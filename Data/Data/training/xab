yeah erm the reason i want to follow it up is because would you not agree er with a number of major companies in this country and in a time of recession rather than cutting back on your marketing and advertising you should in fact be increasing it in fact when the marketing
but when
manager should be a major priority
well that's what UNK am keep telling me when i got to work in the morning it's about the time of recession people should advertise more not less that maybe but the hard financial situation of the theatre finds itself in is to find that sort of money is very difficult at the moment
we're not saying we can't we we're against proposal we've had to take on the market person but until that finance situation is UNK it's extremely difficult
surely the point when you have no money to employ a marketing manager you won't need to employ one
i think there is a need for a marketing person
question directly relating to that point though is it not true that the eastern arts withdrawal of the ten thousand pound grant last year was directly related to criticisms made in both in the nineteen eighty six appraisal and subsequently and repeated both to the star recently what with was that the marketing of the playhouse was UNK inadequate
no
had you not improved your marketing is another sporting chance you've got your ten thousand pounds grant
no
do you know why you lost the eastern arts drama
no
how is it then i put it this way
i'm sorry look i
how is it that you don't know and in your letter to me you said this trust did not know where that money had been withdrawn at the same time andrew director of eastern arts was quite happy to write to me to tell me why he was quite happy to tell the press over the phone why how is it the trust didn't know
well it would be very nice if andrew actually wrote to the trust to tell them why in same details as he apparently told the press
can i ask therefore why the eastern arts of appraisal report of nineteen eighty six a major appraisal costing a huge amount of eastern arts money was not considered and presented across
the eastern arts report of nineteen eighty six was never completed what the eastern arts did in actual fact was to produce a draft report and promised that the final report would be complete and circulate it as to date which is nineteen ninety one we have not received the final report of the eastern arts appraisal
that isn't their story
question
well it may not be their story but that's the fact
can i can i ask the funding of the playhouse
certainly
can i ask over the last six seven years what local companies have funded the playhouse and to what level and how many of actually withdrawn and the reasons why they actually withdrawn
i don't think the UNK ever been UNK with a great deal of UNK but one or two companies in the town that have been prepared to fund obviously the one that strikes me is UNK cos the UNK bar i mean that was funded and like they've been over the years they have given money even fact as a sad note cos UNK have actually UNK now erm general portfolio have actually taken on the role in harlow of funding many things if you actually look all most things that have sponsored until recently have been sponsored by general portfolio so they've been to the fore in er UNK funding
the trust has actually approached several council's in the area not just harlow council obviously but many other councils and i think there was only one other council that provided some funding and that was something like two hundred and fifty pounds was offered at one time i think that's ceased now so there is no other council although it'd be interesting tonight although fifty per cent of the people who actually use this facility actually come from outside the town but there's no funding directly or UNK from any other council so my knowledge would be if you exclude b p exclude general portfolio perhaps i'm doing other companies a UNK i can't think of any other major company in town that's actually provided but gordon can you think of
lloyds bank
lloyds
general portfolio b p UNK over the years have from time to time provided us with funding
is it simply been financial restraint by all those companies that there isn't
yeah their funding tends to be they'll fund something like a production or they'll say at you know if you put our name up were give you so much or general portfolio perhaps will fund a particular show or a series of UNK or say were prepared to put a thousand pounds could you name six shows and we'll put our name on those UNK when they're advertised but no company or other council's actually prepared to come along and say were prepared to put money on a regular basis
have you approached these companies
yes we've approached on a regular basis we've we approach
yeah i mean me i it may be inappropriate at this moment in time to say we will do it now because of obvious reasons but prior to the recession it was an ongoing thing that the board were in through the general manager were actually writing to many companies
i mean UNK er actually have provided funding in the past
hm
eh and perhaps were one of the major UNK in the past i say general portfolio until recently were the major UNK er in the in the ninety one but there's been no company that's been funding the theatre on a regular basis
UNK what facilities would you actually give er on a broad spectrum so these companies that might want to fund the playhouse apart from the normal free tickets
could you could you could you UNK the general portfolio bar
i not the UNK bar
we got the UNK bar but i no the answer to that question would be if any company or UNK organisation was prepared or wished to talk about funding the theatre in any way and i think UNK be more than welcome to sit down with and talk them and say well how would you perceive that which way would you like to go about it how can we assist that and i think we're be open to suggestions from them how they see it i mean you know it could be seats it could be programmes it could be any arrange of things that we'd certainly welcome who approach us from companies but we i think we are pro active in sense that we don't wait for that to happen we actually go out but was said early i think given the recession it has been difficult lately to actually go out to companies and say i mean sure companies like the harlow council find it extremely finance the finances extremely difficult on them and with the recession it's really difficult for them to actually find funding and i know lot's of companies who actually cutting back on it certain areas i think funding of oth outside organisations will be one of the areas they'll be cutting back on
so mr chairman sorry to bring it up again but er i think it's in line what this gentleman said er bearing in mind i think it is a fact that this is a reasonable theatre enjoyed by people from a very large catchment area could you please tell us what support the er playhouse has had from the local authorities adjacent to harlow
in my opinion they're UNK
nothing well we've no
twenty five pounds from UNK district council in nineteen seventy two
i'm sorry i put a nought i thought it was two hundred and fifty but i'm advised it was twenty five
i hope i hope er mr chairman these facts are brought to the attention of the general public bearing in mind the general public over a large catchment area enjoy the facilities here
i principally in harlow who the generous UNK of UNK of the council etc i hope these facts are UNK and perhaps shame these people supporting er you know this theatre
i think it's also entertainment the excellent wage of services placed on by harlow council
yeah
and one of one of the things that i've got on a regular basis is the many of the things harlow council put on like pop concerts country and western have actually been used by people who perhaps live outside of harlow so the council are now looking at a charging policy but also we should also gonna introduce into the theatre is the leisure card which actually includes that the people actually live in the town local and the UNK sort of show if they can do so they should buy
and i think what the council's got to do and i think what the what the what the theatre perhaps has to do is only make that leisure card more easily acceptable and available and also look upon the reductions that we give but that perhaps is a way of actually UNK the people in harlow to use the theatre and the contribution in actually paying for it at the expense of the people coming in from outside who perhaps don't pay anything towards the expense of the theatre
so a leisure UNK been introduced now and will be i hopefully will be expand and give that sort of financial reward to people who live in the town
thank you
i think there's another way of looking at that
yeah
i actually live in UNK
yeah
and i come down here very regularly but my view is we don't get any discount if you like we don't get a leisure card
right
and yet it's the people around harlow were not supporting it what the hell are you going to do then
fifty per cent of them
i mean i know an awful lot of people outside harlow who come here but harlow people could be said to be UNK or not being UNK rightly
i think i mean it was interesting cos someone said earlier about people coming in i mean once you get them in i mean i always feel it's like the pantomime each year which is an amateur pantomime yet the actual people coming in to see that i mean it's well in the ninety per cent 's and you talk to people when they come to see the pantomime and ver invariably the UNK or dad's say no i don't normally come to theatre but i come to the pantomime and they enjoy it very much and when you talk to them they can say well what you think of it
oh it's terrific you know it's a great building i like it i like what's going on and you say will you come back again
and they say yeah i will but presumably that UNK off and they don't but it's an interesting thing that on particular when you're targeting certain things like pantomime do get people in i think there's lot's of people said this evening say actually build on that perhaps get those people to come back again so yes i did like it i did like what i saw there i did like the way that i was treated i did like the whole UNK of the place like i'll definitely come back again will they be viable to do that
i would hope
there's a there's a perfectly example of marketing
marketing
you've got a UNK audience there why the hell don't you do it a sheet why don't you give them a programme for the next three months exactly what is happening
that way they won't drift off they will come back
we had erm no we actually had done that we have given questionnaires out as programmes we actually asked people to i mean it'll be interest to see how many people fill it in this evening but there is a built in resistance by some people to actually fill in any sort of questionnaire er and in the past when we've actually done that i think the UNK hasn't been that brilliant
i'm not saying it's reasonable
so were talking about harlow people just being UNK
well i'm not sure i mean it's interest i mean the council erm with another the council looked upon attendances of the things council do and many people who use the facilities in harlow will argue we don't get anything like this where we live and we always find it like that you know it's that sort of UNK where people in harlow may or may not say well course you get it in harlow we expect it it's just there it just saves we know it's getting them people to use it but i talk to people i'm sure people who live in harlow or the council to people and harlow people tend to think well yes it's all with always it's always there
so i mean it's winning people over because
there
i think it's fair to say that with this new computer erm the box office that we've got a lot of information can be stored on that and in future we'll be using a much more erm sophisticated in a scientific way for instance if you came here and book that seat that your sitting in tonight we would know on that computer what type of show that your UNK coming to erm we can say to you we can send you out a leaflet saying the kind of er things that you'd like to see are on at the playhouse on such and such a date and we could even say to you would you like the seat that you normally sit in
and i think that is
well that's through marketing
and were doing it
were doing it were doing it
were doing it when
now doing it now
yes
can i just say something else as well
i'm sorry erm as far as the schools are concerned you had presumably a lot of contact i mean as part of the national curriculum is if you like is to build contact with the community and the schools
could you not use the drama teachers in those schools to carry out the kind some of this kind of marketing as well
there's projects with the kids you know get the kids to work on what they want what they want to see get them to work on their parents and find out you could find out then whether there is or not in harlow
certainly we er have extensive contacts with almost all the drama teachers in schools in the surrounding area through the UNK in contact with them all the time
and that shows that it that is true of working
and we're getting through that through the through the schools newsletter
but it i mean is it is it
one of the one of the difficulties is that theatres up and down the country have faced over the last two years of the new target that were brought in with the eighty eight education act where schools were not allowed to make a charge it could only be a voluntary contribution now the council of great britain have looked at this it's a problem cos of this UNK schools audiences
for many years we had a well known er
school
t r e company molecule theatre which came originally from the UNK in they came here two or three times a year for seven or eight years and we use to pack 'em out
at the moment there isn't even a charging regulations came in the schools immediately cut back because it was a very definite barrier that was put up to prevent schools that prevented schools from taking up that sort of er offer that they had done in the past and it's a major problem
why therefore have you virtually abandon your students standby scheme
sorry if you sorry if you wish to speak
sorry why therefore have you virtually abandon your students standby scheme
it's now available for only seven shows out of twenty seven in the next programme and only on the first night of each show and only at a cost of two pounds and these are the audience of tomorrow as i wrote to you mr you neglect these people at your UNK you changed the scheme
are you saying you'd like to see that re introduced
what's it UNK you change it
no is that a question are you saying you'd like to see introduced
well yes please UNK you change it
right well we we'll look at that quite clearly
one i mean one of the UNK that we've actually changed these round and don't think it's right is because the has a there's been a cut cost cutting exercise within the building
the theatre like most other organisations have actually looked for savings and this trust has had to look for seventy thousand pounds savings
i mean when you're looking for seventy thousand pounds savings you can only do two things
you can either look at people's jobs because that's the bulk of the money goes or you look at the charging policy or you look how the UNK run
now we've actually found seventy thousand pounds worth of savings we haven't made anybody redundant and we've actually quite clearly taken in that seventy thousand pounds within our overall budget past decisions has had to be taken and they've been taken as i said earlier hopefully when the financial climate gets better we perhaps we'll be able to other things all or were revert back to things that we do wish to do because the financial UNK on us
if you're raising a particular point and the reason that we're here this evening is to look at things that people are raising we'll look at that report we'll look at the point your raising and er we'll see if it validity to it
sorry
my name's derek in any profit making UNK organisation the results shown by the playhouse would have automatically brought about a change of management or does the chairman of the harlow theatre trust still consider that it is running the business very UNK
your asking me as chairman of the board and i think i can speak to the board i think that the theatre has actually managed very well
why the meeting then
sorry
why is the meeting then
why what
running well
cos i think it's important that er the theatre actually talks to the people who actually use the why are you saying we shouldn't be talking to people then
no i think i think it's a valid point to say that the trust should be talking to the people that actually use the building
hm
who've actually come in to see the shows to get there point of view to say what they like and what they dislike
to say whether they feel the things that they like to see and that we're not doing
and has been said by several people who are here
there's things that we are doing like i've been told by a couple of people this evening the autumn programme they think it's very good very progressive very enjoyable i thi that to me that UNK the autumn programme by several people so people who here are people here this evening feel they we say something about what isn't on the agenda or what is on the agenda but i think that's what the meetings for but i don't think it's a bad exercise to talk to the people who actually pay come in the building i mean i think that's a valid exercise
i think it's a wonderful exercise why doesn't it happen more often
well
it 's happen this evening
cos of the marketing policy
perhaps if it's so successful if it can successfully this evening perhaps we will do it more often
you will
sorry yes
i'm really going to erm i afraid i have experience of
who are you sorry
brenda
oh right
and you know me very well tom
yes
no
you don't look the same from this side of the light brenda
that's right that's right
is it a question for us
the thing is i me i've taken all my up here today
yes
i have used this building from the very beginning
i have always turned up when people have asked me to put children in their shows
i came in to this building last year i've got people sitting here who've realised it wasn't a happy place to be i found it quite difficult
i have staff who's morale was very under
sorry brenda i don't i don't wanna cut in could you ask the question please
well i'm asking
sorry i'd like the
the thing is
question
there is not well alright then my question is
say what you want
i
why don't you shut up
you know the thing is i feel that when i was tried to get the theatre board and i have contacted various people on the board i have never been listened to
i feel i'm just regarded as a UNK woman i've been told that by mr i've found that is was very yes i have don't deny it
no you've not
i have tried every way i wrote let a letter hoping somebody would actually come and ask me what was wrong
i wanted to put a morning on when i realised there was problems here just a morning an open morning which would of brought probably nine hundred thousand pounds into this building in july i came in to try to see the director of the playhouse i couldn't go through the written way because i was waiting for exam date to come through
i've tried three times to see mr he wasn't available
i then gave a message to his secretary personal assistant and was told no the letter i receive was that i shouldn't go through something third hand you don't see what the other side is
i've got a big school we fill this place in when i come in here
i'm asking is there a way that the board would actually listen
you know if i if i don't if i've offended mr in any way then that is one thing but i do put on UNK on seats and i bring money into this building
i'm one of the people who've actually got the UNK now to stand up and say that i
sorry i'm not sure yeah i'm not sure what decide but i'll be very clear what they would do
i think thing is
in there mind
people are frightened ron there is a fear thing going on in this place
yes
which might sound terribly dramatic people are frightened that if you UNK you will not use this building again
here
here
here
the staff here maybe i should be i shouldn't be saying this the staff are finding it very difficult i mean what i'm trying to say is for goodness sake eyes should be opened
we UNK because of the your new brochure
and you are sorry
i'm jean from the harlow UNK orchestra
in your new brochure here that you've put on the table erm it says a meeting it doesn't actually say a meeting actually it says we need your ideas come along and tell us that's why we UNK
keith once again
i'm sorry not keith once again we've got other speakers that haven't spoke once sorry
jim er as a private individual
er mr chairman your care to require question so here's a question
is this a public consultation meeting
the meeting this evening is to get the UNK views and how best to plan it's progress
why does a view have to be expressed as a question
sorry
why does a view have to be expressed as a question
hm
chair ian
following on from that er that the point that i think is being made is that a contribution does not have to be put forward in a shape of a question to be er a useful contribution to the debate and your erm pressure upon er the lady who spoke er a while ago was er UNK that she
that's right
addressed you in the in the form of a question that is not necessarily the only way to conduct a debate and i think that's the point that's being made
well i think it's sorry i don't think it will serve any purpose people actually get up and make character UNK of other people and when were talk in terms of i said you said and he said i don't think that's a productive way to conduct the UNK business
quite clearly the reason that people have been asked to come along this evening and have come along this evening is to put there points of view about how the see the theatre in the future what is programme facilities are the things that aren't happening here they feel should be happening here that's what it's for not here to serve any purpose for individuals to get up and make personal cuts on people or say what happen on a saturday morning or a thursday afternoon cos i
anybody wishing if anybody wishes to ring me anyone i'm not i'm not you see i don't see that serves any purpose i'm sorry i do not think that serves any purpose if you wish to ring me outside this meeting
i have rung you i have rung you
the reason i'm standing up here cos your not get things done in this town i'm sorry it is the only way of saying something
i'm available to listen and hear what they've got to say
they are not
and discuss it with them
they are not
that's quite clear i'm prepared to do that
i don't think people UNK and shouting this evening will solve anything quite clearly
it is the only opportunity
chair
can i just say just say one thing paul and for myself erm i don't think that brenda just two things i'm a very against character UNK erm i don't think that brenda was character UNK
no
no
what she was doing is she was talking as a person who's got a genuine love of the theatre as we all have that's what were doing here looking for solutions now can i'm as i said i'm not UNK your character now but you're being very UNK in the way that your talking to people
why is that
because i don't
sorry that's a question
what i'm trying to do is chair a meeting and to prevent what happening what's just happened when people start jumping up and shouting i don't think that's productive ways to chair any meeting or allow that to happen
no your not
the second thing productive i don't think it's productive for people to interrupt start shouting at me and UNK at me or shout at the platform cos i think all that's gonna happen there is the meetings gonna UNK and nothing will be as right
i've
the reason this playhouse the reason
i mean that sort of thing doesn't help it right
i agree with that i agree with him
the same person the same person all i'm saying the reason that the meeting was UNK this evening and the reason that paul wants the meeting this evening was to get the views from the public about what they felt was going on at the playhouse and what they would like to see that isn't taken place i think that was the thing behind the meeting and that's what we'd like to see right okay
if you generally want the views of the public it is no good trying to false those views through a straight jacket of your own to make it what you think there views should be unless of course they go right over the top in which they i don't think that's happened so far
chair can i try er to wrap this up so that we can get back onto debate by delivering a question to you as chair
yes
the UNK that i think is trying to be made is that there are a lot of people here tonight who do wish to express an opinion and that opinion is not necessarily UNK in question form
will you allow people to address the panel as a comment and not just a question yes or no if you say no fine we all understand and we have to er UNK our ideas as a question and we'll carry on that case is quite simple and straight forward like that
you are an experienced chair you're good at your job and if people get out of hand you know how to shut them up
i'm prepared for people who actually prepare to make comments yes i think you've got to limit the time and make comments not particularly what people get up and speak for ten minutes i don't think it's fair on the people this evening who've come along and put a question about why aren't you doing certain things i think that's and i don't want those people to actually come to a solution
i'm not prepared i'm not prepared for individuals to get up but if your not if you don't want to listen to what i've got to say that's okay but i don't i'm not prepared for people to perhaps to start making personal points about people actual work within the i certainly wouldn't do it i don't think it's a question of
right you've made a point now
i think it's
i think you've spoken more than a few minutes
i'll continue to speak if you keep UNK
i quite clear to do that okay thank you
yes
where
i think there's a lady over there with her hand up
when i say i can't see people i think it's the lighting but there is a sort of a i can't recognise people by face
someone at the back yes
mr chairman derek i've lived in the town for something like thirty five years and seems to me that the problem here is a lot of UNK between people who use the theatre and the board somewhere people are not getting answers
would it not help if the board gave a written assurance to the people who've been complaining here that they will meet them on any occasion to discuss the problem in writing please because from brenda it appears that it just does not happen
that's right
if we could have it in writing and we could UNK it i'm sure they would where to go and how to do it
if anybody has any absolutely yes i'll be quite happy i mean to me chairman of the trust or with management committee to meet anybody if they feel that they've got some concern they wish to discuss i'm quite happy to do that all i can say is that nobody has actually UNK wrote to me or rang me to say they'd like to meet to discuss that and i'm quite happy to do that
you've had letters
but i think it may be more appropriate if i actually met with say the management committee as opposed to myself yes i'm quite happy to do that to meet any individual or group who feel they have some concerns they wish to discuss and i give that i give that assurance this evening
seems to be somewhere along the road or otherwise your gonna get nowhere nobody
yeah i'm quite happy to do that
sorry someone here yes
i'm mrs and er the point i wanna make is that i understood when jimmy jones came here had two lovely full houses but i heard through the building through the UNK that the members of the trust or council objected to him because he was racist his jokes and sexist
now if you're talking about filling the seats it's obvious that the people in harlow like that type of thing so why don't we have more of it
the answer to that question would be that the council's actually the councillors adopt an equal opportunity policy and that policy now has been adopted by the theatre trust and the theatre trust wouldn't put anything on if they feel sexist or racist or UNK
that makes you like UNK then
no well that's a UNK that's a UNK point but i think that would that is the policy of the board
talking about UNK on seats here
well we could i mean there are many ways there are many ways that we could actually fill this building apart from putting jimmy jones on there's lot's of things perhaps we could really put on which we would
and then if we would find totally unacceptable we certainly wouldn't be prepared to do that
i didn't i didn't see him myself personally i don't like him but it's a matter of choice
does anybody who hasn't asked a question or wishes to make a comment who would like to
yes i in relation to the above
sorry
aha for the studio theatre to be dark t during the autumn and i do regard the studio theatre as the UNK heart of a theatre and i have enjoyed many of the performances very much and i just hope very much we can just get some more money from somewhere carry on i
in the studio
one of the reasons why to save money is because the studio theatre has a limited capacity
and the sort of er money that won't have to pay a UNK alternative theatre it was such that one couldn't hope to break even on that capacity with the sort of seat prices that were that we're charging
so sadly that was one of those things that we had to cut
i know there are people here
i know there are people here in the audience that use used to come to classical music concerts UNK expensive even with the eastern UNK board's subsidy
for example if you had the london UNK players here as we frequently did and frequently played to full houses then even with a hundred percent house there was a subsidy required of something like seven or eight pounds per seat in order to meet the cost of presenting that particular concert and we've done it for years but sadly when we had to make cuts that was one of things the board decided they had to cut up they had to save money somehow
may i make a relevant point please
you'll ask a question
yeah surely
in the current programme the studio is in use for seventeen days out of a possible a hundred and forty seven
in the next ten months starting in september ninety one it's in use for sixty four days out of a possible three hundred
that is economic UNK not saving money it's UNK it should be in operation making money bringing people in
question mr chair
yeah
my names christopher with reference to that representing myself
reference to that point is that management or UNK
could you answer the question please
yeah the board in it's wisdom looking at the financial situation decided to take on a policy which actually UNK the use of the studio theatre by professional companies and i think that's reduced the actual use of that facility
can i ask erm what's happening to the harlow playhouse based youth theatre cos obviously that has left a big gap in performances cos there's nothing in this programme
yes one of the er sad things about harlow youth theatre which many of you will remember er was sole run so successfully by roger over a number of years
sadly when roger left in nineteen eighty six it took the education of who provided roger's er salary until point UNK
during that time of course nobody there to run it the youth theatre sadly er ran down
subsequent of that of course to meet the need we had stage directions come into being very UNK young people UNK company and really what's happen is that stage directions in part anyway has taken over the UNK of the old harlow youth theatre
harlow youth theatre now with our developing links with harlow college and it's performing arts division er is now based in the college with UNK from staff of the college who's job is one way er that we could we could push it forward
i'd just like
yes
like to ask in relation to er previous comments made before
why then are there not more amateur UNK in the new season erm in the studio erm not just from the companies that actually use the studio at the moment
because i'm sure they don't cost as much to put on up there as do professional UNK
well certainly there are in the coming season there's a many people sitting here tonight will know
large number of er amateur production in fact there's an amateur show in the studio theatre one er once every three weeks
yeah but what about
and cos the studio is also used regularly for UNK for example or as you know if er local amateur company is putting on a show in the studio they're given the use of the studio a week before the week of the show
yeah but
cos that is an advantage of it
okay but you've
your point sorry yes
got local advantage to them but that never used to happen okay so why is it happening now
they i mean in a time when it's sort of been difficult to make money erm why is that one got not gone by the board and more amateur production put in there
i'm sure the people who's actually used the studio theatre would UNK give up that week before it never used to happen
what you're saying is you'd like to see more amateur UNK
yeah
fine
erm
sorry the lady
yes
mr chairman erm i would like personally take up a suggestion that was in the star about the possibility of a regional company being based at the playhouse in other words for a few months i would see it as people getting to know this company and rather like a UNK theatre of old then people would want to come and see these people in different roles and i think that would add to the you know UNK
right
coming to see these shows
right
i'd like the board to consider that
okay that sounds
erm talking about the sorry david the playhouse being an entertainment centre perhaps you should UNK the space a little bit more i'm sure if we go down stairs now into the foyer bar it's probably empty as it is erm many nights of the week
i'm sure if you go to the stage door club tonight erm
it's closed
right i mean these are area's in this UNK centre as it was called earlier on the entertainment being theatre and the gallery erm that may be UNK more i e UNK bands in the downstairs bar erm any other ideas i mean get people into the building then you'll sell tickets to keep the place running
i mean i certainly accept that i mean i think there a lot of problems on the in the stage door club several nights of the years
and why the problems there is that any sort of loud music was actually buried under the UNK i mean that was the problem that occurred and we had to sort of tone it down a bit
and i think in the past there actually been music in foyer bar erm yeah i mean i'd certainly look at that i mean
were open i mean there's been lots of things done like that i mean you maybe aware of this sort of UNK in the UNK bar on saturday lunch time and that's been running some time then it'll cease to come back again you know if you'll actually counting on the people actually coming cos of the UNK there i think as your looking at it was slightly up it wasn't a wasn't great UNK because there was UNK available so yeah we'll certainly look introducing things into different areas of the theatre but from past experience it doesn't automatically follow that if you can do that then you know it's gonna happen
just a reply to that though if for instance the foyer bar became a UNK club and it was it was a the UNK club all the time then it would get a name of it's own and it would get a reasonable quality
i was in bristol recently and i went to a bar there which is packed every night people pay to go into a club to go in there
sorry
mr chairman what's the erm chance of the UNK restaurant coming back under the playhouse umbrella
no
that i believe now it's run by the ladies that took over some while ago
sure
the chances that i think are nil
in fact the pet UNK restaurant is run as a and because the theatre trust for whatever reason could make profit out of the UNK restaurant and people that actually work there for the trust that actually took it over and the trust actually UNK a percent of the UNK percent of profit and er
so really it's
and er as and as and as that
making
were actually are making a profit we said at the beginning we do get a payment from UNK so i don't see that arrangement actually changing but it suits the trust were not very good at running UNK
as much as the council are it's very difficult
your be leaving yourself open
it's a special it's a special licence actually running UNK
yeah but it's
UNK
it's sad not to have a restaurant that size in the playhouse so that people come to the theatre
well
i think the stage door club is fine but it's so tiny and rather you know
that was so was originally was available for the ticket you could actually have some supper before you went in or perhaps supper when you came out and that was the sort of thing that was available
unfortunately over the years there was such a deficit for whatever reason lot's of things were tried it was then decided that it was two options one was closing lose so much money or actually put it out to franchise fortunately enough that people were at all the money and we didn't get an income from it
i accept the point your raising on this if it was open in the evenings that would be an added UNK to the building unfortunately it isn't yes i think your absolutely right
but can't couldn't you perhaps develop then the er stage door club could do more perhaps more meals and maybe erm have tickets that take in the cost of a meal so you actually
sorry
i've done that i mean one of the sad things about the stage door club is due to the design of the building you've really got to be looking to go there
yeah
it's not sort of passing trade
oh
i mean it's got if you've got a disability for instance you wouldn't be able to get in there
so that's a problem
oh
so if your if you're an elder it'll be very difficult to get up those very steep steps etcetera so it's got disadvantages now it's been run all sorts of ways it's was run you know it was run as a as a wine bar it was run as a restaurant it's been run as a bar it's been run as a stage door club but all this all these ways have been run by private individuals it's not always been the trust that's run it it's been run as franchise all these people have great problems actually making profit out of it and making it suitable
and it's also got limited facilities about what you can and what you can't do there so there are problems there
i mean it's empty at the moment if anybody's got any suggestions or thoughts about what we can do with it it's certainly er we i would like to hear those
if perhaps not this evening then if ring me or contact me
i'd certainly raise that at any thoughts about how it could be used it is facility at the moment isn't used should be used
here's a simply suggestion why don't you move the facilities from the stage door club down to the foyer bar so that a load of people can go in there you'd change the general UNK of the foyer bar
yeah
simple
yeah
UNK
i think there's nothing chairman that a hundred and fifty thousand pounds wouldn't do
well why not why not go outside for funding
so marketing exercise once again
UNK just to get back about the point the studio being dark erm it's just as a suggestion has anybody thought of actually running say a week's worth of drama courses with er an artist in residence or something like that coming in to do work shops
i know that stage directions will come along and youth UNK come down i'm sure a lot of people with theatre company come and do them
surely that'll bring people back into the theatre it would obviously pay the artist it would also bring money into the theatre if the theatre could actually charged for them to do them
well going back to the boards point about take over theatre as we did on making a loss
sorry the restaurant you mean
the restaurant yes UNK restaurant
erm one did take up on public individuals if they made a profit have the board not considered perhaps UNK public individuals to run the theatre
sorry
we are yes
yeah we are has that does that answer the question we actually are considering it
you are
we are that
going back again to dave 's point about the foyer bar
yes
i think i probably speak for er quite a few people in the audience at the moment but i myself who UNK going in there cos of the UNK that seems to be attracted to it
i don't know if i know i understand obviously monies not around at the moment but if they made some way of creating some kind of UNK pub closing it down making it part of the theatre again it's just a like a pub and i don't ever feel comfortable going in there and buying drinks on UNK
mr chairman too
hang on hang on
hang on
it's just that we didn't know that i didn't hear what she said
before you give the answer
sorry
i'd like to know what the question was
she felt sorry
i just make
she felt UNK by going into the foyer bar
yeah it doesn't actually seem
can i just say two things on that first of all i think you're right
secondly i think the sad thing is that at one time the idea of the foyer bar was the fact that er mother's and children go in for a coffee facility or tea facility now i'm one of one of the problems about criticism is perhaps they don't know all the facts and one of the facts which i think UNK me was the actual local police stopped that and said that wasn't UNK for if you were selling alcohol then it didn't it wasn't right that children under age and young children were allowed in the same area and that was that was changed then we got a new a new police superintendent and he said it was UNK and then we got another super he went they don't stay very long in harlow and we got somebody else came along and he said no that isn't UNK so we got very UNK about what you could do with the foyer bar one minute you could have and the idea of about telling people and there young mothers going shopping come here for coffee cakes for the children etc stop that we've now got a new superintendent in harlow and i think with applied going back to him and saying well please advice us can we or can't we
the last superintendent said we can't and i think the point you've raised is very valid since they actually stopped that facility said that they're not allowed in there it has i think gone into a situation where it isn't a very quite place erm and there problems about what goes on there etc and i think need to look at it
but i personally feel that it needs complete refurbishment and that costs money i think that the points been raised earlier about having some sort of UNK pub here or some pub here is very bad and i think we could investigate that
can you think if we have something meal facilities which has also been raised if then maybe the stage door club area could be used for something like light UNK space which is always in demand
yeah
or another kind of committee room
right
actually UNK our space not necessarily for the public which obviously is difficult to get to the disabled people etc but using it for something like that
when we say when we say that we stage door club is closed it closed in the place it's not open every evening but we do actually let it out we let it out to companies and whatever conference or companies who want a facility or meeting place something we do actually market that and we do actually ask people if they want to use it and in fact it has been taken up there
but i've i think it is a valid facility but it depends what the facilities for
yeah
i think the problem about having it as a perhaps a wine bar or something is that is that it's very difficult to get to and i think it don't does create problems for people but i think there is a solution there we just need to actually target the right use for it
here
alan speaking for myself
it's apparent from the meeting here that a number of people feel they have a UNK about the theatre and the way it's run would it not be an idea for the board on a regular basis to invite users of the theatre to attend
to approach them tell them how they feel about things rather than having to ring you up and make an appointment if only once a year or once every six months use a group
right you have to come i think the basis of this evening was to get people to come along and put there points of view and to say what's happening and what isn't happening and i think we can take that take that away and UNK it yes i mean i think the board or the management committee will be happy to meet with people to discuss the use of the theatre er what it's used for what might what the UNK is if there is UNK and the positive and the positive as well as the negative points yes
it would prevent there being a build up
certainly we'll do that
yeah
chap
erm when i first started working in harlow eighteen years ago one evening i came up just to see what the playhouse was all about
i was shown round the building although there was a performance on by a very pleasant elderly UNK who's not here any more i've been coming ever since
er is not a possibility of having more open days so that general public can come in to see what's happening and not only advertise in harlow but advertise i live in bishop's stortford now in the surrounding districts erm time gets although you said you get fifty per cent of people coming from outside of harlow it doesn't matter where the people come from as long as they come so more open days free erm to get people to come in and er particularly er outside people also i would suggest that the er chairman's of the local district council's who are not contributing be invited to the open day to see what er the playhouse is doing for the people who live in there er council area's to see whether we can get some more supports er as a stortford resident i'd be quite happy to add a bit on my community charge to go to the playhouse
perhaps er school children could be brought in when the theatre UNK during the day who actually see how the theatre runs see what UNK all about and they might be interested in the theatre
we have er demand for tours of the theatre schools in the area which were not able to meet
it seems an ideal
and it is you know it seems to take up quite a bit of time for members of staff and we do as many as we can but sometimes we have to say sorry we can't do any more this week
peter from
chair can i make a suggestion quite clearly a large number of people have made some very good and valid recommendations or suggestions to you and the board this evening and you've said on many occasions this evening the board will obviously go away discuss those and take a view on the particular ideas
now might it not be also a very good idea then to report back to another public meeting with the results of those suggestions possibly done in a written form which could be freely available before the meeting so that people can discuss these in a structured way because i think this evening one of the problems about this evening is that points are being missed because issues are being jumped from one to another in no structured way and i think that it might be worth while for another meeting where it is structured but certainly to produce the results of your discussions internally to many of the ideas that you've heard this evening
here
could i just make one suggestion that it's made within the next six months as well
here
with time UNK yes
you've got six months for god's sake
mr chairman could i ask a question because one of the things that i've found missing this evening is specific things that people would like to see in this playhouse or perhaps specific things that we used to do and that find are missing and the last i haven't heard the word gallery mentioned from there much at all what do we think about the gallery
can i think
well i'd like to speak about the gallery i like to speak for myself and er just the visual arts and er the gallery when it first started was a gallery very much appreciated by appreciated by the eastern region er they saw it as potential a very significant gallery in the whole region which would have been a marvellous thing for harlow to have
that has now changed eastern arts no longer support the gallery now one obvious reason for that is the gallery started so well because of the enthusiasm from a number of professional people who came along and gave their advice and much of their time and such a body of people has not been called upon for a number of years now and once again a request to discuss this with mr was refused
we have the gallery still running reasonably well but it is one man ten hours a week his experience is badly limited this marvellous free resource is no longer being called for
you asked what people would like to see in the playhouse
is that being recorded
yes
yes
yes
yes
that's a very valid point
what i would like to see in the playhouse is an open system of government very much like our council UNK to follow
i would like to see UNK for these meetings public available i'd like to see some commercial experience by a vote of general manager and their UNK
i'd like to see not cutting costs raise in income and finally i'd can only see these things coming about with the UNK of the five people on the stage tonight
janet erm mr UNK some practical suggestions i have one for goodness sake any show that's suitable for children charge those children half price that way you'll get
in ten years time if you just give them a UNK thirty pence off people leave their children at home make it easier for them to bring them with them
yes
steve represent the association of natural body builders
sir could you tell me why the playhouse operates a policy whereby UNK cannot hire the venue UNK
other theatres operate this system quite successfully with little or no financial risk at all
sorry can you just explain that when you say
i wrote to mr in february of last year
yeah
asking to erm promote a natural body building competition here erm the letter received back was we didn't feel it was suitable
on trying to contact mr by phone i have on many occasions i was put off to say he wasn't available i have also come to the foyer at the bottom asked to see mr after twenty minutes wait and nobody turned up i decided to retire
i again last month wrote to mr to try a promote a drug free competition for a sunday giving various dates of nineteen ninety two and have yet to hear
i would like to know why this policy is that er that you didn't consider this a venue of body building to be suitable if it's not erm it's gonna put UNK on seats and generate income to towards the trust why not
sorry
someone
can you answer the question please
i was certainly with that question has been recorded and i can't answer immediately but obviously you what you've said we'll take that up with the management committee and come back to you straight away
okay
can i also point out that erm the association of natural body builders UNK that a contest must be held in a seated theatre such as this
right
supplying UNK and bar facilities and there's no one else in harlow to seat four hundred plus people and that's like UNK and if the harlow playhouse turn around and say no we're not interested where else are we to go
in this instance the harlow sports centre been very kind in doing everything they can to host this venue and hopefully in the near future the harlow playhouse will open their arms also thank you
yes
sarah
i have been using the playhouse for about ten years now and going back to the point that someone made earlier about sex well about erm racism UNK is doesn't that count as UNK
the same as the way that this gentleman has found it's somebody else making a decision to what people can see and i don't consider some a show like UNK and UNK which had female UNK and two hundred and fifty people walk out in one night to mean something which i think is UNK to the playhouse
i'd like to take up a couple of points if i may about getting some erm we were talking before mentioned children coming in on a regular basis er it's called living
what about getting those children as they go out a voucher that their parents can bring them along to see a show at a reduced rate
we've got there interest they come they've seen they've seen how the theatre works let them come to see the theatre working
then there's a lady over here who comes or used to come on a regular basis a couple of times a month she comes now a couple of times a year
encourage her to come back more often you'll not only sell the seats you'll sell the drinks you'll sell the ice cream you make good profit from those and every theatre and every UNK help is done
drinks and ice UNK are profits right
then we talk about the lady from UNK who said she UNK no incentive i get my incentive use by using my leisure card that lady gets no incentive to come back
what about some sort of UNK that she gets that can use the use of her period of time another idea to around
right is there any body that hasn't asked a question who would like to ask one
yeah
sorry
you asked about the gallery
yes
eh personally i think it's
your sorry your name
peter from harlow society of art
i personally think the UNK under used you have a large number of exhibitions that seem to extend over six to eight weeks
personally i think it should be restricted to about four weeks and get more exhibitions in there for wider variety and also there's a number of er travelling exhibitions around the country that come down north er from up north down to the south to show around here that you can book these any time you want er i talked to somebody organised an exhibition in london and they are quite willing to come to harlow you book us and we have nothing like this at all
and all that's repetition going around
all we seemed to get is abstract art which people in harlow means so few appreciate which i quite understand
UNK ron
there's been some concern about the complete show of publicity particularly for studio theatre UNK the amateur ones
sometimes there's a good write up beforehand sometimes there's nothing
is any body UNK in charge of publicity or is it a committee meeting eh committee do more can you tell me er who's in charge
we produce a press release every week in advance send it out in forty three publications
it's funny er even though there's about five free UNK er sometimes there isn't a write up at all i'm not talking about your panel
no
a lit little write up through pub this would surely bring more people in if they knew what was
we are constantly talking to the press try and persuade them to give us more coverage
some newspapers do the star
i dislike the concern about the communication level between the general manager and the board
erm i'd we have a number of suggestions er a gentleman over there about the er body building was that reported back to you for a start and did you discuss this erm you know i really thought it sort of modern management techniques if there applied here like team working net working it's it this way you could actually begin to perform as the committee at the moment your the UNK figures in the background
the only person that i know about at the playhouse is gordon
erm so i'm aware i'm i just like to know if gordon is actually aware of the terms like team working net working erm
has he been on any recent training courses to discuss this
you missed a couple off that UNK i think is the buzz word it's called seem less production so
if you want
i'm not into buzz words
i would suggest you to ask that question in fact you'll ask gordon afterwards
okay
is there anybody hasn't asked a question who would like to ask one
my name is buzz stage art technical art
i've come in this theatre in nineteen seventy five
i came here as a company stage manager from oxford playhouse company
listening to all this tonight reading that article in the star which i personally UNK
here
i want to say the thing that's happening at the moment in my difficult life that i'd hold onto like a UNK man with a log
one thing that works at this time forget today and yesterday and all the week it's the number of children that come into this playhouse now we have us we have a thing called work experience where they come from the school's and the poor little UNK have gotta work with me
if they go away and say i'll be back buzz i'll be back
and they come back and see me what they taken from here and seen in other papers is a privilege for me if i've set them off in my biased welsh way
but they do come back loads of them and we send them off everywhere into dance into acting into trade shows we've got a terrific act on here all you people who UNK and UNK towards making this playhouse work we're a bloody miracle
but don't lets knock it to death don't lets kick it this place saved my life i almost killed myself trying to fulfil those that we've been talking about
i've done over fifty of them i'm still standing up just about
fifty that's a hell of a lot of UNK and a lot of mrs and a lot of mr and a lot of janet i love you know
a bit of all of you lot so come on people you're not doing yourself justice
can i sort out
chairman i haven't got a question my name is harold er i come from bishop's stortford er i work in harlow and i don't think that you should necessarily forget that some of the people are not residents in harlow do in fact work in harlow
your absolutely right
yes
erm i i've done a lot of listening this evening er and i'm sure you have too from the way in which the rest of the board have been responding er with there eyes and ears even if they haven't always been open
erm i'd like to be a little bit positive about certain things this evening too because i too believe that you've got a very good programme
i think you maintain an excellent record in that but it does still come back to getting people into the theatre
and one of the things that i'm not sure we have addressed adequately now and perhaps won't this evening is how to get people into the theatre and i really thing that it would be worthwhile trying to find out stops people coming in
erm marketing is certainly one and possibly does needs some more er attention but there were one or two things that struck me as er you went by and you asked to comment and maybe give a small one that there will pick up on
erm we actually find it quite hard to book our seats
if you pick up the phone and ring to get seats here you will very often find that you can't get through
there must be a way round that
because i can't believe if you come in the off peak periods there really aren't that many people here erm i can't believe that the phone is so busy that we're actually being stopped in making from reservations
i've listened to a lot of interest to the people who've been commenting about the future and the schools and the young children coming in
erm just as something totally off the top of my head erm i very much UNK the UNK of the proper programme erm and in fact i actually object to the paying twenty pence for something that er really doesn't represent value for money
but just as a thought for you since the school's are involved and since children are involved in a number of these things perhaps it has been tried i don't know erm you might actually be able to get a more regular input not only from the children and their but also from their par UNK by perhaps involving or asking the schools to become involved in the production of the programme
erm that would maintain a regular interest from the schools and also from the children involved
right your absolutely right about the programme
yeah and i'll certainly and i we think are actually in process in looking at that lot as a rule that's a very valid point
people are getting UNK people are leaving can i just
can we just
can i sorry could i could i take obviously take some question people wish to ask a question because i think it's important that before people start drifting away we actually bring the meeting to some conclusion and determine where we're gonna go with the meeting once it's actually passed
so can i take people who actually haven't spoken already i think that's the UNK way
there's a lady here
UNK er chair er sheila from harlow secretary of the film society which has operated here since the playhouse opened moved from the town hall er we do get people past the door we have been doing in years erm and i personally i'm also here as an individual i've been an arts UNK for forty five years of my life in harlow
erm and i'd just got one comment that i like to make and er then the question
the comment is about publicity in harlow itself and just around it erm the environment
when i came to harlow i was stuck by what a lovely neat town it was then erm but there were er absolutely no posters anywhere in harlow
it's a tiny little things you know er in glass cases now there are a few at bus stops but a lot of people don't use bus stops any more you know they drive erm i know that posters great UNK that we some of us probably grew up with when everybody knew what was on and the great big posters everywhere
posters also teach young people how to develop a sense of erm they also make life much more fun more interesting and erm this is great contrast with harlow and an urban area like greater london area where as the report by erm in er the report the report on observation in london you know didn't mention the fact that publicity is of course is much more much greater than the london area erm and erm er one thing i see is missing could er the reason is we found er the film society we can't advertise our events very well because of the restrictive UNK on advertising poster advertising in harlow i wonder if something could be done about this
cos that's one reason a lot of harlow people don't know what's on don't erm you know they don't really have contact with erm they don't always use harvey
so
er erm i'm sorry it is the question now that i'm going to come to was going back to organisation how often does the board meet and who does it regard as
sorry
john company secretary
erm in the first place there are no UNK restricting the display of posters in harlow erm there are however town planning er UNK on and indeed there are a recognised number of sites which can be used for that purpose
erm on the question of the board all is UNK to the general meeting of the er company it's held in the autumn of each year
right is there anybody that hasn't asked a question
it's not so much a question it's a comment
yes erm listening to the UNK i mean i know loads of people come up here and there's one thing which all of them tend to say and that this place is threatening
they come in and they're worried about the place they feel it UNK
what the UNK or the whole
ev the whole building
the whole building
it's UNK it's erm well as soon as they come in the door they wanna walk out and that that's an overall opinion that's not just me or a couple of mates that's everybody
and what i'd like to know is the board
that's your opinion not mine not everybody
i didn't say it was mine i said it was the people i've spoken to
eh er don't sorry
right so can i have my opinion or can i speak with these other people's opinion
yes please do
or shall we listen to you
please do
right i am saying it's people that i've spoken to
right okay
is that clear it's people UNK spoken to
yeah
thank you
right has the board consider giving this place i mean i understand the trouble with money etc but looking at making this place more inviting at all
yeah i mean have they just sort of said okay right as it is that'll do or are they seriously looking at making this place an inviting place to come to
yeah i mean two things
first of all the as you i think you touched on the board's got to work on a budget
that's right yeah
money is tight so we need to be quite clear on i mean for instance i mean the seats have been recovered you know people smoking in the seats when they shouldn't be smoking and putting they're putting their UNK out on the floor i don't know
oh yeah but were not talking about
no i'm not so i mean things like that there's wear and tear i mean the seats have to be recovered the UNK have to be replaced the place has to be UNK yes we do that
i mean the foyer when you come in to the building when the place was UNK that was that we got the UNK to look at the into the foyer and what you see as you come into the building is the recommendations of those consultants were talking about having a red foyer making it inviting and friendly that was their recommendation which was adopted
the whole UNK of the building which has been done was that the consultants come in look at colour schemes and say this is what to do
so yes the answer to the question is yes there is a budget there is a budget and we need to do things now one of the problems could be the budget isn't sufficient to cover all that needs doing so i think you'll find that the building been built at a certain time there a comes a time you've got plan a maintenance programme which we have things need to be done
i think we need i accept i think we need to look at certain areas we need to look at the entrance i mean if we were doing the entrance again we would have electric doors on what like they've got on the harvey centre so you don't have to fight your way in i'm thinking of doors like this we'll do that
the colour the what the lay out of the foyer we would look at again to make it more inviting more friendly we'll do that
and i think when we talk in terms in getting around to spending the money we have got then we need to look quite clearly about how you make a place more inviting and it's also about when people come into the building how they're met what the UNK like when they ring up can they get through and i mean i'm surprised that's said about the tickets that i think that our reception ticket areas an excellent area the people working there are first class are very friendly very helpful so it's trying to get that sort of concept through the building i thin k we work on that i think the UNK kept very clean people who clean the building are very good but i hear what you're saying and i thinks it's been said earlier by the lady here by the foyer downstairs she feels threatened when she goes into that bar because i think the whole UNK and the way it is a threatening place i think we need to look at those so that was an old and
but this is UNK out onto the steps of the place
you've got you've got rubbish everywhere for a start
well that is
is that is that the council or is that the playhouse
that's people
well first of all that's people
if you actually you actually look at the front of the building there's a great deal of money been spent there's been new flower er boxes put out there
yes
it's all been UNK and apart the fact that people pull them out is
so why is there not somebody responsible security say why don't they go out there and stop it
i mean i've chased more people off
here
i've chased more people off than the security has
now have they got a directive to look after the front now or not
i really i really do wish it was that simple and i wish that when i pick up the star on a thursday or one of the other local papers that i didn't read in it the twenty cars that's broken into and all the other problems and i say to myself now why did that happen
all i do know is that we're very conscious a great deal of money's been spent by the council and by the trust to try and make the place outside more inviting those tubs been put there er they been planted etc there's a lot of litter there we've put litter bins there there's taxi rank there there's lot's of things been put there i think the problem is it isn't the people who do that i mean it's the people who actually do the litter and it's quite clear that we do go out we do tidy up but it happens and it's a case of balance of what we can do and what you can't do but we do work at it i can assure you
surely tom one of the main criteria should be placing seats in the studio theatre for something with a bit more comfortable that way perhaps the UNK will come back more often it's easier to make a UNK come back than it is getting in there in the first place
are you anybody UNK i've got erm UNK here is there anybody hasn't asked i wanna sort of UNK to some conclusion because people are getting UNK
tom mine is a comment and a request
erm as many people here know and like them i have worked in a voluntary capacity and one way or another in this theatre for many years and we can't do without it we don't want to see it close or any of those drastic things
were all very concerned to keep it open and keep it UNK
here
and with this in mind and i'm you will notice that i haven't spoken at all and that is quite deliberate on my part but then i can also say the same for many people sitting round here who know quite well that they haven't spoken either
is it possible for some of us and perhaps UNK of organisations or a group of us and i know i can talk to the board but i'm not necessarily speaking for anybody else if i UNK to you other than myself
and i think it's very important that people can come and talk to you and some UNK of the board because there is UNK tom and i'm not prepared to stick my neck out and say in what quarter this lies but it can be got over it can be UNK out because running a theatre is to do with team spirit and that team spirit UNK to the public
a happy theatre a happy ship if you like a UNK phrase to use is very apparent and i'm sure my colleagues and friends around here would appreciate because they do believe they can't get at the management committee and they would like to so please tom will that be possible at some time in the near future
i assume so yes but erm also well yeah well yeah fine
thank you
that will be UNK
er i think they have changed contractors
again
again
but anyway whether that's true or not the this was a s seems to be as a result of
criticism about them not turning up and this sort of thing
erm
hi
sorry i'm late
so i had a long chat with the with the cleansing officer and the main point
i know i know
liz do you want a chair
the main point that i made to him was that after such a superb beginning where they actually state how much rubbish we produce there's absolutely no mention even though there's space at the bottom there's no mention of recycling at all
and he said well it's a different you know different department
mm
i know yes
and this was this that wouldn't have entered into that brief but my argument was that you know everybody would be much happier if there was less rubbish to put in the UNK sites in the first place
now that was about two weeks ago and i've been sitting on it meaning to write to the press and say how disgusting it was
which i have just done today
UNK no
yes half way through i spoke to the UNK environment officer
mm
who was much more switched on
he's a new environment officer he's only been there for a month or something
and he says that erm
he sort of agreed with me that it was a waste of an opportunity
erm but he did say that he's actually writing a leaflet which they can run to seven or eight pages
a detailed one about recycling
anybody will read so eight pages
well i don't know
i just don't know
but i mean he was very interested and when i said that we'd actually done a recycling directory and that i was thinking
UNK it
erm
he was very interested and he would like to meet us and i said that if he's actually doing a directory
all this all this about
i thought rob is doing a sort of recycling what do you call it UNK
rob has just done a green audit for the district council
yes
yes
but we haven't had the opportunity to read it
i mean he knows that we have a recycling d
i was in touch with them
i sent them the recycling
why do they pretend not to know
i mean they should be fully a aware of our
UNK well this is a new guy
is that mr
mr
the recycling officer
is that is the one i wrote to
hold on
there
yeah
is that the one you spoke to
tom
yeah
that's him
only he said that they were gonna get an initiative through the schools on er
is
he's the one
anyway that's my letter
draft letter which i have not got it's very rough for the press
sorry i've only got four
that's alright
actually some friends of mine were quite confused about what why they shouldn't be able to throw their cooking oil away in their bin
because they said they'd always done it and they had nowhere else to put it
somebody else said oh you should throw it down the sink but i didn't think you were supposed to do that either
what
cooking oil
cooking oil
yeah
if you have got one of those deep fat UNK you have quite a bit to throw away
well don't put it in water
no i don't
i don't
you put it in the bin
no they they've said in there you mustn't
where
no not cooking oil
er pet car oil
car oil
that's a totally different story
i'm sure
but i mean the bottom bit obviously we've got to talk about whether we actually do want
UNK today new
but this guy seems to be well worth UNK
yes
here you are
it says here oh that's waste oil cooking fat and other UNK
i know it says fat collection but i
well that only should only be because erm the UNK going to be UNK
in the end terribly UNK that's the reason
i mean why there shouldn't be cooking oil in UNK
i mean
dad
dad's not in
mm
i can only think that i mean it sticks to the sides of the bin at the bottom
well if it's if it was very hot could it could it melt the plastic
it could even melt the plastic yes
or could it UNK
yeah
no i definitely UNK out of the water
i mean into the bin first and then wash the dishes
to keep the water clean
mm
stuff you put in water
yeah
sorry
was it printed on new paper
it doesn't say does it
well it doesn't say no
i think i think they put recycled if it was don't you
well exactly that's
you seen that story what is it one paper er if you get the letter of the week you can take part in the draw and get a flight to from UNK to UNK
wh what UNK this then
i got it last night
there was the most horrible letter in england or britain joining the common market
i'll get you one of those bags
no oh you did tell me about it
yeah i did tell you
do you well do you then know why doesn't isn't rob in touch with them any more
oh yeah very much so
i spoke to UNK away at the moment
yeah
but i spoke to UNK tonight
and erm
but i mean he's also in the sub committee isn't he
there was this working committee wasn't it and then the sub committee to the working committee on environmental matters
no yeah but i mean that leaflet very likely wouldn't have you know i mean i think this leaflet
no but that this mr
mr yeah but i mean
didn't know
okay he should he should have UNK us as a resource certainly
yeah
but i mean you know i i'm certainly gonna follow this up
mm
and i think we ought to get him over to one of our meetings
and he said he would
and i think if we could make it get one of the UNK chaps to the same meeting
marvellous thing they did
yeah
well what he did say was don't you know don't go over the top in UNK that because
yeah
you know he says that there's a lot of things which are happening
he's got all sorts of schemes a lot of schemes in the pipeline
i suppose he doesn't want to be seen to be just reacting to your letter he's obviously started doing these things off his own bat anyway hasn't he
oh yes
yeah
i mean and he feels that er pressure groups like ourselves are very positive because it gives him a bit of weight when he's arguing for things
yeah
well they can't push it from the top
but i mean on a sort of wider thing erm
yeah
you know one of the things that we could do is to do another directory
yeah
i think because i think i think
but
it's a real shame we're so out of date
mhm but i you know we we're can we actually do it
i mean we would need fifty people
no i would not distribute it
to deliver
er from door to door
i would erm put it out in the library put it out in surgeries
put it out in public places and that's it because i mean the number of people erm they went to these directories like hot cross UNK
i mean every week i supplied them with a new stack of everybody wanted them
what the recycling directory
yeah
they come through the doorstep through the doors though
through the door they just throw them away
they didn't read them
i said well don't you live in stortford didn't you have it delivered
no
and i'm sure they'll pick them up if they see them in the
if they printed
print them up and they do it on their own will
couldn't we do it with him
with him
well yeah pro
i mean they could couldn't they sponsor us to do it or something
well yeah i i've whether he well i mean if he's gonna do this seven page thing then i you know i you can look at it two ways
either we can influence and help that to be to be good or you know if that's a failure then see whether they can help us to produce one for the town
mm
i mean i'd much rather they do it if we can influence him enough
they've got the right information
well the thing if we did it with our as they keep saying there's some there's so much in the pipeline
i mean it might take us another two week two months before we get it out
three months
well
i would say six months
yeah
no i would just think of something really straightforward
they do want stuff on local levels i mean if he's east herts he's got a huge area hasn't he
yeah
it might be a help to him to have little local groups that helped him out with these things
but i mean if we print something and then suddenly they UNK all these new bottle banks which we didn't know about
then they are not mentioned
well
in our recycling directory and we can do the next one
he should know about them shouldn't he
well we must that's why certainly have to before
could you drag him along to a meeting
yeah well that's what they said we could do that
i'll write that down
erm is that okay for that i just have something that i read in new scientist does everybody take it
no
oh well i'll give you one to look at it's just a little article about
thank you
recycling in egypt
and i just liked reading it so much that i thought you'd like to read it too
don't have to read it now cos it's quite long
it's really hot
cos they UNK absolutely everything
and they make they're living out of it
in east german they are now UNK in rubbish because they used to have a perfect recycling scheme everything was collected and recycled cos they just didn't have the materials
now they are flooded with the west european goods their recycling isn't worth any more
on the other hand they haven't got the UNK and the whole scheme that the west has developed and they i mean it's a health hazard meanwhile
one of the major problems they have to face
far east lots of guys sort of collecting cardboard boxes and that's all they did they UNK down cardboard boxes and then another one did newspapers and whole newspapers and
the whole town is composed of a
yeah
it's like a big
i just thought it was interesting
erm i did write er as was suggested asking about erm facilities for cyclists in the potential shopping centre development in bishop's stortford
and they are they are interested in cyclists but from what i could make out reading this they're not really going to help us a great deal
if you want to pass it round and read it
it's they're gonna use the green UNK that are already there and the existing footpaths which are already UNK along
what good is that to me
it's just in stortford it's not that easy for a UNK is it
no
and they've got all the places say don't lean your bicycle here and you're not allowed to take it into UNK
one girl nearly got knocked off going up UNK road
it's really quite narrow as you're going up there
what about the all the cars all parked round corners everywhere like up at UNK
mm
they could do something about that
have you every UNK up there
not round UNK wh they park where those sort of shops are they park all around the corners so that you have to go out round them
and of course you meet something coming the other way wrong side of the road
oh yeah
what UNK me is that everybody parks on the pavement as well
mm
seem to UNK all laws there are about parking
it does it doesn't really help us does it
do you wanna pass these around as well if anyone wants to look
all the replies got eleven or so replies that i've had for that questionnaire
there are a few people willing to help aren't
but i haven't gone really as i hoped cos i'd envisaged having the membership list with sort of names of who'll make cakes who'll help on the stall and then know who to phone
yeah
when i wanted some help or who to invite to meetings but because i haven't got a reply from everyone or most people it can't work does it
is that all the replies you got
sent more than fifty out
i did sixty and caroline copied even more
she's a good girl
did UNK reply
erm did actually yes
yeah cos when i phoned she said she's still quite interested
mm
yeah i thought she was
but she said if the baby
and i've got a local group summer questionnaire which i couldn't really fill in
isn't it awful
i thought i'm just as bad as you know everybody else really
cos i wasn't sure of some of the answers
and that it it's saying which of the following days of action has the group UNK in
i mean cos we haven't really sort of really done a proper day of action have we
we've done little bits and pieces
i know we did the UNK bottles
i mean cos and we did that stall on peat but we didn't really take part in the peat day of action did we
what do you think
UNK and i did the electricity
what at the supermarket
is that the global UNK and electricity privatization
that one
was it
it was erm efficiency of
oh fuel and efficiency
right that one then
oh we didn't we didn't do the UNK layer one did we
did you do a stall on that UNK layer
we did do something
with the
oh we did yes
with the with er snow remember
that was christmas last year wasn't it
oh yes that was
that was UNK
yes it was we did
oh so i'll put down for that then
oh it looks quite good
right
have you written to your mp about fuel efficiency
yes i did
we did
i know erm i thought i wrote to the electricity board in i wrote to somebody about erm how er things should be labelled about how efficient they are when using electricity
you took part in the er electricity efficiency didn't you
yes
yeah but didn't we didn't write to our mps though
i thought we were
supposed to write to somewhere else was it the department of the environment or now what would it be energy
we wrote to them cos i've got a reply to that letter somewhere with a great UNK of information
about various UNK and
yeah
and things
yeah
so i can't really say we've written to the mp can we
we haven't found out about company car UNK have we
we tried
well i tried and then i was let down by the group
i don't remember anything about that one
we arranged it two days or three days and each was cancelled
march ninety one
in march this year
it was this year
last year
last year
i didn't think we'd done anything about that this year
but that was last year
yeah
but we haven't done a march ninety one then
UNK the local press for power station applications or UNK h m i p
written to michael heseltine about acid rain
may ninety one
written to your mp to ask him her to press for strict e c standards for c o two UNK from vehicles may ninety one
when was that
wasn't that on the talk
do you remember this talk we had that was last year
er
writing a letter to chris UNK about the protocol
yeah
so that was that was early this year
yeah written something
that to do with the UNK layer
i don't know
it it's mostly sort of things about energy
isn't it
questionnaire
that's definitely to do with the c f c's
yeah well this is c o two in cars private cars
yeah things to do with er UNK and
written that
in may ninety one
yeah sounds about right
ask local car dealer to write to car manufacturers to press for the introduction of more fuel efficient cars
may ninety one
no
UNK your local authority on peat use
not really did we
erm joined the UNK campaign no
written up details of recycling campaigning experience for and sent it to
no
why me
complained to your mp about the national road traffic forecast
no
looked out for threats to s i's
have we got them
s i's
sites of special scientific interest
have we got any in
mm
no
no i didn't think we had
no i don't think so
sorry
do you own your
no
do you
we have acquired a large chunk of the yes
so you should you should nominate that as a
site of the interest shouldn't you
erm it's valuable but not that valuable
but it says here written to linda UNK about the i t p o
now i rang i sent a postcard which was ready written
do you think that counts
promoted the
well we did try
yeah put that we did do that
didn't get very far though did we
actually that seems to have UNK out
haven't heard anything about that for a while
erm written to the government in u k bank about the bank propose new foreign policy
i think we might have done that
i think we might have done that
i know that i've written to british gas
and i think i wrote world bank
that was thing is that was quite a long time ago
i'm sure it wasn't this year
this is february ninety one
it's alright but you get to the bottom of those stairs and sometimes
er check locally for claims of environmentally or sustainable tropical UNK it's not really i mean i do look when i go to all these d i y places to see what they've got
haven't really
local wood guides
well UNK got two
cos i'm just deciding on a new window frame
and all the firms are claiming that they only get their UNK from government erm UNK programmes
and one got a stamp and a seal on that
but whether that is acknowledged by our friends of the earth i don't know because i mean they have so many stamps and seals on
they won't give you names now will they
the friends of the earth
they won't give you names of companies any more
no but if this stamp this acknowledgement
oh it's like a little is it
good government scheme or not
whether that is known by friends of the earth as a good scheme or not
i think there's a day of action coming up on this sort of d i y stuff
so maybe we'll get some more information about that
i'm gonna try and get the book back from rob
UNK an architect and it actually probably would be you know it might be a good thing to actually sort of UNK a question with architects because they do specify these things and they're the ones who actually say you know right we'll specify UNK
it's one of the decisions that are actually made by them in terms of what they use so erm that could be something that is
yeah
round to architects just sort of UNK the question cos they a lot of them have never thought about it
mm
and er you know if they did erm i mean martin asked about the he asked about the good wood guide you know and i told them where they can get it but that they can have it in their office and put it in their library
you know so that that's quite a good idea
yeah
but that's so quickly out of date again you see the good wood cos i mean they have new government schemes every year don't they
mm
and new other schemes
and
what at least it will enable you to know what the tropical species are because some of them have got quite weird and wonderful names and most people don't know what some of them are
mm
i know UNK is UNK
i noticed they had some UNK doors in do it all
mm
on saturday and yet that you have to be careful because they have that i've forgotten what her name was on UNK saying next time you go into a d i y store and you see a UNK toilet seat you know don't boy buy it think of the forest
well if you go into a d i y store you'll find it's a UNK i don't know if they really make UNK
it would be very expensive
yes you'd probably gauge by the price i would think
yeah
plastic
plastic
plastic one
erm oh
yes actually this cycle thing
cycle parking is actually i wish they'd actually pay a bit more places to actually put your bike and you didn't have to sort of tie it up to some UNK or something
yeah
there's hardly anything
i mean they could give you a decent stand to put it in cos i hate those ones at UNK
cos if you've got anything heavy in the bag the bike falls over
the ones at the library as well
er and they ought to have a little shelter over it to stop your UNK getting wet if it UNK
i've got i mean i've got my spots where i park it i it at UNK and outside the post office because it keeps it dry
and out of the way
all the roads into town are just awful
i mean the UNK road UNK
oh yeah
you know really scary
you know you get UNK with petrol fumes and then you get the danger of being thrown off your bike
cycling
yeah they squeeze you off the road if you go up that hill to UNK lights
i
you must to cat
just walk slowly in the middle of the road
so that there's no way they can take overtake on the right or on the left
that's the only way
our cat and i've really watched her makes a point of going and walking slowly in the road
and i think that is exactly what we have to do as cyclists
not squeeze to the side because they might not see you there
right
well you sh you're supposed to ride a fair way out from the UNK never in the UNK so they can see you round the bends
yeah but
and they often UNK you if you're doing it but that's the place
that is their fault if they UNK
erm especially going up that hill at UNK lights
they overtake you and then they slow right down so that you have to go UNK and stop
you can't cycle that slowly up a hill can you
they come in too quickly on once they've passed you
they don't they're in like that aren't they straight in front of you
UNK me
cycle underneath a car today
oh dear
michael 's got UNK
that's a good idea
yes UNK wearing it though
if everybody looks like him
oh well
i mean it looks alright if you've got all the gear on you know cycling UNK and top and everything
make them like swimming hats with lots of little flowers all over them
yeah
but if you do get one you have to be careful you get one that's done to the proper standard because some don't work apparently
absolutely nothing
well that's what i thought it just seemed to say they were gonna have sort of cycle ways going through the green UNK along where i cycle already
mm
and that's no help at all is it
we can't complain
that should do quite well in trying to get the traffic away from the centre in stortford anyway
mm
they were talking UNK
i think that's been on the cards for a long time hasn't it
yeah
UNK and they've never done it
sorry
erm wh have we done anything about the environmental charter
because i started doing it a long time ago
yeah bob did that didn't he
it vaguely yeah and we presented it and then it UNK
the group UNK out because we presented the charter
and that was the aim of
it asks here have they adopted it
erm
wouldn't or we aim to still try
well
i think i've a funny feeling that did adopt it but quite how much that means i don't understand
well it's awful having to do this questionnaire we we've done
all these workshops that have been going on that we haven't been to
well they just kind of recognized the principles don't they but they don't ensure that they'll actually put them into practise
that's what adopting means it's not actually committing
yes i thought they had yes
how about these questions
does the group have a constitution
no
does the group have an office
no
we've got our plastic box
plastic
i know i know everybody will be disappointed but i couldn't get cardboard ones stick it all in
we bought the storage boxes anyway to keep all the
no but you can't really i mean that's what supposed to have it like an actual proper office
you can't have all in cardboard boxes
it's erm not easy to organize
you can't and keep them open at the same time
what is the most common problem you've experienced in your dealings with street
it's phoning them up and the person i want to talk to isn't there
i think
have you had any anybody else phone them up or written to them
no
no
i think they're quite UNK and rude whenever i've phoned them up
are they
they're not terribly friendly
oh they're usually okay i mean what they don't know
i mean i just find it annoying cos you get through to somebody who then passes you on to somebody else and then they'll talk to you and say well the person you want to talk to isn't here at the moment so you've had all this phone call and then you've got to ring again
and you have to do it in office hours as well
what has been your UNK moment this year
oh that was rob
when he was able er to enter the sub committee
oh yes
he was really proud of that and he made a point of that being
i'll write that down
for him years of struggle to get any influence to finally find himself
oh good one
what sort of committee is it then
hearing aid
well i think one does speak a bit louder in public meetings it's just
and i can only do this work i'm sorry
sorry i didn't hear
oh i didn't hear either
turn that thing off
i was asking what sub committee it was
er the environmental
they had a working committee didn't they and a sub
it's east herts isn't it
i think
was it east herts
east herts yeah
yeah east herts
environmental sub committee
yeah
he sits on it
well he had this environment mental officer they in UNK him then at this meeting when erm the thing you handed over
charter
the environment charter
why's it a sub committee
what happened to the proper committee as well
yeah
reports then back to the proper actual UNK the er
the work's committee
district council meeting
well i know at district council there was two environmental groups was it the officers group and the members group
oh
i wonder which group
herts county council
cos when i was on the hertfordshire environmental of the group which has folded
i've got all this money in the abbey national and there's no group any more i think i'll have to keep
keep quiet
i'll have to send it off to
but anyway it UNK that there were two groups sort of working towards the same end and nobody could work out what sort of erm role each played and it was terrible
because you knew that they both had to agree before anything was done
oh
i suppose that was one way of nothing being done
yes they didn't communicate
the officers group and the members group that was right
right
anyway
onwards
erm there's going to be a sort of event at the UNK centre
erm for one world week on the twenty fourth of october and we've been asked to do a stall there
which i said yes to without asking anybody so i hope that's alright
what date is it
october the twenty fourth
that's a thursday
we're doing a traidcraft stall
oh yes
you what
well he wanted to know who the traidcraft person
oh really
and he said he said he tried to phone you up and i said oh don't worry
cos any you always get the UNK
could leave a message
is it
it's at the UNK centre thursday october the twenty fourth
well if we do a stall i would really like to have at least a leaflet on new recycling
yeah okay
so that we have i mean nothing of design or anything just short information because i think it's so
right
out of date
yeah
i know and he said you could sell things as well now
i don't know what you think i just wondered did we ought to order anything from friends of the earth catalogue like those sort of things to sell
cos that i mean they're always going to be useful i use them myself and i expect you all
mm
the question is the quantity
er yeah
i've no idea
well i mean i know what barbara feels about this
she feels that erm at the level that we are working at it is really UNK be counter productive to hold stock
because however hard you try stock UNK
yeah
erm but i you know i feel that very often we don't sell stock
well couldn't we just have a few things
and i feel that if we did have stock then we would erm sell it
so i mean that that's two ways of looking at it
certainly if we've got some stuff in a box
well i mean we needn't buy the expensive things like UNK
shall i try at erm cambridge
i mean it's october
yeah but they will they won't sell you on at a discount will they
cos if we all
but i mean i just know that harlow tried stock keeping and selling they gave up
i know that er in UNK they were quite desperate
all came up with the same idea and they wanted to do it
and in the end they came to UNK conclusions so that its a an expensive thing
but i mean if we only had like the writing paper and the envelopes and re use labels small items of stationery
the stickers and i mean
they still do yeah
but i mean i expect i mean even we had some left over e eventually you could sell them to our own members because they'd all want to use it
mm
and it's cheaper than ordering it off the catalogue
that's a good idea about cambridge isn't it
you could borrow there stock is that what you're thinking and then take back what we didn't sell
that's what
i mean i've never talked to them so i don't know yet
well if they would let us borrow it that's a different matter to buying it from then because we then wouldn't make any money on it
well i don't i have never heard of a local group that makes money out of this selling
well you buy it all at thirty three or twenty five percent discount so you can then sell it at a bit more
but then you have then you have the stuff that doesn't sell and UNK and you still have to have paid for it so
i think it's possible to make a bit of money but at the rate you know i feel we're all the time putting the cart before the horse
erm you know if we are going to try to keep going as a viable group then yes one of the things we should consider i mean i don't i've come here sort of thinking oh is this it is this the crisis meeting or
is it you know erm i mean i feel so UNK that we should keep going but
mm
i also feel just that i am able to contribute next to nothing in terms of time so and i think w we're almost all in that situation
erm you know we sort of seem to UNK from one meeting to another without really committing ourselves to anything much
and you know if we were able to commit ourselves to two public two meetings three meetings of some sort in a year where we're actually gonna do something and present some sort of front par part of presenting some sort of front is to try to sell a few bits of pieces if we're prepared to accept that we're going to lose money
yeah
i mean if we we're preaching you should use recycled products we if we had a few to sell at least
mm
yeah
i mean you you're be selling your traidcraft stuff i mean
which
why does barbara believe it's okay to sell that but not
no well we're in exactly the same problem with traidcraft
you know we used to sell thousand of pounds worth a year and now we're down to couple of thousand a year and we're s we are losing money on that
mhm
no we're not actually losing money but i mean with traidcraft we are getting to the low point where we put borrowed stock
well that's the recession isn't it
or
well what i thought was with this one world week thing at least people that who go might be more UNK to what we have to say to show and sell
yes we've done really well with traidcraft
because that is that's the whole reason for the concert and they're gonna have this concert in there as well and people will be buying tickets to go to
yeah
and i don't know an awful lot about it and there's going to be all these stalls
where they're coming obviously because they believe in that sort of thing so
two or three years ago one world week was a full week of all sorts of different activities which were all very well attended
it's sort of UNK very rapidly
has it
down to i d i don't even know what happened last year
mm
we just had a stall didn't we
but it
or was that last year what seven or eight of us wasn't it
at st UNK
the church
yeah
that was last year or was that two years ago
er
there was something at st UNK but i didn't know it was the one world week
yeah i have never been involved in a one world week event at st UNK
i thought there was one there
you certainly were there
in the church
no i don't i don't think
yeah
anyway i mean hopefully this will be sort of you know if it's well UNK it will be well attended because of the past
i think we might as well get in a few things and anyway i want some envelope re use labels
i've run out completely
there you are so many packets already
well if you don't want UNK re use labels i don't care
oh
i didn't know you did them
well erm
doesn't matter does it
well apart from this leaflet on recycling facilities what else shall we have
on the stall
well who's gonna do the leaflet
i will
i think we ought to sort that out
well that will be i personally think that's the only thing we can do
and we should just sort of say what is necessary to find out and everybody gets a few telephone numbers or telephone calls check out addresses find out about new ones get in contact with the district council erm what is in the pipeline
find out about UNK possibly why there's is running and whether that is going to br breakdown
erm and if we then find money for printing it i would approach UNK bank banks local banks and would it do it very UNK the same local the same style er and only hand it out to places where people are likely to pick it up
and not bother about
i mean charity shops erm library UNK surgeries UNK as i know
i think that's a very sensible idea actually rather than er trying to do the whole town
because that was er you know i mean it got the group together
yeah
i thought because everybody had the same experience
i liked the experience because i had never done it
mm
what a waste of time
the number of people i've talked to that i definitely knew had got and never knew they had got it
mm
yeah i mean but on the other hand the there's probably quite a few that did read it
i mean i know when we moved house i had folder and one of each had got in it the recycling directory
mm
which is quite a nice surprise
i mean had they had they sold to someone outside bishop's stortford
yeah
then they could
yeah
erm
i think we have to have something if we have a stall
we lost all the erm UNK original UNK
yeah
oh that's a shame
well i could photocopy that couldn't you
yeah
the detail
difficult to see what it is
but erm
oh that's a real shame
otherwise i will just do it in a different colour a different
i mean then
then UNK the inside
yeah
er something before i always forget everything
the german friends of the UNK people told me never to do the washing on monday mornings
i mean that's something to put there as well i think
because it's a peak time for electricity and the electricity board er produces according to peak demands
that's got nothing to do with recycling has it
no
i know but
no
but you do you think honestly though that really does still hold true because if everyone ha mostly having UNK now you just wash as you go you don't have a washing day or is it specially monday they
like i've got just automatically i wanted to do washing this morning
really
i don't
i just put it when it gets too bad you know if haven't got any clothes to
it's an interesting though
i didn't know that they produced according to peak
yeah i think it's important to know
it's very important to know yes
erm whatever
don't do it monday mornings
i usually do mine at midnight when i get home
yes
a lot of people do it overnight
yeah
but it's not really a good idea because if something goes wrong with your machine
you're not there to deal with it
i mean i've had mine flood and i've had its UNK go and it boiled everything
i mean that would have been a disaster i mean it's only because i was upstairs and i thought oh i can smell boiling
you know it was like when you boil up UNK i thought what a
there was UNK came out of everything it was awful
and another time it was all pouring all over the floor
the other thing i mean to be healthy it's more important to dry things and keep them dry for a while than to boil them
bacteria survive heat for a short time
yeah
but they don't a for the percentage of bacteria that UNK is minimal
so you don't need to boil UNK
er if you just keep your UNK iron them keep them dry
then they are then they are UNK
be bothered
anyway back to the point
he said UNK
well leaflet
stall
we've got to get back to the stall
yeah er the recycling leaflet
who's gonna do it
it's not gonna be done if we don't get somebody to actually front you know
well
take it on
the thing is that i can do UNK it on computer
because it w you can UNK
what ma UNK
no you just stick it on a UNK
i see i wa before you do that i'll get in touch with the guy who drew it and if he if he has got an original copy he might be able to erm to er
what you can do is you can then get basically you get the computer to type that out type that out
ah
and then you just do a run you don't have to go on to print it at all you just print it off
that's one option
then photocopy the rest of it
i've got a laser printer yeah so i mean that's what i use for my business
i've got a UNK and a laser printer
so i mean
i've got some recycled paper but
well UNK got loads to sell
not doing very well are you
no
because i have this erm dilemma
whether to just photocopy off a very good original
yeah
or do we print the whole lot
and we came to the conclusion it was cheaper to print
oh
than photocopy
what it's a bit slow isn't it
yeah it depends well you can get it to run through copies but the problem is that the UNK for these printers they cost about fifty pounds
mm
they're not cheap
so if i can do one run and then photocopy it
mm
it a is actually a lot better because you can get them usually get them down to about five p a copy
well won't you lose definition on the drawing though with a laser printer
no
no
no it's even better
oh that's alright
okay no it's i'm just going by the one at school and it because it's all made up of little dots you
no this is a laser printer
this does it absolutely it's not a dot printer it's it is a laser printer
oh well he keeps calling it his laser printer seen it in action we don't see that well
so you said you could do it for five p a copy
well i r i r i reckon i reckon you can down to that yeah
that's printing both sides
yeah
double sided printer and i i'll try and get that UNK but
i think we could sell it i think we could sell it for
yeah
ten p or twenty p
oh that would be a different ball game selling it in places wouldn't it
oh yeah
ho how many
that's our i mean you know you can go round in UNK or doctor's surgery and dump them
but to actually say right can you s can you collect the money for us
well one could put a box next to it
well in some places yeah
yeah but i mean mm
a UNK a lot
it is yeah
well although
i mean it i'm not suggesting that isn't cheap but erm to produce at five p a copy
oh yeah
thousand it's gonna cost what's it gonna cost
er
what's five thousands
five thousands
fifty pounds
mm
mm
i mean i'm only going on the fact that i tend to do everything on the cheap so i tend to get if i can find somebody who does photocopying i can do it then we'll do it
for me to produce that'll cost me basically my time and my you know i say my laser UNK paid for by my business erm
copies
so i mean if i if i produced for instance si five or six masters and then people can go and do copies here and there that's actually not a bad way of doing it
and that'll be i've got about a UNK of well it's only about a UNK paper
just pr producing new copies as you need them rather than produce five thousand and i think we have sort of hundreds to throw away in the end
but i it to er recycling
yeah
well i'll get in touch with this east herts guy to get all his information
good
mm
but erm
you know we need to find out where to take
somebody needs to collect somebody needs to be a contact for getting all the information to by a certain date
well you can get it through me yeah
okay
UNK do they actually do now
no
has anybody been there
no
well they collect aluminium cans
oh do they
yeah that's what i was told
i acted on what everyone had told me i then asked my friend who had a contact in UNK about it she said well there is one
it's just inside the doors where you don't see it
walk in like that and you're looking at all the things in the shop not where
it's not in the recycling centre
why don't they put it in the recycling centre
i think it's cos it looks like it's made out of cardboard
it's probably run by the scouts
they're in charge of it like
yeah cos there's one at the swimming pool isn't there
yeah
yeah
mm
does anybody know anything about there's this little note in about erm recycling paper all sorts of paper magazines cardboard er on the first monday of the month
does anybody know anything about that
is this for boots
every first monday of the mo month is the UNK
UNK
and he gave me that information repeatedly and he's terribly involved
it it's fantastic
right yeah
i'm always worried that his enthusiasm is stretched to the limit
no i mean the number of pe
i've just passed my a levels i've got loads of papers going what can i do
well i said ring UNK scouts
and as far as i know he always
i mean the address is on there anyway
yeah oh right
is it
oh
er
quite pertinent actually if we are actually going to do one
what
to ask people sorry in my in the letter
yeah
to the press ask people to er submit any information
yeah
oh what you mean you're gonna put at the bottom of the of the same letter or
well yes
yeah
just write down all the information we've got now so there is can recycling at the swimming pool and at UNK privately run
swimming pool
erm swimming pool
who's going to get the information who runs that
who
mm
well i can do that i suppose
well who runs what
the swimming pool
because i know the scouts do the UNK one and whenever they are put in these cardboard boxes they have to be sorted so somebody must sort them
oh they're not they're not asking sorting oh i see
erm so there must be somebody responsible and i think if we write swimming pool and people take their cans there
yes we'd have to check
erm i should first check
check with them yeah quite
so i do you do UNK
i'll do the swimming pool
i would check who actually is responsible for that
but of course all paper now is
all paper
all paper
what about this chap then
it's in the library th with his number
well you ring him but if he if he gets upset or
oh i see
it's strange you can give that as an address
any UNK town of some size has got a comprehensive recycling centre now that takes any paper
do you have to sort it
do you have to take it sorted
no
no
it's just a big skip
and it says
at UNK
do they then sort it
the car park
no they it's the council UNK it and in UNK that's why i said we should get at the same time an UNK councillor because i would
yes yeah
like to know a whether their new scheme is only temporary is about to break down
mm
or whether they actually get the UNK cost incorporated into this skip collecting cost
because the money they can get for this mixed paper must be a UNK
mm
almost hardly worth their while but
if you look at the UNK kept out of the UNK
yeah
it might work
yeah but i mean it
so where's this place in UNK then do you know
erm if you go in along cambridge road there's the turning to the right isn't there the first when you come up the hill
at the UNK th whatsit hill
chapel hill
chapel hill
chapel hill
you go down there do you
and it's by the library isn't it
mm
go down it's first left once you've turned right at
you know where the library is
opposite there isn't it
opposite the fire station
near the white house round the back of the white house
where the health centre is
yes round the back of those few little shops in london road
and you can take anything
you can take erm any drink can UNK
you can take glass and you can take pa papers
and in UNK
suddenly thought you still got to have a little UNK membership forms in it haven't you
with all that peat and stuff
they even take er pills
with all that
do they
oh that's interesting to know
remember w we did that peat they had a box that had a national membership forms in
we could have that on the stall couldn't we
oh yes w i mean we have got various leaflets produce still which is in reasonable condition
i've got yeah
yeah we could take that you know membership and our own membership forms as well
what pub is that then
did you say a pub
a pub yeah in front of the pub er in
just before the
oh the one in
yeah
before you go to st UNK school the pub
what is it called
oh yeah it's the oak isn't it
the royal oak
yeah cos that's next door but one to me so yeah
oh that's where you are
yeah
well anyway that is a new item on the recycling directory
right
oh they've got one near those shops in UNK
could you find out what happens to the
yeah i know they come er there's a big lorry comes and UNK them
yeah
but whether they are sent to the third world or torn into UNK or
yeah
well you've got the i mean industry uses UNK
UNK up oil and things like that
i might c call
if i see them collecting i'll ask
and then if you're UNK
you have to ring
yeah
erm find out from
oh well i'll get the
the charity shops what they want
UNK shops
yeah
address
oh right
charity shops
ah er the other item that we must mention is any extra plastic bags
yeah i'll ask about plastic bags
are extremely welcome in any charity shop
now what about engine oil
because oh actually we've got some in our garage now sitting there and waiting to go somewhere
the council takes it
the council takes it
yes i'm almost certain
i mean a visit to the council to find out exactly what they do take would be
mm
but can you take it back to garages as well
no
no
no
UNK in harlow is one that we found out took it
but i ce i'm almost certain the council takes it
yeah i remember big bins wasn't sort of sure what else
they also take batteries
i know that
car batteries
do they
car batteries
the car batteries
that's the council
to get money at
right
but what about erm little batteries
i i'm collecting those
yeah
you are collecting them
what happens to radio batteries
are still doing it
yeah
and they bring them up to me
ah
i'm just waiting for a day of action on
what do english er what do the english do with batteries and then dump them
in those letters UNK th there's
yeah
a letter which says they have stopped doing it
oh yeah
that UNK have stopped doing it
oh
about the second quite early on isn't it
oh yeah i was
i was gonna say it's about the last one
think you were reading them upside down
well they only they only er took the batteries over to me before we left on holiday
so they must still be doing them and that was two huge boxes
oh
er
i know they are not very happy
well that needs a check that needs another check i would guess
yeah
and i quite honestly i don't
i i'm going to say about back to this erm UNK oil
my brother in law said he read in the paper that erm over a year sort of the amount of oil tipped on our land and down drains which shouldn't be there is almost like equivalent to the disaster at UNK
i heard that
th erm the amount of oil that people just tip on the ground or down the drains or whatever
mm
over a year is equivalent to the disaster of the UNK
so really people ought to be trained to take their engine oil out
there's this there's this er out of sight out of mind principal
you are fined you are heavily fined in germany and for decades already
you were not allowed to wash your car on a normal street because oil would automatically be UNK into the UNK into the
they must be going absolutely mad about east germany mustn't they
well it's just so incredible that this oil has never been i mean nobody focused on it did they
no
people just don't think
they just tip it oh tip it down the drain
same with petrol stations i mean the way they UNK the petrol
i know
there used to be safety catch mechanism
yeah
but there isn't now is there it just comes UNK out
well really i mean with quite a few you really have to watch out which is
they had a row at erm petrol station when that happened to her
and they said it was our car
and it went cos it was quite a bit more worth petrol that went all over the place
and she refused to pay
and they me up about it
i sort of denied all knowledge
i didn't know it had happened
i think they were being most unreasonable
we at the time the attendant said it was alright
she didn't have to pay for it
it could easily i mean will be shorter i think
sorry
fewer UNK now
this will be shorter
i think we can easily put erm pits for daily life or how to be environmental
and then
oh a few tips
oh
with respect i really think it ought to be recycling and nothing else
mm
well i just find these i mean we had quite a few now
cos recycling sort of comes into the tips for daily life as well though doesn't it
it's part of it
like protecting people don't just save bottles they save their glass UNK
seem to be UNK people when really you just want to give information
as well
people don't always think of
yeah
re using things re using things is almost the same as recycling isn't it
re use
yes
yeah
i suppose it's i mean
well it is really isn't it
re using is better than recycling
yeah
erm
so
erm i take
so it
reduce or re use recycling
has anybody got a con
UNK are much better than sort of er
because UNK read those
well you can write save money across the top then
well i wrote actually that article for the herald and post that has appeared in harlow but not here
a whole load of tips like that
oh
now every week i open herald and post and think oh it's gonna be in there it's gonna be in there but it never is
it's only appeared in harlow and she told me it would get in the bishop's stortford one but it hasn't so far
it's a bit annoying really
who does all the schools
as to recycling
they must be checked
what about asking caroline
school
well i mean somebody who knows the teachers or
yes
that's gonna be a difficult one cos they don't always want
i will i'll do the schools
yeah
erm the general public walking into their
yeah
we ought to split the schools because there's quite a lot of them
i'll do the primary you do the secondary
i'll do the secondary
what about that
okay
primary
well i think boy's high were active in between weren't they
whether they er still are
how about st mary
i found that erm UNK all over the place
st mary is wall
the p e
do they still do it
the p e teacher is supposedly collecting aluminium cans and we've been through various daft schemes of stopping the children from throwing the cans everywhere because we've got this coke machine
and we even had one where they paid a ten p deposit on a can so they paid forty p instead of thirty or whatever
and i got hardly any cans back
or they did was b buy them from the school canteen where they were still thirty
and the coke machine wasn't used
well why not er encourage the canteen to charge forty
they didn't but then they had
as well
well they won't because they have to make money in order to survive
the more money they make the better for them
they have to run it as a business now
for profit i'm afraid
er oh i did have one polish lad who's now left who used to go round looking for all the cans and he'd then collect the ten p's
scheme folded
through lack of support
so what else is mentioned here
i think that still holds
and i can check i will go and
and car batteries is the same
other batteries i'll check
pills er you check
yeah
furniture erm yeah i think that's
is there a second hand furniture shop now in bishop's stortford
there is one isn't there
is there one down by the causeway
yes there is
who is going to check that
well i can check it
yeah
yeah
whether they take
yes
yes
i mean whether they want any
right
okay
could i just borrow your pen and i'll write that down
thanks
are red cross still taking furniture in stortford
now where is red cross
erm well i think the furniture you have to take down to UNK when i last phoned
there's a number in the er when i was church street so that's a few years now so it needs to be checked
would you do that
so it's whether they take furniture
okay
newspapers i think that is normally isn't it
do you think people are
folded
what's that shop in the causeway near the UNK erm it it's a second hand furniture in there isn't it
is it
but h i mean are people in the habit of wanting to get rid of furniture
i mean i mean if it if it's really UNK i mean
well you can get i mean according to the leaflet you can just phone up and get the council to collect
no
glass we haven't got any bottle banks
and that's where we need to contact what is in the pipeline
yeah
bottle bank somewhere
yeah there's one at UNK now isn't there which is new since that
yeah there is UNK
UNK
they have one now
they do
yes
oh
they suddenly found the room
yes actually
well in a parking block
er would anyone like coffee
no thank you
one two
now what was it i mean or would you prefer anything else
some tea
tea
i'll go and check
one thing i struck me this week there's a new regulation as regard UNK on tyres because i had this completely flat tyre and a whole new set of tyres and i said to him well can't you mend it can't you put an inner tube in like i i've done before cos there was a nail in it you see
yeah
and i said just get the nail out and re repair the inner tube he said no it's the there's a new regulation this year that if the outer case of the you know the tyre has
tea
they're not allowed to repair it because safety regulations because the whole UNK and then supposedly the actual UNK comes off
and i said well what happens to these extra tyres
right
so he sa i mean does anybody know anything about anything like that
no
UNK i mean i just lost four
i know this i just know about a sort of friend of ours is making money meanwhile in germany
he found well of course erm connections so he got the permission through the UNK
he's now running lorry loads of worn tyres to russia to the soviet union and makes money loads of money because the tyres they couldn't ha get any tyres so the tyres he saw there were totally without profile
you know
yeah
so the old tyres he could erm find in germany were a lot better
he UNK them over
making thousands out of it
yeah
well people do that here though don't they
se sell them to africa and places yeah
alright if it doesn't rain actually so it wouldn't matter if they didn't have UNK on er UNK on the tyres if it's dry it doesn't really matter you just go round UNK and
i think could chop them up and use them to make road UNK with
yeah but percentages is
mm
at least you know they can do it
mm that's right
oh they can do quite a lot of it
i mean even the su surface out of the play in UNK
mm
i can never quite work out why that
most roads
so far i've got two UNK here and one tea
anybody else for anything
i'll have a coffee please
coffee
black please
black coffee
white
white
white
so we've got about six weeks in which to do this
so how many weeks
i mean there's no excuse i all the jobs are quite quickly done aren't they
yeah
so what we ought to have a deadline for collect collecting the information
and then get together
yeah
to put it together
and then decide on
and how to
and how to get how to get it to put it together
shall we say three weeks
three weeks yeah
probably for everybody just to do it and
yeah
and i don't think anybody has more time in four weeks time
so if you say six weeks by then you
yeah
it's too near
so the thirtieth of september we'll meet here again
meeting
can we meet at house
yes
it's more sensible for
meet where
what's your address
forty two
thirty two
is that alright
or what
UNK is actually not very good for me but hopefully by then
i don't think i can make that either but er
UNK can i have your phone number please
right
erm what did you say
thirtieth
well that's
go through
so UNK erm ya i think that's re using is better than recycling
and erm then mention the charity shops
i mean we don't need to imply anything there
there's no new recycling centre nearby for UNK is there
so who mentioned this
the what
talk about recycling mention that
i just remember it from the
now UNK have become UNK they haven't done the plastic bags collection have they like the a lot of the
they haven't got a provision for plastic bags
is that worth checking out
i know a lot of the UNK do have a recycling
i i'll do that if i'm doing plastic bags at charity shops i'll check
plastic bag recycling
what's happened to UNK one p back cos they don't actually
yes i was yes
they don't actually give you one p any more
no
i think supposed to they are supposed to
i always make them give me three p
this in the friend of the earth germany she stayed with us i really would have liked you to meet her
she was UNK
you have cat f food in tins
how dare you know
what do they
from the butcher and
oh really
locally no transport
cut out transport
only local foods and
if it's available
yes well mm
so who
are you doing the bottle bank
you doing the bottle banks
who's doing the bottle banks
yeah
thanks ever so much
because er caroline once wanted one in a school and we weren't allowed to have it
no i won't thank you
well there's one at erm
the erm wine merchant
you know erm the one down the bottom of UNK hill
well they were they were sort of advertising er giving you money back
i don't know if
down in the er
yeah
can you find out more
and also we do
quite a few we can write at the bottom er for more UNK if you have any more information or something in small print
mm
please contact and then we can do the next few hundred
the thing is you can you can change them very easily
ya
that means you can er pay for it easier
i wouldn't print more than three hundred for a start
so if we get further information we can always if not we can just get printed
that's very impressive isn't it
that's that council of environment
no sorry
council's environment advisory committee
oh that must be that must be the one er
UNK on
thought this was good about the buying the r s p c a that boat oil UNK
doesn't look very steady though does it
yeah they look like
it's ever so tiny isn't it
yeah
UNK
well they've got to keep their green image green image going haven't they
so kath while you were coffee making we decided on er three weeks for collecting information
oh right
and another three weeks for production
which will make the thirtieth of september a meeting at UNK road
that's a
monday
although for two of us UNK aren't good
so i don't know whether
i would prefer another day
three
that makes three
monday or tuesday is no good
you can't do tuesday
wednesday
wednesday now wednesday would be the
second of october
second of october
it's at your house
is that all that's changed then has it wednesday the second of october
have we decided on wednesday
no i think we should
thing is i don't think i can but er i mean i might be able to pop in for about half an hour
because i mean i can find out what goes on
yeah and leave the stuff
yeah
beforehand
i'll probably phone it in actually
yeah
if that's okay
er second at what ti
wednesday second of october
what time
eight thirty
eight thirty
and this is this is about the leaflet is it
yeah
yes
get all the information
decide on how we do the thing
and erm do take it
to go into details of that it's probably much more sensible to do it with just two or three people
but er at least if we can pull the information together that evening that'd be a start
form a sub committee
ooh
sub committee with everybody present
well you can always divide up
thanks ever so much folks and i'll see you
oh you've got to go
soon
see you
bye UNK
see you then
thanks UNK
your welcome
i'll be in touch
bye
so what's gonna be on this stall then
apart from the new leaflets and a few
some re use labels
yeah
you're gonna buy you're gonna buy some
i'll send off for some stuff
i'll just do it
okay
those traidcraft ones
we've got some money
money sitting round accounts doing nothing
how much money have we got
oh
probably loads
can't remember
i'd better let you know what we have got in stock just in case there's anything there that you're
yeah
you haven't have you
no
i don't think so
are you gonna get leaflets and you know friends of the earth leaflets
i've got l well they've got loads i've got a big wallet folder full of all the various leaflets
you have
right
erm
car stickers and
cakes or anything like produce or
i don't know
i mean it it's up to you
i don't know if it's that sort of a do really
mm
hundred and sixty eight pounds thirty nine pence
oh gosh
is that their new catalogue or is that the one the summer one
this is spring summer
it's the latest one isn't it
i haven't had another one
i mean they may be just about bringing one out so
they're just about to bring one out aren't they
the christmas lot will be out
that one
sorry
august that one
the r s p b
well i i've been sent a local
oh that was is that true
no i've got a
no it said it in there
i've got a local group six pound order form autumn and winter ninety one
but i don't think they change that much
i think they just sort of it's the same thing in a different order
and it's got a lot of sort of stuff that's left over from
UNK things
that'll do
yeah
erm
but i mean do we want to have any produce or anything else
i'm just looking at this stall thinking there's gonna be next to nothing on it
mm
yeah
i think if some cakes we need definitely
oh
so we have to do
to make it look right so
good advertising
what is the what is the concert in fact
well i honestly don't know an awful lot about it
i don't think he knows that much
it was low cost through the
no cos it's concert
there's going
oh concert
to be a concert there
all UNK they were going to have a concert weren't they
no
this is at the UNK centre
the UNK centre
the concert at which we've got this stall
yeah
the UNK stall
i mean he kept he didn't know
he said to me on the phone he didn't know a great deal cos he was just getting it all together
and he said today he phoned me just as i was going out and i didn't really sort of stop and talk to him very long
he just asked me what we needed and i said well a table
we don't really need anything else do we
like power supply or
oh no quite
something with flashing lights on it
so what time of the day is that
it's evening
seven or eight o'clock
he told me
how long does it go on for
no idea
he said he'd phone me again you see
i think if there's a concert there'll be a rush at the beginning and there'll be a rush at the end
possibly a rush at the at an interval i suppose
what concert is it then
i mean
well i don't know
sounds a funny evening to me bit of a UNK isn't it
i mean
but he's he just
the oth
the other thing we could do
sorry
liz
is to see whether green consumer rob and UNK want to have something
i guess that would be a
i mean i wonder who exactly you're attracting if you've got people coming to listen to music and then
well i think something to do with the church isn't it
i think he mentioned the church
go through the church
i don't know what the one the there's usually a theme for every one world week each year and i don't know what the theme is for this year
act together for UNK world
yeah
fine
well
yeah
there you go
and he said we come under that heading so
good
right
but all he
there's nothing else going on apart from this concert
i don't know
i'll ask him
i'll ask him
erm we'd better get on to a few other things
i've got erm greenpeace written to me
they're having a family fun day on what day is it
saturday the twenty eighth of september
that's at much UNK hall village hall
two o'clock to five o'clock
they want to know if we want to have a stall there
family fun day much UNK village hall
yeah
do you know where that is in much UNK
opposite the bull pub isn't it
right
er he wants to know do we want to have a stall there and that's gonna cost us five pounds
if we have that
erm
well you could get produce for that
and then if you ordered now
i bet they probably be really competing with them in a way won't we cos they've got all the same sort of stuff
won't they
yeah
greenpeace sell them UNK and re use labels and sort of things like that
i don't know what you think
erm and there's er
i would suggest
if it's a fun day why don't we do a game or something
why do you know
well it's
they're celebrating their twentieth birthday UNK
erm and then th in the evening there's an event
which starts at eight o'clock with two live bands UNK and bar
tickets three pound fifty
does anybody want to go
that's a good idea but it's offer to do a game
well they've got what they've got on here is they've got whale watch talk and slides
punch and judy show
magic and UNK with UNK plate spinning
er UNK painting competition
raffle refreshments UNK and various UNK stalls so i suppose that's us
quite
mm
do they do fire eating act or
we can UNK or my legs up behind my neck
an alternative might be to just to ask whether some of our membership forms could be put out so that
well i think they're more interested in the five pounds
yeah alright well
yeah
i mean to make a contribution
no to be honest because that that's what greenpeace do isn't it
don't you belong
yeah start the harlow one up
yeah
the whole of their effort really is devoted to
yeah they don't do it
they're actually they just do fund raising to their local groups and everything else is obviously sort of controlled by central office or
that's right everything is central
ac action is central or something
yeah but i mean
so they're probably just gonna have their you know UNK and a few people sort of
it's difficult really because i mean we're sort of UNK for the same sort of things
i know
yeah
aren't we
it's er you don't want to be seen to be erm
who's it actually run by
competing with each other in any way
well
i think his name's actually written out
i'm not sure
it's like trying to unite the churches
yeah
it looks like somebody plus UNK oh yeah
no
oh well
it's signed by s
oh no sorry
that can't possibly say
well it says leslie at the top
but there's something else underneath
i mean is that
but is that a greenpeace central office thing or is it erm
a local group
a local group
east herts
but does it pat does it doesn't he
for herts yeah
he still does it now
how do you know
that have got so involved in that
yeah
and bob did it here in bishop's stortford but i don't know whether he's still i think he still does it because he was very committed
but i just pat was doing it for bishop's stortford on or thereabouts because he sent me all the details about the whale walk
cos i gave his name to this guy organizing the one world week
and he hadn't had any joy out of greenpeace
can i borrow that a minute
what this
yeah
the problem we've got with greenpeace they might not have so much in the way of UNK and they just have the stickers and
there's the leaflets
things and leaflets
yeah i think it just depends whether the local group want to take up the option or not
i don't think there's anything i've got to tell you
er except there's a day of action but it's right that's right into november now so you can hear about that
so we this next meeting at
yeah
i think we can sort out more about the st stall i mean if we can sell things
well this er greenpeace letter UNK the september
oh that is a pity
i think that's actually a bit too soon to get ourselves organized
shall i shall i just write off and send them like pound or donation and a few leaflets could
yeah
say we're quite prepared to make a contribution mm
you put them out or circulate them
yeah
yeah i mean don't think rob would be interested
yeah
he ought to know about it though
i'll ask him about it
cos he lives up the road from there doesn't he
oh yeah
erm
and he could collect some money for the
alright i'll tell
yeah
i expect he you know they're fairly busy but you know they may well
and i'll tell
not want to go
yeah
anyway i'll see you all on wednesday
thanks for coming
erm
bye liz
i'll going in the afternoon
there's a few other things
that i've got to get through here
i mean
erm i've got here
i've been sent some stuff by chris who used to run harlow group
oh yeah
chris who was that
not christine
yeah that's right they cos erm so i've got a whole long list of all these people who used to belong to harlow which is absolutely enormous
is that friends of the earth
yeah
masses of names
loads of money and
well no i
no they've folded now
they have folded
well i think that list is the list that what was his name chris
quite a few as well
but if you look properly it's a that is not only harlow
remember he wanted to merge the groups
don't you remember
oh yeah
oh yes
of course
and he had all the numbers
because he also works
yes
some of ou
yeah
in a erm london
isn't it the national
no it's all the
no
he wanted to call it UNK group or something
oh yeah
UNK valley or something wasn't it
UNK valley group
well there's a lo quite a lot
it's mostly harlow actually when you look through it
but there are bishop's stortford ones too
yeah that's all the
and the vast UNK harlow
that was his plan of having
what do they do they want
what do they want to do
do they want join our group or
nothing
he said he he's apparently just moved and he's got involved with this other charity erm to do with the united nations friends of the earth and just passed it on to me
cos the there must be useful contacts you see
people who UNK
we've got the names
mm
they were fairly enthusiastic when they started off
mm
so i
but i mean we i don't know whether you think it's worth contacting or not
it might be
yes
w either when we've got a reason to contact them
yeah
or with a specific letter for them saying you know welcome if you if you feel like it
actually just quickly er i just noticed on that list of your questionnaires that we got back a couple that they didn't actually know what was going on
and that you know perhaps this is er erm publicity wise i wonder whether we're falling a bit short on our publicity
well
they didn't know i mean like first newsletter we've had in ages
and it's something else that we need to get
we can't just sort of
no exactly
we've got to get we should get more publicity
but it's ever so easy for somebody to sit at home and say well you should be doing this and you should be doing that
oh yeah
and not doing
no i'm not sa i'm not saying
i'm not saying you should be doing anything i'm just er
no i didn't mean you i meant them
no well
i well really i don't think you should say you're not doing enough
no
i think last year more or less shows that we really have to concentrate on one thing
do it and then plan
yeah
plan the next
because otherwise we just
and then write about it if we want to
yeah
so what we'll do quickly to write and inform them all that we're doing this stall and won't we
yes
we could even send them a recycling sheet
yeah
and the most recent newsletter
yeah
yeah
and a and a short letter i do don't know whether you said that
are you talking about this lot or
yeah
or that lot
sorry
yeah sorry i was also UNK we were talking about our own membership
talking about stortford
oh right
and we passed on
no i think they i mean
they complain they don't get any information
my first contacts with friends of the earth in this region sort of what six years ago was harlow
mm
and they were all enthusiastic and confident and
well what happened to them
and when there was another friend who was still over here at that time
and we went three times and they always planned and planned and planned and had ideas what they could do
and they never pulled round to actually doing it
no
properly
right
and i think the same happened as with us
they wrote letters and they did didn't have the energy
mm
to write again and again you know and you never get a positive answer clear answer first time round do you
mm
you have to write and write more details or put more pressure on and have more people write
but if you just write a single letter
yeah but you should
i know you two have been
yeah
mm
i'm used to it
i mean it UNK
didn't we have er a membership thing which said about erm membership form which actually explained what we did in if you want to join return this sort of thing
yeah
i've got loads of those
have you still got those
yes
i've got all those
we've still got those somewhere then
yeah
well i've go have got the
i don't think i don't know if i've got a master
but i know i've got lots that could be copied so we could send them out
well i've got the master still somewhere
well anyway it's something to bear in mind the fact that we've got that list anyway
erm
yeah how many
sort of what's the approximate number of people on it
i don't know
i'm not very good at UNK numbers
one two three four
oh and then there was there's it's not all harlow it's all just
yeah it's UNK valley
ya
this chris what was his name
i don't remember
i don't didn't even know his name was chris
don't you remember he then suggested th that walk along the UNK
i do yeah
i mean i'd forgotten all about him but i can remember
do you remember that
that was a really silly thing wasn't it
can i just have a look kath
yeah
he organized it all and then i think was it a week before he suddenly said well we can't possibly have two hundred people walking along a nature trail that we want to protect
and he was really of the illusion that there might be i think two hundred no six hundred people
two hundred people might turn up
turning up
in the end i think three people turned up
oh
it was it was no it was
this looks really interesting
get it
i had to write off
yeah
er it was a nice er display thing to show to show the kids when you do talks in schools
yeah
well i mean i'd certainly use it
is that greenpeace
yeah that's what i think is it's no
it's a resources pack
mm
it's his own is it
well he's obvious they've obviously the group has bought it and he's got it and he's gonna say do you want to buy
oh yeah
oh yeah
for ten instead of twenty
originally cost twenty pounds and we could get it for ten it's er
it's chris
it's erm living UNK resources pack
looks good doesn't it that i thought
erm with all sorts of po posters and teacher's notes and things
well i firmly believe in building up a library
so do i
good i'm glad
i mean there's
you said that because i w i want to buy a book
no library because i think er if you are contacted for information and you are able to say okay we have a book or we have books
yeah
that's one of the things i ke i've kept all my new scientists
i keep these
yeah
i go through them gonna UNK that cos there's loads of stuff in there good
yeah
but i do get quite a few people phone me as you know asking for information
i just photocopy relevant bits
none of none of them has got in contact with me
really
no
aren't they funny
i get the feeling
well i should give you er
that they either phone in
phone me and then get it all given to them just like that
that yeah
and no further effort involved cos
well i should i could
no it isn't
this woman who keeps phoning me up about all this oil pollution on her land
she
i sent i wrote off to friends of the earth i got a load of information all about the law and she still phones me up and say oh you know what the district council's they won't do anything and the n r a wasn't doing anything
and i said well when did you last contact them
february
apparently she's got a problem that the oil pollution is coming off this site where they're UNK the UNK
it's UNK on to her land and off her land and into the ditch which is you know the n r a
where is that
er UNK some way
you know where all those UNK are
and because the oil is coming to the ditch via her land they can't have a go at the primary source
this is what she said and i to me it doesn't sound right
she said UNK they all say they haven't got the power to UNK and i said well the n r a has
they've got more UNK than anybody else
mm
more UNK than the district council
and then she keeps saying but you know what these councils are like
and i said i'm not talking about the council i'm talking about the n r a
and now she wants me to find out how can er found out about a solicitor or somebody who UNK in this sort of thing
to take the district council to court
so that she's more expensive to them than this other lot will be
apparently they're causing quite te dreadful pollution
it's all this oil from the UNK on to her into her soil and out into the ditch
well
certainly is
but erm in the back of my mind there comes that she's saying to me don't get involved don't get involved
you know who owns all that land it's the UNK
and this could be why she's getting nowhere
you could give her er erm er UNK give her the address of friends of the earth london
oh she's already
that's how she got in contact with me
you see they refer everybody on and then i
well but they should give her a UNK the name of a solicitor
there must be green solicitors about
i have to write to them and ask them and about a month later they reply to me and i pass it on to her
because i don't know off hand
i've asked jeffrey to ask a friend about it who's a solicitor if he knows anybody but i c i can't i haven't got the in information
i don't
does anybody of you remember where friends of the earth england erm analyze their UNK
their income and their finance for the last year
i saw it somewhere and i got lost track of it
and i was UNK as to how much they spend on publicity
but i can't do anything with it because i lost the numbers
mm
i don't know i'll have a look
i don't remember seeing
the thing is this
does anybody of you seen that or remember
no
no
no
so are we saying yes to that
yeah
yeah
erm can i just ask you
does anybody wanna go on the energy campaign weekend
no thank you
and there's this book
which i think we might like to don't worry
erm energy without aids
which i think would be a good idea if we got it because i don't know about you but i'm always having arguments with people who say oh we can't have the whole country covered in UNK and
mm
things like that
they all think nuclear powers okay
so we really need to know our
what's the energy thing weekend just out of UNK
and
good
right
go on
i don't
i don't know these things
no
well you don't get them
i do and i feel obliged to pass it all on
i can't just sort of
no
but it i it's only six ninety five and i thought if we had you know a few facts at our UNK to say well that's all rubbish you know
so what is that
is that er booklet or something
it's a book
book
just talking about al you know alternative
on erm UNK yeah
energy really i think
yeah
because they keep saying oh what's gonna happen when the whole population of china wants a fridge and
mm god
i haven't got an answer for things like that
mm
there is no answer really
because want to catch up with us and we're already using too much energy
change your lifestyle
i just thought the more facts you've got at your UNK the more easy it is to persuade people
yeah if we've got some money we might as well spend it
yeah
yeah
okay
educate ourselves
an and the next day of action as i said before is on tropical UNK erm
connection with er tropical woods
oh we did actually do
november the ninth
for the architects
like hertfordshire architects
yeah
for example
do something basically have a
yes
UNK or ring them up or
they're a pretty depressed lot at the moment
yeah i bet they are
they have nothing to do
not much to look forward to so they'll probably like a bit of excitement
nothing to do
no i don't know what it's going to be about they haven't sent any information
it's just that er i've got the date
right
when they say
is it an action day
it's an action day
it's the next day of action and
what date
that's a saturday
what date
november the ninth
it's only just after the one world week thing
well it's october
well if i if i get
well it's only two week's after
yeah
and i don't know what it's going to be
you know which would recommend
yeah
this
i mean i have been into this window frame business
mm
because we have to have UNK and UNK soft wood
so anyway various companies wrote
well they do use tropical UNK wood but
yeah
it's government er schemes
yeah it's like some sort of erm okay
yeah
and i mean i have i remember that on some t v programmes they said it's all UNK
mm
i mean that it is not really government run er
they UNK it but what they UNK is UNK or
yeah palm erm they oil palm UNK
mm
mm
they just er
actually i've got a i've got a brilliant picture that i took outside the train
erm we were travelling through UNK and erm it's just one UNK tree standing on its own in the middle of nowhere
and there's all this sort of UNK
and it's obviously that one wasn't just didn't want it or it was dead or something and they just left it
mhm
and it's just the one
and then i've got all the pictures of all the logs on the train wagons and er that was really it was a it was a good picture actually cos i thought oh look at that poor old tree there it's
yeah
all its friends and then it was just standing there on the ground
but really it's completely it's completely wiped out UNK the whole of central UNK is just gone
and all the UNK cos it's sort of sand and it's red
and it goes into dust
so it goes everywhere so i mean there's gonna be trouble with that in the future
it's where they get all the flooding isn't it
oh yes
right
oh
okay
thanks
thank you very much
ladies and gentlemen we just before we get on with the second part of the meeting when erm meeting erm i think i ought to tell you that erm one of our committee members died a very short while back
i don't know how many of you knew him
and that was arthur UNK who died very suddenly
and the erm committee was represented at the funeral
and he'd been on our committee for i think it was about three years was that right
and erm he'd er contributed quite a lot and so we were very s it's a very sad loss
and erm anyway i'm sorry to have to tell you that but erm now we'll get on with the second half of the meeting
so brenda
thank you
well some of you have brought some erm interesting items along
haven't had time to look at them all
erm i'm not going to keep you very long because i've nearly finished talking so erm when i've finished perhaps you would like to bring some of your things up and put them on the table and we can all have a look at them
and let's make do and mend
UNK old UNK washed or UNK the UNK wool and UNK it
the tops of knitted socks with warm toes and UNK were UNK and UNK with UNK of UNK wool
the wool saved was used to knit new toes and UNK
the UNK of badly fitting or UNK were UNK and the garment washed and UNK
UNK wearing thin at the UNK were UNK
any spare balls of wool were UNK to make children's clothes or squares for UNK blankets
best way patterns produced some interesting variations on the knitted square
erm i found recently found a UNK pattern book and this is one of the pa the war time patterns they produced which is sort of shell shaped squares for UNK and it really looks very effective
i've got a knitting machine and i worked out how to do it on my knitting machine and made a UNK blanket for my UNK and it does really look very effective
so if anybody does UNK knitting or makes blankets or anything for charity and they'd like to give me a ring any time i could give you the pattern
UNK that were too worn or UNK to be UNK were cut up to make hats body UNK and bed socks to wear in the shelter
patterns also appeared for UNK and UNK
anyone who could hold a pair of knitting needles was expected to knit socks UNK and UNK for the fighting men
and here we have some of the erm patterns that appeared patterns for women in the services patterns for men and women there's the UNK
and this is a child's and UNK to make out of an old UNK
i think it looks rather UNK
sort of thing my mum used to make me and i hated
at the age of nine we the whole class knitted gloves for themselves
and i can still remember the pattern
i know how to do the same pattern
i remember a little boy i've got on a picture with me he was a very poor child and he made the best gloves in the class and it was a real sort of UNK for him
well we i remember about your age and having to knit sea boot stockings with very thick white wool
and knitting needles that to my little fingers were like rolling pins you know and they were long and they got under my arms and i always used to have a tummy UNK on knitting day cos i didn't want to go to school
so that was make do and mend knitting
the winter of nineteen forty was extremely bad in fact most people say that it was the worst winter of the war
people sleeping in UNK and UNK found them damp dark and cold
UNK tips in a december issue of woman's own suggested lighting a UNK inside an inverted flower pot and standing an UNK jug UNK of water on the top
this would take the UNK off the shelter and provide hot water for a cup of tea in the morning
other suggestions included using hot bricks as feet UNK and sewing newspaper inside your UNK
between september nineteen forty one and june nineteen forty two nearly two and a half million homes had been damaged or destroyed
sixty percent of the population of london alone were made homeless and during the war there were sixty million changes of address
at the height of the b one and b two attacks in nineteen forty four more than two hundred thousand homes per day were made UNK for UNK
erm this little map here shows a very small area of west ham where i lived
and all these little spots UNK some kind of bomb or UNK
and that is only within about two miles you know an area of about two miles square
so if you multiply that by the area of london plus all the other big cities that were damaged and the UNK
they still find them quite frequently don't they
mm
building si building developers and they sort of stop because they've found another UNK bomb
yes
i went to my old school in west ham recently to talk to the children there and er the master to me that they've got a bomb trail
and that's part of the geography
oh
their course
they walk round from the school and they've got a map of the places where the bombs dropped so
wh which school was that
this was home road school now UNK school
but it's been demolished this year
that's in UNK
and er erm they saw me on the you know television programme and they asked me to go to the school and
oh yes
talk to them about er pre war period there and er i very much enjoyed it
i got a lot of letters from the children there and which was very UNK
the only difference they were very well written but they were signed you know UNK and which were names i used to go there
i started nineteen eighteen
yes it's the s same school in west ham that i went to too
i don't know whether other places have erm kept that as a part of the i don't know if it's in the national curriculum
yes
any well you'll be interested in there i've got my own personal bombs on there
the one that damaged the house in which we lived
between erm oh by the end of the war one in every three dwellings had been demolished
millions of people throughout the country lived in buildings which were either due for UNK because they were unsafe or had received only emergency repairs
heating then was difficult UNK to fuel rationing and UNK supplies of gas electricity and water
washing and cleaning also caused major problems as soap was rationed UNK powder in short supply and UNK and UNK were no longer being manufactured
UNK were mixed with UNK agents to make them go further and pot UNK were made from old silk stockings UNK into squares
a mixture of UNK tea leaves and UNK was used for washing floors and UNK
UNK of soap were saved UNK with a little oil and water and pressed into a block
and i had a catalogue the other day from a an environmental erm agency it wasn't greenpeace it was something like that were ac actually now offering these soap UNK that we used to have in the war to press your bits of soap into magazines were full of tips for saving fuel
UNK would give out more light if they were washed every week in UNK water
water tanks and pipes should be UNK with whatever material was available
coal dust should be collected up into strong brown bags UNK down and used as coal
tin cans filled with a mixture of old tea leaves and coal dust gave a lovely UNK and plenty of heat
further economies could be made by using as few rooms as possible
single people or couples living alone were encouraged to join a UNK pool saving fuel by UNK and take it in turns to cook meals for other people in the group
only five inches of water was allowed for baths
in nineteen forty two the lady UNK announced that the president of the board of trade had cut his large bath UNK in half and he hoped his sacrifice would be repeated all over the country
wasn't much fun either
what about the british restaurant brenda
yes that was that was right erm there was a limit to how much you could spend as well wasn't there
five shillings wasn't it that you could no meals allowed if you ate out you weren't allowed to spend more than five shillings
and the british restaurant was one and six wasn't it
you could have a complete meal for one and sixpence
and that wasn't on UNK was it
no
you had to have what they gave you and it was pretty UNK from what i remember
do you remember tommy UNK though er comment
he goes into a restaurant and he says oh the UNK erm let me see the menu and he looks at the menu and said right he said
the UNK said no all off oh send me the usual UNK
which is what often happened
all you could get would be UNK
well i remember once going into er a british restaurant because it was my birthday and there was UNK on the menu and UNK was some sort of weird UNK thing that was thi instead of UNK it was UNK bread and i think it was sort of UNK apple and mock cream but the fact that it was my birthday and it was UNK you know i just sort of sat there like a queen but i think i'm sure that it UNK quite UNK
it looked horrible
and there used to be sort of a UNK made from UNK beans too that people said were baked beans and they weren't it was just sort of white UNK erm white UNK beans with a sort of red colouring poured over the top
but i think you could you could have whatever you could eat for one and sixpence in the in the british restaurant
excuse me i've got not exactly hay fever but i think i'm going to be UNK for a few minutes
going back to the UNK when we were bombed out we erm had to during the day we lived in my UNK house mother and father and me
so we had the dining room and a lounge
and at night our bedroom was the UNK of UNK dogs st UNK
underneath the UNK
oh
so i've often wondered how safe that was
i don't think it was full
but it felt good
i mean there was a lot of concrete in it
oh we went i remember
so we all walked down the corner there we all had our beds round there everything was laid out
buildings
people used the underground and of course there were the there were the erm UNK weren't there that you had UNK
well if anybody wants to see one i've still got my UNK shelter
well it's got all the basic structure and half the top so if anyone's interested in seeing shelter i've got
UNK you got that
in my garage
it's a marvellous work bench cos it's very
oh is that what you use it for
we have used it in anger oh yes
it was used in anger because we were living near UNK when the v one was over the UNK and er they UNK er one of these UNK just near our house you see
and er one or two got caught up occasionally now and then so we did erm have to go underneath because i was earning too much to get a free one it cost me seven pounds ten and i've got the receipt for it
it is really my own it wasn't given by the government i paid for it
so i justify that one
i think
britain directed more of her resources towards the war effort than any other nation including germany
recycling of waste was essential and it was the UNK job another job for her to UNK from her home such things as paper bones tin cans old gramophone records photographs and negatives jam UNK rubber and UNK
each category had to be put in a different container and taken to a collection centre
and here we've got the pig club and the pig bin with its pig food
have you heard of the tottenham pudding
tottenham pudding
there was a campaign after the war to bring back tottenham UNK they had somebody in harlow who was
well what was what was tottenham pudding then
tottenham pudding was a er a mixture to for feeding animals
oh
which was collected and
pigs particularly wasn't it
pigs yes
and er the it was a sort of for i remember erm only a few years ago in harlow we had a discussion group there was somebody there and i think i've still got the piece about that
they erm wanted to bring it back cos they thought that this was excellent all this erm purpose erm nowadays
yes well l think i think so too
that's how UNK brothers started out wasn't it
they used to collect the tottenham pudding
well they my parents used to have it you see cos they kept pigs
that's it
and it was UNK who used to bring round tottenham pudding
used to get deliveries of it for the pigs that's how they started up
they used to bring it round in metal things
bring back tottenham UNK
and my dad had you know the stuff he used to find in it UNK all the tea UNK and plates and everything else
it was it was used to be stuff from these UNK and they weren't particular what they threw in it was all these knives and things
but we used to have these bins at the end of each road and we used to have to put any scrap or unwanted food in
and then we had this pig woman who erm who wore men's clothes and a big cap and she had a horse and cart
and she used to come round at night and collect this stuff
and it used to smell UNK
i think probably that was probably london but in the north i lived on the north east coast in a very small town and some of i mean my memories are quite different in a way
i mean i remember the waste paper which was organized by the girl guides and the boy scouts in the town
erm very much that was the whole sunday
yeah
yeah well as i say i lived in the east end of london and that that's how it was done there but i dare say that other places organized it
it probably wasn't economic in the very small town you know probably you know i don't i don't remember people keeping pigs but if it was collected it probably was collected by the bin at the back door
yeah
well it was understood that UNK got most of theirs from UNK and all UNK i think had to sort of hand over all their waste for the war or something
that's what my i say my father bred er pigs and supplied the ministry of food and i can remember that he had a contract to collect all the erm waste from schools in the area
but erm they say that he had used to go and collect it and that was what was fed to the pigs
so as regards waste material fifteen tons of scrap metal would make one medium sized tank or two UNK
from nineteen forty a compulsory campaign deprived public parks gardens and squares of their UNK and private homes of their front gates and UNK
all aluminium UNK including those from UNK palace here collected in july nineteen forty but unfortunately it was not of the right grade and so housewives then suffered for the rest of the war and having to cook with inferior pans
after UNK entry into the war all UNK of rubber from the far east were suspended
woman's own produced a rubber UNK which sounds rather UNK to encourage its readers to part with their old rubber UNK
i don't know if any of you are old enough to remember the sort of rubber UNK that were worn in those days
erm those of you who had mothers who were young in the twenties will probably recall seeing them because they were rather UNK almost like a rubber tube with small holes UNK in for circulation
and they were the sort of UNK that gave you the straight UNK look that was necessary for the clothes of the twenties and the early thirties which were cut on the cross
and so a lot of women continued to wear these erm rubber garments
in fact on erm on one of the erm sheets that i've brought up there's a notice of how to repair them with bits of cycle inner tube
so the erm woman's own rubber UNK erm begins UNK for the runs and i UNK for the runs in your UNK
may i suggest if the thing is worn out it will help us to jump the last hurdle
paper was collected in every form
it was desperately needed
in the first months of the war UNK had UNK thousands of UNK for emergency use in bombing raids on london alone
one hundred tons of paper was needed in the planning and construction of a battle ship
magazines and newspapers reduced the size and number of their pages cinema theatre bus tram and train tickets became small and UNK
used envelopes were recycled using stick on economy labels
bank statements cheque book UNK and private receipts could be returned to banks for UNK
and interesting but only interesting UNK could be taken to the post office for distribution to the armed forces
non fiction books and sheet music went for UNK
very little UNK paper or other packaging was allowed and paper bags and clean newspapers were carefully saved for shopping trips
newspapers were also cut into squares and used for toilet paper
butter and UNK papers were kept for UNK and lining cake tins etcetera and i still do it
and i still fold up my paper bags
UNK were more difficult to collect as housewives were putting scrap material to so many other uses
we're wearing them one housewife UNK
this comment was not entirely UNK and this brings us back to the remarks i made earlier about erm the use of UNK and the government trying to persuade women to erm use internal UNK protection
because of the shortage of raw materials the government was running a propaganda campaign to persuade women to wear UNK during UNK
UNK advertised a trial offer of two UNK in a box with an explanatory leaflet
now the reason that erm they were trying to promote the use of UNK was that one couldn't get cotton to make cotton wool and so it wasn't possible any erm er erm UNK garments that were made of cotton were UNK and used for people in essential war work or the armed forces
and so there was this campaign to persuade women to change
women who preferred who preferred traditional methods of UNK protection either had to stand in long UNK in order to buy just one or two UNK you couldn't even buy a packet you could just buy one or two or make do with other methods
one of the most common particularly in low UNK economic groups was squares of UNK an rag which could be UNK boiled and re used
but when the make do and mend clubs were told that even worn out soft UNK and shirt UNK would make maps for tank UNK they responded well and over a thousand tons of rag was collected between nineteen forty two and nineteen forty three
bones were used for making UNK glue and paint for aeroplane mark markings and proved the most difficult of all to collect
the ministry of supply asked for any kind of bone except the UNK of a UNK
housewives were told to hand them in after they had been used in the stock pot and fed to the dog after which the bones were to be washed and dried in the oven after the gas and electricity had been turned off
then they were to be put in a tin or other suitable container
in november nineteen thirty nine the national savings campaign was set up
it was estimated that in august nineteen forty the war was costing between six and seven million pounds a day and that a great proportion of it must come from the savings of the people
savings groups were formed all over the country and children ran their own campaigns in schools
there were also special savings weeks
by nineteen forty three individuals were putting aside almost one quarter of their UNK incomes
but it was always UNK to UNK in whatever small UNK were available and people were constantly warned to be aware of the UNK
there he is up there wanted for UNK
he was a UNK little UNK like UNK and he had a big UNK on his stomach
and he was always persuading people to spend more money
you see there he is telling this lady don't listen to her she runs a savings group the UNK works for hitler
the UNK pal known to be at large in certain parts of the kingdom
so you had to be careful of him
so world war two ended with the surrender of japan on the twelfth of december nineteen forty five
on the home front it was time to make new plans fo r the future
but for some people the UNK period which followed brought it even more years of deprivation and hardship than those of the war
they were UNK cold UNK resulting in fuel restrictions and cuts in gas and electricity supplies
some new foods were introduced including UNK a fish product from south africa and whale meat
but in nineteen forty nine there was less meat available than in nineteen forty four
bread was rationed in nineteen forty six and food and clothes rationing continued like make do and mend until well into the nineteen fifties
i conclude
went through all the all the motions of bread rationing but the last time er they cancelled it
did they
so bread wasn't rationed although everybody er was allocated a bread ration
there was an allocation yes
according where you although it didn't actually come into practice
you didn't have UNK
no
unless anybody else can confirm that
it got right near it but erm
finally there's just the there's the famous dig for victory poster and er is your journey really necessary
and erm watch it all the things that one had to do to one's car if one was able to use a car in the UNK
well thank you very much
i was in the army and you were thinking of a different country
cos i was in the army we had good food and were away from all the bombing
UNK
and we went to UNK of all places and you could go to the UNK and get fish and chips and everything
it was a different war from what you're talking about
yes
several people were called up er they were they were given a white UNK were given a white UNK for exactly the reason that you mentioned
so they were going to have an easy time
if you were in london erm you were called up give gave you gave you a white UNK cos you were going in the army
i missed most of the first war with him actually
we didn't know it but we were together
UNK
i was up at UNK when liverpool got it
i was at liverpool in nineteen er forty one may
er at wood er lord wood lord wood you know the pie p person
UNK
yes lord UNK his home er when liverpool got bombed and the ship went up
and all we got was we slept through that
and then we came down to UNK and felixstowe when london so
you know when people talk about the war we feel dreadful
well there was one sad part wasn't it that when i was on my in training during the and the UNK and so in classrooms and had a lecturer talking to us and erm this lad come in with a message from the UNK and erm give it to the UNK and he'd call a name and the chap would go out
pretty horrible
yes
somebody from london that'd lost their family
yes but it was it was just like that when one went to school
and you went to school in the morning but never knew whether your house was going to be there when you got home for dinner or whether you'd still have a mum and dad and
i got er two letters actually
i got a letter to say dad was in hospital and we had a buzz bomb and it wasn't too bad and er don't worry
and i god so i UNK round got a long weekend it turned out to be marvellous
came home and she said well what have you come home for
says well dad's in hospital
yes he had tummy trouble
and the first letter told me that he'd got stomach upset
the second letter told me so i thought they'd been bombed out
er one of my worst experiences actually was going to school and found that when we walk when i went into the classroom there was only me and two other children
and the rest of the children had been killed in the night
they all lived in a small area that had been completely bombed
they were just three of us
no that was in erm near the docks erm in west ham UNK way yes
yes
the UNK road is er is er three hundred and fifty people
yes
children erm
you might like to look at the erm the west ham bombing map
well i'm afraid ladies and gentlemen we're going to have to stop now rather UNK
thank you very much really interesting
thank you
and it's very interesting UNK from people in the audience
thank you very much indeed
and i'll see you again
ok can i draw to some sorry
i take it as a last question comment
angela i'd like i'd just like to ask if we could have a meeting about the future of the gallery
yes
and i'd like art teacher's in all the school's all around not just harlow but UNK all around UNK to be asked i'd like artists to be asked from all around erm essex has a directory of artists eastern arts has a directory of artists i think you could probably find quite a lot of people
i don't think we're very well represented here tonight and i think there's a lot of not well used a terrible waste of space
and we need to say that you know i don't think that it's criminal to have a gallery but it's criminal to waste the space some of the time
yeah we'll look at that yeah that's sort of
can i just say before you close is a you out a hand out before everybody was here can some more of those be run off with a questionnaire
perhaps i should mention now i mean i i'm not fill in UNK but it would it would be helpful if you actually did erm fill in that before you actually leave this evening and leave it on the on the table on the way out if that's possible i think that information which you put on them would be useful
can i just say a conclusion i'm not sure how you feel how the meeting's gone this evening i think it's been very positive meeting at least people have actually said what there concerns are and actually raised eh some of the issues
i also give a guarantee that it isn't just a one off situation meeting we all go away and forget about what we've said i can assure you that won't happen minutes have been taken and what's been said this evening that will be UNK to the management committee meeting the board meeting and i think we need to look very clearly at a very closely what's been said and respond to what's been said and i think that it's been suggested also raised this evening about having a further meeting to report back and say erm this has been said this is our response
i think that will happen also
i hope you've found the meeting this evening positive i'm sure you haven't heard perhaps if the people found after the this evening and the guy up there UNK we ought to retire well i don't think we will retire but i think we will be responding to the things that you raised this evening i happen to think the harlow theatre i'm not sure how you measure success erm i think we measure it's success in the fact that people actually do use the building people do come to see the shows
i am aware of the difficult times that other theatre companies who actually face in this moment in time and i am very grateful when i and i've always been grateful to the harlow council for the funding of the council has given to the theatre has given to the theatre over the years
it's interesting that erm many been said many of the other local authorities in the area certainly don't produce or put on as what harlow council does they certainly don't from the arts like harlow council does and i think we have all got a UNK to the council even in difficult times the money spends on the arts
the council looking at the whole process of how it spends it money what it does i think the theatre the start of this evening we were looking quite close about what we do and how we do it what we don't do and what we should do and i think from what's been said this evening will be re look closely the questions you've raised things that you've raised we'll report it back to you in the hope of this meeting that we'll actually moved forward because i think it's in everybody interest everybody's interest if the playhouse closes
the playhouse in the harlow is about the people in harlow and about the people that come in from outside of harlow i'm very conscious that we do serve a very wide community and i am pleased that people with other sounds come and support the theatre has been rightly said if they didn't come in to harlow to support the theatre we would have major problems
so could i just in conclusion say please fill in your short questionnaire thank you for your attendance and i can assure you as chairman of the trust what you said and the UNK you've raised this evening will be looked at in great detail and we will be reporting back to you in the near future about the proposals that we wish to make
thank you
introduce brenda who's going to speak to us on make do and mend and she's asked me to say that she'd be very pleased if people break in or erm sort of form some sort of dialogue with her as she goes along
if they've got anything that they wish to say or any personal UNK
so don't be afraid to interrupt her
and erm i'd also like to introduce keith UNK from the longman spoken corpus who's going to be recording our meeting
erm and if you this is for the longman UNK spoken corpus project
and he will if you'd like to come along and speak to him individually afterwards he will tell you something about that
right so i'd like to introduce brenda ladies and gentleman
and er she's oh sorry
sorry i thought i'd disturb
anyway brenda
yes sure
and i'm going to talk about and make do and mend in the second world war
erm and as you'll be able to see from my introduction make do and mend wasn't something that suddenly happened in nineteen thirty nine there were sections of society in which make do and mend was a permanent and not particularly erm welcome fact of life
although the period between nineteen thirty nine and forty five seems to me and people of my generation to have been only yesterday
we are actually talking of events which happened over half a century ago
doesn't it make us feel terribly old when we think of that
we tend to think UNK of john UNK pre war UNK of happy UNK families of UNK farmer's wives with a UNK supply of UNK baked bread new laid eggs UNK jam and UNK cream
of the comfortable UNK of large estates providing long and useful employment for their servants
and an UNK and UNK working class supporting and supported by an extended family network
it was in fact a time when even just prior to the war many families had neither gas nor electricity to heat and light their homes or basic public services such as running water for drinking and other purposes
there was in many urban and rural areas extreme poverty due to unemployment bad working conditions poor housing inadequate diet and UNK ill health
and for many people make do and mend was always a harsh reality
well if you remember that the UNK and the general strike weren't very many years erm you know be behind the UNK that were going on for the second world war
even in the more UNK homes labour saving devices we take for granted today either didn't exist or were an expensive luxury
routine household UNK like washing cleaning cooking sewing and UNK were often done by women and girls employed as resident domestic servants
or UNK who were expected to know how to perform them to very UNK standards for very low wages
in my own family my mum and my aunt went into service you know when they were about thirteen and they used to do the most UNK jobs for next to nothing
we used we used to have someone who we used to know who'd been in one of the big houses
and erm she you know she found it and she really enjoyed it
yeah
because i think she probably depended what sort of house household you were in
yeah
and what i from what i gather the bigger the household that people were in the more they enjoyed it cos the jobs were shared out more
but often the when they were in small houses where they had to do everything erm they tended to find that they were they were expected to sort of UNK much more
well i was in the east end and of course where my mum and my aunt worked it was mostly sort of cleaning and UNK and UNK and turning UNK in the back garden and all sorts of things
mhm
war was officially declared on the third of september nineteen thirty nine although UNK for it had begun as UNK
i worked for a UNK company
yes
at that time and erm we had a lot of german UNK and cameras in museum before september the third on september the fourth when i got to work they were all out
you had to put them all away
they were all being no they were all being taken apart
oh
and studied and er so that we could copy their
oh i see
their which of course had er ceased to exist
in the shops things were much as usual because UNK and suppliers were still using existing stocks
to the majority of women the fact that the famous UNK fashion houses had closed that silk stockings and imported luxury goods were more expensive and more difficult to obtain meant very little
the major impact was the break up of the family unit
apart from worry about the safety of their nearest and UNK what concerned them most was that with the main UNK away children still had to be fed and UNK and household expenses met
worry was considered by woman's magazine to be the main cause of an UNK appearance
and in november nineteen thirty nine the editor wrote anxiety is a dreadful UNK of UNK
no man wants to come home from the war to a wife or UNK who shows in her face how much she has worried about him
wash away UNK of tears with warm weak tea
a secret which saw our mothers through many a crisis
well erm this anxiety UNK erm dominated much of the printed material in women's magazines
erm you can see in these particularly you can look at them later on
no off days now she must carry on
erm winning the war of freedom winning the war with freedom nervous strain wore out worn out with war worry
so th people were most concerned that women's morale should be kept up and that one should shouldn't worry too much
and there were and erm i hope this isn't too embarrassing for the male members of the audience
erm lots of advertisements produced by UNK erm about worry and off days and this was because during that time UNK was one of these taboo subjects that people didn't talk about
and many women actually did take to their beds when they were UNK and erm sort of retired from active life and this wasn't possible then because so many women had been called up you know and they had to be in the army or they had to work in factories and it wasn't possible for them to be absent
and so there was this sort of propaganda campaign that was done through advertising to insist that women shouldn't have off days any more
and erm UNK were involved for another reason which i will explain later
erm the advertisements themselves called a great caused a great UNK because erm UNK was a fairly new UNK and because of the sexual and social UNK of the time they weren't considered very nice
and erm so that the campaign was working on two levels one to persuade women that they didn't have to take time off from working in factories at certain times of the month and another to persuade women to use erm internal UNK protection and as i said i will explain why later it comes into another section
by the first months of nineteen forty one there were ten thousand women in the armed services
and all single or UNK women between twenty and thirty were liable to be directed to essential war work of some kind as we can see here erm com coming to the factories erm there's a woman there driving a tank another one on er a UNK a gun sight
erm some in the armed forces working in factories a r p
so i don't know if any of you are old enough to have worked in factories or have been in any in the services
well i was an a r p warden during the war
at the age of sixteen cos there was hardly anybody else at the place where i lived so it went down to sixteen year olds
yes
and my sister in law who erm my eldest brother was a lot older than me
i was six when the war started
and she actually took me on this war work
and took me away
yes
and erm that was considered
yes if you looked after a child
yes a child
yes
and then when she came back and i was returned she actually went into a factory then
yes
but she was a UNK by profession
er but then she worked went to work in a UNK factory in UNK and she had a marvellous time
by the end of nineteen forty two nearly three million married women or UNK were so employed
looking UNK and attractive was no longer a domestic issue but a matter of vital national importance
it was a duty and i just have to take this one down
you'll have to excuse this picking up and putting down of papers
here we see an advertisement for UNK make up
beauty is your duty no surrender by UNK
erm figure precautions by UNK manufacturers of UNK
and erm fire fighting but her UNK is perfect home front hands can still be UNK for beauty on duty now foundation garments were considered to be an essential part of the trim active image which it was every woman's duty to project
so you mustn't not only mustn't you worry you've got to be perfectly made up and have a super figure you know while you're making tanks or whatever
erm a UNK and i've got a this is one of the UNK di
don't you think that a lot of the advertisements are just like advertising today wanting to sell the garments
yes
rather i don't think the advertising industry had such a strong sense of duty but i assume
oh no they were
they just wanted to sell their stuff
yes
i think
but also of course there was this propaganda from the government you know that erm they'd just got to keep up morale and this was one way as you will see in a minute of how they did it
even the government realized the importance of UNK in keeping up morale amongst women workers
propaganda posters instructed them to put your best face forward
and in august nineteen forty two the ministry of supply issued royal UNK factory workers a special supply of high grade make up and a booklet entitled look to your looks
women's magazines were full of ideas on how to make the best of one's appearance in spite of the UNK supplies of make up available in the shops
woman's own march the seventh nineteen forty wrote do remember that when he in capital letters comes back he will want to kiss the hands that have worked for him and all our brave men
it will be easy enough to UNK them with some milk of UNK the night before he comes home
UNK were mixed with oil or cream to extend their life or to make UNK
black boot polish was used instead of UNK sore eyes and tired skin UNK with UNK skins and of course plenty of raw fruit and vegetables for inner UNK
once they'd done with our figures and our faces then we'd got to look for our UNK and so we had to have inner UNK
in nineteen forty one the use of silk stockings was banned and by nineteen forty two all hosiery was rationed to members of the public
advise was given on how to colour the legs with substances such as cold tea coffee UNK cocoa powder etcetera with the UNK drawn in with pencil UNK or burnt wood or UNK
i remember having to do that for my mum
she stood on a chair and i used to have to draw the lines round the back of her legs with a pencil
and there's an advertisement here for UNK stocking cream for people who could afford it
there it is in a beautiful presentation box
as the war progressed beauty products became virtually UNK and a healthy mind and body were considered to be more of an asset to the war office to the war effort than a pretty face and soft skin
women and beauty in april nineteen forty three wrote there is a special kind of beauty preparation that can't be bought in a single shop in the world because you must make it yourself from spirit heart and simple courage and you make it fresh each day
war time health propaganda from the ministry of food told women through an article in woman's own nineteen forty one you've got to look lovely for his leave
do eat for beauty
liver is your meat
it isn't rationed either
oh now we come to some advertisements about food
erm somebody's got some books here that er we can look at
we were we were instructed to dig for victory and so we've got er erm a gardening guide and a book that i've also got called we'll eat again which is full of war time UNK
and you might like to look at these later these later
and erm some immediately post war recipe books and i'm sure you know if you'd like to look at them after i've finished talking you might even remember some of the er the er
my wife still uses the
so do i
you referred to the fact of erm er items that weren't on the on the UNK such as liver
yes
of course you had to get them
yes of course
and we had a during the periods you mentioned we had er lived in a village and we had a very honest er grocer
who one day we thought well about time we had something so i think we said to him er about these things off the ration can't get what happens to them
well we have them he said
and i think that shows that er you know the distribution of er non rationed food was not quite what
well it was the black market as well wasn't there
yes
i was going to say there was a UNK black market wasn't
yes
yes
yes i can remember as a child my UNK erm family all lived in the east end and i can remember that the you know on the occasions that they used to come down and see us there was always tins of fruit and all sorts of
yeah
UNK that they'd got because they all worked in the docks
we used to look forward to them coming
fell off a UNK did it
certainly all over rural essex everybody was killing pigs and everything UNK
yeah well you were you were allowed actually later on to
you could kill a pig if you kept you kept half of it and gave
that's right yes
for your own consumption but there was a lot of people doing it as erm UNK
UNK
yeah
well food rationing began in january nineteen forty and i'm sure you're all familiar with ration books
i'll pass them round
you can give them back to me
i've got one nineteen eighteen
oh ooh
er you can give them back to me afterwards
have you ever seen a ration book
no
did they have blue ones for children
yes
or green
can't remember what colour mine was
i don't think i ever saw it
well by nineteen forty two rationing had been extended to include most UNK except fresh fruit and vegetables
rationing or quota systems were later to extend to include soap and soap products fuel clothing and most dress and UNK fabric
furniture and UNK was supplied on a UNK application system
nineteen forty one was the poorest year for food production
the nation could no longer support the expense of feeding UNK
and farmers had to grow more UNK and UNK
everyone who had even the UNK piece of spare ground was encouraged to grow UNK vegetables and fruit and to dig for victory
it was to the women's UNK that the government turned to organize UNK preservation of home grown produce throughout the land
this was backed up by articles in magazines and newspapers showing the housewife how to preserve fruit salt beans make UNK and UNK
store root vegetables in sand and dry fruits such as apples and UNK
i remember my mother having erm pieces of wood with apples rings on that used to be dried in the oven
surplus eggs could be UNK in UNK or water glass
in their december nineteen forty one issue of home and country magazine the institute reported that two thousand six hundred and fifty preserving centres had been opened
and over one thousand pounds of fruit had been saved
and the demand for jam UNK had been so great that even UNK and UNK had been UNK for extra supplies
i can just imagine women's institute ladies creeping out in the night to pinch jam UNK from UNK
one of the things that was popular was that the smaller things like rabbit clubs when people could then get food for them officially if they did that
erm yes
i remember one of my UNK was belonged to one
and didn't really know anything about rabbits and i know my aunt it's a sort of family story that she took her UNK to the UNK and the UNK had babies
that's the sort of thing that the government encouraged
that's right
yes groups yes
women who made their own UNK were able to obtain extra sugar in UNK of their jam ration
and those who couldn't obtain fresh fruit UNK vegetables producing UNK and UNK jam
UNK with UNK or UNK and UNK honey
we we've got most of those UNK here erm in my book
there was even a recipe for lemon UNK using UNK but no eggs or UNK
goodness know what that UNK like
we used to do erm we used to have erm a girl at school when i was at school in east london UNK erm who used to bring mock UNK sandwiches and that was made with UNK and erm some sort of erm UNK essence
yeah
and erm they UNK i mean we all used to have a taste of it and it UNK quite nice
well i
with UNK
yes well in the east end you bananas probably weren't very UNK and that was the poorer people anyway
nobody had bananas first bananas came in about forty five
came a long way didn't they
one of these ships UNK isn't it
cos one of them brought bananas in
so we have erm UNK here for UNK without sugar
UNK sausages
UNK pie the UNK pie
erm UNK potato cakes lots of potato UNK
UNK
the government issued food UNK in newspapers and magazines and on radio to teach the UNK of food UNK
and as we said before erm many of the erm people who lived in the poorer parts of erm the country whether in urban or rural en erm england didn't really know about basic UNK and health i mean you just ate what was available but you didn't know why and so the government started this campaign to introduce you know knowledge about diet and how important it was
UNK
there was a little poem i don't know why i remember it but it was if you have the will to win cook potatoes in their skin
for the very sight of UNK deeply hurts lord UNK feelings
there's just there's a potato pete poem up there somewhere actually
potatoes became the basis of practically every meal
they were UNK and used to UNK and UNK and potato water UNK and UNK
UNK and UNK were UNK for sugar
posters showing pot potato pete and his UNK became household UNK
erm there's potato pete and there's UNK and there's potato pete again
oh yes here's the song of potato pete potatoes new potatoes old potatoes in a UNK cold potatoes baked or UNK or UNK potatoes whole potatoes UNK
enjoy them all including chips remembering UNK don't come on ships
flour for domestic use was home produced and much heavier in texture than that UNK from imported canadian me wheat which was banned in nineteen forty two
it needed more liquid a strong raising agent and longer cooking
nevertheless UNK for UNK cakes sweet and UNK and biscuits
the national loaf was rather an UNK grey colour i don't know if anybody remember the national loaf
and it was UNK
people complained that it UNK badly and couldn't be cut into thin UNK so woman's own recommended that the bread knife should be UNK in boiling water in between cutting each slice
unfortunately a diet high in UNK meant that some women not only put on weight but also stopped wearing their UNK
which caused a lot of trouble particularly in the lady magazine
and woman's own
they were strongly UNK by woman's own whose editor made the strange assumption that large hips were UNK with big feet and she said the well UNK woman has a good figure that will last her for life and feet many times smaller than those of the UNK
well that put you in your place if you ate too many potatoes
with UNK entry int o the war some foods were imported under the lease lend agreement
these included UNK products dried UNK beans baked beans dried eggs which were very popular and UNK pressed UNK of vague origins UNK and UNK somebody's UNK there do you remember those which could be eaten cold or cooked in various ways
UNK yes
and UNK and baked UNK sandwiches were another favourite
in our erm canteen at work until quite recently used to do UNK
mhm
i mean they're not they haven't sort of died out
no
they were very great UNK at school UNK weren't they
that's right
one of their most useful features was the thick layer of pure white fat with which they were UNK when you took it out of the tin there was this layer of fat round the edge
it could be UNK off and used for UNK and baking
and dried egg was very versatile
one UNK full of powder mixed with two of water was the equivalent of one average sized whole egg
well i've recently seen that they've started selling it in UNK again
i haven't i haven't bought it but i've seen it
i think it was since the UNK scare some time ago
to UNK out the small meat ration people formed pig clubs which is what you were talking about
they would group together to buy a pig to feed UNK and slaughter
they were allowed to keep the head UNK and a proportion of the meat
the rest was retained by the ministry of food
pig bins were provided in each road in urban areas for household waste and these would be collected usually by a pig woman with a horse and cart
the pig feeding scheme was so successful that even with rationing the amount of bacon UNK in nineteen forty one was greater than the annual pre war consumption per head
it was expensive however and a cheaper substitute was available called UNK made from pressed UNK
sea food became UNK as fishing was UNK and most of the UNK were UNK
UNK salt UNK was cheap but transport and storage facilities were so UNK that it was often rotten by the time it reached the housewife
UNK were only UNK on the points system
some canadian UNK salmon did reach the shops but it was very expensive
fresh salmon and UNK fish were not rationed but were price fixed and like game and poultry usually became part of the black economy
preparing good UNK family meals was made even more difficult when in nineteen forty housewives were asked to contribute cooking UNK for the UNK into UNK campaign
in nineteen forty three the board of trade produced the UNK
the UNK was erm a UNK a thing like a UNK with a kettle that fitted on to the top so that you could boil your vegetables in the UNK and boil the kettle at the same time
the lid the lid of the UNK became the kettle
but UNK housewives already had a far superior version
a UNK was put to cook in a UNK on top of which was a UNK where a pudding wrapped in a cloth was UNK
this was covered by a UNK tin lid on top of which was a kettle filled with water for an after dinner cup of tea and the washing up
one woman wrote to woman's own describing how she fitted her garden UNK lined with a piece of clean rag into the top of her copper
and she was able to steam a complete meal while the washing was boiling
in nineteen forty one on june the first clothes rationing began and for that year twenty UNK were issued
the amount of UNK needed for each garment depended on the amount of material and labour involved in its manufacture
in nineteen forty two the board of trade introduced utility clothes recognized by the symbol UNK forty one
here we are
i'm still using UNK with that mark on
i've still got a UNK
not from the first world war
no not from
this UNK the two UNK was an UNK for civil clothes nineteen forty one
eight top UNK were asked to submit designs for four basic items
a coat suit winter dress and cotton house dress
each garment had to conform to regulations on UNK and use of approved materials
restrictions were placed on the number of UNK and buttons on new garments
the width of UNK the depths of UNK
UNK were banned and the utility range was later extended to include clothing for men and children
these are two of the utility garments
this was a sort of a battle can you see a UNK jacket
and a plain skirt and a coat and a UNK suit
and um if you'd like to have a look at this book utility furniture and fashion later you can see some more utility clothes
on the fifth of september nineteen thirty nine a control of timber ordered was made by the ministry of supply followed by controls on all raw materials used by the furniture industry and allied trades
furniture manufacturers could only operate under licence to the government and most of their products were designated for the defence of the realm
by july nineteen forty timber supplies for the home market were withdrawn completely
and that ma of course erm posed problems for people just getting married or setting up home or people who had lost their homes due to bombing
after the UNK on london in september nineteen forty the government introduced a scheme whereby payments for damage to the furniture of persons earning less than four hundred pounds a year would be made up to one hundred percent of the damage
four hundred pounds a year then was quite a lot of money
the result was an UNK demand for second hand furniture the price of which quickly rose to UNK levels on the black market
by the end of the year the government was forced to change the situation and announced it would produce a range of standard emergency furniture for bombed persons
basically it UNK that issued to hospitals UNK and similar institutions
once again women's magazines offered advice
UNK the legs of that ugly iron UNK off the top and bottom rails and send them for UNK
you'd still got to look beautiful and have your UNK on and not look worried while you're doing all this UNK
the result will be a low modern UNK
and they also said that UNK pretty results can be UNK with UNK furniture when painted in UNK colours
in nineteen forty two a range of utility furniture was produced UNK twenty two articles in two qualities and three designs each UNK to UNK criteria
there are some utility furniture designs up here
in fact i think you can probably still pick them up in antique shops and second hand shops and probably a lot of people have still got some
in the beginning priority was given to those setting up home for the first time families with young children and people who had lost their homes and furniture through enemy action
the furniture was well designed and proved very popular
other ranges and designs were introduced to cope with even heavier demands and with minor amendments utility furniture was still being produced at the time of the festival of britain in nineteen fifty one
utility UNK and UNK were also produced to UNK the furniture
these are two designs i you probably all recognized them when you see them they were very popular
can you all see
yes it was it was a very UNK fabric and if you'd got animals they te it tended to UNK
the designs had to be small to avoid UNK in matching
and only four colours or UNK of four colours rust blue green and natural were allowed
good housekeeping gave advice on home decorating
you must keep to light plain colours
UNK light blue or green or pale UNK
very sound advice because these were the only colours available anyway
it wasn't possible to buy wallpaper but very UNK effects were achieved with government issue UNK by using bi colour techniques of UNK and UNK which are now popular again
i remember curtains erm UNK curtains my mother made
and she died them pink and she i can't remember what i think it was some sort of erm cooking net that she bought
it wasn't real UNK but she made it out of this material
and she made a UNK and she died them pink
possibly it was the erm the UNK that
cows and things came in to the butchers
yes i think it was
sort of long UNK bits
yes
one of the UNK with the colours you mentioned er was it red er blue and green or UNK colour
yes UNK red
yeah UNK red
what happened was that i mean you made curtains er the UNK red was affected by light so eventually you got a curtain where the red spots had been there were holes
remember that
was that was that so
yes
it affected the fabric i didn't know that
yes the red colour was always er and er this so that the curtain had to be UNK
kitchen curtains
yeah you had kitchen curtains
that's right and all the red went into little holes
all the red went in holes
oh that that's strange
our dining room chairs were covered in UNK too
back seat and backing
that's right
yes
and you could you could push the seats up
right so that's oh these are some erm designs for erm UNK and erm other UNK produced in the utility room
this is the victory design
and it's got victory written in small letters all over it and of course the v for victory and this particular design here has got items of clothing and the number of UNK required for each item scattered over
and now we're coming on to your actual make do and mend
women were encouraged by the board of trade to join make do and mend clubs
this is one of the government posters
