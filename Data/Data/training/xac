and there was this awful woman mrs so and so that was always telling women what to do and she wasn't very popular because some of the things that she suggested that women did to make do and mend were so UNK and time consuming
and they were encouraged to erm form make do and mend clubs where basic sewing skills and repair techniques were taught
as well as how to UNK a UNK coat or dress and UNK it up again inside out that was one of the things mrs so and so suggested
worn parts of old dresses were replaced with UNK fabric and UNK outer and under garments were UNK and UNK in more fashionable styles
children's clothes were made from UNK old garments which could not be otherwise UNK
sheets were turned sides to middle and worn blankets cut up to make sleeping bags for children
housewives were advised to turn UNK over every morning when making the beds and the UNK would then last twice as long
all resources such as needles which were UNK sewing machines thread etcetera were shared
and buttons UNK and eyes press UNK etcetera were carefully sorted and retained
when UNK a garment the lengths of thread or cotton were saved for UNK and UNK
and UNK of thick UNK material were UNK into UNK to make split UNK or UNK
magazines gave UNK on how to m UNK pretty UNK and UNK from UNK of unwanted material because we still had to look pretty
and UNK using UNK from broken UNK coloured pipe cleaners sea UNK and UNK cups
following the example of her UNK the queen old felt hats were UNK and UNK pieces mounted on cardboard to make buttons or cut into interesting shapes for UNK belts and UNK knitted or UNK in dish cloth cotton which was UNK
instructions were also given on making pretty matching covers for ones ration book and identity card and gas UNK so you had a complete UNK these are these are the belts and erm
wore UNK and dresses again
and here is a UNK made from UNK
so did you get extra UNK if you were getting married or were you just expected to make do
er you made do
you had UNK you wore curtains or UNK or borrowed something
UNK silk was a sort
we think you did have extra UNK when you got married
i don't i can't well i don't know i don't think you did
no see the material all people used was the UNK material
the wedding dress
yes
have you got anything about children's toys cos they were in terrible short supply
UNK yes i do have i haven't brought it with me but i do have a book at home that erm in that showed you know the pieces of fabric that you had left over from doing all this erm i've got a pattern that my mother actually used to make things that were very are now very unpopular for my children
she used to make UNK out of old black stockings
and it showed you how to make things like that
some toys you could get the german prisoners used to make didn't they
i don't know is that true
yes locally a lot of people got you know the off the german prisoners of war used to make toys
and although they weren't allowed to sell them for money people could give them objects could give them things like coffee and things like that
yes
in exchange and they used to do quite a trade in cos a lot of them were quite skilled at making toys
i mean they were on farms all round here and erm people used to they used to do a lot of toys
people used to get them for their children and
like the french prisoners in the UNK wars used to do exactly the same thing
the manufacture of silk stockings was banned in december nineteen forty because silk was needed for UNK
the only stockings available to buy were a thick brown lisle
these were not popular and as most women wore trousers or UNK for the war work hand knitted long socks or UNK socks were more comfortable and convenient
those who were still fortunate enough to own a pair of silk stockings were given tips on how to make them last as long as possible
they should be kept in an UNK jar and UNK in UNK spirits before wearing
UNK nail UNK should be applied to the UNK points and toe join as well as UNK or UNK so that if you got a little ladder or a UNK you put UNK nail UNK on it
protective UNK could be made from the feet of old stockings
odd ones could be died UNK and died in tea or coffee to make a new matching pair
stockings that were past repair were used as a base for the new victory roll UNK
after the UNK belt UNK and foot had been cut off the stocking was tied round the head and the hair rolled over and UNK into a v shape
and this style lent itself very well to uniform hats and UNK
pre war UNK was available from high class shops but was far too expensive for most women
utility UNK was strong and UNK but totally lacking in UNK
and restrictions on UNK in use of UNK also applied
UNK and french UNK became popular because they didn't take much material and were economic in UNK
magazines gave instructions on how to make a pair of UNK from two silk UNK
UNK curtains UNK as UNK and even wedding dresses which answers your question about wedding dresses
patterns of knitted UNK for all the family were also available
in the immediate post war years UNK lies of white or yellow UNK material were released to the public
it was sold UNK free in eleven foot long UNK panels
special patterns were produced in magazines and newspapers and instead of quoting the width and UNK needed for a garment they stated the number of UNK panels you needed
the w v s and other voluntary services ran exchange centres where unwanted clothes household UNK and small pieces of furniture were allocated a sliding scale of points which could be exchanged for other goods of equal value
making do with UNK was a problem especially for mothers of young children
wear on leather UNK shoes was saved by sticking on over soles made from pieces of old tyre inner tubes
in nineteen forty three wooden UNK wedge UNK shoes were introduced in the utility range and the lady magazine gave UNK on how to walk in them
if you find yourself walking a bit duck UNK concentrate on placing your toes in a pigeon UNK position and you will find that your muscles will soon cooperate
well i think we have to stop there for a little while because it's nine o'clock and i've just got erm a few more pictures to show you later on so if we have a short break now i think the coffee ladies are ready
and erm you can come and have a look at my books or talk amongst yourselves and we'll resume later
set this to right we must stop
so we establish the rule
never have the
by a gr by a UNK process in
well what choice did he
what choice has he got
in the there was a UNK and
with this view they can trap
to lay on and then
supply of water and when a
and half an orange sunday
they named a great many of
anything else that
they make great many other wise and UNK
this is a this is
yes
the room was UNK from the worker and the
okay so make the what's going on in england at the time
paul
yeah
the people in charge see that the work
are an excellent idea so if you
workers were only used people who could actually work if people can't do a job then
they go off to an
they could do but then again
of american people could be lost and
would they get out of
very easily
erm they do what you do
yeah
and then again the old people would join the
sent to australia
there's certain ways that
would you give
no
but they were criminals anyway
if you treat honest poor people like this then criminals are lower than you'd take better care of animals than you would
er nick carry on from the first six months after oliver twist you can read
for the first six months after oliver twist the system was full was in full UNK operation
it was rather extensive at first and consequence of being and a necessity of taking in clothes of all the UNK who with which on a on a waste of after a week or two the number of the UNK got thin as well as the UNK and the board were in were in and then in which the boys got back were a large was a UNK was a copper at one end after which the master dressed in an apron and assisted by one or two women and they UNK the UNK at meal times
of this UNK composition each boy had one
UNK
UNK and no more except on occasions with great the bowl never wanted washing the boys polished them with their UNK till they UNK again and when they when they had to form this operation which never took very long the bowl they would sit UNK at the copper with such UNK eyes as if they could of UNK a of which it was composed
employing themselves meanwhile and UNK their fingers most UNK
UNK
UNK
carefully
with a with a the view of catching up any spare UNK of UNK that might be cast there UNK
boys with generally excellent UNK oliver twist and his UNK suffered from the UNK of slow UNK for three months at least they got so for UNK is that right
UNK greedy and wild
and wild beyond er that one boy who was and hadn't been used to that sort of thing for his father had kept a small cook stock his UNK that unless he has another UNK of UNK he was afraid he might he might some night happen to eat the boy he slept next to who happened to be a UNK youth of tender eight and they and they UNK believed him
a counsel was held lots were who should walk up to the master after supper that evening and ask for more it fell oliver twist
what is actually er the boy is could eat the boy next to him erm
what was it saying that was
well erm it's a bit he was
he was just trying to scare him trying to scare him
were you right when the worst thing that this
he had big pies
it proves how desperate people get and then he treats them like animals and this boy said i think
er the evening arrived then er david
the evening arrived the boys took their places the master in a UNK uniform stationed himself at the copper
his four assistants behind him
the UNK was served up and a long grace was said over a short the UNK disappeared the boys looked at each other and went over while his next neighbours UNK him tired as he was he was desperately hungry and he rest on the table and the master with his hands he said
yeah that's
please sir i want some more the master of the but he turned very pale and then he what said the master at in a UNK voice please sir replied oliver i want some more the master UNK at UNK head with the UNK
in his arms and treat and mr UNK rushed into the room with great excitement and addressed the gentleman in the high chair said i beg your pardon sir oliver twist has asked for more there was a for more said UNK yourself UNK and do i understand that he asked for more after he'd eaten supper he did sir replied UNK that boy would be hung i know that boy will be hung
this boy is a trouble maker and
and the boy would next morning would pass on the outside of the gate offering a reward of five pounds to anyone who would in other words five pounds for oliver twist i never in for this in my life said the in the white coat as he locked the gate and he went to the next morning
i never want to
i had always
anything in my life and then i am that boy
by the white UNK the gentleman
so what's he got against the
yeah erm he's also what's his attitude to what he
yes but is he is he terribly serious about his job
no he's very UNK
yeah erm
you're right
as i first show in UNK whether the white UNK gentleman was right or not i should have
just yet whether like oliver twist
later oliver twist was very near getting a
in other words
sorry
it could not of been easy
you'll find out actually why in a moment
a week after the had asking for more oliver remained greater prisoner in the UNK room which he had been UNK by the wisdom and mercy of the board but it appears that at first sight not unreasonable UNK that for a particular gentleman of white UNK
it was established that individual pathetic character once and forever by tying one end of his pocket UNK to a hook on in the wall and UNK himself to the other to the performance to the performance of this UNK however the pocket UNK inside had been all he only cried UNK all day and when the longest nights came on he spread his little hand before his eyes to shut out the darkness and UNK in the corner tried to sleep everyone drawing himself closer and closer to the wall
it's most that any prisoner
you could do but then again
yeah
let it not be spoke by of the system that during the period of as for exercise it was nice cold weather a public warning had been and so far this uses the same apartment every evening at prayer time and there selfish mind work a general publication for boys contain a special clause by authority of the board in which they repeatedly made good UNK protected UNK as regarded to a the powers of UNK as an article direct from
what is his crime
he asked for more
he just asked for more erm one thing that is disturbing what he does very UNK mention is what is going on all the time
well maybe not but what is going on is
fear
fear all the time if anybody to steps out of line or
as i was going with the fourth year to
what lies have been used
how can they justify what they do
yeah they
they're being fed they're still kind people taking care of them they're very lucky people
and what do
and so we presumably the little children
well i suppose you get
in a UNK or something this place would be better as long as you get fed the stuff you get there is horrible but at least it's food and er these kind people are taking care of it
in the outside world there's people waiting to exploit children and
er anthony do you want
erm with UNK was waiting down in the high street he was waiting there whoa said mr to the donkey the donkey was wondering probably whether he was so without listening to a word of warning he jumped on him
what makes you a bit disturbed about that
he's trying to smash
yes if he keeps the donkey like that
how's he treat children
how he treat children yeah
the gentleman with the white UNK
the gentleman with the white UNK was standing at the gate with his hands behind him after having delivered himself having witnessed with the donkey he smiled UNK when that the door he saw at once it was mr smiled as he pursued the i am said the gentleman in the white UNK
erm what is a
erm you say the young boy was
erm where they where they work as giving five pounds and oliver twist
or did they want five pounds for him
er i gather they
and er the UNK the gentleman in the white UNK why does he think that this
would feed the child regularly in a
that's it yeah he's
that beats the donkey i mean all the donkey does is
he hits the donkey while he pulls the UNK hits the donkey again and he finds out later that
well the man in the white UNK followed the gentleman with the white UNK into even if he gets stuck in a UNK worse thing that he the gentleman in the white UNK appeared his only chance he has is
okay now erm now what's he supposed to be assessed by the board have they just said
er why are
what's he doing
yeah it's all religious UNK okay UNK it's UNK to UNK these boys down the UNK yeah it's UNK giving them a good beating isn't it right then
sir is miss not in
no
could you take your coats off please and come into the blue room
well who's taking miss 's class
question
what
the answer
can you come through please
right folks donald is here making typical of english in use from schools at the moment
so if you would er ignore the presence of the microphone that would be helpful
i intend to give you a demonstration today based on work that kevin has done
he's his plate with hard wax as many of you now have done
he has UNK the back with can you remember what sort of special old UNK it was
straw hat
correct
well done
straw hat UNK
now it's safe from acid attack on the back and on the front except for where he has lightly drawn through the thin wax UNK using the UNK
drawn this little character and what i intend to do is put this into acid and UNK it
the actual UNK process where the acid UNK through the UNK into the metal and makes a rule
when that's happened i'll take it out of the acid clean it and show you how to take a print from the plate
i would like you all to try to remember the stages of the process because you're going to have to do as i said to you last lesson a small write up on this in order to get your unit of UNK for this work
that is to say your special certificates
right erm would you normally be room
would you normally be in this room
is it likely that there are other pupils who may turn up in that room in a few minutes
or do you think that you may be the only ones
are they all on the english trip
okay
in that case could you just take your coats off and put them somewhere erm out of the way
please
now we're gonna be using acid very dilute acid
nevertheless we have to take proper precautions
so if you would be so kind as to get into a position where you can see what i'm doing without being too close it means that if we do UNK any acid by accident er the likelihood of it causing any problems to anyone are minimal
have you come to UNK miss 's class
as it happens it would seem that most of those children are out on an english trip
oh
perhaps you would like to go and do your own thing
perhaps you'd like to stick around and watch this happening because i remember you UNK once for an UNK lesson
oh it's an UNK lesson is it
yes can you remember
yes
yesterday wasn't it
and you thought well i'd better not
i'm not having them running around
that's right
i remember you saying
so perhaps you'd like to keep them right
have a
and make sure i do it right
but on the other hand if you
i don't know how to do it
oh well i meant from the point of view of
safe safety point of view
safety
oh i'll stay for this
is that alright
mm
smashing
thank you very much
this by the way is er donald who is making sound recordings of in the school today
so UNK
er right my friends
as i say i would like you to be in fairly close UNK to where i am so that you can see what i'm doing and hear what i'm saying
er and i don't want you to be too close
i will actually be working to start with in this area here
so perhaps you could arrange yourselves in a semi circle just round here
right my friends we've very strange and wonderful chemicals in this erm i do beg your pardon when we are printing
the one which you will have come across when we were doing UNK printing was UNK
we had to use UNK didn't we to dissolve the printing UNK
can you remember that when you did UNK printing
mm
but when we're doing screen printing we use very much stronger UNK which can have a nasty effect on your skin
you notice i have slight UNK on the UNK of my hands
some of us have even worse UNK yeah
so it's really important that we don't UNK our skin
but frankly it's not likely to UNK your skin anyway because er you aren't industrial users of this you would only ever touch these chemicals for a very short time so the any possible side effects they might er have on you will be greatly diminished by the fact that you didn't use them very much
if you're using them in industry day in day out all day long then that is the real importance of wearing protective gear
but i'm just going to demonstrate to you just what happens
this lovely UNK rubber here is exactly the same UNK rubber here at one time but now it's gone all hard and UNK because of the chemicals
so if y if the chemicals will do that over a long period of time to rubber think what it would do to your skin
does that make sense
mm
these lumps have become so erm UNK by these chemicals that i can't er pick up the thin zinc plate from the tub
i'm afraid that mrs has gone off with ah mrs i'll be very grateful if you could bring me in a bowl
you know the one you just took out
you want it back
i wonder if i could have it back please
a bowl
a bowl it doesn't matter which one
just a plastic bowl please washing up bowl
do you want anything in it
or just water
er bring it empty and i'll
thank you very much
i'm gonna have a bowl of water handy just in case
so having put on these er temporary protective gloves
these are ones i bought long time ago
erm they're as you can see still a bit awkward but much easier to use than these
what do you think the other piece of protective gear i might need would be
UNK
UNK
good
and i have a pair of UNK here but there is another safety device built into this which is this window
in fact the tray of acid will go in there so any UNK around i might do any upward UNK is not likely to reach
you will be relieved to know i've ordered some new rubber gloves like this and some new UNK for next term
but you don't need to use them this term anyway so it's alright
the acid we use is nitric acid
it's very dilute only fifteen percent acid the rest is water
and i have used this particular acid already to UNK zinc
can't hear you
oh
i just i'll just
i'll see you later
consequently this acid now contains some zinc which has eaten it away
there'll be a residue of zinc in there
the other metal which i mentioned to you before which is the traditional method for UNK is copper plate
and i am told that it is not UNK to use the same batch of acid for UNK copper as has been used for UNK zinc because the deposits of two metals in the acid creates erm an unpleasant UNK possibly poisonous gas and i don't know what that would do
talking about gas even this produces gas
therefore you have this machine which is an UNK
it's called a UNK cupboard i think
a s sort of cupboard
it's open at the front
it has to be because we have to get our hands in
but it's UNK the fumes going out the window
possibly not very UNK sound but safer for you at all events
this hasn't been used for some time so it's a bit so i'm just going to wipe it out so there are no UNK or foreign bodies in there
and this bit i do before the lesson and i do this clean it up afterwards
you don't have to do this bit
but notice that i'm pouring slowly and gently away from me into the dish which i shall then put in here and i'm going to put the plate which i described to you before which has been covered with what's on the back
straw hat UNK
what's on the front
hard wax
hard wax
and UNK so the acid should bite through there
has anybody got a UNK on them
what
you have haven't you
what
a watch
will you time er two minutes please
from the moment this goes into the acid
you lower it in gently and UNK it about so that the acid covers the surface
right you may UNK by that and look down there notice i wasn't wearing the UNK that was naughty of me wasn't it
i should have been er while i go and get a turkey UNK
okay you go and have a look at that covered up
and try and see if we've got er forming on the lines
yes
that's what makes er these chemicals so dangerous you don't know what they are
what do you think i've got this for
sorry i can't hear you paul
so that er
i still can't hear you
to UNK the zinc off
to UNK the zinc off
when it's
very good yes
that's correct
as the zinc is eaten away air UNK er sorry not air UNK gas UNK i don't know what gas
any idea what gas might be being produced
no i was trying to think it's zinc
and it's in a UNK of hydrogen
zinc and nitrate
and it would give off nitrate wouldn't it
zinc nitrate
which isn't a gas
which isn't a gas
it's a salt
so perhaps some odd hydrogen is produced as well
well that sometimes happens when there's
two minutes
right
yeah i think the two minutes is up
david's timed two minutes
now when that acid is fresh and hasn't been used before two minutes is usually quite enough for it to have done the job it's supposed to do
this is an UNK operation because since the acid has been used i don't know how many times because the temperature the UNK temperature in the room varies
in the winter when it's cold it works more slowly now when it's very hot it will should work more quickly
er i can't say precisely leave it in the acid for so and so time
so we always this has always been the case for the four five hundred years that people have been doing UNK so they go by a rule of thumb
the rule of thumb is this when the first cluster of UNK is fully formed sweep them away with a UNK wing UNK
so i have duly swept them away
which means that the acid can get back in there
that the air UNK er the gas UNK i keep saying air UNK that's wrong
they are gas UNK
the gas UNK forming along the lines were keeping the acid out of the lines
so i've swept them away so that the acid can get back in
when the second set of UNK is formed it's done
that's the rule of thumb
okay
two UNK of UNK and it's UNK deep enough
so i suppose that was about two and a half minutes wasn't it
so i would think that we're working on a five minute schedule
don't forget that when they first did this people would not have had personal watches
and there may only have been one clock in the town where they worked and that would have been on the town hall or the church
UNK are a very recent er introduction as far as ordinary er working conditions are concerned
what might have they have had to measure the time as it passed
egg timer
UNK
UNK yes
but that might not have been too convenient
egg timer
say it was night for instance
pardon
one of them sand things
one of them sand things
who knows what they're called
egg timer
an egg timer is what we use them for now
do you know what the traditional name for them is
anybody know
it's called an UNK
have you heard that before
no
sir
you UNK your nose and you've got acid on them gloves
right
i did didn't i
yeah
but i should come out in great UNK soon and start looking like an american UNK in london
right my face will start falling off
quite right
you must be careful not to UNK touch anything with even the gloves
and you should wash the gloves as soon as you've touched the acid
i should have done that straight away
well spotted
i will do it now
say that again paul please
i'm sorry paul i can't understand you
something about an UNK
yes
yes
yes
it might be harmful to your lungs
it hasn't been used yet
but it's not er as good as
well that's what it says it is on the erm on the outside
orange spot on me notes
mm
see what it was
now it's green
that means it's been used with copper
we have a suspicion that very little reaction has taken place because in fact very few UNK have risen to the surface
this could be i don't think acid spends itself as it sits in a bottle does it
no
it stays the same UNK
mm
it's erm if you've used that lots and lots of times it may have used up all the
it may have exhausted UNK it
yeah
so because it worked last time i used it
i'm hoping that it has worked this time
it's been in there much longer than i'd normally leave it
so it will either have not worked at all for some UNK reason or it will have worked well and
so whatever has happened i'm now going to remove it from the acid
i'm going to wash it
and then we're going to remove the wax UNK
okay
so i wonder whilst i do that er if you would just take note of the safety precautions here
again one should wear one's UNK no
one should
notice where i've put the UNK please
i've put it resting on the dish so that any acid from it doesn't get on to that bench there
drain off the acid
please note if i leave any UNK on the bench
did i leave any UNK on the bench
yes
right
loads
as you will
i've now UNK that in there so it's so dilute now that when i pour it away hardly a trace of it there
take a cloth and i'll clean up where i've been
you should do that every time
you'll also be provided with an apron to protect your clothes
ooh
right
so that's the spec on that
these i will dispose of now
but when we have a prop proper set of gloves we ought to put the gloves and the UNK there ready for the next person to use
and make sure when you leave the place i hope that you have washed them and you've washed those
okay er yes i think it may have actually UNK we may be in luck
i hope so
would you come over to that bench over there
right folks can you all see
i don't want you too UNK
can you move round this side a bit
as you can see the wax has dissolved away extremely quickly easily except for that lump
do you remember that lump kevin
mm
and it didn't do any harm at all that lump
you can just
has it worked then
it has worked extremely well and you can all even see can't you
mhm
the fact that there are UNK lines in there
can you see it alright from where you are
it's a little sort of er science fiction monster
now the UNK will not i think dissolve this UNK because this UNK is alcohol based UNK
you have to use an alcohol UNK to remove that when we need to remove it
my next task is to find some printing as you can see printing ink is delivered both in tins and if we have any left there may be somewhere in tubes
yeah
or you make it yourself
this powder here
right
that's the commercial name for it
it's carbon
mm
it's carbon or UNK
right
that's right
do you know what UNK is
that's right
now if i were to mix some of that with another substance i could make printing ink
what would the other substance be
water
erm it would have to be if it were with water i'd have to put something else in as well otherwise the stuff wouldn't stay on the page
it would just fall off like a dust
so if i were using making a water based printing ink what other stuff would i have to put in as well as water
oil
no because oil and water don't mix
pardon
something to UNK it but think of UNK
glue
glue yes
you'd have to put glue powder and water in to make a water based printing ink
or erm a base which er dried water UNK such as UNK
but the traditional UNK printing ink is oil based
so one would use copper plate oil
this stuff here which is actually dried out but it's you can smell it still has the UNK of UNK oil which is what it is
can you UNK it
it UNK like oil
it UNK like oil but not like three in one oil
i think you'll find put some UNK into it would erm
UNK does that mean UNK
so i'm not going to show don't confuse that with this which is oil derived from UNK products
UNK oil is mostly made out of the seeds of the UNK linen plant
you've heard of linen haven't you
so there's probably going to be a little bit of ink left in here rather than opening those
now don't be horrified this is the whole point of these UNK benches is that we can work directly on to them
i'm gonna put some printing ink on there
it's one of the reasons why i tell you not to sit on benches because you'll probably find the UNK of ink along the edges even after the most careful clean up
i'm going to take a roller these are very expensive very UNK rollers
much higher quality than the UNK rollers that we may be used to using
and therefore they must be carefully looked after
er these little feet here are for the roller to stand on
please don't let me catch you rollers on benches
don't spread this all over the bench
you only spread it in a square no bigger than the width of the roller
the idea is to cover the complete surface of the roller in the printing ink
you see how beautifully UNK it's taken up that ink
you keep your
you've missed a bit sir
you'll fi you'll find that
don't worry
you know roll that on to the plate which unfortunately may still have a film of UNK on it from when i cleaned it
strictly speaking i should have taken it from here to where to get rid of the UNK
the sink
no
oh the chalk
the chalk good
the chalk tray
so the chalk could have absorbed up the UNK
it may
take yes it is taking
because we've been talking for a while so had time for it to UNK
good
the next thing you use three UNK
believe it or not one of these is the dirty one is the not very dirty one and one is the clean one
now they may all look dirty to you but this one has been used less and it therefore has less
this one has erm taken over from the medium one
this was the clean one
this one's the third one
this one's been used a lot of times
last time this was used about two years ago so it's a bit stiff
normally you'd find that these were quite er UNK soft
now the method of plate is to gather the
why are you UNK it if you've just put it on
very good question
see if you can answer the question without me yourself
because it runs into the UNK
exactly so
well done
well done
and that is something i haven't told you at all
that when you do UNK printing you are printing from the surface of the UNK block the bit you've cut away doesn't print
and that's called erm er a special word which i've forgotten for the moment
when you print from the cuts that you make in the plate it's called UNK printing
i n t a g
UNK a g l i o UNK
which means putting
whilst i'm thinking of that notice the way i into the middle of the plate
did you see that sort of semi circular UNK motion
i then twist the plate forty five degrees and then keep doing that and paul can you see the ink taken up on the UNK there
and i'm giving it three UNK each time
i'll be working to the middle now
now the rag i should be using for this is the very dirty one and i've started off with the clean one by accident
i should have started with the rag most loaded with ink
i should have then gone on to the next UNK one and finished off with the UNK one
that's what i should have done but i got them in the wrong order
however
it doesn't matter
it doesn't matter because all of them are as it happens fairly er new and indeed as kevin says quite correctly dry because they haven't been used for a long time
now there are still UNK of ink on the surface but now you can much more clearly see the UNK lines because they're full of now
the next stage is the actual printing itself
now notice that no matter that i've been careful my hands have got printing ink on them
and your hands will UNK get with printing ink
what professional printers do at this stage or fine art printers would be to take their piece of paper using little paper UNK so they didn't get their fingerprints on the paper
i am going to be less particular but i've got to find some paper first
excuse me for a moment
right this process that i'm about to do should take place on that table there normally
we have to be very UNK when we do this
UNK up on that table only
UNK the paper UNK karen erm on that table
erm so i'll just move my UNK
and before you start printing you should UNK some paper
i'm going to do a wee demonstration on how to do it now
you dip it in with the leading edge let the water pour over it then drain it off
put it down put your next piece in
is that is that
correct
ah
it should be much better quality thick UNK paper preferably UNK but that costs i think i've said to you before about ten quid a sheet
notice how this is beautifully covered with my fingerprints now which it wouldn't be if i was handling it properly
how big are the sheets that you get for ten quid
they are about what you would call a one
they're that size
ooh
aye but can you use it over and over again or not
no
erm you can divide that sheet up into well using a small p
can you not use the same bit twice
you can't use the same bit more than once no
waste of money eh
no it's not
what for
one thing
so
right the next stage
you take a piece of perfectly clean white tissue paper and you place it on the of the UNK plate
as close to the rollers as possible just there
you place the slightly warm UNK plate so if you pop it on there for about half a second to get the printing ink nicely mobile and you put it printing ink face up
you take your UNK paper it shouldn't be dripping wet like this it should have had time to dry out a bit
and you place it carefully on the printing plate so there's lots of spare paper round it because the essence of a good UNK is that it has breathing space all the way round
you don't crop an UNK to it's edges
you now place the
sir
what
in there
aye
don't worry about it
i'll explain why in a minute
but it's straight not
found to my cost in the past
so you put it under both like this
thanks for mentioning that
you'll see that the pressure is must be quite enormous and produced a raised section there
erm you peel off the tissue paper and you have your first print
and of course it's the
ooh
the wrong way round isn't it
all printing is
so you must remember if you ever put any UNK on when you're printing that you must write it backwards
right so that it's a bit grey isn't it
if you wanted it to be a perfectly white background then you would also use bits of white tissue paper for a final polish on the surface
and if you watch this technique these
sir
why do you think you put tissue paper on the on the erm base of this
UNK up the UNK
so the UNK so the UNK doesn't get UNK
so the UNK doesn't get UNK
good point
anything else
in case any ink runs off the side
mhm
good one
to protect it
to protect the steel on the
use the that part of your hand to polish the surface in a circular motion like that
and as you can see even after three print i've managed to lift off quite a lot of UNK from the surface
consequently that would print pretty clean
we've cleaned that
so paul was worried that i hadn't put it in straight weren't you paul
didn't you mention it
you said
oh aye
i hadn't put it in straight
yeah
well it's perfectly true
it's very hard to gauge when it's in straight
if you leave plenty of UNK round the edge later on you can crop that slightly so that it is a perfect ninety degree
that's basically it
and that's the way you print whether you're doing hard wax soft wax or UNK
very good
i'm glad you mentioned that
you should take at least six prints of every impression
we haven't got time today i don't think kevin
can you check the watch again
ten past
ten past and we finish at
twenty five past
twenty five past right
i will i will say to kevin yeah
take a print see if you can do it
but remember these are wet so you have to leave them out flat to dry
and then of course we sign them up later
and i'll have to teach you precisely how to sign them up
you must also learn how to clean up after yourselves
mrs clean er tables for you when we've been doing now you have to do it yourselves
so i will give you a bit of instruction on how to do that now
you will take one of these blocks you will wet it for a certain time and you
lay it on there
get the roller and roll it on there so it'll dissolve off the ink
yes
yes
then you would erm do it again with a clean one so that this ended up looking as clean as that
you have to pay attention to that part and that part too
then you would take the same rag and wipe that off and then the piece of cleaner cloth bit more UNK clean the desk
and you put all the equipment you have used safely back in the correct tins and on the correct shelf
sir
wear those
it's not very nice to wear them because you get that is the end product
thank you for your attention
if you'd like to go into the next room please
display i have to put out
no
you need one sheet you put that on there
ink your plate up and put it face up
you don't need that one
well
but ink it up using the UNK
it might be a good guess today if i could say that most people either done as much as they could with their model and had this
erm
finished so i asked if they would help me to sort out the erm
they nearly did it brilliant way remember i had the little labels on them and they've all got mixed up one way or another
so we're here to
scrap through the remains of erm and got the wire wool and got them down and washed them what i would like today if you would be so kind as to assist when you've finished your pottery is to re label these now some of you er have already finished pottery and start straight away those who only have the finishing UNK to do start half way through the lesson or whatever but i do intend to give a demonstration now so could you gather all round
you must know where all the
erm if you take a
and take a
to your desk
and then
the trouble with
is about three
speed of knots going on this flight here i
put them on your desk and then arrange them in the order that you know i approve
can anybody remember UNK
so it goes yellow UNK erm UNK red UNK that's the dark red light green dark green erm sky blue UNK purple brown and black a lot of people get mixed up
i like you
that i realize is very
so can you see that board there
that's just
erm
er emma keep thy hands to thy self otherwise that the eye can UNK the old custom of putting them off
the
goes UNK across there like that put as much glue on the back as you can so that they're really well UNK down leave the so the outside edge of the square level with the
lining so they're not all UNK
when you come to doing along on the other side make sure they're beautiful parallel
does that make sense to everybody
so that's a beautiful block now did i explain to you lot yesterday about er that was yesterday sorry
about er UNK or pottery
no
no sorry about that right now one should keep
they would like to paint their pottery the fact is if you initially don't paint your pottery with normal UNK you paint your pottery with erm UNK which fire well i'll explain that to you once the er as the
comes through so if you just wait i'll talk to you again a little bit about that
if you go into the top cupboard there's a shelf marked
and
right i'll take
through er ah put the
a chemical term er
difficult question but you might be able to give me an example of one aha
okay that does have oxygen in it yes i don't think it's
i think you're wrong not being a specialist
can anybody else give me an example of an oxide with
that is a metal but it's not erm an oxide metal
nearly all metals have UNK and those UNK substances on the surface of the
which is UNK off and used as so called paint for the pottery mixed with a little light
which is burnt off when the whole thing gets fired in the UNK so what will have to happen is the your pots you've done so far once they're thoroughly dried and go into the UNK they're fired at a high temperature and then they'll come out this bit fired you'll then separate them with oxide UNK dip them into UNK which i'll explain in a minute and re fire them at a higher temperature the UNK would
in the heat once it's UNK down you'll get the familiar appearance of a glossy surface of pottery with the oxide having also fired and sometimes changed colour and that's your colour underneath on your base a layer of colour and then a plastic surface right if i talk about UNK erm UNK does did anybody understand that
have you heard the term before
you've heard of UNK before yeah
er i don't
mr sir have you heard the term UNK
makes it shiny yes what is it that is shiny
specifically
the surface
the surface do you know what it's made out of
it's very similar in word
polish
it's not polish it's glass if you look at the windows they are familiar glass aren't they
well actually pottery is covered in a thin layer of glass so that when your pot is UNK into the UNK solution it's simply a suspension of UNK in water which ride on the surface to leave a powder which is really UNK ground up sand when you put that into the UNK to fire at a higher temperature it UNK it turns into glass now it's
in its simplest form
i'll have to do that later for you because you won't be doing it then this lesson next year and if your pots don't go up in the UNK i will be glazing for you so of course you see the colour and everything we don't have the time to do that it's a shame well actually they'll look very smart just with the UNK on but i'll try and get that done for you okay can you put your hand up if there is
you need to do today
you
okay will you people very carefully go and
oh
well you took
apologize
but do you know who's following on from cos i'd take it upon myself
seems reasonable ian
aye
well just for the tape purposes i'm not actually from northumberland
i'm from the north east if that's good enough
you're from UNK or somewhere
that's
UNK yeah on the
that's the deep south thought innit
durham stroke yorkshire border
so i'm not northumberland
erm we haven't i don't think got minutes of the previous i don't think we were keeping minutes of these meetings
mm
erm
but now that we're getting or going to get presumably more involved in union matters it might be UNK if we could have a minute UNK
er UNK there
don't know whether she's
i'm just putting a t shirt on
a volunteer for taking and UNK of the minutes and producing of them
would it be handy er to UNK to give to anybody who either say UNK or nupe who was discussing them
well i think it's going to be essential isn't it
we're going to be meeting more regularly in the next er few month and we want to know what
i think yeah
we discussed at the previous meeting
thr through you chairman i think also it's erm it would er apart from it being er erm a minute for us here erm in relation to you know what we're looking to er to er apply er it also would be useful er in relation to the regional liaison group er of the UNK er unison unions erm so as to er actually circulate it to them and that's that tends to be made up of er officers full time officers er and er the three UNK that's gill and er phil as well so it er it lets them know er
as a progress report
yeah that's right
what you're what we're doing erm and hopefully seek their support on some areas that literally falls within the regional er liaison group's remit anyway
so
does that mean you are UNK lisa
well i thought it was done like the army volunteer line so let's get on
let's get on with the business
so you you've now become secretary of the northumberland liaison group
do i get paid
no
you don't get any to do it
right
okay
well you you're on that regional liaison group in fact then
yes i am yeah
lisa so you're the natural person
yeah
oh thank you don it's really
good
very
well i think what we'll she'll have to do
erm what we'll have to do i i'll put this attendance put an
i was just
attendance sheet
yeah i've
you've got one have you
good
er good from memory of the previous meeting there one of the items i recall at er i was left to do was contact the our education officer erm namely keith er to see if er a one day seminar or a one day school or whatever you'd like to call it er could be held prior to the ballot
well i've had a word with keith and he will be available and very willing to do a one day seminar of that nature basically on why unison how we should go about convincing the membership at large how we should er conduct the free ballot campaign as it were
er he will be quite will willing and happy to do that on behalf of the three organizations erm here in county hall one day in the first week in october well any day UNK thursday of that week
so we're in your hands as to what date you would prefer to hold it and who we would want to invite
erm probably a larger group than those UNK here
so i have undertook to do that i've done it and er i mean it's up to you as to which date you choose
erm we're talking about week UNK the fifth of october
so it could either be fifth sixth seventh or ninth
what's the fifth
what day is it er UNK
er monday the fifth of october
but i would suggest er wednesday the seventh
i don't know whether anybody would disagree with that
of october
mm
wednesday the seventh
would that be everybody happy with that date
it's the UNK of UNK or whatever way you pronounce it
would you be having that at county hall
yes
because i think you'll have to check UNK for accommodation in here before you made a decision because the
a firm date
mm
yeah because the erm it's very difficult to get rooms at the minute
right
well can we leave it that erm
well i mean i'll check now if you want
can you
cos
oh that would be
that would wouldn't it
that would be very useful
chairman could i just ask as the minute UNK to er clarify the remit of the er educational seminar
yeah
er any day ba UNK thursday the eighth
er the remit
UNK between now and christmas
i i've just suggested wednesday it could be any day now
no i'm saying that it's between now and christmas UNK gotta keep them clear
oh that's right aye yeah
so you're
that's right i'm a bit dodgy on a wednesday yeah
anyway we'll see
see what date
see the availability of rooms and then we'll make a firm decision
the remit with regard to the er one day seminar it was suggested at the last meeting er that it would be useful if the activists of the free union actually got together held a one day seminar or training course whatever terminology you like to put on it er to actually educate ourselves on how we should be conducting the campaign basically
erm how we would go about going outside into the workplaces in the various parts of the county convincing the members er to vote yes
erm what kind of publicity material we require and we'll come on to that later because we did elect a publicity sub group i remember
erm and how we would generally distribute all this stuff that we're going to get from the respective head offices which is now UNK into our office we've got leaflets er car stickers question and answer booklets that kind of stuff
er and obviously if we've got thousands of those coming to each three regional offices we've got to find some method of distributing them we don't want them left in the office do we
so i think the whole idea of the seminar was to kind of basically get ourselves organized but have it in a kind of er seminar format
does that
yes
that's about the remit isn't it
as far as i recall from the last meeting
er that
i think the intention if i recall correctly was to give er stewards
yeah
as the key people
aha
yes
the sort of arguments really
aha
for er cos they're the key people that in of workplaces
and getting the arguments across
erm well our branch secretaries are the main people who pass on to stewards who would in turn pass all this literature and things like that on the nupe side
yeah
as far as we're concerned
we distributed cos we're lucky we've just got schools in and around you know
i mean the members who
mm
i think a as far as this group is concerned it will be up to each respective union er i think of who they invited to that seminar
i think i mean some unions might want the branch secretaries but some might want all branch officials some might want all shop stewards or senior shop stewards or UNK or whatever terminology we have in the respective unions for their positions
i mean i think as far as UNK concerned we would want our branch secretaries or a branch official and probably senior shop stewards i would think
yeah
wouldn't we
yeah
you know
er cos we're talking about you see we're talking about nine branches aren't we in er northumberland
far UNK throughout the county as it were
so from our point of view certainly from UNK point of view it would be a good thing
in fact if we weren't doing it as a unison group we'd probably do it ourselves anyway because of the fact that we've got nine separate branches and we'd want to have a bit of erm common strategy if you like between the branches anyway
erm chairman could i just ask a question in relation to that
er we're talking about er for example er nupe have nine branches erm i is that all local authority health service er and the er educational
they're all
well no we're just talking purely and simply about local authority here
just local authority
yeah
right
i just wanted to clarify that
basically our branches are based on the district but with a slight variation or two not exactly district
the only thing that's different with the branches is the health UNK
the health
yeah well we're not concerned with the health yeah
i mean the health different completely but the rest everybody's incorporated each branch to what area they are
irrespective of what they work at
mm
i thi i think they're the UNK and nupe health branches are making their own arrangements in northumberland as far as i know
they're not part of this liaison group
so they'll be doing something similar i should imagine er
we we're we'd be likely to invite all of our stewards really i think from the point of view the county branch up to now with these meetings it's just been our county branch er that's been
mhm
well the county branch UNK er but i think i'd be inclined also to spread that to our six district branches as well
because our organization is entirely employer based
er you know one in each of the six districts at the county branch
yeah
and i i'd be inclined from point of view to invite all of our stewards not just in the county but in all the district branches as well
yeah
to make it fair
can i make it fair mr chairman that erm obviously with all ours being mainly UNK it would only be fair to the actual UNK erm person who looks after UNK to only invite cos otherwise you've gotta get stand in for school which will cause problems
yeah
say four or five people come to that meeting
mm
from one area you'd have to find four or five UNK which is impossible
i mean
ah well
schools have still got to be covered
that'll be the next hurdle i mean we haven't got to that hurdle
no i'm just saying though it's
nor the hurdle of getting paid release
i hoping we'll will get it
aha
well there's no problem
without any problem but you never know do you
he's UNK we might not get it
can i ask question chairman
yes
what is the situation with i know they're private now but er the situation with the river authorities the water authorities
cos we have a tremendous lot of nupe members
not er not so many now but it's er we've still got members but i mean we well we're you know all about that you're the front
yes i yes i know all about that
front runner erm but i mean er all i know about from the nupe point of view is that since the kind of can we call it semi de recognition
or can we call it totally de recognition
mm
erm er our membership UNK somewhat and we haven't got a very big membership in er water now
we've got a hundred members
well er in the UNK we we've got a rivers authority branch which is well a hundred and twenty hundred and thirty strong that's not a northumberland branch it UNK from the UNK to the UNK i think but
yeah
certainly the UNK
so the water membership wouldn't concern us here
so it wouldn't involve us that's right yeah
no i think we should stick to local government branches in the county of northumberland
and you know i think if we can that's a big enough task for us to take on here
oh yes i appreciate but i were just wondering what branches they were in you've explained that
so it's like a national branch forget it
as far we're concerned this day's seminar that we're organizing it will be purely and simply local government branches of the three organized regions in northumberland
that's it
is that
that's it we won't widen it anywhere beyond that
and i think we it was UNK pointed out that we've got enough to do er sorting out the local government situation in northumberland and i don't disturb the other industries as it were
did we get a date
the only room available is this one on friday the ninth
of october
yes
well it's going to need th this size of room anyway i should imagine
oh
if everybody we invite turns up
mm
friday the ninth
everybody happy with that
no sorry can't make it
can't make friday the ninth
friday the ninth
well
at
at ten a m
ten a m
ten till four
that's a full day's work
ten till four council chamber
what time ten to what
ten a m
till four
need access to the room before that
will we need access
mm
well only for the tutor to come in with his er overhead UNK or whatever he's got
i'll try and get time for that
would we need we'd also need some kind of refreshments and er we'll have to make a decision about lunch
can i put in excellent restaurant that exists right here in county
yes
yes exactly
er no i mean normally when most organizations when they call members together for a seminar or a training course provide subsistence for lunch and we usually have tea and coffee don't we
could i could i just raise an issue
are we going to have that
erm in i mean obviously there's gonna be some of our some of our members i mean if i identify one UNK from UNK but i UNK other unions er have erm have one or two members who actually work night duty
and UNK was just saying i mean sh on that on that friday she's due to be in work on that friday night and it comes on a day she'll paid time off aspect
erm she's due in at work on that friday night er we've UNK problems before whereby we've asked for i e the friday night off because there's been an educational seminar on the day as it were er and that that's been that's been de er
refused
refused as it were
so i mean
in the past it's been refused
yeah
yeah
yes
that might be a problem area particularly where we've got reps who work night
well
who work nights
it'll apply to nights and days that won't it
i mean we might find that we've got a problem with members generally getting paid
i'll be astonished if we get paid time off for this
our we haven't got a problem
as long as we can possibly get someone to replace them with
yeah somebody UNK to replace them or erm they will allow so many in actually erm be off at one given time
i think yeah
but erm
i think chairman in relation to the time off i think erm i think that's one thing we need to as area UNK to actually try and er clarify
i thought
er as soon as possible
i thought this was supposed to be
i thought this was
at the last meeting
no all that all that was going to be done was to see about as far as i'm aware the feasibility of get getting one of the education officers and one of the
to actually put a course on
details of when and where will be discussed at the next meeting as far as i
ah in my notes here i've got paid leave
oh
but there is an agreement actually er with employers stating that they will give time off for erm that's what
training courses
but for training courses and meetings
er they recognize the unions so the they there is an agreement
yeah
well i if
yeah but if they're if they're if they're at work during that period of time
aha
my argument is i'm not at work between the hours of ten to four
no
no that's a point
i start work at night
yeah
and i'll be you won't be qualified for paid time off
well what's your UNK like
is he sympathetic or is he
yeah
well th they follow the rules laid down by er
mm
i mean it we may find yet we don't know we haven't applied we cos the reason that we haven't applied cos we didn't know until today exactly who we were going to invite and when we were going to hold it er so it would be ludicrous to apply for time off when you didn't even know the date you were holding it and who you were going to invite
erm so and we will do that now but i mean it may UNK that the employer might say no to paid time off er for the people who are on days as well as
er and i would guess then we would have to switch it to a saturday
if i mean if we can only if we can only invite the people that are he i mean the they allow us release for this type of meeting mind you
so i can't see why they shouldn't allow
but er sorry i mean i'm i don't deliberately want to labour the point in relation to the night staff right
but then the same problem applies because you'll have had the night staff working all day friday night come off duty about seven eight o'clock in the morning
erm they're gonna be UNK
yeah
well i
to say the least
well personally i've never had a problem getting members who are on nights their night off to go on a training course never
well all i'm saying is mr chairman is
because they've always said it's exactly the same as a day worker and yes you have either the shift off before the night shift off before you go on the course or the one after
i think with regard to er i mean the general rule of things with regard to educational er issues and time off for them erm they tend to be let's say reasonable er about it er but that's been literally on educational issues
i think the subject matter of this seminar is slightly away from that and therefore we may we may find some er some er problems in that
i mean then we might not
all i'm saying is that we need to before we literally start UNK i's and crossing t's in any literal sense is to UNK out whether that's gonna whether they're going to be UNK to the subject matter
i can't see the problem here
you see the employees recognize the unions they ask they join the unions right
and wh whether it's nupe UNK erm UNK it is a union unison which will be one if it if it comes about
now if they recognize the unions it doesn't matter which one it is they didn't erm differentiate between any unions do they
mm
i mean they recognize UNK they recognize nupe UNK they've got to recognize unison
because it's the
i think i think the point UNK was making before was that er there is an agreement for shop stewards to have paid release to attend training courses
that is agreed isn't it
aye
aye
somebody UNK and s that way and said it wasn't agreed but er it is actually anybody who's going on a UNK training course organized by their respective union the t u c er a local college or whatever a shop a shop registered shop steward does get paid release for that er training
so what we've got to say to the county council i would suggest is that this is a training course similar to those we always got release for branch officials and shop stewards so why should you turn your nose up at this training course
i think in the past the response from the county council would be that it wasn't directly related to industrial relations
because we had this when we carried out a political fund ballot erm and we asked for time off for stewards to go and talk to members and we asked for time off for a seminar for a one day seminar
and which we weren't granted the time off we were granted time off without pay but not paid leave
yeah
well if we were granted time off without pay then which is this is a distinct possibility yeah er would the respective unions present here be UNK their members for loss of earnings
well it's for their benefit in the long run
i mean we're not doing it for our own good
are we
would do that
i s i can't i can't make that decision
oh
i'd have to i'd have to erm i'd have to raise it er and i think to be quite honest the er i mean fortunately as i said earlier on mr chairman there is a regional liaison group meeting on monday er and i have a UNK audience of three budget holders doug gill and phil erm and raise this with them
er and obviously we'll get the response erm a as it were but erm that's something i couldn't i couldn't answer at this particular time
mm
it's a last resort but then again we might not need it but if we do
well it looks as if what we're doing now we're having a discussion we're like counting chickens before they're UNK we haven't erm actually had a refusal
we haven't even applied yet er for release
er we've got one month in which to do it basically erm so what i would suggest is that the officers of the three unions represented here apply for paid release first of all to or presumably it will be geoff the chief personnel officer
erm whether we want to add something on to the agenda that would make it more acceptable to them like health and safety or whatever
and that
local government finances
one of getting round er the problem we seem to have
you know you can you can work a bit of a UNK and put something on that's more or less acceptable to them
we could say we could UNK it industrial relations in northumberland
yeah
changes in their industrial UNK seat in the county
changes
mm changes
changes
i think with regard to that mr chairman if local representatives
there's a hand up at
are going to actually apply sorry
there's a ha hand up at the back
yeah i mean you could do that
i mean i think that's a good tactical UNK even though it's tongue in cheek
the only other difficulty that you've got a need to know what sort of numbers we're talking about
i mean are you talking about a hundred and fifty
which is i think the capacity of this room
no
because it's all going to come out of their budget isn't it
it's i mean they're okay you're applying from three different UNK but it's coming out of one well UNK erm kitty
i think you know you say you've got a month i think you're gonna need also to try and find out from your membership as to whether in fact they're prepared to turn up on a saturday as well
because i think you could you could come back here in three weeks time and find that you you've got you're not gonna get time off on a friday you haven't got enough and then you're going to have to start all over again
mm
ah
so i think you've both those questions have gotta be addressed by the unions that the s that the second one in terms of turning up on a saturday
mr chairman the certainly with they'd still have a problem with a friday night
time off
because if you work friday night you know they're not going to come in on
mm
the saturday are they
UNK are we looking at sunday
rather than saturday
well there's no i mean surely the same will apply on a sunday
i mean night workers situation
so friday night's not your normal
i don't think we'd get many members turning up on sunday
no
well let's stick to friday then and let's
well let's
chairman
two things
firstly nupe has never had difficulty with northumberland county council getting time off for anyone
no
in all the years and i've been it's secretary now for fifteen years and i haven't had any trouble
and neither has my stewards
dennis years ago did a deal with by we had so many days a year and any extra you applied for them there was never any trouble
and the second issue is in my experience if you have a seven hour on a saturday or a sunday you get a poor turn out
you get no one
always been the same so if we're gonna do this let's do it right let's have it through the week
yeah
i think i think yes i think the consensus is that we hold it on friday the ninth erm and we're going to apply the three full time officers will apply for those in their organization that they want to attend apply for paid release
the three officers will agree the terminology of the request
you know industrial relations or whatever is going to be on the agenda
er it's not just a unison liaison seminar
er we we'll agree that between the three of us and make sure we have the exact wording cos we wouldn't want three subjects would we
well
just can i just remind you that the request for paid time will need to go to seven authorities in the county
they couldn't go to central personnel
no
there are six district councils in the county and we're proposing to invite our own
oh yes district councils oh yes
district branches to send people as well
er i think the way the request is presented to northumberland might be different to the way it's presented in or UNK or somewhere like that
er i'd prefer to UNK it maybe to er suit each employer and to ask permission from er the other six branches as well first
mm
well can we
but er going beyond that i think it would be wise for us to assume that we will not get paid time off for this even if we do attempt to disguise it as something else
and you know i'd prefer not to do that
i think that we should assume that we would not get paid time
er i think we should also assume that the regional er UNK will not make a contribution to any costs we might incur cos i don't think any budget they'll have will be intended to cater for er you know paying people's wages for them getting UNK time off
i think it will be intended for things other than that
and as somebody mentioned earlier again i think it would be wise to was it steve
to make contingency plans to hold it on a day when we don't need the cooperation of the employers in terms of time off
er are we all agreed then we'll put down that there's a third
can i just point out though you see this the difference between nupe and UNK and that we haven't got a problem
with time off
we definitely have not got a problem
cos we will get it we know we will cos it's an agreement you see
your only problem it seems is erm you're not sure whether you're gonna get paid or time off or not
you know all this is i mean we've got a month actually which is a good thing but erm surely you must have some sort of agreements with the union and your and
we have we have an agreement relating to time off and time off with pay
mhm
and our agreement does not provide us for time off with pay for an event such as this
and yet they recognize unions and they ask you to apply your er to yourself
and you're trying to UNK all the unions together to make it easier for them
they're not prepared to er to make allowances for that disgraceful
the agreements that we have will not provide us with time off with pay for this purpose
well i appreciate what you're saying but
your agreement may be different from ours
aye
but
well it is erm
right
so i think we seem to be agreed that there we'll attempt to hold a seminar on friday the ninth here in this council chamber
each official will apply for time off their me members that they wish to attend
er if we find that we get a no answer from the employer in terms of paid release er the first reserve date will be saturday the tenth and we'll switch it to saturday if we if we can leave it in the hands of the three officers to get together on that without calling another meeting of the group i think might be better
just to make you again so it's not just the counties that i'll need to ask
that's right
it's the other six district councils as well
yes
mm
mm
so it's going to be erm you might only get a week's notice if it's going to be switched to the saturday then i would guess
cos it's gonna be three weeks before i get the replies from some of them isn't it
there is another small point
even though the county may say that staff can have paid release governors at schools can say no
and there's nothing the county can say about it
oh a school out on it's
yes
oh under l m s
yes
that's individuals yeah
individual school management isn't it
yes
but in our circumstances erm they wouldn't say no because obviously they're covered
there's somebody in there
yeah
doing the job i would be doing
i mean i'm not saying that would happen in every school cos they wouldn't they wouldn't get it anyway
i've never been to the head i've never been to the governors
know and she says okay ron yeah
no but UNK at the moment are in a different position
mm there's too many
the rest of the staff are still under the
er UNK of the governing body
can you switch it off
are you on or off
oh
why don't we leave this
you know i think we've gone over it long enough and leave it to see the er
yeah
leave the three officers to sort it out
anyway i don't think we it's we don't get any anywhere debating the why's and UNK
i mean we haven't actually had a knock back we haven't actually put the request in yet so if we can proceed on that format of applying
yes that's what we're saying mr chairman we needed to we particularly would
UNK test the water on that
yeah
er this week
UNK
i think it would have to be some time this week
yes
right
chairman could i also mention that the county council has a conference centre down in UNK park which i think is probably bigger er than this particular room erm may well also have catering facilities
the other aspect is of course catering facilities here on a saturday may not be the same as what they are during the week
yeah
that's true
it may involve additional cost if you're going to have the er UNK coming in for a saturday
specifically yeah
that that's a good suggestion
so i think what you're suggesting if we if we are moving it to saturday which er is likely erm we could switch the venue to UNK park but
i'm not suggesting you know the switch
just because of the weekend i'm suggesting it may be bigger
yeah
it may accommodate more people
yeah
er facilities er exist for parking and so on and the only thing is er i'm talking about catering in the sense of a saturday whether it's here or there
yeah
er i don't know what the catering facilities are on a weekend
in either location
yes
yes
er i mean i mean have we really thought this through because er if we're an anticipating having hundred and fifty people here which i suppose is of course about what we would hope for the response that nupe er as you know they would need to actually achieve the yes vote i mean we need this sort of room full er wouldn't it not be more sensible to split up between co or not would it not be normal for the tutor to expect the group to split up to address specific areas like i don't know labour party membership erm finance i don't know whatever
mm
now you've got a real problem here because you just er you know that this is the only room available
there's no other committee room available on that friday
er admittedly they'll all be available on the saturday but perhaps we would need you know we've perhaps a little bit more work to be done
mm
and that would be a s severe UNK if you're gonna have you know hundred and hundred to hundred and fifty people in here from ten to four i would
the suggestion you're not gonna get the benefit that you know those who not particularly wanna come forward or those of us who shout our mouths off will get the eye of the chairman
mm
but there are others who won't
yeah er very good point that yeah
i hadn't thought of that but er i mean it will be the group kind of er UNK i mean it won't be UNK to er a full meeting all day
so on that basis maybe UNK park would be a better venue cos there would be rooms adjacent i should imagine i haven't been in to UNK park
is there
rooms adjacent
to the main
so i'm lead to believe i haven't been to
i've been to it
yes there are plenty of rooms
and it would be more fitting for group work would it
yes i think so
and they do catering there
yeah
but whether they do it on a saturday i don't know
right
right well we're not there's nothing UNK up as it were
well it could it could be
either the ninth or the tenth it could be held here it could be held at UNK park
we might get paid release we might not erm and i think we're gonna have to leave it and make some further enquiries and get back
and the commercial services group here are UNK expensive for putting on saturday UNK
yeah
yeah
we may be better getting outside UNK
yeah
oh dear
right i think we'll
they are UNK expensive
yeah
we'll leave it we'll leave it at that
i mean there's nothing UNK up but
yeah two obviously we do need to clarify before the end of this week is one is in relation to the paid time off a and two is the UNK stroke UNK of the particular venue
er and that also UNK the would it be a friday or would it be a saturday set up
i think that those need to be clarified by i would say i'm saying well it's tuesday today definitely by the end of this week
mm
right
does it have to be in
mm
does it have to be in
because for some people it's as easy to get into newcastle as it is into
yeah
it's a six and two threes we've had a number of times
yeah
i think that i don't mind
i think better for parking
well check all the options open to us and then
yeah
well it's just it's just something to bear in mind
er yeah
i think i think i just had the feeling that the northumberland liaison group yeah meeting in northumberland you know
more fitting
erm i mean we'll put that down as a third reserve
if we can't get UNK park we'll move
we'll be on that boat up and down the river UNK at the finish that's were we'll end up i think
now the other thing i recall from the previous meeting rod seems to have minutes i think well he was looking at them before
yeah
erm was that we did elect i recall a local publicity group one representative from each union didn't we
yeah
has the group met yet
well we were supposed to meet after the last meeting which was cancelled
yes that's right
oh
that was cancelled because of the holidays
yeah
it was too close
so we haven't actually met yet
right
so i mean i think what we envisaged though was that the local publicity group erm would meet and see if the well first of all i suppose was there a necessity having seen what we've got from national level er necessity to produce a kind of newsletter a joint unison newsletter specific to northumberland that's what the group was going to have a look at wasn't it
so probably we can widen it out and have a discussion here this morning now that we have seen some if not all of the stuff that's coming from the respective head offices
would it be necessary and would we want er to supplement that with something no with northumberland in it or on it
you know like a northumberland type newsletter from the three organizations
well i think there is still some quite a number of questions that members are asking
as the ballot papers are going out on the twenty sixth
mhm
distribution of ballot papers on the twenty sixth of october about subscription
and nobody seems to be give us any answer to that
subscription level
yeah
contributions yeah
yeah
well
johnny
john
john
mm
john
no he's not here i think he's on the sick
he's not here
i think he's on the sick
oh
er i think that my recollection of the last meeting was that if we could just knock together a northumberland newsletter a unison newsletter that's quite clearly coming from the three organizations that represent the membership in northumberland it would be better than th this national stuff has one union on it as i see it at the moment
i haven't seen anything that all three erm may maybe that's yet to come
erm but i mean there's nothing in that we get from national level that has anything at all UNK to northumberland in it or on it has it
and i think that that's what we were UNK
we needed something to go round the various workplaces in northumberland that actually UNK a bit more to northumberland than the stuff we're going to get from national level
and from the branches of UNK nupe and UNK within northumberland had produced it under this kind of joint format
so i mean what i would suggest is er i don't know is john anticipated to be off for some time do you think
i don't really he was o he went off on friday
right
erm wh what i would suggest is the three that are on the group and if john's going to be off maybe somebody else from UNK would er step in to the group get together over the next two weeks or so and er try to jointly produce a northumberland newsletter
i think that's would be the only call on the publicity group really cos we'll have enough stuff from national level for the rest of the distribution won't we
i mean correct me if i'm wrong that's the way i look at it
i've drawn that up from the information i was given i don't know whether could you pass that on to
but again the u the information is erm needs to be updated
these are all the same we hand them round can we
no that's there are just
oh they're all different
three sets because
oh yeah
but i didn't know whether that was something that you were looking for something more local
well i like that on the bottom
UNK nupe working together in northumberland
yeah
that's good
it UNK it
yes er yeah
yeah that's exactly what we're looking for isn't it
very good these yeah
unfortunately everybody hasn't got one
oh we've got
i can alter them quite easily you see
yeah
yeah
erm have we got the facility
i i've got the i do i've got a desktop publishing
yeah
package at home you see
i'm just thinking for this meeting if we could photocopy some
yes
everybody can have a look at them
any we've lost our secretary
that would be a start
i isn't there a danger of us becoming a committee a publicity committee you know
i'd hate to try and work out a leaflet in a committee this size
UNK
oh yeah n no we're just more or less
oh i see
for information today
just for information right
i mean one member of the committee has produced something which i rather think you might all like to have a look at it
as opposed to just three of us looking at it
yes chair in relation to publicity i mean th there's one sole objective and that's in relation to the ballot concerning unison
mm
and i think if we concentrated on that otherwise even with the publicity group you'd end up with them saying well what
yes
what use can we put all this
yes
you know
and it becomes you'd never actually get the thing printed and you'd never actually get the thing distributed because you you're wondering what to put in what not to put in as it were and sticking to the UNK er at least it's getting it's getting something out and i don't personally i don't see any real problem in UNK it further and as much to indicate right without obvious prejudice to the new union erm to indicate er in some general or specific sense if that doesn't sound like sort of like UNK on the UNK of representation for members within northumberland come unison
you know bring that in as mary's put in this stuff there
she's talking about improved representation and UNK that in relation to the northumberland area which wouldn't UNK what whatever flows from structures and branch structures in the UNK period er which is you know good six months to a year away as it were
yes but i've got a thousand members in my i'm district secretary i've got a thousand members at least
mhm
who don't really know what unison is
yes well yes it's
they'll just think it's a pair of boots er haven't got a clue what unison is or what it's gon they know they're gonna try and UNK the unions to strengthen that's what i never managed to get through
very good mary
but they're not prepared to leave nupe let go of something you know unless it's better than what they've had
and the past few years have been good years of course
erm since we've got we are on top of the world
you know erm we've recruited more we've enjoyed it more
erm and they're more inclined to listen shop stewards and believe the lies we tell them you know
and a lot of kids just think oh erm well they're not full lies but they're it will be will be better cos we don't even know ourselves do we
can you erase the lies from the tape
i mean in some respects this is very good mary
i mean i th i think in some respects
some of it's some of it is out of date
yeah
yes
yeah well i think er of more value would be just to people here present going away and between now and the seminar on the eighth or ninth is actually trying to get the negatives
because if we actually can address th those real concerns you know you know the point that brother just made about why should he leave you to join unison try and UNK that out in a northumberland way if that's possible it may not be it may be difficult on a short UNK a five leaflet it will probably service because i mean it c it can be UNK there's nothing wonderful i mean it doesn't have to be sort of the most wonderful printing techniques and giving them desktop publishing
all i was doing there steven
yeah
was to try to see how things could be reduced and UNK
right yeah that's fine
but i mean i think if we can actually feed some information through on that on that weekend
yeah
that friday or that saturday
yeah
that could be as UNK those issues which have come from members could be addressed i think we might achieve what we're after
you know things like UNK in people's minds i don't know whether i suppose this question of fees might still be i don't know it depends what the national executive say but i mean i think it's those issues and the fact we can respond quickly is will be an advantage
i mean then we've then have what two weeks to produce a leaflet which should be quite easy to achieve
well yes because thanks to mary we've got the erm we've got a good UNK
mm
which just would need to be you know as i call it UNK a little bit more
erm you know hopefully by that time will be clarified
but we could easily
it's something that's better than nothing
you know er briefly er a amend er on to using this as a UNK as it were
so UNK you you're main you're main work's actually done isn't it
aye
i think we've go i think we've got to get through to the members actually that together as a we're gonna be a UNK force for the benefit of the members
cos let's face it the
the authorities are or the employers are gonna gain from the fact that we're gonna be a new union that at first we're gonna be trying you know to you know you've got to walk before you run haven't we
they're gonna gain from that or they're gonna be seeing that they think they gain from that and all you've gotta get over to the members we're gonna be a UNK force and that we're going we are going to fight some day together for them
you see UNK suggested at that last meeting that we had just small leaflets that we could give to all members
you know the publicity from us would be like a small i don't know what size just a small leaflet
a five
a five that you can give to each individual member
well that would be better i think this approach wouldn't it
but the point is at the end of the day they've got to be approached in a just giving them a bit of paper
right
to run away
i think i to be quite honest correct me if i'm wrong with regard to the publicity group that the publicity group really was to get something out that was going to act as an UNK to the members
i mean you identify ones who never heard the word
etcetera
right erm now that's understandable er even members who get stuff posted directly such as you know we've had a direct mailing system for quite a few years now when you meet them you say what about i don't know what you're talking about
and you know they've had the book
yeah
you know i mean you er it's al i think the same would happen if you put a five note in inside it would get thrown out with the rubbish but erm the thing is that obviously some early day if one can say in inverted commas early day publicity erm from the northumberland side of things could a and i mean my view when UNK was telling me what happened at the last meeting erm was that was gonna be acting as an UNK as opposed waiting till the last minute somebody's gonna and they think erm as it were a and build up from that because there's obviously gonna be one or two other things coming directly from national level
not a lot but one or two things direct from national level
er but as i say if we can do it on a UNK basis er UNK basis it gives it more identity er then what you produced certainly i is halfway there to the issues that steve mentioned earlier on
we could slot in our ag our agreed words erm that wouldn't have to wait till the regional liaison group met because we've just got the three UNK king UNK hopefully er and try and er you know UNK that
you see most of us er in the union have got a like a branch meeting next wednesday right
it's an ideal opportunity to get people right
or you know whatever turns up
i'll pass on this information i've received which i normally do
then i'll call a district meeting where i'll get other branches together erm shop stewards and that and i'll pass this information i've let them know there's such a thing as
i've let them know it's going ahead erm and that the vote is coming off
but it's up to us now to UNK it before the actual vote otherwise they're just gonna throw their ballot papers away they're not even gonna bother voting
and the ones that do that voting against
cos that would that would be the hard part
mm
the hard part would be sweeping up after
mhm
because if you have a group of workers or individual workers who are immediately faced with a steep rise in contributions
oh yeah
without any UNK benefit starting at the same day that is your that is your problem
but you see
the way we the way i look it see the way we've been cut and UNK and i'm not just talking about high schools and first schools or anything right we've been destroyed we've been literally UNK into the deck
and the union i mean i'm not blaming just nupe i mean every union but we seem to have stood still and nothing's happened and th and the m and the members are actually sick of their lies about what am i paying all this money for then
now i would approach it on the lines of here's your opportunity it's not just erm nupe mind UNK joining er UNK joining and we're gonna be one hell of a force
had one at a time to UNK with before
now it's got the three and we're UNK for each other you know playing on the same side
erm conditions cannot get worse now they'll only get better
and that's the way to look at it that's the way to put it to them
and to the normal UNK that sounds better than not say nothing at all
now you can say to them well we're gonna be struggling we well we must be we've got three voices
will be
we will be bigger we will be stronger
well that's it you've got to be UNK aha
therefore we will in future be able to negotiate better
but it's always will in advance but you're asking them immediately for more money
well no not er not in the cases of er lisa mentioned there because quite honestly some of them will be paying less especially
some will yeah but i'm thinking about the people who
a lot of your UNK might be
well a UNK gets a hundred and ten pound a week he's not gonna pay more than a hundred and twenty one pence which he's paying now
and i mean to say that's in all honestly that's what'll happen they'll pay less i should imagine
can't imagine somebody on a hundred and ten that will be paying more than a hundred and twenty one pence
i mean i can understand the point of will
mhm
you know UNK but you erm you can't use the word now
it's the same in the majority er of major issues in life like er erm like when you get married you're UNK i will always love drop the honour er
and it's the same at a general election or local election you know when we get into power we will
so you i know what you're saying but i mean it's plain
i mean is it ian
is it ian
ian yeah
ian said that judging from the basis of the that some of the nurses there are gonna be paying a hundred and twenty percent more whatever it was in contributions
that's based on each individual er at the at the moment
right good
h how would you go to somebody like that and say well yeah we we'll be able to negotiate for you better in the future and we might be able to get more er be better conditions of service than you've got now but as of now you're gonna be paying this much more in contributions
you haven't anything UNK to give them back in return on the extra money straight away
this is gonna be the hard part to get it
you see you're all talking about contributions in or an ability to pay but based on what
where there has to be a starting figure and it's never come out
and i'm asked every well not say every day of the week but most weeks i'm asked somewhere well where are you gonna start from
are you gonna take the figure starting from one twenty and take it up from there and down from there
or
there's nobody
er quite right the people want to know
this is what we're talking about forget about all everything else that's basically want to know
plus they want to know how the branches is gonna operate
nobody's said how the branches is gonna operate
are the branches gonna remain the
same way the same set up
they want to know
and they don't get the answers
and this is gonna a big no
natural and i'm and i never was but i like to know what i'm voting for and i like to tell the people who i'm responsible for what they are voting for
and so far it's
i think that
yeah i think
we're just running round in circles
yeah i think on the er i it isn't for us here to decide the level of contributions
er and we i thought we'd agreed earlier
we are going to get from the three national executives erm a list of what the contributions are going to be
it's in their hands at the moment er as far as i know they are going to let us know that in the very near future certainly long before the ballot papers are actually distributed to members
so we will know what the contribution levels are going to be
it is er as i see it they've gone back to the drawing board with where the bands are actually how it's UNK
and i recall seeing the lowest contribution i think was fifty pence wasn't it
you know for a part time worker on low earnings
what ranges from fifty pence to two pound fifty a week
that's what they were weren't they
well they were sort of like rough figures given in relation to er
you s you see you cannot deal with rough
pending discussions but the whole thing mr chairman really hasn't erm hasn't been decided to you know er a few colleagues point er i mean there's nothing we can actually start and you can put pencil to paper on at the present time
erm i think what we have to do in particular as full time officers is probably try and er and erm chase things up although they they're within the UNK of the UNK the respective UNK but to try and make sure that they do get some clearer if not confirmed insight into re in relation to the contribution aspect
erm so as we could possibly erm lend it to er a pending news UNK that would come out in relation to northumberland
i think and that really is about as much as any of us can say
i mean we could all spend all day discussing that particular issue but up until the decision is made and which road they're gonna go down we do know it's gonna be UNK but on what on what basis is it gonna be
that's the thing
you know we could spend we could spend a month i know there's a lot of figures floating around
no
you know and various things like that but none of them actually mean any concrete decision on that
mm
well i think if yes
as important as the erm subscriptions in the new union will be i think we need to also address the fact that we are saying we're gonna fall for members aren't we
we can't say now we can give you these new services and we can't say we will give you the services as we're just UNK
i think we're gonna have we've all got and face the fact that we've gotta give them increased union activity before the ballot
mm
to high to give them high profile anyway
cos you know
yeah
i mean can anybody answer that
i don't know and i'm
er UNK er
who
it's UNK
the thing is yes we we've got a ballot out on a pay increase
now we actually here and we've only got erm a short time to get round these people very short time erm and get this back in otherwise the ballot will go against or for with no members voting
now we've got to race against time again this is not just happening in nupe it's happened all over and it's gonna it's happening in this union before it starts
the protection clause will
there's nice little things like that sick pay er major UNK and all this
you know that this is telling the members it's UNK the members before they sign it you wanna accept that pay rise or not
it's a UNK four percent but you've got to try to get them to accept training and consultation
and it's exactly the same with joining this in fact it's more important joining this union as it is a different union altogether
it's more important than just one year's pay rise
it's your future
it's your defence
mm i think er what this stuff that i'm er knocking together here into a pack for each of you is a step in the right direction i think mary's done a good job here on this er
but some of it's out of date you know
yes but it's a start
it's a start
yeah
i mean this is exactly the type of material that we we're going to need to put out in northumberland
i mean p and if every leaflet i think has that UNK on UNK and nupe working together in northumberland that gets the message across to the members
you'll be you'll be getting a copy of this in the minute
can we mr chairman can we not suggest erm the fact that to the three executives that the subscription stay the same for three or six month period until unison and members are UNK on
subscriptions
er everybody stays as they are for three or six months
well we can't because the thing is the national decision has been made and within the final report to all the conferences this year
erm and it's been accepted and endorsed by three conferences right
so it's too late
i mean i don't know i mean somebody er our respective conferences could have raised that er and the UNK gone ahead and it's been voted on and said no i mean i don't know
erm but it's too late for that
i it's too late for that
i think in addition to that erm well i wouldn't want to say too much
other than in that respect it would erm it would reduce representation to UNK members i would say by about forty percent at the present time before structures etcetera were sorted out
i mean i may have been being a bit naive as a general sort of just a rep within UNK i'm not i'm not although i've had all the publicity and yes i'm sometimes you do not the course
and they're all genuinely things apology or whatever reason there are things that i genuinely don't know
that's what i think
and i think you've gotta address my doubts because if i have doubts how am i going to stand in front of members and say hang on a minute i can give you all of these answers i can tell you what UNK going to be like and this is what's been decided now come back to me and give me your fears give me your doubts and i'll go and take them on to represent you
how can i do that
how can i stand up and do that
i don't know
i think that's one of the purposes mr chairman also of the of the educational seminar that we're in the UNK of organizing to actually to do that
to educate advise
th a after the seminar
the activists who then can go out i like the disciples in a sense erm to the to the new membership
if you don't mind me saying i think it's a little bit late in the day
i said this all along unfortunate fell holiday time
i'm sorry to say but i think that we're talking about this education day at the beginning of october and i mean god knows we've known this is coming for it's almost as if we've got to the UNK of you know like UNK just about to throw ourselves off the cliff and we don't know why we're going to do it
we can't stand there in front of members and put ourselves in the firing line if we don't know the answers to their questions
yeah
well
th this has been UNK on you by a group of activists sort of
mm
and
the problem has not been a lack of information the problem has been a UNK of information
nupe and UNK but certainly in UNK have bit the dust
er and it's written in a language that hardly anybody can understand anyway
yeah
er you know it's not plain english it certainly wouldn't
and i think the task really is to try to translate some of that stuff into english
mm
er you know er UNK perhaps er or whatever
i mean
there is a further UNK difficulty is as an UNK activist
UNK activist shall i call myself i mean a point of view mentioned recognition of the river authorities i mean erm the latest pay awards i mean we haven't had too much to UNK about have we this is what the m this is what we can do for the members
i mean we're up against a wall
i mean increasingly small authorities are effectively opting out of the national UNK now we can't ignore th
erm i mean i don't mind
no
i think i put your ideas up cos i wanna get that done bit
er i'd be perfectly happy if that was er
right no problem jolly good erm
this one er what's going on he said well what i been called for
mhm
have them turned on er and that's it well this school
and he's asked to put another one on for this morning
no
i said er if we get the rest up we'll in the vicinity was obviously not unusual
well i suggest we have a bit beautiful
a bit UNK the weather might
there's better for your
yes
good
i know i just i don't know why it's too much coming her to discuss
yeah
and they just UNK it in wants to know i know what he's when he when he or
that is well it's central
well i hope we will get something
mm
and that's been
right i've got you
you know he borrowed the UNK from me he brought it back in this
did he
would you rescue it for me
yes it would be a
it should stay clean when
ah yeah
are you sure
yes
right
probably today i ought to start moving the erm the UNK into the strong room into here
yeah be alright
is that alright
yeah fine
so that i take
there's a lot of work to do
mm well erm
well what'll tomorrow
tomorrow i can do it
yeah erm i'll put some
about half ten
yeah today
tomorrow
tomorrow right
so what if
yeah
that'll help
right got me
gotta stop at half past ten
ah i'll give you a shout
yeah
and go straight in
excellent
okay
okay
er does it want to be
yes it does
yeah for both of us
right the control panel erm sort of built in
and erm
sixty UNK two hundred and sixty UNK from
well if you get three amps we can have that er that
manage it to go from
yes
yes i'll put that one down i'll put that one down there i've got er
i've got to clear up
erm
kelly
you are once again doing it completely and utterly wrong
at the wrong place again
kelly you have been using
kelly you've done it again
can you walk the right way no now do it right kelly
let's see you actually do something for a change
how do you do this one down here
you should have
what else have you been doing wrong kelly
you've been using a brush instead of a UNK for spreading glue
the UNK
right
now i hope that only kelly has been doing things as desperately wrong as kelly has been doing them
looking around at all the there are a whole lot of people who have left the same even border all the way round instead of having an even border top and sides and leaving a bigger border at the bottom
which you'll remember you were told to do so that there's a space for your name
sarah stand up and come over here
sam will you stop doing that please my love and come across here so that you two don't
i'm using a white colour pencil here in order to draw a line from to the work that is being mounted on here
and you might say that the word has not been mounted on there
no it hasn't because we
can you see what i'm doing without me having to
or are you UNK by what you see
mm
no
it's a demonstration and the line itself is like UNK within a frame
and i should imagine that the light UNK the backing paper and that i've already UNK my work on the paper and my picture is already UNK just there
can i have my UNK back
and i'm now drawing
sorry
a white line about half a centimetre from the edge of the work being put on
right this is a UNK line round the sides of
does that make sense
just a white line
now you can make that look even UNK by making a second white line on the outside
and then moving the erm ruler slightly away from the border for the second line over the top of it which makes it UNK
so you've got a thin white line on the inside and a UNK white line on the outside
that's point one
point two is this that i made the bottom border there er about be exactly five centimetres
and i'm going to put a guide line which is one erm er half a centimetre from the side there
yes christine can i help you
i've put two very faint white lines there in white
you could use ordinary pencil are you alright UNK
have you lost something
aye i was just
you then write your name in block UNK
what's your name
jane
j a y n
yeah
so imagine you were writing jayne here j now it's a very long name jayne and you have to put the title on there too so i couldn't put it all in capital letters on this occasion could i
probably that was a little bit on the large side anyway so i would use lower case as well on this one a bit like a bit like junior school writing
do you know what i mean
then it'll fit on very easily
you have to use your common sense
but you can see how a white pencil on that paper that's going to look quite smart
without the picture
so that's the next stage
go
just on the floor at the front here would you people just pick up one or two of the things that you have in front of you and hold them up above your heads please
oh
so that everybody behind you can see what they are
turn them around in your hands
a minute
and what are they
UNK
UNK which have been gathered from all over the UNK
just put that to your ear
do you hear anything
could you can you hear anything
you can't
i can hear a train go by
i wonder if that was
not that one
can't hear anything
that's a UNK
right
shh
right
well good afternoon everybody
good afternoon
well time for some introductions
my name is chris
and my name is UNK
hello
some of you may know UNK already
me
you do
well you are very fortunate people
but none of you will know my friend over here whose name is donald
hello
hello donald
wh who i think is a friend of UNK
at any rate he is got very big ears and i'll tell you why
because he goes around the country with his tape recorder finding out what's going on
and he's very interested in collecting would you believe not just stories
UNK
not UNK but words
oh
and he's collecting lots of words to put into a very large book
but he's not a UNK
he's a UNK and a UNK of words
just as you might be a UNK and UNK of stories
are you any of you UNK of stories
some of you are
well i've got some stories that i'd like to share with you but there's a condition
if i tell you a story you'd have to agree to tell it to somebody else
do you think you could do that
yes
no i couldn't
you couldn't
well will you try and listen to these stories and see if you think there's one that you like that you might like to share
mm
alright
now the first story that i've been asked to tell specially comes not from this country we'll just let our lads here get dressed because you knew that the story was gonna come from a very hot country did you
no
you took your clothes off for it
well the story that i have to tell you to begin with comes all the way from a very hot and very large continent
does anybody know any large UNK where it's a very hot place
oh the centre line of the earth
what's that called the centre line of the earth
mm
d'you know
i can't remember
the UNK
the UNK
well done
is that the word you were thinking of
yeah
great you took the word out of her brain
put it back later
a hot country which has the UNK running through it
the country i'm thinking of is africa
oh that place
right
would you like to hear a story from africa
yeah
alright
some of you may know this story
i wonder if you do
it's the story all about a man who had two very nice daughters
an excellent choice
the man's name was UNK
and he had two daughters and their names were manyara and nyasha
UNK was a very proud father
both his daughters were very beautiful and he also thought they were very wise
but manyara when she was alone with her sister nyasha was not always very nice to her
she bullied her
one day she said i'll become the queen and then you'll have to do everything i say
you can be my servant
alright said nyasha
if that's what's going to happen i'd be pleased to work for you
but don't go around being so cross
everybody likes you better than they like me said manyara the elder sister
that's not true people like you as well said nyasha
but don't go around being cross or you'll only make UNK for yourself
nyasha never told her father that manyara was being nasty to her because she didn't want to upset him
nyasha had one place where she was very happy though
outside their little house she had a little plot of land
and that's where she did her gardening
she grew UNK she grew UNK she grew vegetables and UNK and the food she shared with all the family
and one day when she was working in her little garden UNK between the UNK there came a green UNK
now in africa you must be careful of UNK because some of them are poisonous
but nyasha knew this UNK and she wasn't afraid
my friend UNK come to me she said
you are very welcome here
you will keep away all the little creatures that would like to eat my vegetables
you can come here any time
and she made a little UNK in the ground which filled with some water and became a little pool for the UNK to drink out
as she worked in her garden nyasha who was so happy sang a song
not only to herself not only to the vegetables but also to UNK
and she pulled up the weeds and she pulled up the UNK
and she gathered the vegetables
and every time she sang her song the people knew that she'd be coming back
and that's the reason they believed why her vegetables and her UNK grew so
one day a messenger came from the great city more than half a day's journey away across the river to say that the great king had decided that he would like to have a wife
and a UNK went out to everyone who lived far and near to say that he was looking not only for a beautiful wife but also the most worthy wife that could be found
and he wanted all the girls who were interested to come to the great city
manyara took her father to one side
father she said please don't send nyasha
she would be so lonely to be without you
it would break her heart to have to go away even to be wife to a king
i tell you what father i'm your eldest daughter i will go to the city and i will become queen
and then you will have nyasha to look after you
my child said UNK her father that is very kind of you but the king is the person who is going to choose
he is the one who'll decide who is most worthy so you must both go
and that is what was decided upon
well that night everyone went to sleep because if there was going to be a wedding everybody in the village would surely have to go
and everybody knew that would be a great journey
but manyara was not happy
she got up at night and she set off towards the city all by herself travelling through the forest
she had never travelled alone through the forest at night before
and she was a little worried
and she was a little afraid
there were animals who lived in the forest who went out hunting only at night
she set off with only a little food and she hadn't gone far when a small boy appeared right in the middle of the road
please he said i am so hungry
may i have some food
boy she said you're in my way
get out of my way
i am going to the city
i am going to become your queen
move
now
and she UNK past him and continued down the road until she came to a place where two UNK crossed and there was a little clearing
in the middle of the clearing on a stone sat an old woman who smiled at her and said hello manyara
you're very welcome
take that road to the city but be careful
the trees may bend and seem to laugh at you
do not laugh back
and when you get further towards the city on a little rise of the land you'll meet a man with his head under his under his arm
be careful
and do not be rude to him in any way
goodbye
how do you know my name
said manyara
and my journey is no business of yours
you foolish old woman
and she turned and went on down the path
and no sooner had she done that than the trees began to wave their branches towards her
and they seemed to laugh at her
ha she said and laughed back as though trying to be brave trying to be strong
but the trees still UNK in her ears
and then she came to a small rise in the land and there was a man his head under his arm
you're in my path she said
get out of my way
i am going to be a queen and i do not people speak to people who UNK me
and she walked around him did not look at him
and she arrived in the city
next morning nyasha UNK back in her home village the younger sister
there was great UNK outside
people were worried
people were UNK here and there
they were all looking for manyara
where could she be
what could have happened to her
wait
called someone
here is her UNK on the path leading towards the city
she must have left already said UNK
we must all follow
and nyasha and all her family and everybody from the village made a long line and set off through the forest
they hadn't gone far when at the side of the road they saw a small boy
little boy she said
you look so hungry to me
here take this food
and she offered him half of the UNK that she had brought with her
thank you he said
and on they travelled through the forest until they came to a place where the roads crossed and there sat an old woman resting on a stone
she smiled at her
old woman she said you look tired
and the woman smiled but pointed at the direction that they were to go
thank you said nyasha
here share my UNK seeds with me
and she gave her a packet of UNK seeds
and on they travelled until they reached the rise in the land
and nyasha ran up to the top of the rise and saw the land and the city all below her
oh father she said this is so beautiful
i've never seen such a beautiful country in my life
surely there must be some wonderful things happening here
lead on said her father and he lead the way till they came to the flowing river
carefully they crossed the river and they made their way into the city
but no sooner had they got to the city than they heard a loud UNK of a girl's voice
and manyara came rushing out of the temple
don't come she said
don't come
stay where you are
oh nyasha my sister please do not go into the temple
there is the most dreadful monster in there
he has five heads
and it's telling you about me
it's telling you all about
nyasha said don't worry my sister
we must not be afraid
we have come here to see the king and we must all go into the temple
her father UNK his eldest daughter
while nyasha UNK went into the temple and there sitting on the UNK that was made only for the UNK there sat not a king not a prince
a queen
not a man
a UNK
not a woman but a small green UNK
UNK said nyasha
what are you doing here
and the UNK spoke to her
i am not just a UNK he said
for i am indeed and as he spoke he changed into a young UNK man
the prince
with beautiful black skin and a lovely smile on his face
i am your king he said
but i am also UNK your UNK
i am also the boy who you met in the jungle
i am also the woman who sat at the crossroads
and i know you to be beautiful and to be most worthy to be my wife
will you please become my queen
and nyasha agreed
what a wedding there was to be
the king's mother and sister took her to their hut and they prepared the UNK clothes for her
and she baked some bread with the UNK flour that she had brought from her own garden
and there was a marriage
and there was a great UNK
and their father became the UNK man in the whole kingdom
nyasha lived with UNK her husband in the palace
and manyara worked as their servant

it wasn't in your time and it wasn't in my time
but it was a time when the boy and his mother who lived in a little cottage just outside the town had to earn their living from growing their own vegetables and doing what they could to help other people in order to make a living
he liked the cottage they lived in very much indeed
he liked the garden that they had very much indeed
he liked the path to the town
he liked the countryside all around
and he was so happy that he said to his mother one day mother i want to live for ever
oh my goodness she said i can't help you there
you'll need to go and get some advice from the head wife at the end of the village
and at the end of the village there lived an old woman who was very wise and said if you want to live for ever then you must speak to the person who's the oldest person i know
go and speak to the old man of the woods
so up to the woods and there in the woods he heard the sound of an axe
now do you know what the sound of an axe is like

and the old man stopped and put his axe down
i want to live for ever t said the boy
ah said the old man

and it was a huge forest and it went for ever
and he put his axe into the tree again and the boy thought he's gonna chop down all these trees soon
is there anybody else please who's going to live for a long time
ah said the old man of the woods there's the old man of the lake
and he is higher up the hill
so the boy UNK up the hill till he came to an enormous lake
then in the lake an old man came up from under the water and took a great UNK of water and UNK deeply
the boy had never been more surprised in his life
old man he said do you live here
i do said the old man who's hair was almost down to his waist
and i shall live here said the old man until i have drunk this whole lake dry
the lake was enormous and very deep
and the old man UNK again
oh said the boy you seem so UNK
eventually you'll have eaten and drunk all this lake
is there anybody who's going to live for even longer than that
ah said the old man there's one other person
it could be the old man of the mountains

and so he UNK to the mountains and there high in the mountains in an old stone building lived a man with hair down below his waist
old man are you gonna live for a long time
i am he said
i shall live here until these mountains UNK into the sea
oh that's a long time said the boy

excellent
well if UNK falls asleep will you take over
excellent
good
would you like to hear a story that has a UNK
yes
sit down on your UNK everybody now please
and we'll see what you think of this story here
in scotland by the shore there lived a UNK who's name was angus
he'd been a UNK all his life
he had his own little boat and do you know where farmers make UNK on the land the only mark that was left behind by angus was the mark where he pulled his boat up on to the shore every day that the weather was not too rough
the thing that he loved most of all in the whole world was the sea
and he would sing to himself in his house or in his boat the song which his father had taught him many years ago
he sang about his love of the sea
every now and then angus would go into the town
he'd drink a UNK with his friends
but they would say to him angus isn't it about time you found yourself a wife
someone to share your life with
he UNK his head
i could never love anyone who wasn't like the sea
wild free
he loved the sea so much
one day it was close to UNK a day not unlike today
angus had been to the town and he made his way back to his cottage along the shore
as he went he heard the music of the sea
he heard the sounds of some other voices singing on the shore
as he came up over the rise he thought he heard a beautiful song
some girls were dancing and singing on the beach UNK in and out of
as they played and as they sang and as they UNK they made no mark on the sand at all
angus was UNK
he hadn't heard such a beautiful sound he hadn't seen such a beautiful sight
as he moved his way down on to the beach he UNK knocked the stones and the girls saw him and rushed to the rocks where they picked up not clothes but UNK which they wrapped around their bodies and then UNK back into the sea
except for one girl who ran towards the rock where angus was leaning not just on the rock but also on a UNK
please she said that's my skin there
let me have it back
i must go with my people
i must have it
please give it back to me
the skin was so beautiful to touch and the girl had such a beautiful face
no he said i can't give it back to you you're the person that i've been looking for all my life
please come and live with me
please come and be my wife
i must go back to the sea she said
that's where i live
but angus had hold of the skin
and although she was sad she knew that she had to go with him and she did
up the shore they walked
and she UNK when her feet first touched the grass
back into the cottage he showed her the way and gave her so
the children had heard this song many times but they were always sad that it sounded such a lonely song
and while they played in the barn and while their mother sang the girl found something behind the UNK
it was soft UNK than anything she had ever touched before
she held it to her face and it was so beautiful
she told her brothers and they too put their faces into the soft UNK
mother they called come and see what we've found
and they all held out the UNK towards her
oh my children she said
she dropped the bowl that she was using to the floor
thank you
she put the UNK round her body and she UNK each of her children
and she UNK her daughter very tight
never forget me my dear she said
i will always help you in your future life
but boys you must all tell your father that he must look after you now
goodbye
and she took the skin and she ran down to the shore and she put on the skin UNK back into the sea
a UNK head UNK up from the waves and angus was pulling on his UNK the UNK back to the shore
a seal called out to him goodbye angus goodbye
look after the children for me
UNK
the seal UNK away and a moment later two seals appeared together in the water and UNK away together
the children told their father what had happened but he knew
but whenever angus and his daughter went out in the boat fishing for their lives to keep themselves fed it seemed that a seal UNK in front of the boat and lead them towards the places where the UNK were UNK in the sea in that part of the coast
and they never forgot their mother
and they never forgot how important the sea was in their lives
now that is the story of a seal wife
yeah
thank you all for listening
well
that's the end of our stories
and somebody has got a question
yeah my dad works in scotland
well i never
i wonder if he's ever seen a seal
and there are lots of people who live in scotland who tell stories all about the seals
have any of you ever seen a seal
shh
good
now one or two people have got something they want to ask
so let's listen please
and those people who've got their hands up boys
can you be quiet please so that we can hear the people who want to speak
i think before we ask any other questions we'll ask everybody to just have a stretch
everybody two arms and a big stretch and everybody have a big UNK
ooh
ooh
now is there anybody here who was born as an animal
everyone was
and so were you born as an animal
yes i was
what animal are you most like
a UNK
a UNK
that's very interesting
i'm a monkey
sorry
a human you're a human being
alright
i just wanted to make sure
right so everybody listen please
boys
donald has still got his microphone here and he wants to hear what everybody's got to say
and if we all talk at the same time he can't hear anything
he's come a very long way to see what you've got to say as well as hear the stories
now what did you want to say at the back
UNK some of class seven enjoyed the story that much story about seals before we came in
you've heard a story about seals before
yes
this afternoon we had a story called the seal king wasn't it
it was all about
really
yeah
it wasn't the same story but it was a story about seals
what a coincidence
what a strange coincidence wasn't it
oh absolutely
and what happened in your seal story
i'm doing some listening over here
a UNK caught a seal
a king seal out of the sea
a king seal
mhm
and what happened to the seal
and erm
shh
we're listening
that's a very good story
and those stories are very old
and for many years nobody wrote those stories down at all
so the fact that you've heard those seal stories two different ones is very important
particularly if you've written them down
you're not supposed to still be UNK
alright now i just wonder if it might be worthwhile just some people going back to the classroom now or some stay or
children class
children in class
will you sit down for two more minutes
all those people going now music

now i've got some questions that i'd like to ask you
everybody sitting on the floor please
everybody sitting on the floor
that's
i've got one or two questions i'd like to ask you and i wonder what your reply is gonna be
now in order for donald to be able to hear the replies as well we must only have one person talking at a time
i want you just to close your eyes for one minute everybody please
and i want you to think about the sound that you not touching anybody
sit down on your bottom and close your eyes please
everybody else can do it except for you
now close your eyes please very carefully

and what we're doing is collecting like the
of all sorts of different places schools meetings business meetings
to have a record in the english language is
right and to put it all back together to have some sort of record
dave have you done your er homework for er english
yes i done it last night
tony what's this stuff we're using in that one
miss what's the
we were using
it's the cow UNK
UNK
i say i usually use UNK but i say that grows wild in the school so we use that
oh it's raining
is it
we've got UNK after school
practice what
i ain't doing it
i'm sorry that i was unable to get well two things went wrong first of all the date of the UNK changed UNK and his friends in UNK due to circumstances beyond our control
but in this programme you'll appreciate this planned months its planned when did i first contact you oh february wasn't it right so we thought we'd have pictures here and sue would be talking in front of the pictures
i didn't know at that time what the content of the exhibition was because sarah who organised it all had to write to lots of people and arrange the loans and you know it is fairly recently that we discovered for example the UNK would lend their pictures because its very rare that they do erm and so we thought the next best thing when i discovered the change of dates would be to have slides of the pictures that sue was using but erm oh dear then wonderful that sue was using a another book and this term allocated and i wasn't able to get the slides she picked it was my fault that they're not on slide due to the amount of time that we had to do this
therefore i'm afraid were going to have to pass UNK book around we'll leave the lights on and erm she's changed the scripture of her talks so that she will be describing the picture UNK its been passed round and could you please sort of pass it fairly quickly i'll be at the back and then i'll come down into the front again is there anyone who's a UNK
i know i enter the poem when there is one
not every picture has its
some of these kinds telling you about how they write a poem if i was going to
right
but erm we'll spend start the whole questions again when we get to the next one
and we do have some of this slides which i'll show at the very end alright but it means it er erm the first part of the talk we'll keep the lights on and then could i ask you know to look and then pass it around like school
nobody looks back and i rush
oh yeah
right i'm pleased to introduce to us er against all these difficulties and the nearer you are at the front the better there's all stuff here look
i'm sitting at the back
anybody at the back would like to move nearer then sit here yes ok is that alright
well i think i'll start off by telling you a little bit about myself erm i'm a writer and i live in durham my work is here and i've also work abroad if anybody can't hear me please say
no
you can't hear me right ok i'll try and speak up a little bit louder erm my work i work erm here and i work abroad and i live in durham er i'm a writer and erm one of the things that i'm most interested in is using art as an UNK for my work as a as a writer and i'd like to be able to show you by this talk how i do that erm i have a few publications my work's performed by a local group actually based in newcastle and i'm a member of er a group called another story and my work's been put to music by a UNK and er a play and the play and sing that the pieces of
erm another area of my work is as i er writing workshops the writing workshops are very different from the normal writing workshops there based at UNK and they take groups of people round an exhibition recording their comments on either one particular picture or the exhibition as a whole and then with my help we put the comments into poems that are then displayed along side the UNK erm this work i do with erm all sorts of people with children people with special needs disabled people and that's really where my interest in art erm comes in and i find that its a great UNK for people who would like to express themselves and have perhaps have difficulty by UNK by looking at UNK and being able to see perhaps emotions or images that they feel themselves so in all areas erm i find painting in my areas of work painting influences me and has done for as long as i can remember
sometimes erm given me the questions and sometimes answering the questions for me its always UNK me and over the last few years i've erm i said that to try and understand erm how to use this information in my own work as a writer and i see i see UNK in all forms of art communication is of course one erm and the need to recognise and respond the plight of others is another area and the area that as a writer i'm particularly drawn too
physically and erm emotionally writing can be very UNK and so for example a few years ago i was writing a huge piece on africa about africa and i found emotions growing that i actually didn't have names for erm and it made it impossible to finish the piece i was working on and then i went to see an UNK asian exhibition of art and i saw UNK some of these UNK the same emotions and it didn't give me a name for the emotions but it made me feel an awful lot less isolated seeing that erm other people have also have also felt this
so i was going to UNK through these slides and we don't have them erm so i'll have to i'll hand the book around in just one minute erm the poems that i'm going to read to you very few of them are actually complete most of them are UNK erm ideas and images of erm that i've got i've got them from the UNK
sometimes when i write a poem i want to create a particular mood erm giving the piece erm a shape a definite shape or just a UNK shape erm and the UNK in er UNK i found very UNK and the starting point for this particular poem i'll hand this round to you know with the name of the front right i don't has anybody if you already know this picture does anybody actually know it already no i start with the UNK obviously erm very UNK not just because it was people wear over UNK in cold days but it was the size of the coat and the shape of it and it gave me a weight i felt er i felt a very definite mood erm about this picture because of the coat and it was a er a UNK mood that i that i felt from that and the stick in the erm hands of the women over the bridge gave me the sound for this poem would you like me to read as the thing being passed around would that be ok
yes
ok this UNK called erm a pause in a moment worn out days dressed in damp wheat heavy coat pulling at tired shoulders memory pushed back brought forward in the click of a stick pause in a moment UNK reflected in eyes offering the warmth of recognition so that poem started with the UNK and that was the mood as i say that was the mood of UNK erm and there was something about the way the old girl was looking at the women on the bridge almost as if there was this recognition and as it brought back memories that perhaps went or as black as the UNK erm the next er painting which i'm going to read to you about is erm have you
its the four UNK girls and does it do any of you know i'm sure most of you some of you have heard that
erm when i was looking at this picture of the of the UNK girls i erm i was really particularly struck by the bo the mild head of one of the UNK and the fact that she was rubbing her heal erm and it gave me a voice for this poem i was also drawn by the dismissal there's a UNK in the painting there's four UNK and one of them is UNK the winner UNK and erm i found his look very interesting and i couldn't help but compare the lies of these four UNK with those within erm from the later period as the eye that UNK painted later on
this UNK called dancing feet time found hidden in a hard day dry earth becomes a dance floor audience of three UNK the fourth along with a UNK turns it back wooden shoes meant for mud rug on dancing feet erm and if you if you take were oops trying to pay particular attention to if you can see the UNK in this one here there's a fate there's a there's a UNK which is missing what's going on and er and the reason well in fact er which was er very much a UNK point for me in that painting
i think its got to be better if i hold it different
it is but then you won't be able to compare the details against the
well could you we pass it round twice
yes you could pass it round twice that's ok with everybody
yes
erm how shall we do that as its going read it again now
yes
ok time found hidden in a hard day dry earth becomes a dance floor audience of three UNK the fourth along with a UNK turns it back wooden shoes meant for mud rug on dancing feet erm the next one is the still life on with three UNK while i was looking at UNK work i couldn't help but notice he's constantly struck by the fact that he use set of three symbols through out his work it seems and very often three UNK erm or lines of three or three objects and i found this very interesting more point of view that something that i wanted to incorporate in my own work but i wanted to find a line or a phrase to use in the same way erm all of my work starts as one or a series of visual images and i then turn them into characters repeating a word or repeating a line would be a way of erm UNK erm and the UNK that are in this painting erm they delighted my children so much i don't know if any of you know do you know the painting of the three UNK
its going to come round at you in a minute so i'll talk about it until it gets to you erm it delighted my children this particular painting erm and i decided to put my sort of UNK approach to one side erm and do something with that later so this poem is from my children's point of view and one of the things that are very interested they were really worried that erm i think it marks the height of the table and the fact that the UNK might fall off and do themselves some harm that i'll read it while its going round and then i can see then that so this is ok from my children's point of view this poem its called threes table laid and waiting milk place in bowl not to high they lap and UNK played and roll UNK distance from knocking and breaking UNK made from clay
there's something else the children were convinced that the UNK weren't actually clay the UNK that were on the erm the table as opposed to
would you like me to read that poem again would that be helpful right we were
with the of the erm the picture threes table laid and waiting milk place in bowl not to high they lap and UNK played and roll UNK distance from knocking and breaking UNK made from clay
the next one is erm van UNK sun flowers that's it that one its erm well its UNK van UNK sun flowers
ok i'll talk as its going round again if that's alright with
is that alright
erm putting images into words is not always easy a colour in a painting can give you a way in and the brown of van UNK jacket erm affected me with this one particularly and the sun flower i felt was inappropriate UNK in a UNK to small erm and it gave me an image a very strong image of suffering and this poem is in its very early stages and its literally just a list of images and i wanted to be able to show you how i start off which is with a series of images and then i have to put some UNK in and open them up a bit and make them more accessible and understandable but this is just a list form
sun flower UNK water less UNK suffering eyes UNK in UNK so from that painting i had a tremendous feel of something UNK tremendous suffering and seem very desperate about the situation and i didn't just see that in the picture of van UNK but i could see that in the sun flower so as a writer its images like that i would look for and open up and turn into characters or a way of UNK a particular mood erm the next one were doing very well
its UNK
i suppose this is erm a UNK a self portrait this little i in fact i was really actually UNK as i felt that i don't actually know an awful lot about UNK but if i knew nothing about him at all i would of thought he was having a bit of joke of himself with this but er being the person that he was i can't image that he had that quality that i don't believe he would be laughing at himself erm the UNK erm and conflict of this painting its UNK me more than the colour or at least as much as the colours in it but there's a there's a half eaten well it isn't half eaten but there's half an apple at the top and that was the way into me finally for writing about this again is a shopping list i call it a shopping list this is just visual images that will be opened out at some point and turn it into something and my images were erm shoulders of the UNK smoking UNK dare to bit an apple see one half gone and still i wear a UNK that i'm sure i've completely wrong about him as a person but as the painting that's obviously something else erm i found that one of the things that were he's i think probably that everybody who writes is that you'll come to a point when you can't write you stop writing you haven't got anything you want to write about or your frightened of writing and i devise exercises so that doesn't happened to me i think writing is like any skill you have to keep doing it to be able to do it its you some of it is a game and the rest of it is hard work and one of the exercises i delighted using erm a portrait of a woman erm its about erm the er still life its the back one yes this one here i have i hope to use this as a writing exercise i found the maths in this and the colour of the piece of fruit in the background very interesting because most of the colours to me seem a lot less UNK then many of his other UNK and so they attracted me and have a strong sense of erm er a hidden desire in that and so it to use it as a writing exercise which i intend doing it will be able about a situation of UNK with erm something that's hidden some desire i don't the not even spoke about to themselves or generally erm i like to sort of say that came from those two little just this amounts of colour which seemed to be saying such a lot
anything i do
if erm while this is going round you have any questions now would be now would be a good time to ask them if you have any there will be time at the end to talk you can do
have you check to see if your
well erm sort of in that erm i was asked to come and do this talk and so i organise to make sure that i had access to some of UNK work and then to write poems about it erm so erm only in as much as that it was a waiting to hear this talk but a lot of my work is through commissions and so i find myself writing about things that i perhaps don't have any interest in particularly erm or i find actually in a waiting asked to write about anything is quite er exciting and actually using my skill i think it should be as a writer i should really be able to write about everything
one of the things i was asked to write about this week i think was a radio to write about er what i felt about UNK you know er erm so anything could be thrown at you and obviously i have my areas that i particularly interested in and i think sometimes i get a bit UNK and i'm writing about a i find particularly interested in and a bit lazy so its quite good to be stretched
erm the next one we'll shall go erm go to market will do yes that's right no
no
you've got the wrong one
i was gonna say this is definitely not going to market
yes no she's not going to market
this one are you sure your not going to market
this one i this is one of my UNK i love this painting
the movement of this reminds me of er stage set and the figures on the bench could almost be actors and UNK and with the figure at the bottom here the male at the bottom well its not quite at bottom UNK away at the side there he looks like erm like a UNK figure maybe a UNK maker er i felt there was a lot of fun in this painting and a lot of erm er UNK and stage UNK that kind of thing so this poem is called for obvious reasons people of the UNK and i'll read it twice probably be the best way ancient people drawn on a UNK tell a tale warn a friend man dressed in red holds back a curtain over hears and tells they are UNK people playing chinese UNK so i quite wanted to give that er a contemporary updated feel erm i read that again for the people who may of just seen the picture at the back people of the UNK ancient people drawn on a UNK tell a tale warn a friend man dressed in red holds back a curtain over hears and tells they are UNK people playing chinese UNK erm the next one we'll have to put you on wheels i think
your
this is erm this is a bit like i went to an UNK at erm UNK street and all the UNK were brought out by hand by the
erm
keeps watch i'm sure this is a this side of
i in fact i've just been shown a different copy of this UNK has just shown me a different copy and the UNK is totally different its a very poor erm print and when i was looking at this through my book the background was very strange and i felt that almost had been painted by a totally different artist but having seen UNK er UNK
is much more of a go down in colour erm so i think probably if i'd seen her er prints i maybe i would of approached this erm differently erm it gave me a very immense voice about crowds erm very different from the front of the picture apart from the alarm registered in the eyes of the of the old woman erm this is called even UNK has its end sorry even UNK has its price sorry ours in the night laying between sleep and arousal held in balance UNK as dust on a scale night UNK sit easy in no hurry even UNK has its price would you like me to read that one again
yes
as i say all these UNK are very dense and erm if i get round to completing them they'll probably have at least another verse certainly extra words and UNK that open it out and make it a bit more UNK ours in the night no i've got it wrong sorry i've moved on and i UNK done
that's it
this is right ours in the night laying between sleep and arousal held in balance UNK as dust on a scale night spirits sit easy in no hurry even UNK has its price
the next one is not working this one here erm the light UNK split here
erm falling on the ground is the UNK of the of the UNK aunt
people and animals UNK in this in the UNK painting never seemed to be in a hurry erm even when always relaxed even when working and i wondered how much of this was cultural and erm how much was due to the large amounts of erm drugs UNK in most UNK at this period but that i suppose i'll never know for sure about erm with this painting i found in the background er there's a figure that's looking in on the situation and i for myself think's its probably UNK as he UNK himself as christ which i think he did quite a lot to me in a few of his UNK and so this painting gave me tremendous sense of being looked in on and this figure in the background was the person that was doing the looking in
this is called it was good in the afternoon when the sun half close his eyes UNK can be found not working dogs in their cool places UNK wall slice through heat hold and let go of light in rays in the afternoon when smoke UNK like the back of a cat people lean and UNK hair someone dressed like christ looked in and said it was good
would you like that one again in the afternoon when the sun half close his eyes UNK can be found not working dogs in their cool places UNK wall slice through heat hold and let go of light in rays in the afternoon when smoke UNK like the back of a cat people lean and UNK hair someone dressed like christ looked in and said it was good now we have the dug out how food is presented erm can say so much at least it does to me and so that so that the beginning of this poem became from er the food piece of food held in the hand of the mayor in this picture
UNK erm have the power to take you back in time i can look at a painting and remember something that's happened yesterday or years and years ago and as a small child looking at this painting i remembered as a small child seeing for the first time erm the sea UNK into er sorry the sun UNK into the sea and being horrified i was convinced that the heat of the sun would boil the UNK and the world dry and it reminded me for an awful lot of my childhood and i'm sure if i'd seen this painting years ago it would of persuaded me otherwise erm this is called in a days work satisfaction in a days work chosen not given eating the UNK food face turned to steer a sun making cloth into a UNK and giving colour to the side of a boat
what is it called again
in a days work satisfaction in a days work chosen not given eating the UNK food face turned to steer a sun making cloth into a UNK and giving colour to the side of a boat erm we know come to a
here comes the last er picture in my in my talk
this is erm this is going to be UNK here on the twenty third of july ok erm two of UNK pictures this is one of them and several other artists er of the same period and i think this is going to be the only venue in england i don't think there coming sort of worth seeing but unfortunately i shall miss it cos i'm i won't be here erm this is a poster of
i find this very difficult to erm to relate to relate hard work to the women UNK in this we've got the postcard of that one erm it must of been hard work and very UNK but i think every now and then the moment breaks away and UNK through at the back and i think people like UNK erm UNK those moments and then releases them on the UNK and i hope that erm by i hope i've been able to show you how i use art as a voice erm and a friend as my own work even though we've maybe had to do such a sort of hand UNK way hand UNK way erm but i i've recently started to re visit old favourite of UNK and i found that the story they tell sometimes has changed dramatically maybe sometimes when your very little that you know sometimes dramatically as well erm but i mostly most importantly its still i still find them all of them UNK and challenging and something to UNK for in my own work erm er only time will tell so i'll finish with the last poem which is erm comes from the postcard what's going round which is harvest its called patterns in the grass wheat cut and falls making lion head patterns in the grass UNK shaped women bend and bow as a naive dressed as a dog UNK the evening meal
i'll read that again wheat cut and falls making lion head patterns in the grass UNK shaped women bend and bow as a naive dressed as a dog UNK the evening meal
thank you very much for being so
its been very difficult for everybody and i do hope you've managed to you get something out of out of this talk if you have any questions i'll be very happy to try and answer them
i'd also like to er i attend i've got a performance tomorrow night in durham so if any of you want to come to that it would be very nice to see you erm if there are any questions please feel free to ask
have you done many
no i its not my UNK i have tried and i really can't i can't cope with the discipline of it at all it er ruins the activity that i have i know some people one woman i was on the course with it wasn't you was it UNK it was somebody was it you who worked no
somebody else that er we were doing a course with who had a tremendous skill with high
and said so much into the
there's some woman i admire but i can't think what her
is
seem to focus in or
in art and you go for art by visual means rather than say a piece of music and subject
i don't know do you write
erm yes i do both my husband is a UNK and a UNK and erm just recently you well i'll show you basically that we exchanged skills and erm i
interpretations of his music erm i one of the things i would love to do and i'm hoping to do next year is to do something related to art using a dance
and words i think with three mix well actually mix it with
its exciting but that's one thing i really would like to work with
i was asking you cos i'm always having arguments with the
i myself i can see it as well
yes
and i think its
i was just wondering what you
very much the same
its the page is so important yeah very important
and this is what i think myself but lots of people
yes that's right yes
but i mean it depends also i suppose erm when your aiming for is the market and i would like to have my work published but i also like to perform it and its got to be attractive to be looked at in the first instance in on a page its not known er there is there is a lot of debate at the moment about using erm pages for poetry and some UNK have actually starting using writing from the wrong side and writing in the shape of a poem for instance if what poem i was thinking off was a was a UNK so it was UNK the words UNK you almost have to pick ha have a choice of words that you want to fit into a particular thing erm i think that's had its place but i think it can be a bit off putting as well yeah but it exciting yeah definitely
do you try any other
oh yes varied and there interesting with children particularly if they erm if i'm doing workshops er with art and writing workshops and we come across an abstract picture the children music and we as a way into their vocabulary which isn't as large as their writing skills and there'll UNK an abstract picture wonderful language and i like doing that you know
i'm thinking the
abstract art
yes
express
yes oh yes and erm going back to somebody asked me earlier erm about how it i feel i have to be able to write about just about anything erm and so if i was given commission to write about any one thing i would have to put myself in a position to be able to do it
i think this idea of writers shutting themselves away and writing has gone you know very
that is a luxury i think erm to be able to do it if you want to write and earn money which i do as well as UNK while i'm working erm you've got to find ways of doing that and erm just writing books and poetry just wouldn't i couldn't survive on that i really do have to find other ways of earning money which is enjoying more and also uses of my skill and erm i would think you'd need to be in contact with the situation rather than you not knowing being able to write about that
do you say whether you identify the picture only on
erm that was very
er i mean that
yes
then they UNK both of the
the visual image and the written words
i'm sorry what
do you identify the artist do you
oh i see yes i huh yes i would do i would say in quite definitely that these words are UNK by such a such artist and make it quite clear that i'm a writer and not a i don't study art or i just don't understand science and painting and its my responses to that yes
just seems that it to me must be wrong that it didn't identify them because a particular picture anyway the reason why i find difficulty in making
absolutely yes
way for them
the this is just one aspect of my writing and i write about all sorts of things and erm the shows that i do we use two artists that's erm i i've written erm two poems about erm er darren and erm UNK er you you've heard
and erm and i have assumed wrongly that most people will know the work of their
and luckily that the song that we did was funny and so people enjoyed it but they didn't understand it and they didn't have a visual image of the UNK work so i now have to take erm a couple of pictures er prints with me if ever were going to read it and we sing those songs but not everybody does and then they do become UNK you know they can see you know that erm yes erm if it if i was going to publish a book of poem i it would have to be stated that this related to this picture and presumably it'd have to be it would be with it with it
if anybody would be interested in doing
does when you've finished the poem you read it out
yes
that's right yes
that's right yes it should erm these aren't completed but even so the ones that we i have done that too i've opened out having performed them you still need to have a little bit of an idea
that's right
of the artist
yeah
but as a as a piece of work in it yes that's right yes and i hope we did achieve that
yes
erm because they enjoyed the there are a few funny lines in it you know and they enjoy the visual UNK of these people performing it but to themselves to actually understand it they need to know which artist it was yeah
and you know
yeah that's right
yes
do you think colours with emotions are
oh very much so yes new UNK size erm it in one or two of these erm they gave me a definite feel and to a to a it new i was trying to write
i think UNK was
well yes absolutely yeah and shapes i feel as well you
particularly erm and one of things that i did find in UNK painting of UNK was that erm er erm depression really i could see it there and the des UNK very much as if he was looking in on somebody who was in that position er although at the time i don't thing UNK and er UNK himself knew it
no
i don't i'm not an expert for UNK i feel about it perhaps didn't
did you hope to show the slides that you've got
i mean is
yes would you like to see there's about three
you need the lights off
where's the light switch erm
do you not fear that if you if there is
and another especially if your contracted with powerful UNK that the approach you make suffer as the result of the UNK vision or
i think that we can
and see each other and also my interpretation
yes
would be different from the reputation of the
as i was holding on a particular images and create and then become those energy
right
rather than doing it direct erm UNK of the painting
right
its my responses to it that would be a very different approach because of familiar with a i mean with the postcard that was past around familiar with that picture then looked at it one i feel that about it
when your reading
i closed my eyes and i got a different feeling
yes
from your
and i can UNK something totally different
but is that what it should be
yes that's what yes that's what i hoped for because i feel everybody's interpretation
yes
is different and you need an original
yes
and you maybe miss something from this you have your own that's right and its somebody else teaches you another angle then there's possibility for ex expanding possibility
yes
which i find exciting but interesting in it
you seemed to take it
with your poems
yeah i do
and
i think i went down to most people to say they can't but when you point out something to them they say yes i can see that look there's this as well and i think UNK er were led to believe if you don't succeed in it erm but in actual fact i think that you all do but perhaps i think the books do either assess it and give it value or still allow it to happen
mm somebody
i feel it did i strongly feel it feel that but i'm also sure that its an awful lot easier than most people think but its not going to work for us is it
its a shame we didn't have the slides i think we'd see more
have you got the
if you'd like to hold a UNK for me i can
its erm i think sue
yes ok i'll just i can i can do it winding up
so this is called a pause in a moment worn out days dressed in damp weeds UNK and tired shoulders memory pushed back brought forward in the click of the stick pause in a moment UNK reflected in eyes offering the warmth or recognition threes table laid and waiting milk place in bowl not to high they lap and UNK played and roll UNK distance from knocking and breaking UNK made from clay
can i just point out that something here erm was i think i mentioned about my children it was the height of the table and its just so little that they indicate their in height in this picture but it is there and erm that i found that really very exciting and as i say the threes it the three UNK the three apples the three UNK so often i've found that there is three sets of three objects and in
i haven't actually got a poem for this i was saying to you that i would use this i intend using this as a writing exercise because the colour of her mouth and the colour of the piece of boot in the background just stands out to me it says its about to me hidden desire of some sort either the UNK or hers or mine i don't know
so none of those pictures would be in the exhibition that you have
no
but this is our picture which
this is erm yes i don't have a i don't have
i have got a poem for this which we were its been
to pam now that would be interesting
thank you very much you UNK against others
thank you very much
no
no right
ah
they won't do
they won't do a thing for the children in their old blind school because r b e a have got so much money we don't put our
yes aha yes
money into the school
mhm
cos there they can do it themselves
i agree they shouldn't buy the tickets because they're the
they shouldn't
ones that have provided us have a go at
they are loaded they're loaded
well there is other things they do want you on special er pantomime before the school breaks up you know
they of course
mhm
perhaps we could organize it or something
a target one for kids and one for
yes
yeah
a standard audience
we should get back to r b a they're the ones who supply the equipment
yeah
mhm
they've got one of them
and that none of their children go maybe that's a way
absolutely
to do it
well i think that would be worth looking into
yes
right definitely
if brian could make the sort of
oh contact the
oh yes that's a good idea
yes get a letter out and come back to me
what about to go back to the idea of UNK and things
mhm
UNK yes
i mean
yes UNK is seeing to that
the difficulty is we need a mechanism but the
yes
difficulty is we what we i think need to do is establish who is actually arranging dates
mhm
yes
i mean i think we're stuck we're obviously stuck with a
on the sixth
oh yes yeah
and the thirty nine and that
right
for the variety of reasons but i think what's obviously important is if there is any more date arranging going on
yes
by whoever
mm
that there is that sort kind of everybody keeps in touch with everybody else erm
i think that's UNK you see i don't think that's possible for everybody to keep in touch with everybody else i think you've got to have one person that everybody looks to say right
all the dates are centre that one person is that one
i mean it could work on that basis then that if for example i'm just thinking about well just from my point of view when i was arranging that date in UNK with the oxford people i could of said well UNK okay with me is it okay with you until i've checked with
mhm
whoever it is upstairs
right
kind of thing
mhm and provided it's only one person it's not that difficult
it's not that difficult
it's not you see because every person
have to check it with everybody
yes you'll have to buy a chart for that one person
yes the only thing is that in each city now
mm
well glasgow and edinburgh anyway cos
that's the other thing now
you need perhaps someone in each area to be coordinating
again yes
all the de you know because they've got the UNK whoever is in charge of the UNK knows when they can spare people oh no i can't do that week because we've
right
already got tied up
yes that's right
so it really has to be the person in each city erm who then gets together with a general coordinator
for this in edinburgh there is a sort of a forum where er organizations are set themselves round the table and say this is what the sort of idea that we're gonna do for the next year and a half
right
mhm yes
so that we don't clash with each other UNK
yes
so you don't have
so we could take it from that stage even
aha yes
yes
yes that's it you see
mhm
i've been trying to spot room for that
is this what's erm
try and take it back a step yes
aha
as a kind of clash diary
mhm
but it's also linked i mean the other thing that i've got at the back of my mind is a kind of nightmare is that when we were talking about the festival around about march that you know we spoke to UNK er you know as a group and then that was all fine and we kept er going along and then and then there was that sort of dreadful phone call i had from linda along the lines as i'm not sure if i've got any UNK
that's right because it's august
oh yes
because it's august
yes
you know part of me was thinking well just a minute you know this service is if blind people can offer UNK but on the other hand people are entitled to go away on holiday
yes
exactly mm
and so you know it is a sort of i mean it's exactly what iris is saying it's a meeting with minds in a way because we need to know that
yes because in that case you could of we could of drawn in people UNK from UNK
yes UNK
who knows next year we'll be we say glasgow or
that's right
but people should also be aware that the festival is always in august
yeah quite
exactly yes
yes and i'm prepared to i mean
and these people all live in edinburgh
yes exactly
that's why they're all tired
rent out their houses
that's right
i mean i was thinking that you can actually with linda actually you know because i UNK linda today's meeting obviously
she was on holiday
and you know
yeah i thought that was lovely
they said she was on holiday you know erm and you know so i mean
mm
mhm
maybe this year because it's you know the first kind of year of it
mhm
and maybe next year people will take their holidays another time
mm
but there are all these kind of variations to build into this problem i mean i don't know we could i feel we could almost talk around this for hours
mm
to sort of see some way around it but i mean it's a it's a problem of the UNK both by the theatres
mhm
because you know the other thing to take into this is the
yes
sort of thing we've talked about as well with the edinburgh and glasgow kings
mhm
the kings theatres in towns where by and large they're showing the same shows
mm
yes
and sometimes they go to glasgow first
mhm
and then they go to edinburgh
yes
and sometimes they go from edinburgh to glasgow
and they usually go to aberdeen
sometimes they go to aberdeen
that's right yes
sometimes they come to edinburgh and then go away for six months and come back to glasgow
yeah
yes that's right
and i'm quite keen to sort of have that
yes
i mean you're never going to control you're never going to be on top of it but i mean
no
oh no it's not never doubt it
like UNK gun for example i know is coming to the to the kings up the road here quite soon and then it's going to glasgow later on and i keep thinking every time this sort of thing thing's happening i keep thinking we could be dealing with these
mhm
we could actually be doing
mhm
you know erm this sometimes they go to the theatre royal to UNK things but you know
mm
playhouse and things but it's different theatres but
yes
you know i just keep thinking the UNK on the way round and there ought to be some way of doing it but i you know i mean maybe UNK idea of the organizations in the UNK but that doesn't help me you know with a with a
you still need a key person who's going to
yes you do
you still need yes
yes
to sit on the information
yes
i think so there's got to be one person i mean i thought about this long and hard and there's just no way it cannot be done by committee it would not work cos then
no it won't
you've got people phoning oh but i told er linda
yes
oh but i told iris oh but i told jane
that's right
and you've got all this people not you know
and the information just never comes
never gets together
everybody
that's right
so it's got to be one person and it's got
you're all little bits innit
to be soon because that's already
mm be soon
yeah
happened
but that's gonna happen again
yeah i think it'll happen again in the spring
it's only a matter of time
at least we've got dates here for the lyceum for
yes
till april
yes and i've got UNK till november
so we can sort of put those into our
september
i think what i personally think what you need is a coordinator in glasgow a coordinator in edinburgh to get together with a general coordinator who's going to cover UNK
yeah
aberdeen erm and get together and decide what they want discussing dates
yeah
because the coordinator are the ones who know if they
what's
have to describe and
yes and the people on the ground well linda is obviously the other recorder
yeah
and you're obviously
i'm hoping that wendy 's going to be
oh
at glasgow yes
if she's going to take over well obviously if those two come together
if she doesn't get a job i hope she doesn't get a job that's not very nice thing to say she's so good so
you know wendy she's so good at it these
she'll coordinate the glasgow ones and erm
right
that'll save me phoning up to say can i have a script please
and that for you to take them all
that's right
aha
well the other thing that's in the back of my mind is i happen to know that cath is just taking on a new worker
mhm
would she be able to is this a full time worker you've got
yes she is a full time worker
working beside you
she's full time worker and er she's a clerical UNK so
and so she's more or less UNK to a desk then is she
mhm
nine to five
or whatever
because that's the other problem with people like me is i'm all over the place all the time
yes she can certainly
i've only got a part time back up you see
she could certainly erm offer any you know assistance in whatever way the only thing is that erm
she doesn't really know the theatres so that's the thing
no now she doesn't know any theatres and she doesn't no that's
yeah you see that's we really need someone who's involved to be honest
mhm
yeah
no be honest about that certainly doesn't she's there she's certainly there and can offer any assistance you know erm
i'm just thinking maybe of a central diary or something that someone would keep someone who you know you could UNK them with phones
say what's happening on the twenty third of january
i mean i er if wendy is dealing is UNK well perhaps going to be dealing with a
yes aha
do you feel that leaves you UNK to
well i'm UNK to do i mean i got i wanted to be free because i was getting tied up with that and i was getting tied up with persons but not agreeing everything
mm
and i felt i was being spread in so many directions erm that erm i wanted to get rid of the glasgow coordination
aha
so
you could tell the day
yeah mhm
shall we try that then
you see iris has got an answer for you
mhm
yes that's another thing
and you can't say this because i've got to say this for you
that's right
because you're blind iris i've got to say because
you know i mean i'm just thinking out loud it has to be someone that you can leave messages with
mhm
so that's the thing
you've got to get hold of them too
you've got to be able to
yes aha
erm i certainly am worried about it cos i can see and see when it starts getting out of hand like this see
yes
when it starts going wrong you'll get you'll get
going ah wait a minute
yes exactly
exactly
and blind people go wait a minute you know i want to go to this and i want to go to that
cos the other thing that's worrying me coming up is christmas
yes
oh that'll be a nightmare
yes
because there's that thing
you were saying about the visits
visits yes
and our friend in glasgow west society not
oh yes
organizing tickets and
yes
remember last year remember all that
the only the only date is the sixth
we landed up with no idea of the description on one of the pantomime performances because he wouldn't arrange the date and then
well i mean the thing is as soon as the citizens open the box office for pantomime i phoned them and said
good
open and book
good
now
yes
and what did he do he didn't book now
oh no
and the first time by
i don't wish
the time he phoned he could only get friday of the first week
oh that's hopeless for children
now i can't say no
of course not
because we have because it's for the children so i said we'll do it but that gives us an awful UNK to get it in friday the first week
exactly and also it's
and he said i have to admit i didn't act on your phone call and i felt like UNK him i really did
surprise
why couldn't you of just said yes well you well you just
two years running you
two years running yes last year we did two separate audio
last year we did two separate audio descriptions
he shouldn't mess it up
well i think this is another case actually where i think in that
yes it is
situation that you know hopefully by next christmas we'll maybe be a bit
maybe we'll get a coordinator who will just say i'll book the seats for you
it's not far away
yes quite exactly and
you owe us
yes
we'll move it into a position where you know maybe we can bring the UNK on this well as well and say
just send the bill to glasgow then
that's right
maybe it's something that which may emerge as well with you
yes
if you talk successfully to the r b a
yes oh yes watch yourself over christmas it's very complex yes because i mean the whole point innit is to have the audio description and also it should be it should into the runs so that
yes
so that it is
people will have time
nearer to christmas because christmas eve would actually be the perfect time to do for children
yes exactly
i mean children just get more and more excited
yeah
and er alan actually said to me last year why i don't see the importance of audio description anyway
eh
oh well i mean that was red rag to the bull
i don't think he ever has he
well i've got people on my committee who are on r b a board
oh
and they that's why we got the equipment of course and they all support it and jim supports it
jim's
so there shouldn't be any problem
no
through that
the chairman
mhm
there shouldn't be any problem but i mean he won't
right
instruct the school to do anything about it
no
but we might be able to convince him
so what we've agreed then is that f you're hoping that wendy
wendy
is that e or i
she actually
yes
she actually volunteered ha
oh she's sweet
would take over the coordinator and linda
linda
through here
mhm
yeah
and obviously
and my offer of help still stands for wendy
right
because
the typing
that iris will still keep the diary as it was
yes lovely
iris would actually and maybe what we should do is buy a diary
yep
and i could have it a year diary in fact
yeah
because that's the sort of seasons you guys tell me what
mhm
erm and you know and that would be their kind of bible get one with a lock on
yeah
and er you know we would just have to
yes
set up that mechanism that you know
aha yes
everybody and you know
everybody checks them
everybody checks with those three people
yes i think so
i mean in a way the purse thing is a bit more distant
a slight more distant yes
but non the less if you're
mhm
i mean you're still gonna have a
but UNK isn't for instance they'll want to consider their pantomime again
mhm
yeah so you know we need to sort of pull that together
it's very important for the equipment as well if we're using the
yes it's the as well
exactly yes exactly
all by and large i mean it's almost certainly
it's getting it from one place to the next
oh for instance for instance
same equipment for the same blind people
well come the twenty
come the twenty fourth of september
give it to the blind and they can take the equipment
equipment in UNK in UNK then from glasgow back
see
induction
see
which is a nuisance
now well it's a nuisance but thank goodness at least it's there
it's there
yes but not they won't like you going back
but it's you know it is a you won't like going back no i don't like it either
mm
if we had our second system in each city then
there we go
that's right
yes mhm
you can imagine i mean
come in and use it as a
centre and the phone and never thinking there that
yes
that's bad
that'll help and also for any the other coordinator unless they've got a problem because er
well can i say then that iris will keep a diary
right
which is also the equipment diary that with back up from your
yeah
yes it's a lot of work
so right i'm just wary of the time
mm
it's twenty past three
mm
right
erm moving on erm audio description in scotland no er since this the last meeting yes cath and i have been talking about all that money we had an entertaining day out
entertaining day out
and to cut a long story short we went to see three possible UNK er UNK one was t s b foundation where to cut a long story short i'm pretty sure that t s b er we have to put an application in for october i think we'll buy us another system
only because the guy had lost his sight in korea
mm
oh good
good
so you should always send me
yes definitely
of course
too late
oh yes i think you're right
if i hadn't of been UNK he was out the door
so er meeting number two was with geoff from UNK trust and he er welcome welcomed
UNK got a
us very UNK and erm
oh yes
mhm
and he's encouraged us to put an application in to do more so with the training side of things
mhm
you and i will need to sort
ourselves on that that's new
er we just need to get the money and
yeah erm yeah i know it's writing the application a little bit
so that will be quite good erm and lastly we went to meet with sandra from youth out fund employed UNK fund which was a meeting we weren't really allowed to have and this is certainly not for the record
mhm
erm because i'd phoned up and asked for them er my secretary had phoned up and asked for a meeting with her but the response was we're not allowed to meet with you so we said okay cos it's public money and things
it'll give us the edge public money
and then we arrived we arrived at
this is good
where the UNK trust is in UNK having just managed to get there on the petrol in the tank erm
we happened to go up the UNK and er the door was answered
the door was shut
by this woman who said you know who are you
what you want
so we said were robert and
she sort of gave me an odd look
aha
went away and came back and said oh mr will see you in a minute and it turned out it was sandra
because youth and UNK i knew are in the same building which is why we wanted to see you
and she said while since you are here i can meet with you
we won't talk to you
i bump into a lot of people at conferences so i haven't been able to write formally to thank you for the meeting because i don't want anything on the record then
she made us tea as well
oh good i read in today's newspaper
oh
erm on the train coming through that UNK have withdrawn the sponsorship from sports in scotland
oh really
oh
oh really
and they're going to concentrate on community
ooh
ooh
ooh
i thought we're a community
everybody likes that one
UNK immediately
nice one
UNK mm
get in touch with UNK oh yes
small UNK of UNK
that the one with the UNK or is it shell
that's it
UNK
UNK the UNK
UNK the UNK
UNK the UNK
UNK the UNK yeah
put a UNK in your audio description
yes
mhm
so and UNK is a in fact UNK i felt quite pleased about in a way because we'd analyzed maggie and i had analyzed the documents and jane and i and graham and i had spoken about it as well that they are principally interested in unemployed volunteers
mhm
but not UNK but the what i did have a concern about and i think we'll have to be a bit careful about this as we go forward is that the audio description project is about audio description youth and funding is about volunteers
yes she's quite clear in
whilst the two er obviously
aha
fit together
it's the way you
it's not quite the same
no
so it's not exactly like you're trying to put you know you're trying to put a right hand onto a left hand but it it's a certain element of that erm having said that what do you think
i mean do you think she's going to respond well
oh definitely aha UNK made out about that
yeah
she said she's very into alan and she knows his work
mhm
cos he's
i phoned alan erm their UNK unit
mhm
is back to back with UNK in UNK
yes that's right
so you see she sees him coming and going she sees the blind people coming and going so hence the kind of yeah so is that's it
oh i knew that
so
i didn't know that
so that was
alright there you are you see so that's information on giving out
share this information so no i think she'll help and i think he'll help erm because of you because obviously very committed to that
yeah
aha
that should be quite good but it's not enough of course
no i mean that you know that all kind of gets off the ground
aha
er what the next thing that i've agreed with mary
mm
is that once obviously there is a specialist application to UNK to their forms
mm
there'd be a not quite a specialist application to UNK will be linked to UNK
mhm
due to the timing we have to apply to UNK well the deadline for UNK the deadline for UNK comes first
yeah
but will be considered second
mhm
mhm
not till december it's not considered
that's right the UNK is the deadline is end of september and they'll considered it in october
aha i see
but it will become UNK decision will be UNK on UNK application i think
ah which is a bit UNK
mhm
but should be okay
but since geoffrey is actually one of the UNK trustees as well it will all quickly fit in together
it's all UNK yes
oh yes
but once we've agreed is once i've done the work we have done the work i have done the work with you helping me er i've written this application what i want to do is turn that into a much more general one and then i can write to you know maybe twenty five trusts on a more general basis
yes
saying you know we need a sum of money and mary will help me with the marketing of that and hopefully after that we would go on enough to keep us going so hopefully by the time christmas comes
mhm
i mean we'll obviously have to sort of keep a keep an eye on all this all the way through
mhm
can i say i can express concern about that because i think that in terms of funding i've written a short term and b long term erm i think we've got a short term problem and
yeah
i speak on behalf of playback not as playback itself but as playback being part of the regional council that can a bit now i was at a meeting this morning where i sort of absolutely had to read the riot act about playback because they do not have a set budget whether you know this or not they don't have a standard budget as they should have we've fought for this for years what we do is we survive through crisis to crisis now some money has been extracted from the playback budget and whilst i have to share two bits of playback you know the actual playback charitable voluntary bit and the regional council i mean they i can say that they do not have a backing of money that they can fall back on too many backs there but i mean really i would say that i would be concerned if it was christmas before we were ready i can't help but think if we could and i mean very happy to work with anybody and everybody on this to try and get these things pulled up quite quickly i mean if it's forms to be filled in then
mhm
you know application and that surely we could maybe tackle that quickly and then
sure well
we would be in a position to have this letter because i'm getting anxious i've written a logo first and then this long term short term and they're connected
yeah right
i think we need to move a bit faster
well when i say christmas i mean that's actually decision i mean we can't hurry the meeting that you've had and we can't hurry the meetings one we get
yes decisions no for the actual post of
all that stuff i appreciate that but the actual raising of money and something
yeah well no i'm thinking that these applications have to be in both of them by the end of september and i don't
yes
see why the second string of the trust letters shouldn't be going out straight away after
aha
straight away yes
but again you're always linked you're always linked to
aha yes cos again i'd go for assistance on that you know
UNK a lot of these trusts only meet once a quarter
i know
and you might get lucky
mhm
yeah
yes
and get in
mhm
but you might you know miss it by a week and got three months two months three weeks at the most
i just er it would just be i just would be concerned
but your
you know
yeah
that UNK left you know for a very long time because i think you'll agree and
i know it was a decision taken by playback and that you
hang on cath
playback had been
now been paid back
playback have been paid back
have they completely
yes we have yes the same as the edinburgh society yeah
oh well then i that really takes away my short term concern then
aha
that's fine because that wasn't running
the edinburgh society had given us some money that's not me
my UNK going bananas you know
mine doesn't make that noise now
no that's my clock going bananas
nothing over here
mhm
yeah well that's fine then sorry i take away my
i should of maybe actually asked the question
has jane had enough
first because erm
leave it there right
that's why you meant
you mentioned logo there and erm i think that's where
now again can we go back to that because
but i think this comes down to the
UNK i mean if we want a logo it should be an audio description logo for the country
yeah
for the for everybody
don't you think so
yeah it should be national
a national one
except
well
except then if you're writing off for money to places like telecom and it's a national logo
can you not have a national logo which is kind of personal wise
oh i mean i know that in america and all the different cities have their own UNK
okay
so maybe we could do that here
on the logo front when linda wrote to me and said she couldn't come to this meeting
yeah
she said i have UNK a draft of a logo and she didn't i have seen it because jane's got one
who is this
linda
linda
linda had a contact who'd done something
linda had done one because remember but alex did one way back which would not
of course and at college
yes
say was wonderful but i think we should maybe try and just gather them together and
but the sooner the sooner we get a logo the sooner
soon
i can get UNK made to put above our heads
so lovely get it
out there
but if we have UNK just that
mm with information on
yes exactly
can you find it
mm i've got it somewhere
could you could you maybe gather UNK and UNK and anybody else's that they've got
well those are the only two i mean UNK one is the more
i'll give you one
oh but ah well UNK
that's three then
yes
three
i've got all the bits and pieces of all
okay well put it on the agenda next time
right yes please i think that's a wee
i can't find UNK
aha
and if people could get a copy of them all before the next meeting
do you have friendly relationships with a UNK at this
yes
we could hopefully try and make a decision
yes
i mean i couldn't care less as long as it was something
must get something
UNK is the mask in the theatre
oh yes
not really but
with UNK and erm lights
that's it that's it
and UNK coming you know the
brian has something to come up with
oh do
which is
yes
ooh
yes
yes please
yes please
because i just think it would it's so important to get that bit that bit goes along with the all the application bit if we tie those two up together
yes
i don't think we'll have a problem with money you see
mm
but it's got to be done properly and
one of one of the things is the is the i don't know what the eye is the good thing to have in the if somehow or other
be incorporated it
to be quite honest i quite like the iron
yes
and i know that's a bit blind and i'm usually
well
saying the opposite but you do have to remind people what you're doing
it's it identifies you really quickly
mm
yeah mhm
it does
mhm
perhaps right
well great if you can get something good
if you're not so very UNK all but seems
just need to come up with a brief
it was more or less something along those lines wasn't it
yeah i could i could
something as simple as UNK
UNK
it did have yes i mean it wasn't that but it was something you know that
it was the UNK
theatre UNK
should what they were trying to do was copy the UNK that you have in the
yes
mm
lyceum
and
oh so it's a lyceum over there really
no
UNK
lyceum has just got a new logo i noticed
oh don't no
said can we have your old one
yes
yes steal it that'll be fine i'll steal it
no i don't know what i've done with it
so anyway
that's all my fault
so that's the erm the funding side of things graham and i
we gave the money back
yes graham and i erm spent time talking about job descriptions which
aha
if i haven't brought that forward it's really UNK because i'm sure i've put
don't seem to of done so we have done some work on job description here i mean it's not been typed up anyway
maybe send them out rather than wait till the next meeting aha
i'll send them out erm
that'll be good
it's only draft
mhm
so that's done some work on that and there's now four models for training one is the you know on the job evenings training there's the weekend model of getting people together for the weekend there's the sort of summer school idea and the other one's the one that doug keeps reminding me about which i keep forgetting about which is the distance learning one er we i think this is the one he thinks is running in dundee that maybe help with because the idea of developing a pack which is kind of trainer proof
mhm
so that it could be sent to the folks in UNK
mhm
i'm a bit UNK about this but he seems to
yes i'm a bit UNK about it
think
audio description at a distance
ah yes
no i don't fancy that at
so anyway those are the four those are the four models i mean at this stage i don't know
i mean the fourth one the fourth
one of the one of the
i think the first two though the on the job obviously
oh how
the weekend is relatively straightforward the summer school idea is complex and i think the distance is complex
it's expensive
yeah exactly
in some ways wh i heard i was listening to a description on saturday at the UNK and i must admit i thought to myself mm
yeah
we've got more work required here
aha
yes so it needs someone i mean i'm always
hers now sort of saying why those but you see if there's nobody to doing that in edinburgh they're going to slip again unfortunately
yes that applies to hand and that applies right throughout the country
absolutely yes
yeah so we need to yeah we're sort of thinking about it
aha
but er how you kind of do that
the other thing i was slightly concerned about it if it's a slight UNK is the fact that the people at the lyceum at the assembly hall last saturday didn't know hadn't been told anything about the equipment
yeah
they didn't even know how to put the clip onto the microphone they were sitting holding the UNK instead of UNK it round their neck and they've never been told about the equipment so they needn't
i see
i mean all of them are obviously going to need equipment explained to them
they need to understand how the equipment works aha
so that's part of the training
aha
that part aha
yeah right
it's a
trouble is it's an ongoing it's a not a bit of training it's an ongoing
no the only thing is the thing is the equipment is new to everyone in edinburgh
of course
and once they've shown if somebody new comes along one of the old hand
it'll just pass it on
of course it'll pass on
will be passed on but in this instance they all need to be shown how to work it yes mhm so that concerned me a little bit apparently because they were holding the mike right up to their mouth and it was UNK terribly what's going on up there
so it's the sort of
mm
mhm
UNK use
yes exactly yes
right so i mean there's obviously more need to be thought through on that and the video i haven't oh i have done something more about the video
mhm
erm i haven't i was gonna go and i tried phoning UNK one time i was going through to glasgow just to see if i could can i have a can i have a pint with him or something erm just to UNK it over cos he suggested you know he'd made various helpful suggestions in the meantime i didn't manage to meet him but in the meantime i did manage to speak to my father in law who has a UNK and er he will be more than happy to erm he's also got editing equipment he would be more than happy you know to do the home made video that we've talked about i need to talk to him about this because the obvious place to do will be the lyceum on one of your shows
can you get can you give me the name erm the rest of the
through to glasgow she was rose that she UNK and UNK or something
margaret
margaret can you give me a phone number for her because i thought if they do that they must put her on plays with us students
yeah well that is another possibility we could
that would be ideal
mhm
certainly i'll
aha
erm
but she would be ideal
let me just put you in the picture there brian what UNK has agreed subject to what guarantees have been given
mhm
is that we as a group can er video the production but it was at UNK but in this case it would have to be
mhm
review erm subject to getting on commission from the cast and director
mhm
and all we will be talking about when my father in law will be coming along he's got a UNK he's got all the gear it will be just that probably be UNK it on front of the ground circle actually
mhm
erm
a bit like UNK a good we could put it over the front
oh that'll be even better then you'll need to talk to him
i mean you'd asked him to do that
i mean he's he has been quite busy
he's retired but he's been quite busy with this festival but i said to him now what i'll do is maybe come and you and him and jane maybe kind of will just sort of have a quick UNK sometime just talk about what he wants and he will be kind of happy to do that with obviously we'd have to find a drop of money to pay for the tapes i mean that wouldn't be huge and expensive
he's also got editing equipment so it might be the sort of thing that you know like you'll be able to take it away and say you know this section that bit and then
and that that's right
meet again with him maybe go to his house
yep
and spend an afternoon cutting it off as it were
yes
i mean if copying those bits onto a separate tape
yeah
what UNK has the concern UNK has is that he doesn't want that tape finding its way out of our
mm yes
hands erm i mean he's really genuinely concerned wanting to help us but i mean he's obviously he's you know he is the union
oh yes absolutely he's quite right about that
and he has to represent his neighbours erm so erm so we would need to UNK give guarantees i think that would have to be
have to give guarantees that the tape would not be abused but i mean that in UNK you know if it was you doing the training
that's right
it comes down for you and you would have to sign documents of erm anyway so it's
that's great
should be fairly easy to
yeah
just to record straight over
right
not necessarily on a UNK
right well we can we should we should do that then
when do you start again
i speak to stella now
do you speak do you start straight after the festival we have a gala evening
er eleventh
right well what i'll do is if you like that's it this is the erm linda
mhm
mhm
friend who i spoke to cath
i'll date it
no i can't and can i tell you i'm not being funny but i think that's actually maybe quite important i know this is not the in doubt visually UNK people but
oh no
i think you'd have to
oh yes
choose something that a person with a visual UNK might be
yes aha
able to catch
not every one is totally
but i mean you know it'll be quite nice it also be quite nice if it was raised
yeah
yes right
then it would have a wee
with it which would be quite nice for a visually UNK person
mm yes
mm
