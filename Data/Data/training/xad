just a thought you know
mhm
and i'm afraid i'm not a very UNK
person as well
when that went into the paper that's a similar sort of thing that they use
fair enough
that's what they used
mhm
similar
yes there's a technique for raising it isn't it
i think there must be because i've seen it several times now and just in you know
mm
people not necessarily anything to do with visual UNK paper you know
yes
yes indeed
it was quite fun
mhm
i suppose it's always much more expensive to do
yes you just write over the top sort of write over the top of it and it raises off
that's right mm
but i mean erm i suppose it's best to do it in colour
we've got some of the stuff downstairs
colour along
yeah
i suppose it'll cost
yeah
cost more in printing cost more doesn't it
yeah
yeah an awful lot more
yeah so if
i mean it is a quite complex problem because once you've
once you have a single colour it's okay
yeah
yeah a single colour ah right yes well that maybe quite nice
because you want something which is big and small
mhm
so that you know you can use it you know on your own publicity material
yes something that'll look good blown up aha
yes
to do a poster or something
yes that's
that doesn't immediately occur to me that it's for blind people
no
no
that's what i thought
it's like for like for like hearing a hearing aid person
mm
that's my initial thought it's not obvious
oh we definitely don't want that cos all the money will go
the money will go to sign language in devon
can i can i have a
what you see are the UNK so you think about hearing
hearing
you don't think about sight
that's right yes
and i think that's quite right
yes i mean just i mean this is you know
mhm
this is the quick
we did for this and that's
yeah
why we just put the eyes on the front
mhm
what we don't want is a
man with a white stick job
no
i mean that's
no and we don't we don't want a green dog either no
and a dog oh no watch graham
i think that
yes
a bit his master's voice isn't it
yes
oh no a guide dog listening
his master's voice in UNK you know it's just stick a who i am on that wee dog i can remember i can see i can remember that from
but the dog listening to a big ear instead of a an UNK
if guide dogs can sue us
aye guide dogs i know
now er moving on
erm i did phone UNK up and asked why were the
coming to london and it is something to do with television
yes
he gave me a number to phone and i've tried phoning and i've not had a response but i'll keep trying
this is a
that's very difficult to get hold of
yeah i haven't managed to get all of them
yes mhm
sixteenth of september no
the nineteenth
nineteenth
round about then mhm
right cos it only UNK on me cos the first of september
erm the UNK meeting that was talked about
right
on the nineteenth of august was UNK and it's now in a couple of weeks so i'm gonna go
is it now
right
in a couple of weeks whenever it is
right
same one i was going to go down to
was that what was it on
glad i didn't go down to it
it was about training
oh it's about training
i thought that was something else you were going to go to
yes
glad you didn't go eh
yes i did yes
well just as well i'd that sounds good
yeah UNK was being quite sort of vague but UNK is gonna be here at the end of the month
yeah
yes by the way i'm gonna be able to see max i'll tell you that now because i've been dragged off to another conference i'm actually going down to the to the UNK workers' phones
you haven't been dragged off at all
i'm UNK
and alan's started phoning me up and saying
and then you're flying up to stone UNK
sorting out and then i've got to go down to that conference and fly up to stone UNK
yeah
that's two
however it doesn't matter
and when are you going to get to stone UNK
i don't know
i don't think there's an airport in stone UNK
no
oh
you're flying into
what
she's actually flying to UNK
just drop you off in
i'm not coming
you can see it all folks
that's for the thirtieth you're flying into UNK
aha
well i'll be in aberdeen
anyway
oh
and that's aberdeen airport i could maybe pick you up
yes let's try and
i'm not quite sure i've put my name down
cos i live in aberdeen my UNK aberdeen so i'll be in aberdeen
for that with the thing with the fancy
excellent i'll get together with that
quite right i can easily be at UNK saturday no problem i know dave
that's a saturday is it
that's a saturday
yes
what's the
i don't know
i know
i quite like to go but erm
well i'll be in
i was telling you
i'd loved to have gone you know
UNK cos that's where UNK going
commercial in russell square next door
aye next door
oh that
yeah
all the theatres and the country
there is the there's the
i find that quite useful
the erm scottish theatre guide
yes the scottish theatre guide
i haven't seen one of them for a long time
i'm staying in aberdeen
of course
that was scottish federation scottish
there's a theatre marketing which is closing it well sort of shutting up shop at the end of the month maybe
so do i what i like about going home is you can get away
i haven't seen that for a long time
so we're back
this isn't a federation
that's right
marketing committee
that's right but if you're actually going home it's easy
cos i seem to remember having so something a long time ago especially the smaller theatres as well as a UNK thing you know it'll be handy for you
yeah
mm
you know what was going to be where
yeah i think though i mean it comes back to sort of wanting to know we're just talking again about what's on
mm
mhm
we need to know before it's published
that's right
you know you need to know like six months before
i won't give up
and if everybody does
all sorts of
for finding that out whether you go through the arts council
yeah
you see the arts council has a finger in most pies the only way to find out through them i mean the trouble is a lot of it is going to be confidential
mm
yes
erm
but then if you did it at the stage before it gets into the scottish theatre guide you can then make your dates available or you can agree your dates and you can get publicity and that at home
yes cos that's the thing
that's the thing
aha
publicity is the thing
so we need to find
aha
but if you can find out through lucy whether or not
mm
that publication is still on the go because if it is gonna carry on the go we can maybe get into the
yeah
UNK of the gathering of the information
mhm
yes
that would be
yeah right erm
cos the publicity is not just for visually UNK people or even for UNK it's for theatres too when they're seeing this and saying ooh i noticed they're doing that this and this
mm
and we're not doing it
yes
you see and that would be
yes that's right
that'll be an idea wouldn't it
talking about publications one of the things from the last meeting is iris pointed out the number of theatres in here say they do audio description and i've
yeah
oh i said that to you at the time robert i mean i'll be honest and i saw that document and i nearly died and it's the way they say it too
i don't suppose
you know
i've been i've been through them all and er there's only one or two that i've not actually had any contact with actually one way or another
some of them are people that erm that i've generally had contact with in terms of starting to talk to people about it erm other people are being kind of what's the word optimistic with the truth likes and the UNK for example erm
well we have done it
we've done it since they UNK about what happens
it's like it's like the UNK one i want to know you know and the small and the one down in the borders
the one that's down in the borders yes i mean that i've seen so another piece of print about that one down in the borders and erm it's not our version of audio description so i am going to write
and linked to that i was going to do a new information sheet i found the old information sheet so i just bring that up to date
mhm
i do i like do you think i could have a copy of anything you've got to date because lying in my desk this morning is something i have to prepare a briefing note for my chairman and i was thinking about that recent one but i couldn't put my hand on it robert absolutely updated on exactly where we are
i don't think i've got one here but i could send you one
could you thanks robert could you fax it
yeah
cos he wants it like
yesterday
what does he want it for
oh well because this video has come in
of course
it's gone it's gone to chief execs
oh i see so they want
in the regional council and they now want to know all about them see
the back ground yeah
so that's good because it might mean money it means of having
and that's for UNK
well no it's the UNK the UNK of the whole region
oh right
like you know
yeah whatever it is
no ah more senior than him it'll go to him too but it'll be for everybody's
so what you want then is the sheet we did a few weeks ago just about the erm
yeah give me the update yes and if you're just updating that a bit if you're gonna update it then aha
right okay
yeah
cos it'd be nice to show it's happening here and there you know
yeah i'm not sure if it mentions the magic words
regional council but
well you'll have to get that fitted in somehow i'll fit it
if not
you can re type it if you can
gonna get
it's on the computer though i think we can manage
oh dear
so erm advisory committee being the next item well we will we'll have a word from brian we'll i haven't approached er david yet in glasgow meeting but i will do
mhm
and obviously UNK will let us know when she can come and we can talk a little more about the festival
erm i've been thinking that i can't chair this meeting and take the notes and things when it becomes and if it the fund comes through and it becomes the audio description project as opposed to this group and you know we will be widening out a little bit i wonder if we should actually have a chairman type person
i haven't spoken to erm i mean i only thought this coming along in the street whether there's anybody sort of UNK i mean is it is there any value in actually having a UNK type chairman you know sort of UNK type
yes i think it makes a big difference
type person who you can
oh yeah somebody could
push forward to
mhm
you know UNK and things i dunno i'm not suggesting will you find out now but there's something
yes interesting angle
if there's anybody that comes to mind
i thought about tom on more than one occasion because tom for so many years was the voice of the royal wedding and erm this and that state affairs and things state occasions and he only lives in UNK i mean
a state of affairs is not appropriate at the moment mind you
i heard that
they were they were UNK for this
thing and you know they were over and some of them were doing something and it is somebody you normally and the news and i said the news and actually sort of frozen and the guy said to me he must of actually seen me frozen there he said it's okay it's okay it's nothing about whatever her name is you know
i said oh no he said i've to go to brussels you know and it'll be all about oh i thought i was really UNK it
i don't know i think it'll be lovely if you can get up a blind person
mm
yes
mm
blind UNK a well known blind
is it that
was a blind UNK
he's dead now i think
oh is she dead
we don't want
he is
oh we don't
no she wouldn't she's away yes she was away
anyway that's what's involved
anyway it's a thought
yes it's a new thought mhm
yes
i mean there's the practical side of actually having i mean well there's various aspects of it you could have someone as a UNK
mhm
who never actually did anything apart from this sort of push forward to receive cheques from
the only thing is to make sure that somebody's going to come along because the worst possible scenario is like
or you could have or you have
the society for the blind in glasgow who the lord lady UNK
oh who never turns up for anything
UNK person and they she never turned up at anything
not even the opening
she never ever turned up at anything
never so i mean you might as well not bother you know
mhm
or whether you actually have
in fact it makes you more stupid
mm
you know working type chairman or something i don't know anyway it's just for you to think about it
yes that's it
right any other business iris look forward to the playback send you about seven hundred pounds
mhm
and so jane can now report the now that's been settled
yes thank you thank you
that's really good
erm
but er
i thought i was a
yesterday erm
aha
something although they were quite er nothing to do with er
aha
and to pop down to do theatre because i see paula eat before at UNK
aha
and he assured me it is an
who's this
ideal little spot to do it audio description from
the commentary UNK yeah
yeah
because when UNK and i went we didn't actually see up there but we could see from down there and
yes that's
yeah
aha
i think we'll be okay on that
mhm
paul of course is leaving
oh
is he
ah
to go and do something in dundee so they've advertised his job
oh
oh well we were talking about funding i've actually got an account for expenses
oh right
so that's what the money is about and that's where the money came from
mhm
aha
i've got i we're going to get some money from the UNK fund for the festival
mm
yes
plus erm plus the expenses from us going from glasgow i don't know whether anybody from edinburgh will have expenses but erm what shall where shall i ask her to send this cheque for it i mean i still there's still an account open for it in glasgow for audio description
aha
right
but i mean who was linda would be treasurer
yeah
has she got an account there
yes
it'll probably be better just to get and then she'll the money for the
yes that's right
so i'll get them to send it off to linda
if we all the information for linda comes through me anyway
yes right okay fine
because the address she's put it on is the UNK address
oh is it
yes
right
which she felt was better than her home address
aha
oh yes aha
right
and i've got the bank book
fine
so the money is
i see
i'll get the cheque made payable to and
hope you're UNK this robert
and then
robert knows
the only question is whether or not jane has a key to open the UNK in the
i know i couldn't get the i couldn't find the key for the desk no
that was her story alright
oh i've forgot to say under advisory committee i this has taken so long i've completely forgot about it
we do when we set up this group we asked
for a representative
ah yes aha
and eventually after some searching they nominated someone who then resigned from her post not clare
clearly because they nominated for
right
in UNK central region erm changed her job or something so that she no longer her voice
mhm
on disability issues and they haven't been able to find anybody else but what they've said despite extensive attempts the convention has not been able to obtain a replacement for this one due to and buys us time
i'm disappointed that we cannot be represented but sure you will appreciate position
please continue to send papers for any relevant meetings and an attempt will be made to respond to appropriate issues if there is any specific topic you wish to be considered please do not hesitate to get in touch so i thought that was quite a nice letter seeing as i practically read them all
i would also like a copy of that
mhm
because if i UNK a copy of that with this response to chief execs
mhm
that'll kind of filter its way through into and will cause will certain need some
yes i'm not quite sure of how
and they won't like that one little bit they'll amend them because they've done it
yeah i mean it's been going on for ages
i don't think that's
erm
particularly fair
right i mean i'm not quite sure how UNK will go about things i mean the reason we wanted someone from UNK is cos we wanted someone from the federation of scottish theatre cos we hadn't heard for a while
yes
we had roy and then we had simon for a bit and then we decided because it wasn't working altogether an edinburgh person and a glasgow person
mhm
erm
well i think it's very important robert because i mean as the charter for the arts indicated look at the money that local authorities are spending upstairs to us and really you know we are
well exactly i mean we have we sort of we kind of anticipated that
oh yes so i mean come on let's give them another wee push gently
so i mean we've erm i mean i've developed a relationship with david at UNK
yes that's right
so it might be that he could come erm anyway i'll give you a copy of that
yes so that i can just sort of say you know we did invite and that might help
where are we on
i mean i'm not quite sure how UNK how do UNK sort of nominate their representatives like that
we asked them to put some
i've no idea i mean did they sort of send someone like you
who's who is an employee
well for example phil is our yeah phil seems to go to some of these meetings and but mainly it's the elected members
yeah
mhm
and it's usually elected in
well glen isn't in fact an elected member
ah right well i mean she should be able to give us somebody god there's ten million of them
i would of thought so that's right
and it helps you
cos i was looking at
with funding you know it does help
what about jimmy
because then they go back jimmy
yeah
councillor you know people like that
yeah anyway
yes that would be
where are we with costing and theatres on the UNK charge
what are we doing about that
er i haven't contacted the citizens in due course but erm
yeah
that was a
you have contacted the lyceum
have i contacted the lyceum
oh good we're charging the lyceum
yes
erm
because we agreed to it
what was it we said
twenty pounds
i was gonna
what i just want to
i was gonna say fifteen
to you fifteen
everybody say a different figure now
i have talked
are we to invoice
UNK theatre asked me how much it was going to cost so i off the top of my head i said twenty pounds
mm
erm thinking that we ought to charge something because to hire the equipment is very expensive
sure
and if we were looking at running costs and replacing things and
and all the rest of it
that's what i'd say yes
of course
to be to be replacing that so i said twenty pounds off the top of my head so UNK theatre have agreed to that as well
right
and they will
will they pay that as a one er
yeah mhm they'll pay
pay each time
yeah
will you require
is that either side each time or is that up until christmas
right presumably if there was a necessity would there be a necessity to produce an invoice
i mean what would your system
mm yes
require an invoice for that kind of thing
yeah
oh yes
well what we might have to do is UNK something up on a letter a stand have you a standard charge
but it doesn't matter whether it was you don't have to do one
you'd do it all
you could do in advance or you could do UNK or
do it as that or you can do it after three months yes i mean
we could do it up till christmas three monthly or something like that
yeah
mind we wouldn't want it every time
yes mm
so we need to some time
too much paper work apart from anything else
yes that's right it's a UNK
that's good that's good
yeah
it just gets a wee bit much
mm well it keeps you being able to run it so you're
mm
not stuck
yes and
that's a hundred and eighty pounds worth there
yeah
it's too
it's too expensive over the holiday season
that's right
that's another one for christmas then
double
it's certainly cheaper than the way you were doing it
it's certainly cheaper than three hundred and fifty quid they showed up
that's it exactly and that's crazy
right i don't think i've got any other things
you could of bought your own equipment
yeah
by now
yes you could of
it's a shame
erm oh i have got something else which is music erm at the last meeting i said i've been talking to simon from the queen's hall about the idea of doing pre concert notes
mhm
right
not actually doing an audio description of the conductor
and again and again
worried about doing ballet
one thing one thing about it it's crossed my mind a long time ago is er the idea of erm in the half hour or whatever twenty minutes before a concert doing er concert programme notes
yeah
particularly if there's you know heavy
mm
information about a particular piece so simon and i sort of we were talking kind of fairly UNK about that but erm what we agreed to do is this was about the time when we first got the equipment i think and it occurred to me that you and i've checked this now that you can actually plug a UNK you know a UNK type of player into either the microphone for the
right
radio system or
aha
indeed into the infra red if you were using the i mean obviously that's a small scale probably wouldn't erm so the idea of actually putting some concert notes onto a tape or indeed doing it live so anyway simon is away on holiday after the festival but i've arranged UNK principal and for him and you
right
and his most regular blind UNK who you know mrs
mhm
to
ann mhm
to kind of just get together with someone he's identified a person whose name i can't remember but he's got a chamber orchestra
right
what i was interested in knowing in was for example whether he's got his chamber orchestra repeated their same concert five or six times in different cities
mm
i just it's just a sort of an idea at this stage i'm not wanting to take up UNK of time on this but
i'm quite UNK of doing it with a with a full set and everything it's awfully UNK for taking the system
yeah
down and may well be just one person requiring and you've got somebody else to go down
yeah well there may be other mechanisms of doing it
with it and hand it out week and then at the concert collect it at the end again
yeah
it's a kind of thing that i think could be put and take and people could pick up at the box office
yeah i think so
yeah well maybe that's what we
you could pick it up beforehand at the box office
well maybe that's what you do yeah
er yes
erm you know maybe it's something we can do in just a one off during the winter
mhm
you know if the UNK are doing concerts on the basis of six or seven of the same i'm i really don't know enough about it
mhm
and it maybe something that we can get one person to come into playback
yeah
make up a note and then you
how did the home of the brave do their thing
that was to do with head sets
eh to do with head sets yes
aha nothing to do with
and that was picked up
our infra UNK there
they're infra red yeah
that's picked up right then
so there is something
i mean margaret have you been to it cath
no
margaret was at it really she said really it was not much for blind people
no and i've
no it's not
i've spoke to colin to
just to try and cope with it
and the crowds
and the aha
yes aha
very difficult for blind people
mhm
no we were not
there was lots of
consulted or asked or involved or anything like that
there's lots of things you could touch
yes though yes
which is good
which is good makes a change aha
so that's the only other sort of bit of sort of
the other thing is i mean erm the UNK did it a couple of years ago they haven't done it this year they
er no yes
recorded they got somebody recorded
that's right
the entire winter programme
the next three months of programme on tape several plays there were
not that you did erm
and i think there was a bit of a up the place
aha
and they had they we copied them
that's right
and we had half a dozen of them at the box office and if anyone i think we still sent them out if anyone wanted them
yes
but it meant people could go up to the box office and take a tape recorder and sit and listen to them
right
i think they had to take the
oh we did that as well you had the
UNK does it UNK does it for them anyway
yes so it's quite good to have that kind of thing to UNK
yes it would be good to get the UNK to do that again we must have
again
yes
cos that stopped
yes
i mean he was doing that before we ever started audio description and now
they've been doing it for some time at the UNK is
oh yes does the UNK
at st andrew's
do the UNK not do it using actors now then as well
yes they do
they actually use the actors who are going to be there because it's easier
this wasn't this was just a programme
yes
cos alan says he gets copies of that from the UNK theatre
yes that's right
i mean it's a jolly good idea it really is
so there are a few initiatives there but i don't think there's been done anything on the music front though
we do yours from the information that goes out
mhm
UNK records it in newspaper
mhm
so it's on our tapes anyway
right
so it could go on a separate tape if you wanted that to happen it's on a UNK tape
mm
so it could go on
tapes we could do it
right
it's easy for you to have it at the theatre mhm
to take a copy from that
yeah
yeah
could easily do that
i perhaps could
easily do that
they could pick from me up here or even send it out
yeah could even have some at the theatre and
yes
UNK does it anyway
mhm
so there's no point in UNK it
no
so in a way that's not really audio description although it's
no
obviously
no
closely linked but it's not really
but it's always a joy for blind people to go to the theatre
yeah
mhm
if they're involved yes
that's right
right i've nothing else has anybody else have any other topics
ah good
erm
that's rather nice ah nice
it is it's nice most of them don't work i've got
date of next meeting
a lovely one over there
oh
yes i've been looking at that and thinking we'll take it mm
its great isn't it
probably worth a fortune i find
present it to us yes and doesn't work
oh and doesn't work well
maybe because it's not wound up
is the mouse dead
the time of day and er
yeah
you're quite right yes
can i ask just a little it's quite a big question actually i don't know if anybody will answer it
is there any research
probably not
on the size or the whereabouts of the potential markets that we have as a theatre
well this is something that we have talked about
i mean we touched on how we're going to reach some but is there any
this is something we've talked about and in fact lucy and i have talked about it
mhm
actually we mm at some length and had a few ideas erm i've got an appointment with someone at the arts council in a couple of weeks that the arts council's got a new fund called erm consultants in research and i thought i'd make a bid to see if we can get someone
mhm
to research this audience and ways of getting to it
mhm
mhm
presumably you know roughly how many people are already
if you look at the number on the register i've got three and a half thousand
already we can give you these numbers i mean we've got
yeah but that doesn't mean anything if you're getting ten people turning up
it doesn't mean anything
no but it means it means that we know how we've got to gear up
yes
yes to a lot of things
i think what we needs is a
what we're ready to pitch that sort of thing
that's right i think what means something is this overall figure and then erm a kind of er an information giving part which points out that what you know what seventy five per cent of my twelve thousand had over sixty five
mm
fifty per cent over seventy five
mhm
but a piece of research would be very good because that would help in honesty when you're trying to get erm organized with er transport and things
yeah
that's why we're saying transport important because the majority of people are over seventy five
sure but it also goes down to do with erm UNK and doing the evening performance
but what that's right
yes what should aha
and there's also
that's right and there's also people who have been to the theatre before that's not an audience who have
yes no oh no
and the audience yeah
and it's not like the deaf audience had dealing with the
have a hearing audience yes that are older but the deaf audience which is very young but other audiences and people who have lost their sight
yes
have been to theatre
mhm
and who really could yeah
who have once enjoyed the theatre yes
the sort of thing is
it's bringing them back
yeah the sort of thing lucy and i were talking about earlier is it was just before i went on holiday so my memory is kind of UNK it's one where i was going to see the arts council and see if they were interested in the idea if they work
mhm
you know this is the initial chat if they're interested you know you suddenly put paper and go back to lucy and say okay let's write this down
right
but i mean it was things like doing questionnaires maybe telephone question phoning people up you know that your three and a half well not all of them but an example
mhm
and she seemed fairly confident about her questionnaire in developing the right question in questionnaire but i suppose that would be in conjunction with people like you
mm
yes
mhm
erm to sort of engage a response
it was it was as much to do with what kind of things would you like to see
mhm
listen to
yes cos that's the other bit isn't it
aha
as it's the choice aspect of it as well as the sort of if there was an audio description would you go and you know
mhm
what kind of things do you want to have audio described so there are i mean there's still quite a bit but she got quite excited about the idea of involving one of the proper well not proper one of the you know official professional market research firms as well in terms of doing this work maybe getting money from the arts council to actually pay them
mhm
to do it although whether they have this appropriate kind of sensitivity of not i don't know
no mhm
so it is a sort of it's a kind of sort of UNK topic it's sort of in one of those stages where it's not actually happening yet because a
but i mean erm i mean it it's UNK obviously at this
i think there's a there's
point your thinking how can we get people involved
how can we get the people yeah
i mean i worked at as an open afternoon or something where we invite like into the theatre
yes
find out what feel around the theatre
yes
get onto the stage feel a set talk to some of the actors
talk to the costume people
talk to the costume people you know talk about make up because a lot of
yes cos remember at the beginning of all this audio description lots a chat about including all that
that's right
i was horrified because you know it's like bringing blind people in doing all this but something like that open day whatever that'll be wonderful
that would
that'll be great fun
yeah
would encourage people to
mhm
that's right if you're organizing something like that and thinking about it from now this is only the first of september but
yes
UNK already out
yes
that's right
so the only the that the easiest way for me to do
UNK out yeah
UNK out as well the easiest way for us to get to people is through these
mhm
tapes
tapes
now the next one doesn't go out until october so you would have to have something in november
mhm
to give people time to organize it
i think yeah two months ahead
that would be okay i mean
to let you mention it once
two months ahead
let you mention it again
at least two months ahead
and go on about it again
so if you had a date in november that you could give me time to get people together
mhm
i have a huge group of people who meet the first thursday in every month
aha
so even to get them there
yes
that would help a lot
would be a good er
yes getting them in the door is the
get them in the door
the blind people respond really
wanted to come back yeah
well to somewhere they've been
yeah
that's right
and if they've been there people have been really nice to them
mhm
and it's been good fun they do want to come back
i have thirty or forty people who meet once a month for
oh that's excellent
first thursday in the month
aha
and we could get them to you
mhm
cos their meeting could just be with you
mhm
yes good idea
for that afternoon
that'll be ideal yes
that'll be ideal
mm yeah
i think that's a wonderful idea
yes
easily organized
mhm
if they could see the theatre to see what was going on and an example of audio description
get them into the theatre without a lot of sighted people to push through that's what it's like yes
yes that's right yes
yes
and find out where the la ladies is
where the loo it's as simple as that yes
all that kind of thing yes
yeah
it's having that knowledge you know
that's right trying to get people together for that japanese
let them take
night
i remember japanese night
but that was very difficult to organize because they never give us time and
that's right yeah
if you don't have two months you can't do it
no you can't you really have time
you've got to have two months mm
so your UNK your publishing date for this is october
first of october it'll go out
first of october
mhm and iris
probably round about then
and then you'll need that
you could assess them on that and just say right i think you're a and a or a b on this particular booklet
mhm
because i've done it with you
i mean that's no reason but we shouldn't be sort of saying well look let's not lets all not do this booklet now
mm
and i think it's something that we ourselves should look at
yeah i just wondered because there are some of them that don't have any relevance to national curriculum and i want to
why
i just thought maybe you know sort of miss them out do level one
do another type
do level one and level two the ones that you have to do and if there's any time left at the end of the year do the ones that you missed out
that are left aha
yeah
you know that
ah
you know are non essential
i'm sure that would the would they be flexible and look at i mean certain things you know UNK and UNK
yeah
do you really feel
it's just that
that that's terribly
yeah
important
and it the there are some of the extension that are much more appropriate
yes we don't yes
and some of the children never ever get to the extension booklets
have you do you think it might be better for some of the UNK ones to stretch them to go through the whole lot do you know what i mean
instead of just doing all of one a you know how yo how you follow the map
yeah
to do go through and do the UNK at the same time follow the topic straight
mhm
through
it would be
do you think they would
sometimes it is yes
it would be it would be better for them than doing all the UNK together cos doing all the extension booklets
i know
together is really hard
i don't think it is
it's hard
and it's erm i don't
mhm
think it's very meaningful to them
yeah
what i've what i've tended to do is to do two b and two e
together
together
mhm
that mi that might be more
aha
sensible
well i haven't you see but i i've thought about it and thought
yeah
it would be a good
i've done
idea
i've done that cos what i've said to them is well it's too much for you to do all the UNK together
mhm
mhm
mhm
if you do two b and two e and two e and three a
mm
mhm
and mix them
yes so you would you would look
cos three a's easy isn't it
ooh yes
you would look at one a and one b
well that's it they find that
probably together
a UNK don't they
would you
after doing er
oh
sorry
one a and one b so yo or would you have all of yours completing one a before they started on one b
well have you got
or do you
that map
is it in there or not the map
yeah it's in it's in that the that
one
you know the map that we've got all or not
there
you mean with all the
aye it's not in there is it
aye the one that the one that we printed out
is it
yeah that's it
no that's er
it doesn't give all them
no it doesn't
er
mm
i don't know where the map came from originally
mhm
but it wasn't in this book
well the i me it does follow across doesn't it
yes
from one a one b
that's two a two b
that's it
and two e so that
that's right yeah
that shows that one
mhm
yes you see the they're suggesting that when you've done area one that you might like to
aha
go on to UNK area
aha
and that if you've done erm bum digging into history that you could do UNK and coordinate patterns
mhm
well it's not so much a suggestion it's more that you can't do UNK area until
oh yes
you've done area one
aha
isn't it
yes
yeah
but i think the link up is suggesting that
mm
you could
yeah
just follow on there
mhm
so really the they're working on the whole scheme then er
well
from one to four aren't they
some
a
of them do you think it'll
i tend
create problems
i tend to sa to say right you know one a and one b are all out together
oh yes that
but
that's but once they start
well i didn't used to i used to have one a at the beginning but of course it was UNK because the there weren't enough booklets to go round
well i mean a all the reasonable kids don't do all
no
the numbers one two three four five anyway
so
no
that's
but you still have to take care in case somebody says well i've just done fractions two and you say but you haven't done fractions
yeah
one
you know
aha
mhm
yeah but i mean the bright ones do the bypass sheet they have the fractions one and they
the fractions and the
don't do that either
yeah
yeah
yeah and if you block it all you're gonna get some kids who will never go beyond number
yes the ma the ma
they won't experience
they might
and they
no
might concentrate
no i me yes no it's not practical to do the whole lot but to erm
but well certainly lo one and two you could couldn't
mhm
you
mhm
see you just use your own judgements some
yeah
some kids you know
i mean i do i don't think that as a department
depends on the ability of the child
we should start saying this is what we all do
yeah
we do
mhm
mhm
what we feel we want them to do and
mhm
what see it seems
i think it this is whole scheme is just a case UNK and trying things with different work
by the time we ge
by the time we get it right
yes after about ten years
the scheme will be redundant or we'll have retired at
that's right
you know but er that's what it's all about
yes you'll go
and UNK come in a say oh i don't like this and get rid of it
yes when i retire UNK say well we're gonna do smile now
so you're not bothered if at the end of the two years they haven't even
reached level four
the best kids haven't reached level four
because
i would
have working three lessons a week some of mine are UNK sort of struggle to onto four
mhm
i'm not saying that i wouldn't say
mhm
i'm not bothered but i would be happier if they will very familiar with the work that they have done
mhm
rather than
mhm
race through
but you might find that it's
the booklet
it's easier because you missed some booklets out
yeah
you wi they will have had support and yo you might say we're gonna miss little things out that we've already covered on or are not relevant anyway erm i think we've just gotta wa just got to see how it works and
a are we going to decide what we think can be missed out
no i think i think
no yeah
i think you yourself can decide what you want to miss out
from what you've taught in that third lesson
alright
really isn't it a lot of it
so we we're looking there at a reasonable amount of sort of extra work but i think we will find a benefit from doing that
mm
i say we might
part
if we sort through all the work sheets we've got we might find you know
so
yes
some
quite a few
are we going to try and get some work sheets
i think one of our first
that we can we can
jobs
all use
yeah
mm
are we also going to try and match those up with the UNK targets so that we can say they've completed a work sheet successfully
mhm
yes
we can give them something
yes we'll put that on mhm
put it on their record
yes
and we could if we've gotta collect evidence we could use those work sheets as evidence
mhm
and we've also got
mhm
yes we we've got to look at this in the assessment er procedures as well but we've go we've got to try and link this up with er the computer work that we're doing erm we we've got i think really we should have possibly a reasonably UNK session one evening next week to say right how are we going to put this into practice
let's you know i mean UNK saying well i've got some good work sheets on this i mean we can all say that if we all know where the work sheets are
mhm i think UNK most of mine
no but
i think i've cleared
mine are pretty dog UNK
well yes i've think i've had
oh i've got loads
i had a damn good clear out i think most of mine have gone
hundreds
i might have a copy of some
well it seems pretty UNK me sort of saying oh here you know they're never gonna get the hang of negative numbers and UNK saying oh i've got an excellent work sheet and you think well you know
mm
if i'd known about that would of great
mm
i think if we all know what's available it would it would be a lot easier than just operating as you know five separate units
oh yes i think so for that and so then we've gotta bank our work sheets
mhm
what we keep in the then just all to use
i mean it's not gonna be it's not gonna be easy but if we start developing it erm there's no reason
mhm
why you know it shouldn't work reasonably well
go and get my down and get a bit more room
right well we've only got erm not much more than ten minutes left erm i'm ri i'm well we've got to be we've got to be early for lunch so you'll need to go
it's only across there
take us ten minutes
you'll need to go
to walk there
and shower and such like
and change
well you can stay here till twenty five past if you want that's up to you
erm am i right in thinking
that this after that this afternoon your
i'm technology for the rest of the
right
for the two days
and i'm somewhere else
it's just us two we're gonna do
and you're
our assessment
you're looking at graduated assessment
mhm
okay
you won't be around for the other sessions
no that's me finished
aye is
and i'm not
how many sessions are there this after da do we have a session together this afternoon or not
yes
yeah
well yo you're not just the three of us
is there only one session this afternoon
mhm
two there's the one with UNK and i and then you join us for the last session
right that's fine then
so we'll sta er you do erm graduated assessment this afternoon then we'll start looking at erm our assessment procedures we you know s m p national curriculum and i mean if you're not around you know well
i can't do the presentation
you know
aye
what presentation
aye
don't know about a presentation
yeah i don't anything about a presentation
mhm well you will when you're sitting in front of the staff tomorrow so don't
so erm you know wha what else do we feel i mean tha that's that will take up this afternoon wha what else do we feel is you know vitally er important
ooh how about a UNK
so i should remember that there's a you know it
having a UNK
i do ju hey
there you are
that's UNK er speaking UNK first
wasn't me
the head the head has said he wants er a UNK copy of this
has he
he he's slipped
right
me a few quid to give him and what have you
right UNK the UNK for UNK right
erm well in actual fact er s m
you know s m p er erm national curriculum is gonna take us an
forever
mm
so
well look if you're wanting the next thing to do i mean you've done that for seventh year
aha yes
is it not worth sitting and thinking what you're gonna do with the eighth year
some of the things for eighth year oh yes
yes
yes
but i do i think that would be very useful but we've got to make sure that we get this assessment started so if we don't get round to eighth year then that's tough
mhm
we've got seventh year sorted erm i think we've gotta look at the assessment
now we while you're here you know wha just to sort of ten minutes erm i mean UNK produced these sheets
yep
which we can photocopy
mhm
now basically what we're thinking is that no we're not thinking we haven't really got round to that
but i would feel that
you know we must be talking about july when we sh when we present when we produce erm one of these pieces of paper
for the present year seven
and eight
yeah
or just
yeah
seven
seven and eight
sorry one of these pieces of paper
well one of these records
national curriculum records
oh right
now i don't know whether what other people would say about doing it the way we're suggesting like somebody has completed levels one a one b and two a therefore they've got this and perhaps
mm
a few odds and ends added to it
you're wanting to produce a certificate for the kids is that what you're talking about
well not a certificate just a record
no just our records
just the national curriculum
just a record
they're records
record sheet
who haven't got it
you not seen them
no
ah
oh
look at this straight in the UNK
oh
and it's there
no it's not
oh i've got my national curriculum in here as well
erm
did you hear that was alan just making it
i wondered where that had gone
hadn't i lost it no
no i did definitely bring it
well look why don't you just sketch it out on there so i know the sort of thing that yo oh you've got one have you
UNK got me one
hey ian i'm glad somebody's organised
oh
do you want the old one or the new one
the UNK one
right
right yeah i knew
this is it
that you'd done that because i started it as well on the computer
right well i've done it all the way through
right fine
right up there to the yellow books
right
so what are you wanting from me
right so wha what we're looking at is you know we would have that
mhm
now you're gonna get anybody with that but let's suppose that you did have somebody that was really there we want that UNK out really
mhm
and we would need to have national curriculum name date and so on which
mhm
i mean just a few odds and ends that you could do from your nice
mhm
printing on the computer
mhm
now what we would say like if somebody has erm you know by the end of year seven done that
yeah
right this would be the national curriculum record so we'd have something but i don't know that it's wise to
no
to really have that in to say look you know to make it that obvious
well i mean that wasn't in for that reason
no
it's not
oh yeah
i wasn't thinking ahead to a final document
s so we would look at that and you would need as well to be looking at
UNK in what levels one
li
and two
little bits
and anything else that we
and anything else
we're saying that
there
we're going to cover
aha
on there
but i mean when you think how long it was taking us taking a blank one of and i know the
one of them
UNK targets have changed but a blank one of those and colouring the damn ooh sorry pete
the er things in erm you know i mean that was horrendous
why
well it was me that did that
in the first place
yes
for the other one so i know
it has to be remembered as well that this is my interpretation of the UNK that s m p have sent out
we're happy with your
because
interpretation
i mean the first time at a lower level something appeared i UNK half a square
that's what i
yeah
did
and next time it appeared
yeah
i UNK the full square
yeah
in now whether that's right or not i don't
that's
know
that's what i did and i thought the same thing
really what we needed to do was to read through make sure that it was covered adequately but on the other hand if they've come across something twice and not if i if it was in brackets i didn't count it did you do
mm
that as well
if it was just in brackets then i ignored it
yeah
it had to appear twice properly
aha
before i coloured it in
yes i mean the other thing is if we are absolutely honest which we shouldn't be with a microphone in front of us but if we're absolutely honest you know this is a bit of work that we're trying to make simple
aha
when is anybody going to come and make use of that
the o the only thing is that when the kids do the sats
yes
right
aha
and they are given a level from the sats how are you going to record that on there
mm
and how are you going to record ar are you still you see you can't use colours if you're gonna do it that
so
way
this would just be dated and then er by year nine they would have er a nineteen ninety three one a nineteen ninety four one and nineteen ninety five one
right so you need a year as well
you're going a
really that you need a space for dates
are you going to explain to me this afternoon how this works are you
well if they've finished one a you photocopy that
if they've finished level one a
you give them one of them
you photocopy that with their name on
oh
oh well that's good
if they've finished one
yeah
b you photocopy that and put their name on
but we're not but we're not going to da we're going to do it one by one next july you will say where is a kid
right
and then you just say i've got five
there'll be three a
who have finished one a
get a three a sheet out their name on
then you get a three a sheet
so you won't need all the others
no
the on the only the only
oh right
that you still either gonna have to fill in anything else that you've covered with them
aha
and UNK
separately
target one
that's the one
UNK target one
but even then i was thinking that we might in actual fact start looking at UNK target one and certainly fill in you know
mm
the first i mean there's
mm
no way that we could
level one i think are we are we ignoring
level one and level two
what i are we ignoring the stuff that comes primary school then
well it'll be interesting to have them but i mean
it'll be interesting to have it but i mean we
you can't sort of
we've got to UNK kids on that
assume that they're at that level when they come to us and follow on from there
see i sometimes wonder whether it's not worth giving them some kind of er a proper test
national curriculum test
when they come in
the beginning
mhm
mm
and saying right well you're at level
well that was another thing that we did debate
mhm
should we in actual fact produce
give them give them time to settle in
well we should well yes because i suppose eventually we could have them fo we've got one now haven't we for the end of year eight
aha but if you
well we can it off the end of year seven and one for the UNK for next year so they
well no if we wanted to we could produce erm a level three test
i mean when they when they do the sats
what i what's what is it we've got now
three four
when the
and five
when they when the a the when they do the sats then we'll have something that we can trust won't we
when they have
well mm
public sats
mm
but it if we wanted to change what we've done already we could at a certain stage have a level three i mean i've ordered these books you know UNK level by level
mhm
so we've got what we've already got and we could produce i it just worries me because we're going we're going back to eleven plus days you know
mhm i know
and saying a UNK you know
well they are anyway cos they've been doing the test at eleven
ya well that's what it is isn't it
in
but
different levels
we could have a level three test that they could try
mhm
and then we could say well yes this UNK what we've what we've said here
well how do they get the levels in the junior school
how did mrs do it
erm
ooh tick sheet isn't it
sorry
it's a tick sheet isn't it
it's a mhm
yeah but some of them have had sats obviously the ones lower down
but i mean they
but then
they're UNK on kids they're they give them a problem which is a typical level four or five or six or whatever and because they get that one problem right they say that kid is a level six
oh
you know ju just
so i mean tha that's
looking at one
aha
single aspect for you know
but the other thing about giving them a UNK test at the re when they first arrived with us is when you get the parent who comes and says well how they were level five in the primary school and you've only given them level four
you can say well i'm sorry but on our tests
mhm
when they arrive in school in september they were level two and they've now moved up to level three
that of course is that of course is the problem of national curriculum it's your interpretation of the national curriculum and there is i mean if UNK says a child is level three i would accept that but if somebody from spring garden said this child is level five i'm certainly not going to accept that without evidence that i have
yeah but what i'm saying is that yeah but what i'm saying is when the parent comes to you and says well the primary school said they were you can say well yes but by our standards and our assessment when they arrived here
the problem is that
they were that and they and this is pre the progress that they've made
the thing you are saying about
the parents are going to naturally assume that you're a if you're at level five at one stage
the ones you buy in a shop i've heard of six
that you would either remain at level five or go up to level six
six is the
which is not gonna be the case when they transfer from school
so you can six
i know i know
at regular intervals but when you get to higher
but at least it would give us some because you could say well yes there has been progress erm primary school might have said
you only have one level five for all
and like did was three
mhm
i would think so
and if they that's what you say that they're doing
well more or less
they di yo
oh did they
i must just jump up and down on mrs when i see her at lunch time
emma is emma here today
oh she's with mrs is she
i see now we've got lots to do this morning you're going to need to ignore what's going on behind me ah it's not happening right as i said to you at the very beginning of september i'm the star so you pay attention to me
that was the correct thing to do very well though you saw the look and you decided
on the board this morning we're going to have a bash at thinking about some targets we're going to have a bash think about how you think you've done so far
one of the two tasks that i've set you since we met in september what are the two big tasks that we've concentrated on
one should be in your file already and it should be finished and the other one you're going to give to me today
our UNK and our diary
your UNK and your graphs
there the two big pieces of work that we've done together so far in a minute i'm going to give you a printed sheet
we had to do jobs
so you owe me ten minutes and normally when you come into my room you say i'm sorry i'm late
i'm sorry i'm late
you don't look as if you mean it sit down please because my lesson started ten minutes ago there's one over there now in a minute i'm going to give you a printed sheet and it's going to ask you how well you think you're doing
have you been able to complete the survey on belief have you been able to get it done by a deadline
what does the word deadline mean
let's have hands up what does the word deadline mean
the time when it has to come in
yes the time when it has to come in the day i say i want to collect it now you might need to say to yourself oh dear mrs said the deadline was have i met it
no or yes i'm UNK brilliant yes i did meet the deadline
now i'm going to help you with it and what i suggest we do this morning when i give you these sheets will you please write your name and today's date at the top of the sheet and i put the date on the board and then can you please resist the temptation to start writing over the rest of the sheet until i've gone through it with you
you can certainly have a read but please resist the temptation to write on it
right the sheets are coming round when you get yours your name on it and today's date on it please that's all i've already UNK holes in it so it's ready to go in your file now is there anyone who does not have one of these sheets it says at the top year seven module one survey on belief
is there anyone who does not have a copy in front of them
please write your name and the date
the date is on the board oh we'll do that later that one get you another one good most people seem to of done that
if you have a look at the sheet you can see there are six sections and then on the right hand side there are two columns one is headed up pupil the other is headed up teacher
in a moment when i've explained what each of these sections mean i'm going to ask you to put your signature in the column says that says pupil
each time you think you have succeeded in UNK that task
now when i sign my name that's what i do they're my initials that's all i need you to do
now you might decide that you want to put i don't know f b fred UNK like that that's fine you do not need to write your full name
a simple signature is fine and then i when i'm satisfied that i have seen that work in your file done in the way you say you've done it i will sign the teacher column on your sheet okay let's start going down these six sections
section one says now for this everybody we're thinking about the survey you did in the form room from which you did your graphs saying to people do you believe in god have you visited a place of worship is everyone clear about the piece of work we're thinking about speak to me
yes
yes good
i didn't do it
you didn't do the class survey
really
because i was away
you were away for all of it
in which case it would be pretty silly to fill that in wouldn't it
pretty silly because you haven't done that piece of work so perhaps what you would like to do if you would like to follow it with us then i will give you back i think i might have your survey here and you can at least see what we've been talking about and then on that we can write absent for this piece of work does that make sense good
everybody else then number section one can you collect information for use in a class now we've got several ways of doing this first of all were you able to collect information for the class survey whoever's UNK with a pen please don't it's driving me nuts
could you collect information for the class survey
were you able in other words to go round and talk to people to get their answers and record your answers on their grid if you think yes you did do that sign your name now in section one where it says survey
if you don't think you can do it then i'd leave it blank if i were you cos otherwise you're telling UNK aren't you
who thinks they were able to collect information for the survey
hands up oh brilliant boys you not sure
no
not sure okay hands down everybody
what are you not sure about
i didn't get all the names
right so you had a problem getting everybody's name what problem did you have
the same as malcolm
you had the same problem as malcolm so would it be fair to sign that or would it be more sensible to leave it blank
leave it blank
why
because we didn't finish it
right that makes sense good sensible
i did it but i only missed out the two people that were away
right so it wasn't your fault that they were away was it
so did you do the survey
did it
so what you gonna do
sign it
brilliant you're gonna sign it brilliant
right next part of section one did you collect the information by the deadline which means were you able to complete it in your form time with your form tutor and bring it to the lesson so that you could start on the s on the graph
you have a think about it if you think yes i did i spoke to everybody i got their answers and i was able to bring that sheet to mrs lesson sign it
did you think mm no i had one or two names i left off i was too busy doing something else i was away then you can't sign it can you
because you did not meet the deadline and you've just told me that deadline means the day i said i wanted it
everybody okay with that
yeah
speak to me
yes
i was away but i completed it so
by the deadline
sign it
okay third part did you collect the information after the deadline if you did sign it
if you didn't if you met the deadline leave it blank only you know the answer to that
next one i did not complete the survey not because people were away if people were absent that's not your fault what reasons might there be for you not completing the survey hands up
i didn't get time to go round all the people
you didn't get time to go round to everybody that's one you were too busy chatting the girls up yeah
others
i was away
i was away i was absent so sign it
any more
i done most of them but i left the sheet at home in my coat
i did most of them but then i left the sheet at home sign that bit
right yes so you weren't able to complete it because you left the things at home you weren't very well organized okay so sign that part
shall i sign it er cos i didn't get all the names
yes anybody else not sure please don't write on your pencil case
anybody else not sure
okay we've done section one well done
section two oh big word here UNK
i can UNK information and present the information as a table
what on earth do you think the word UNK means
it's a very sort of secondary school type word isn't it
is it to collect all the information you've got
it does mean collect sort of er you're talking to me everybody it does sort of mean collect anybody else
UNK means not only collect together but organize it
do you remember the UNK we did
yeah
we were UNK so i can UNK the information and present the information as a table how many of you were able to do the UNK
brilliant sign it
number three i can present information in graph form who's been able to do a bar graph
i've done a bit of one
who's been able to do a bar graph
brilliant sign it who did pictures to go with their bar graph
sign it so there should be two signatures in that little bit of number three
you did a graph and you did pictures if you did the graph one signature if you did pictures another signature and shall we say what are we going to call pictures
what are we going to call that illustrations is the word what are we going to say is acceptable as an illustration
hands up give me some suggestions no ideas
UNK them
UNK accounts for illustrated pictures patterns colours you filled in all the space that's illustrated as far as i'm concerned
did you work as a member of a group now what do you think that means
oops sorry bash you on the UNK no it's my album
did you work in a group
to do what
to do the graph
mm some people decided they were going to work as a as a group on their table to gather information and when you were doing the UNK last week you helped each other didn't you some of you helped you were talking to one another to help make sure that you got the right number of UNK if you worked with some other people to get the survey questions and do the UNK sign it if you did everything on your own leave it blank is anyone not sure what to do there
i helped you
oh i don't want the arguments of about who was helped okay you carry on you argue that's alright number five read it and then somebody tell me what it means
read it number five and someone
what
tell me what it means you've got some secondary school type words there as well it says has been co operative and helpful in the classroom
co operative have you worked with other people as a team as a pair have you been pleasant and helpful have you been a pain in the neck
now if you think you have been pleasant and helpful you've shared things with somebody if they asked you a question you didn't bang them on the head you helped sign it now we come to the real sixty thousand point question are you ready for this
are you really ready for this
yeah
i'm not sure has produced all homework all homework on time if you think yes i have sign it if you think no i haven't there's a bit sitting at home and i'm gonna give it in tomorrow no you haven't have you
you haven't if you've got it all in on time you've brought it all to this and you haven't come out to me saying oh i'm really sorry can i bring it tomorrow oh i really wasn't sure oh
miss you know the graph we done where we were
if it wasn't completed and we still bring it in can we write it down or
well would you say then that you had finished the homework task on time

yeah
now at the bottom of your sheet shh i there are two boxes one is for me to scribble in the other one is for you to write neatly in i'm the only one here who's allowed to scribble
i would improve this work by in front of you this morning most of you have got your graph
the bar chart that was the result of the survey we did you need to look at that piece of work and ask yourself a question is this piece of work the best thing i have ever done
if the answer is no then you need to think about how you could improve that piece of work somebody is speaking now it's bad enough you owe me ten minutes if it's not the best piece of work you've ever done why isn't it
now have a look at the work now hands up and see if you could tell me just looking at your work is there some way you could of improved it
if i said right you've got a second chance this morning how could you improve that piece of work in front of you now

handwriting i could make my handwriting UNK larger i could try joining my handwriting have the letters joined some people are still more comfortable printing in year seven
illustrations
illustrations i could put some illustrations in i could use more i could use colour i could make more detailed illustrations yes
spelling
spelling i could have improved this work by checking the spelling carefully with a dictionary
i could of improved this spelling by UNK my brain when i did my homework doing it on my lap in front of neighbours
how else could you improve that piece of work
by colouring
you could use far more colour make it bright and UNK make it UNK at me come on mrs mark me i dare you
erm you could of underline down by the bottom
did you underline the dates titles
did you put your name on it or have you done an anonymous piece of homework
now on the board i have listed some possible targets
you are going to decide now by looking at your graph how you could improve this piece of work and i want you to write the target you decide on it could be more than one in the space that says i would improve this work by you're to write that now please off you go and while you're doing that let's get the register done shh sarah

later you are going to have an opportunity to do some writing similar to the pieces you have heard however if you have been UNK and not concentrating you won't know what to do big boys
i wonder why people are here on earth
i wonder why they haven't burnt
i wonder what is the point of living
why are we talking taking and why are we giving
these are the questions to the puzzled men man
why the world's here why it began
why are there wars and why do we fight
why are there things wrong and why are things right
these ultimate questions have puzzled us so what are the answers does anyone know
why is there living and why is there dying why is some people laughing and why is some people crying
why some countries rich and some countries poor what is this thing life and what's in it for us and what's it all for
is there a heaven up in the sky and wh why where do we all go when we die
thank you
paula
thank you
thirteen
thank you and that's written by a thirteen year old pretty good ah let's have a male voice amongst all of this
get yourself here big boys and that one
if i ruled the world everyone would sing and shout war and bombs are the things i would throw out
little children need to UNK no more as i would give them a big food store
a house for everyone to live in is something else i would give them
rain and cold weather would be sent away i would order it to be a hot sunny day
christmas would be twice a year so we could have lots of good UNK
there's lots of things i wouldn't like to do if i ruled the world how about you
and who wrote that
UNK eight
eight thank you eight i believe in love it comes from above i believe in UNK every year he does his UNK
i believe in UNK they UNK like UNK i believe in make believe and i believe in what do you believe
you've had two and a bit examples a thirteen year old with their questions about life what's it all for who put us here and what on earth did they put us here for
an eight year old if i ruled the world if i was in charge this is how i would organize things and then and i believe what i believe in
what i want you to do between now and the end of the lesson ah wait for it in your rough books ah i want you to start writing down ideas of the things that are important to you but before we do that let's just have a few starters on the board let's have some hands up
put your hand up and give me an idea of some of the things you think are important what do you believe i believe do you
yes
okay so would it be fair to say some people would want to put that down
i believe in god are there any other things what do you believe
i believe that mark hall is the best school in harlow
yeah
yeah
no
well okay some people were a bit UNK about that what else do you believe in
shh steven doesn't believe in anything shh well you're silent
being silent
is nothing important to you don't be smart with me is nothing important
is there nothing you would like to organize is there nothing you would like to change about the world the planet think
people don't have enough food
so what would how would you like to say that
how can you
i believe if we make an effort we can give people food
did you get this by the way did you get the information yesterday about collecting the bar codes
one and a half million
one and a half million saves a six year old little boy's life in a london hospital
i believe everybody in mark hall is capable of achieving that target
there's my box see if you can fill it
okay let's go back to the i believe what other things would you like to alter to sort out
i believe the children should have their way once in a while
once in a while once
in a while
once no once i'm not buying that at all
i believe children i'm not i don't like writing this children er should have say it again
have a fair trial
er
a fair trail now and
er no a fair
trial now and again
trial or a fair try
trial
trial
trial of what
always a fair trial now and again
a fair trial now and again
every day
no
no every day every day
once er any more shh i'm not writing every day if you want to alter it you might need to
children should be able to drive
yes
what did he say
children should be able to drive
what did he say
he said i believe children should be able to drive i think we are now getting
yeah
into the UNK of fantasy erm just shh i won't add any more
i won't add any more to the board because i think you're starting to get the idea but one or two others i want you to think about i believe animals should not be UNK upon for make up i believe everybody should be treated with respect
that seems reasonable doesn't it for a wednesday it seems reasonable
i believe i believe mrs when she says she'll jump up and down on my head if i get my homework in late
i believe children shh should not be abused i believe teachers should not be abused mm
now in your rough books please start listing all things that you would like changed that you believe are right that you believe
shh go on now start writing how long have you got to do this
well i
it's a heck of a time isn't it to let
how many of you are involved in doing it
it takes
but it's not your job then to start
really so why does it go to the next
and so these are clear words
what the aim
yes you're never gonna get to college you're never gonna get a you're never gonna get your a levels
no it's the necessity before you know the university of life is a great teacher you know but erm take it while you need it but in the meantime erm there's a great deal more out there
mm
and while we're on about it why haven't i seen you
somewhere
oh make my
i always think this is february
yes
being ill come back to work until he's
so when
erm friday
i knew yesterday morning
yes and what have you got
those who you're going to
i know that when the person who was doing this
it wasn't going to be appropriate
yeah that's why it got probably
mm it might be that she's got
then when
it's daft isn't it yeah
how many have you got girls
one
one what is it it'd better be a good one
pollution drug abuse theft murder erm the way you're treated by adults the way we treat one another equality no racism violence UNK everybody should have a right to an education everybody should have the right to have their teeth filled when they need it and teachers deserve more pay and more it's only for instance
one
no he left erm
he left about two years ago he's at
which i think is that way
he must of left just after i did
yeah and then she left i think
he works part time in a sixth form college
there's nothing he can get out of it
no that's right but erm if you want a coffee
no that's alright
shh erm i can hear UNK i believe UNK are working
miss david
a course
but i know that quite often they
whenever they hear about they automatically
no not in the least good fine
that's lovely there's no it's not a
pardon
er judging by the noise i can hear some people have finished some people have extremely short statements of about what they think is important and some people have got no statements
who's got five different things they think they are important they would like to change they would like to stay the same who's got more than five more than five
not many hands down not enough
planners out
miss are we doing this
miss
yes this is brilliant my goodness you come to school and you're doing something brilliant we can't have that
up to fifty my goodness you'll be working for a fortnight
no let david he
right planners now according to me this is for thursday next thursday week t week one thursday so homework for thursday finish writing a list er whoever's UNK will you calm down of things you believe are important do this in rough and i think we'd better underline the next bit bring it to the lesson now quite seriously if you have only managed to get five or six items at the moment on your list that you think are important that's not enough you really do need to be going for a minimum of ten and if you can't then the next piece of work that we're going to do in the lesson next week is going to be quite difficult
i'm going to bring in some UNK medieval books for you to have a look at because what you're going to do is to write this out in best on special paper using UNK letters and if you're very good we will try to get them UNK so that we can keep them as an example of what year seven students can produce as their best work to say to everybody hey look at this is very good now we can't do that if i give you a sheet of a four paper and you manage to fill less than a quarter of that space so you're going to need a minimum of ten different things that you would like to say you think are important you believe are important you believe they're valuable and your homework over the next week is to finish that list if you want it to UNK well yes you can work on it to make it UNK if you want to have what we call UNK er just one moment i haven't said clear away
i have not said clear away it is not the end of the lesson and some of you have not worked hard enough to make the end of the lesson now if you don't want to make the whole poem UNK what you might want to do is to put two lines together at a time and have those UNK you can do that
and what you might need to start thinking about as well is how could you illustrate some of these already around you in the room going up work from year nine where they have started writing that as a complaint to god UNK about UNK andrew about UNK and floods and so on and they've decided that they're going to illustrate the work they're doing with these paper UNK of disasters and problems in the world there's one up here about a UNK that's been taken from the wild and is in UNK in london UNK and they said that they think it's wrong
you need to have a think during the next week about how you can illustrate the lists that you're drawing together are you going to use newspaper UNK
are you going to do your own drawings
are you going to do photographs
what are you going to do
if you've said you've that you think you believe UNK and UNK should not be UNK then perhaps you can find a photograph showing those creatures swimming in the open ocean something to think about
are there any questions about that homework
is there anyone who doesn't understand what they have got to go home and do
are you sure
speak to me
yes
okay right one person from each table will you please bring me the homework graph and the sheet that you filled out the assessment sheet
one person from each table yes thank you are there any more
right can one person from each table please bring me the red files boys can i have your red files please what was that
was that one of your i believes
what was that
er right shh er right people shh er you might find that once you start thinking about what you actually believe it gets quite complicated i just want you to listen to this
dear god everything is so wrong look it took you six days to make the world but does it say in the bible that it took you fifteen days to design it oh no you just got up and decided to make the world
when you saw what a disaster you had caused you could of started again and taken some time oh sorry i forgot that's not UNK you probably didn't want to know or is it that you enjoy what you made a sort of entertainment better than home and away watching wars and diseases and things
here are but three mistakes of your career you would of at least think entering the world would be safe enough but even that has its dangers
you could be born disabled UNK or dead
if your so called parents decided to have an abortion that's it you're history you never got a chance or a choice
a nice night's sleep seems like a nice change but UNK have habits of popping up once when i was five i had a dream that my friends and i were being ripped apart and eaten by a giant now when the time comes to go into that great big c d tea room in the sky could you change something
what have UNK bleeding and being run over by a steam roller got in common
they're all painful
could our bodies UNK red when we only have a day left so we could all sit down and wait UNK and then when we snuff it we could just disappear
and it goes on
now some of you were UNK there and some of you were smiling it might be that you actually would quite like to say you know that i believe it's wrong for people to be born disabled handicapped
that year nine student has got quite a lot to say has written a very nice letter of complaint to god UNK god's ear say just one minute god
you need to have a think about those things as well
you did very well this morning will you quietly stand
okay one table two table
david wait up
here sign the minutes of the last meeting and the special meeting for the special meeting thing but it doesn't matter
and er are there any apologies
yes celia and john
john who
and i
ah yes
yes
and er they got
right
and him
erm one of those er that i've got two er points to make one is to there's a recording somewhere going on er it's erm not anything really to do with er us but we have agreed or someone's agreed on our behalf but er the person can do the recordings but it's er of an educational nature to er help students with their language but er we shall be completely anonymous so if
is that rough language
so we'll er just erm behave yourselves this evening
and er
and speak UNK and erm and then forget that er anyone's here
that's the first one the second er point is that we have on our agenda on eleven d er the three hills re er UNK and er we have er the er association here to erm to make a presentation
i wondered if you'd agree with me that we if we do that first and so then we can get on with our business afterwards
would that i hope that will that er you will agree to that because we don't want people hanging around waiting for us to go through all our items so i hope you'll agree with that
yeah
yes
you know i suggest
make it just a minute er bill
simon
thank you
could you ask who that is making the recording
are we allowed to know who who's making the recordings
it's longmans
they're doing it for a dictionary for erm sch for students
so are getting his copyright are they
yeah but is it if it's for commercial er enterprise
is it a well i suppose they're not going to make a loss out of it
but i don't
they'll make a erm they won't make a su a surplus i don't like the word profit so i'll say surplus out of this er little gathering here tonight
i don't think that it's all that er important
when you're in public life you have to put up with er cameras and er things going erm around so and we're going to be er completely anonymous in er that so
i think UNK suggesting that we might benefit in terms of
well erm er well yes of course i didn't think of that
i never think of er you know commercial things i'm just thinking of we well providing a service but then
oh yeah
we don't all work on the UNK do we
however coming back to
er bill wanted to say something
same question i just wondered who it was that was all
oh
right
erm we can er now er get on with the er three hills er UNK
does any of the officers want to say anything
yes i would
er paul
do you want
yes thanks joan
er the reports on three hills UNK er next phase starts on page a hundred
erm and includes an appendix one the proposals from moat housing society with erm nick from moat and some of his colleagues are going to er run through a bit later
erm also we will see u up here er displays erm of the proposals
erm these are the same displays which were shown to er the tenants meeting public at three hills
or in anyway can't be made at the meeting
erm we both feel you've had a chance in detail and they'd been quite blank in design
er just to take you quickly through er the first part of the report and then hand over to moat
erm as part of the agreement on the UNK of the four remaining blocks of three hills erm moat er became our partners for the rest of our development of three hills
as you were aware they had been involved in three hills in er developing UNK field and successfully with us on our most recent one
this scheme has almost been seen as our joint number one priority in terms of social housing projects along with obviously getting social housing on to er church UNK
we are we are very close now to completing the final lease agreement with moat erm as we're not quite there yet i'm gonna be suggesting if it's possible to er amend er one of the recommendations er recommendation b er to take note of the facts that we quite er UNK the agreement yet erm i wanted to try and get in line with the er programme for the recommendation which came out of great UNK neighbourhood committee
and i think it should read erm as it does but without the final full stop it will then go on er when in a form satisfactory to council's legal officers
there is a separate paper which has been circulated as well is the comments on financial liability of the scheme which you should have as well
erm as i've said there is a display there and moat are here to ask as many questions obviously as you'd like and hopefully they'll be able to clear up any er issues on the
erm this has been to great UNK committee so it's been through the UNK er community cycle and there has been an exhibition following that committee on three hills which was very well attended by tenants and residents and main feelings coming out of that was that erm the residents were keen for this to happen certainly wanted something to happen erm er on the estate particularly UNK of the four empty blocks
at the great UNK neighbourhood committee members requested that our building control service being used er the developers throughout the scheme and that has been taken on board and moat are perfectly happy for that to happen
there is one further UNK which has arisen and that is that we er need to apply have applied for a high waste er the roads on the estate are in fact adopted erm so we do need to get that through
erm fi finally what i say on is that we do need er some firm indication this evening erm in order to enable moat housing society to draw down the housing association grant for the housing corporation erm and to enable us obviously to sign a er the legal agreement with them
perhaps it's best if i hand over now to nick to run through the proposals there are some amendments to the one that you had as appendix one erm i don't think any of them are too substantial
perhaps if i just quickly point out the main ones erm they have been amended in er a later version of the document
er i think the main ones really are on page one o six the final two lines of the first paragraph which says the two vacant blocks now really there's four it should just read and does now read the UNK of the vacant blocks
on page one o eight paragraph two point two er the society proposals of the er in accordance with the objectives we've taken out overall it wants to be clear that it must mean it's in total the objectives
page one o nine the second paragraph then we've taken out erm first from first priority so it should read in agreement with harlow to place a notice through the scheme as it's priority with the housing fund in the future years as required
and the next paragraph down we've taken out best now so it'll read erm the legal UNK we will substitute reasonable which er erm has a al altogether different meaning to term
which paragraph is that paul
on this one
that's paragraph three on page one o nine
oh yes
first line
mm
finally on page one four the anticipated start and completion dates are different
it should be spring nineteen ninety five to spring nineteen ninety six
okay with that i'll le i'll hand over to nick to take you through the their present proposals
if you don't mind i'll stand up cos i'm gonna have to shoot over there to the plans in some stage in the in the presentation
i'm nick and i'm the development director for moat responsible for all of our new development activities and i have with me tonight sally our assistant development manager for essex who'll be responsible for this project and also two of our consultants dealing with the scheme alan from UNK design who are acting as architects on the scheme and howard from space who have been acting as our employer's agent and consultant and will administer the building contract for all the phases of this project
if i give you some background to moat and to the project itself an and how we're gonna approach the scheme i'll then hand over to alan who will talk about the design issues and the master plan and we'll price the three hills and how they'll they can meet that subjective
moat put considerable store in this scheme at three hills as the next stage of our partnership er with the council and erm we are committed to doing the scheme in accordance with your overall master plan that you've adopted for the three hills area er our proposals will com complete the re development of the vacant sites at three hills providing a further a hundred and nine properties for social housing both for rent and for low cost home ownership
the scheme will meet the local needs of the area those needs being identified by the district council
if i say a little bit about moat er we are a registered housing association who are obviously monitored by the housing corporation responsible to a committee of management
er we've been going for twenty six years er and we now manage around about three thousand properties and are building er and selling around about seven hundred properties a year for rent and low cost home ownership
er we've been working in harlow for a couple of years now and as you may know we as paul said finished the first phase of three hills which is the UNK field scheme which provided sixty six properties for a low cost home ownership and two special needs properties and we'll also be starting in the next couple of months er on providing low cost home ownership in church UNK erm it's funded by yo yourselves
we currently have a small office in harlow UNK by full time member er and we'll be opening in late november er an of a fully staffing housing management office er with three members of staff it'll be located in the town centre
we're committed to harlow er as an area we put considerable resources of our own into the first phase of er the three hills and you'll hear tonight we'll be putting in a UNK er two hundred thousand odd into this phase from our own reserves
as i said our proposals fulfil commitment to er the three hills area and the overall master plan
the hundred and nine properties that we will provide will be split between seventy one er rented units some of which again will be for special needs and thirty eight low cost home ownership units
these will be shared ownership properties whereby the purchaser will buy a percentage usually forty to fifty percent but then pay a rent on the remainder and they will er be able to staircase to buy further parties into an UNK ownership
so again it's a low cost option for people to get their own housing
we've currently been allocated just over one point three million from the housing corporation which represents about forty one percent of the money that we need to do the scheme
we need two million pounds more from the corporation er and obviously we will be making that our first priority for investing into essex er and to obviously erm as paul said er you're prepared to make that a priority as well and through the housing corporation
our consultants for the project will be for all three phases er leonard space partnership an and UNK design who were involved in the initial master planning of the er three hills area so we feel that gives continuity er to the overall planning of the scheme
we're also committed to tenant participation and er we've done a couple of exercises already on the scheme and we've secured some funding from the housing corporation to employ UNK design on our behalf with the housing association er to involve the tenants as fully as possible in the er development process
the properties that we're building will be available er the initial UNK a and sales will be one hundred percent er to council UNK subsequent UNK and nominations will be at seventy one percent which is the maximum level that we can agree under the housing corporation rules
er however we have agreed and we're perfectly happy er to have an undertaking which obviously you can't enter into within the a legal document cos we wouldn't qualify for a corporation grant to make the remaining twenty five percent available to the council as well
you're the statutory housing authority you identify the people in the greatest housing need our aim is to house people in the greatest need so you identify the tenants
in return for that you're providing a to the society
we will be entering into a legal agreement with the er the council to basically erm set the criteria for the scheme this will establish the mix and the UNK er of the of the er the scheme and to ensure that it UNK to the to the master plan
and we've written into our arrangements with any contractor in the tender documentation that they have to UNK to the er requirements of the master plan
the development agreement requires that we complete the scheme by the thirty first of march nineteen ninety seven er obviously subjective to your support and funding i in the corporation
er if not then we return er the elements of the site we've now developed to yourselves er and we get UNK for the cost that we've incurred in the UNK of the blocks
the legal agreement requires us to UNK er the blocks that are on the site er and this will cost approximately including interest etcetera over two hundred thousand pounds to the society er so obviously it's a reasonably substantial commitment from ourselves tying up our own our resources in three hills
in return for us putting that money into the scheme er straight away er as paul said the council will be agreeing to make us priority for handling corporation funding and if that's not successful er to use your reasonable UNK to try and find the remainder of the scheme yourselves
as i said we've already got forty one percent of the main funding required er for the project and er we're relatively erm confident that with our own money going in and yourself putting the er the loan in for the nothing er that a our bids are gonna be successful in future years
if i just nip round to the drawings i'll just give you an indication of what exactly we're doing
this development here is the first phase called UNK field which we've already completed the sixty eight units for er rent and shared ownership
we've got funding already from the housing corporation to do twenty four category one sheltered flats on this part of the site and we'll looking to start that in late er UNK november nineteen ninety two this year
we've got all the approvals we now need from the corporation er and the UNK are out and erm we're awaiting their return
the next phase will be er this phase site three er which we will be providing twenty one er flats to rent as your UNK er three units for the special needs and for those like i told you it's about twenty four rented to UNK we've had the funding for that pre allocated by the housing corporation so they are er committed to funding that
and we anticipate starting that scheme er in spring nineteen ninety four latest and the completion is nineteen ninety five
the balance of this site we'll be doing as i say twenty five shared ownership properties and that's subject to a bid er in for the next financial year er which again is obviously subject to your support but as i said it will be our first priority
we then move over to the er jus what is called site two and on that we'll be doing another twenty one houses for rent to your UNK with a further two units for special needs and the balance of the site can be made er available for shared ownership which is another thirteen properties and the timetable for that is set to follow on after this UNK been completed so that's why the phase has been er changed to nineteen ninety five in your reports
so i think alan can talk in a bit more detail about the design of the master plan issues and then be perfectly happy to take any questions you may have
thank you
i think it might help if i stand near the drawings
i thought that i was gonna have to er talk about phasing but i think that he's dealt with that quite adequately but i certainly will be happy answer any questions afterwards if there are any
erm before we started this drawing which so if i co perhaps if i stand here everyone will be able to see which is probably fairly familiar and in most respects it goes back about six years to the first master plan that was produced for the estate erm to provide a combination of regeneration and new build
and in essence it's been our prior aim to keep to that which was agreed by the council back in nineteen eighty six
er in a number of ways i think everybody will agree that it's been improved by er the er UNK of the terrace blocks rather than refurbishment and the opportunity has been taken to create erm perhaps a more comfortable relationship between bungalows that are about to be UNK and the new houses because the new houses are designed in such a way as to keep the scale down so whereas the terraced blocks were anything up to four storey the new houses will only be two storey and in a number of cases they will they will be a relatively low two storey so that erm i will just point out on the front UNK that the roof comes down fairly low relative to the first floor windows so that it's not too much above the roofs on the bungalows we're not talking about UNK people's heads on the internal though
so the other things that had erm we've UNK to incorporate is to try and not divide the estate one of the one of the aims of the master plan has been to seen to integrate bungalows and any new housing together and in a number of respects the UNK of the terraced blocks and the er putting back of more conventional two storey housing has allowed us to do this by rather than having a access road running the whole length of the estate and similarly the that are running past the length of the estate away from the houses we've put the houses where the road is and the road where the house where the terraced blocks were erm to form more of a conventional street UNK so that people can look out on their cars and that we you actually got the new houses facing the existing ones
erm generally the er design of the houses UNK those which have already been built at the er southern way and the side of the UNK field and the extension to UNK hill er in terms of their materials in terms of the UNK and they will er as close as it's possible to do match the UNK bungalows in terms of including features such as block paving and erm car ports
i think one point that erm i wasn't sure if you were gonna mention it is that the proposals do actually UNK the allowance for additional parking for erm the residents and proportion of UNK as well and that's something that moat are including within the er within their construction contracts
erm so in broad terms the master plan is unchanged in concept but we think improved in detail the is the other thing at each end erm represents on the left hand side er what is currently honey hill i believe the name may be changed in due course erm and those behind me here are the houses on the UNK hill side and then although some of you will have difficulty seeing it at the moment at the bottom there are detailed drawings showing the internal arrangement of the houses and flats and detailed drawings of the UNK with dimensions so one can have a have a bit of a feel for the sort of space standards that we've aimed at but there are in fact furniture plans shown on the drawings
erm nick has obviously talked about the er the phasing of the estate erm just to point out that the reason for it perhaps UNK a bit of long drawn out er affair it's a minimum time as far as erm all the people who have been negotiating feel it's achievable in if we are to make sure that the estate doesn't remain a building site as a as a total entity fo at any time so this site here will not commence until this site is completed so that there will be some er rest bite for the bungalow residents and of course somewhere to park their cars in the in the interim
erm i think that in broad terms that covers the UNK aspects we have of course as er paul mentioned at the beginning erm talked the these designs through with the UNK hill honey hill and UNK hill UNK association and they have erm been shown the exhibition on the estate and er we believe that they've been well received towards seeing what
the co the confirmation on that
erm but certainly we we're happy to answer any questions if there are any
thank you
right er members any questions to the speakers
yes bill
i'd just like to ask er if it's not to start on the er phase three before the spring of ninety five it seems a long time two and half years time before they a they make a start
would it not be possible to make an earlier start in view of the great need for a for homes it seems a long time to wait
er for the for the phase three which is the one that we've got the one's that are rented already the money doesn't actually become available until er that date spring ninety four
we're currently negotiating with the er the housing corporation to bring it forward we wanna bring it forward er and we're asking them if we could do that
we will also be taking a decision ourselves er as to the tender part
of it as well because obviously we could take advantage of the cheaper prices now to do it
as i said spring ninety four is gonna be the latest date for the site we want to start that phase as early as possible so that we can then get onto to the other phase as early as possible because we obviously don't particularly want to wait until nineteen ninety five ninety six to finish the whole thing
er so our intention is to do as quickly as we can
okay bill
any body else ann
may i ask a question on the this er the speaker said er erm that it will be down so that they on er or no particular help on his accordance but o on these here o on the ones this isn't the case
yes i on the side which we believe er matters if you like the side that faces the er the road and faces the bungalows we we've sought to achieve that erm on the rear UNK it's perhaps a less important issue so looking at any of the erm large coloured UNK sheets the upper drawing represents the street side the side that faces the bungalows and the side where scale issue becomes er more important and the lower drawing erm where there's er an UNK and UNK above the first is are actually the back garden side that erm will be seen perhaps less
do you know how many two bedroomed one of the others
also are this lot are on this
speak up
lot er pulled down
it's a
but is there a particular one
er
yes
this one here is it
is this is this it
that one here
that one is the same both sides but i think that
yeah
more of them
these ones
yeah
that's
don't know this one
that particular on there actually only occurs the once it's in this position is er a cluster of four houses together that erm is if you like as a as a signature at the end of this particular
so this one this
er access road
is the main design
tha that is the one that occurs the most frequently yes by far
thank you very much
okay
yes bill
on this question of priorities here i understand that if we go along with local UNK to the housing corporation that this is a priority and then they can see to that make the money available when can we go along again with another priorities
erm really it's an issue about the amount what little amount of UNK that housing association grants are a comes into harlow via the housing corporation we don't have a lot to play with on any
since i've been involved in er in the partnerships we've always tried to have a joint number one with three hills and church UNK as i explained before and it's always been a very difficult balancing act you know to keep both going along
i'm sure you will agree that there'd be nothing worse than to start into a erm er regeneration idea on an estate and then have a year or two's UNK where nothing can happen because we're er pushing the UNK funding elsewhere in the town
erm by saying it's a priority we're not saying it's our only priority we have a number of priorities and it's up to us to in debate with the housing corporation er to come to the best agreements for harlow
jim
anybody else want yes tony
we'll be able use where are they going to go
right well garages the there are already some here and here both in here and here that have been built as part of UNK field
are they UNK with the house are they
no the well some of them are those particular ones some of them are joined but they are to all UNK and purposes separate in that they can be er rented out separately they're not tied to the house erm in that they are they go with it but the housing department have the opportunity to rent them to whoever applies for them
and what would the rents be any idea
tha that i can't tell you
that's probably
considering the er
a question for housing department really
on what the county council are gonna
erm
erm then we've got some more erm here in this position and some more down here and in fact i think that we've managed to squeeze a few more into erm this position for the bungalow refurbishment that's obviously an aside it's not part of erm what moat are proposing
so there's a few
on each side of the estate
where are the parking spaces
the parking spaces for the erm bungalow residents erm are generally spread around in a in such a way as to be as close as possible to the bungalows that they serve they're not if you like specific car park but on this drawing they're identified it's simply that the UNK parking that the planners require for a construction of new houses is there and then over and above that there is further parking which if you like will satisfy the need of the bungalow residents though they may not necessarily be identified specifically
er as you can imagine if you try and tell somebody to park in one place that somebody else has parked already you could end up with some misunderstanding so there is erm a generous amount of parking to bring the total parking to the whole area up to the level that was erm put forward in the first master plan
an and what about the disabled parking
well there are a number of spaces that are in positions which could be used by disabled in other words they are not sort of sandwich tight against other spaces and what's happened in the past is that erm when a need has arisen an and when perhaps there's been er generally a bungalow that has been er occupied by somebody who's disabled then the housing department have erm modified that space i mean wha what we've actually done is we've er taken a certain amount of block paving out but put back some block UNK logo sort of standard white er symbol that erm that identifies disabled space and that space is actually earmarked for that person and it could happen in a variety of different locations erm it's just that there's probably not so much point in doing it until you know that there is er a specific need
okay
do you think they're wider
they're wider yes
oh good
yeah
right
anyone else
thank you very much i've
oh sorry were you trying to get attention
i know the question about rent was mentioned but i'm just talking generally now i asked this question to another housing association how do you justify rents of sixty pounds and above for accommodation and social housing
i mean i know it's something to do with funding but could you just explain that for me
yeah
because we i do not understand how i
all average rents on our stock across the whole of the south east is twenty seven pounds a week erm i think is the figure now the bulk of that funded down to the old er regime that we had from the housing corporation where we got er a lot more grant and we had the residual line and the money we've had to borrow ourselves for the scheme was actually from the corporation themselves that all changed in the ninety eighty eight housing act and we now get a fixed er sum of monies it's fixed percentage of local cost from the housing corporation and the balance has to be borrowed from a private UNK just like anybody else going out and buying a home if you like er from a bank from a building society or somebody like that and we have to charge a rent er to the property that will UNK that loan and the way in which we actually do it is we charge a lower rent and actually who pays the rent quite substantially below that er because erm the rent on these properties if we i if we charge what the housing UNK grant as it's set would be round about ten twelve pounds more expensive than that
er it's not a funding system that er that we would choose to work under we would want to keep the rents as low as possible er but it's one that's set by central government through the housing corporation and that we have to live with
what we do for our residents is employ a welfare benefit service so that they can UNK the er the housing benefit section that they're eligible for to make the po properties as affordable as they can be
and obviously we're concerned that people erm will rent our properties who will then be UNK entirely on housing benefit er and if they increase their income they may be worse off
er the fact of the matter is it's the system that we as housing associations gonna have to live with er if we're going to build new homes
thank you
alright secretary
anyone else
right
and can i then er draw attention to the recommendation on one o threes on er one er sorry on er b the amended notes that er came from er the area committee er and er c
are you all in favour of those
UNK
UNK
mm
do you want to show a raising of hands so that we can assure your agreement
okay
anybody against
no
right
thank you very much
then sit down now
right erm we'll come on to item three er with the questions from the public and er UNK is going to talk to about er questions
thank you chairman
erm on the supplementary paper sent round you will see at i think it's page one and two a letter received from the UNK association erm i hope you've all had a chance to read that as it was circulated to members in advance
erm this matter was raised at committee and i'd like to explain the item of committee that prompted the letter from UNK association
can i just say a few brief things to this firstly i share their concern entirely and totally and i don't think there's an officer round this table who wouldn't agree with that and i also believe having met with all the board members this morning i know that the board members similarly agree
erm we have taken various steps immediately one is that the vandalism that taking place over the erm we have immediately re secured i have to say there's been about fifty erm tickets out to re secure those that site over the summer but they have been re secured and tomorrow morning there will be the UNK of UNK up of the doors and windows of the ground floor of block d block
can i also say that the erm the fear expressed about UNK i believe to be fairly well founded UNK building a UNK er building society had been on erm entered into a long time ago on this erm and the letter that was read out at potter street area committee from UNK indicated that they hadn't yet decided whether they would proceed and er i think is i've talked to the UNK since they have promised us an answer this week er we are intending we have spoken UNK also spoken to our managing director we are confident we will have an answer from this week and i have to tell you that i think the answer will either no or it will be so UNK that we'll need to take some action and make a decision
i sa as i say i met this morning with the three members from potter street erm we do have various alternative proposals for sa ways forward should the village back out and what i can say to you at this stage is that we have another meeting scheduled for next week we will be meeting with the UNK associations keeping them fully informed erm we will ensure that the letter goes back to mrs who and the other UNK associations who expressed concern there and that we will be taking i hope i hope because i'm gonna have to say if UNK back out we're going out we're going have to move very fast and do some quite erm in depth work
we hope we will be able to take new proposals to potter street on the second of november if nothing else we will certainly take them an honest indication of where we've got to so far and what proposals will be taking place and what we will be proposing erm for the future
but i mean the concern UNK association i think is well founded i think there's been a lot of problems and er i think it can come upon us all to keep talking with them and to improve the situation should the should UNK back out
thank you melanie
er i noticed mrs is in the audience is there anything you'd like to say referring to what the officer
erm
has said
just to UNK the fact that we are making so many you said about pulling out as well is there a possibility of that
erm
well hm you can see that er members are also very concerned about it and er we've er i there are external circumstances that you know we have to look into first
but erm mrs said she will keep you informed of will discuss with the er residents and the board of councillors
if i could just say one other thing that is that i've had a an initial of the blocks done and pending the outcome of UNK which i expect to get tomorrow erm if they are backing out then i will be getting a full structural engineers structural survey within a couple of days this is the actually meeting plan
mm
yes
er anybody got any questions to put to melanie er about er yes er yes er UNK
yeah i'm rather concerned that this kind of thing seems to be happening rather a lot i mean this is so UNK of what happened in the four UNK in UNK hill where we had empty blocks left for a long time erm becoming a UNK for vandalism and all kinds of everything
we've also seen it happening to an extent in properties in UNK as well erm i really think we need to get to grips with what we seem to be doing which de counting people UNK early er in response to housing developments which we are planning to undertake in partnership with other people and leaving ourselves open to this and not
well what could we be doing you tell yourself
not only can pose as a danger but it presents er the UNK erm an and all the other problems associated with that
it seems to be happening far too often and i wonder i wonder what's actually going wrong that this happening so often and in so many places seems to be something that you know perhaps we need to address it far more generally as a problem of housing management as a whole
er well if i can er answer some of those er points
er first of all i ensure that people are not de counted unless they have er wished to go and maybe that their dwellings are er in er a state of er UNK or there's something UNK wrong that they feel unsafe er in them and then er they are i don't like the word de counted but then they er are offered er other accommodation
i would agree with you that if the if we have gone along and said to people well er yo we've got alternative accommodation for you and they haven't wanted to go then well i'm sure that we hope not to give them that er alternative accommodation er and it's not in our interest at all to er keep er places empty and further more we haven't really got er enough er alternative places to put er these er tenants in so i'm that it's as the result of the sort of dwellings that er we've er we now find ourselves with as a result of the er initial buildings in the first place
but we won't go into that that's history
but it would be very interesting if er you had a positive er proposal or something constructive to make which we might be able to examine but i can tell you at the end of the day money is required and this government won't allow to spend er the money that er we have got er erm at the moment that we could er use but they won't let us
and further more they don't come up er with the er right amount of money for our needs er but er it is er duty bound er to us
i'm not UNK that i'm simply saying that perhaps we have a management problem here where we could be doing things differently and i'd like to hear some positive suggestions from housing officers as to how you can address that
oh
well now er if you've got some critical comments about the management of it perhaps you could write and we have a look at them
alright
any other members want any comments on UNK indeed other
no
no
right
thank you
well thank you for your comments anyway erm we'll get er back to our next er item er on the agenda
we've got a couple of erm er oh that was the only one from the er questions is it
yes that's the one from there
but it's
right
er unfortunately
perhaps bill could
contentious items i've suggested five d and eleven
got it here
UNK eleven d yes
five hundred copies
five
oh yes that's right we right yes five and er eleven d
er eleven is
b
the same
b
yes
that's right
sorry about that
er then erm er we come to er UNK er spoken
right thank you very much june
if i could draw members attention to the supplementary papers erm and it's page three which is the second report and it will become i will make it clear with regards to the er linking up of the two reports both UNK and essex committee linked up to the museum registration
erm members will re ma will be reminded the report was requested at the last personal services committee with regards to the council's involvement in the current UNK and essex committee er i'm also requesting er the financial contribution that this council actually makes to that committee
erm the report identifies the history of the committee and UNK the benefits that harlow has achieved through membership
i'd like to highlight the er a quote by the county UNK officer with which the UNK the amount of er contribution which was agreed by this council on the twenty third of march ninety er which actually relates to the size of the population i will actually point that the thousand pounds has actually increased to one thousand three hundred this year because of population has actually increased since then
we've already valued the use of free displays or whatever erm if i could point out the recommendations that the members agree in the report the members agreed harlow council's continued membership of the UNK and essex committee
right
are there are any members any comments to make on these
agreed
are they
agreed
for it
does anybody oppose the recommendation
no
thank you
the actual link is linked to museum registration which i'm sure members will remember erm with regards to the long running saga of the additional storage facilities
and going through on page sixty five in the main agenda this UNK the current plan to achieve registration for UNK in order to achieve to achieve the a the a and UNK to grasp to obtain aid from the UNK national bodies
agreed
agreed
right
thank you very much
erm seven neighbourhood er welfare candidate
rejected
yes at the last meeting these committee members did ask that er he produce some details of help and a number of cases dealt with have been apparent and the details are presented for amendment
thank you
who was it who wanted to know something on that
yes i
it's me
yeah i would like to do is just mention that it's so surprising really that er the resources used are out of all proportion to what we used to er do on it on the other central panel
we've had ten meetings and only thirty cases and that'll be the three cases where each meeting spread over a five different locations which er doesn't seem a very good way to use our resources
so what i was wondering was er the scheme is in it's UNK this and i'm all in the favour of the UNK in principle but i think we ought to perhaps look at it a bit closer and i would suggest that we have an up to date report at the next meeting of this committee so we can compare it over a longer term so as that we might then reflect on a if we're doing the right thing or not
but it seems a waste of the resources to er have er ten different meetings for thirty cases we that's my view but i would like to see another report at the next meeting so as we can compare
right er frank have you got any comments er to make on that
yes i councillor is quite right i mean it is a new departure to centre these panels in the UNK it was always our intention to come back after a period had UNK er we with the new system to bring to members attention the success or otherwise of the neighbourhood panels
erm and certainly i think i think in going to neighbourhood panels it was it was to serve a democratic process of tenants being able to panels local to their that area and i think in that sense erm it has been successful and certainly i think as far as we were concerned er it UNK the perhaps UNK nature of tenants appearing in a large centre of the various panel which er i think was er certainly one of the members wishes when we started on a neighbourhood basis but yes it was our intention and i would think that it's quite reasonable to ask us to bring the report to the next meeting er with a better explanation of how the council works so far
yeah
may i ask er another question is of the thirty cases in the neighbourhood the tenants don't need
no i haven't that information tha that detail was asked for but i do know that er that certainly in a majority of cases because they are local erm the attendance from tenants was certainly substantial and i would of but certainly far more than you would expected if the panel perhaps had been inside a
er just a minute i'll ask ann and then UNK
ann
i wa i wanted a point that er respond er neighbourhood and the manager i spoke to said that the areas that were the case since er de UNK because er people are er in coming to neighbourhood offices and that of the of the managers arrange er aims or er either run in two UNK er i feel personally it's been very worthwhile because we were able to talk to the er they were never able to go and they came to the er the neighbourhood offices international UNK er or er ah i in areas they want to talk to so i personally would like to see this continuing er for perhaps a it isn't the best value for money i it certainly far better for can come to their neighbour office speak to
thank you
thank you ann
les
thank you
er as you know i haven't been exactly an enthusiastic supporter of neighbourhood erm areas but i have to confess
some never attended them
i have to confess that on that in so far as those that i've attended and i've had a couple in my area i have to confess my surprise at the efficiency of them
and i really see that the public now certainly they give certainly for the benefit of the a ten the tenants that
a
are presented
yes
there in comparison with the UNK way of old bill's seventeen round this table
oh that's
UNK people don't go back to that way that old system
the people there are that's going to the neighbourhood are getting a fair crack of the whip and they're being the centre of that every week
er i wish the man wo wouldn't put words into my
for what it's worth
mouth UNK
no
i understand
i say i think that's quite
no
wrong
i
interpretation was
you're not UNK and the and the er the me er
the meeting to be called not
and we
UNK cos we have the
don't take it personal bill
it wasn't meant
well er he meant it you meant it personal
yes alright yes
do breakdown
could we do it
come along
of councillor conversion UNK
yes
yes
yes
and
i think that'll be
gone on very late yes
jim
yes chairer why don't we pat ourselves on our on the back about this it would it be useful i in the report a further report that's gonna come forward if there could be some indication as to actual format that was adopted when a person goes to one of his welfare panels cos i've been to three and there doesn't seem to be any consistency whatsoever in the way that things occur or whatever
i don't think
right
it's entirely fair
yes i think that's up to the chairer so
oh i think it's up to the council chairer to say what procedure should be so in fairness
yes
there is one other point although erm you know it's good that they are in the er areas which the tenants er live so it's er not very difficult for tenants to come and see their councillors but er there is a difficulty at times when er the er air the housing manager has to ring around to get the er members who are able to sit on that panel and sometimes that is difficult because we have just three members and sometimes they can't all fit in the whereas when you have a larger group if one member can't attend there's invariably sufficient there to be able to come to a decision so i think that that's on the other side of the balance sheet
but altogether yo er sorry you wanted to say something on that
yes i do sorry
i don't often agree with jim about anything but i really do agree with him about this that there has to be some clear guidelines i think as to how these are fixed they are not going be have the potential of being very unfair to people because people operate in different ways in different areas and i would suggest that it would be a good idea if this community were to ask for erm guidelines to be drafted for this committee to agree so that there is a more even fair laid down procedure for dealing with the cases coming before the panel
right well we'll look into we'll look into that
any other members got any comments on this
if it's a problem with numbers and why don't we extend the numbers on the panel
i mean
no
couldn't put the numbers up
well i think that is
the problem is with how the is conducted who gets the first bite
who puts their case first
who
yeah
that type of thing
i understand that but
what i'm talking about
three people on the panel is that right
well t yes and it has
well no i haven't got a problem
i have feelings about it i mean my generally my experience i don't know i haven't discussed with other members but er when i the panel that i er allocated to erm and i was UNK could a make and certain dates were made and i finally made one then i was told oh no that's not convenient
at the end we er of the day i had to opt out because it wasn't possible for me to fit in and someone else a i'm just thinking of the time taken for er housing manager or one of his er staff to erm er you know to do that practical thing that's all
oh yes
that i'm
of course it should
saying
but we'll look into er the format i think
can we have a further report please
yes there's going to be a procedure and a report er is er and we're going to have another report frank yes
thank you er very much
right now we get er back to the er and we've got er item which is er the council's er response the proposed merger of the health er authority
erm er it's UNK
thank you chairer
erm the latest round of erm proposals to come before you as part of the n h s reforms are the consultation document that we received recently and proposals to the merge the three existing area health authorities in north essex to form one UNK unit
we've attempted chairer to assess this proposal and then to set a criteria i think it's important for members to understand that currently there is a consortium that er is in operation fully operational that is carrying out the tasks erm that are identified in the consultation document mainly erm the consultation document itself does erm show exactly what the health authority is doing erm the proposal now before you is to extend that erm to one UNK unit of health authority with one executive board erm based with three local health UNK erm to provide the service
we've made an assessment on the single reports yeah and we're asking members to erm give us guidance on the principles it and your response in order to get a response to the regional health authority by this friday
erm i do apologise for this but er unfortunately we have no choice i suppose
right er any comments from members er from this er report
anyone
yes chairer er i think UNK report is a very fair summary of the er the issues which face us erm truth is what we've been as in this proposed consortium which no doubt will go through with it's most of the reforms of the n h s despite the er consultation mechanism which they've gone through you know but largely these are beforehand given the UNK of the n h s management
what we're actually lo doing here is those of longer members who remember we used to have a thing called the area health authority which was proposed in a three tier structure by a corporation called the UNK corporation at great expense charity governed by three quarters of a million pounds to invent structure of the national health service nineteen seventy two some years later they came back and said well give us another million pounds and we'll go back and look at it again and say actually we were wrong and they abolished the areas and produced districts
and what we're getting here actually is a recreation of the area health authority they're actually gonna be situated in the same office block where the old area authority used to be in UNK erm and the community health council which i represent this authority on has certainly been er raising a number of questions about this for fear of UNK in UNK erm with perhaps the lack of UNK to local needs of west essex and in harlow particularly
the question that the senior the middle management staff will propose the authority has been drawn almost exclusive exclusively from north east and the mid essex health authorities and not from west essex
cos of course the west essex management staff have been co UNK with another project which is to provide a trust for the east herts and west essex health providers i e p a h and associated health services providers and surprise in this council chamber chief executive of the west essex health authority has become the chief executive of the provider trust despite that it's not gonna be approved by the secretary of state but certainly a conference which she's speaking at in she is named as the chief executive
actually i didn't see the job advertised i must admit i was going to apply for it myself of course
ah but surprise
it seems she's been appointed without any advertising which would seem to flow equal opportunities promises here the government and the health service really believe in it
so because they don't like the sound of this the other two have drawn off their magic stone and got them into the top jobs in er consortium
er now it claims of course that this is a more efficient purchasing mechanism on behalf of the patients and the community of this area the problem is of course it depends what you mean by efficiency and the truth is that we may get increased our purchasing in terms of UNK as they put it UNK our patients
but actually it doesn't tell you anything about the quality of the care which they're purchasing and the evidence that we are getting increasingly from the community health council is the experience of people of the health service is that actually the quality of the care is getting worse and this is not due to the staff in the health ee the more detailed plans coming to the next meeting of the e the more detailed plans coming to the next meeting of the for an operation er four years it should to be said er she's been waiting despite the government's claim that all operations are done within two years er for very severe UNK veins and surprisingly enough she got them because of course most UNK have been removed her the north east thames region erm and er she turned up on the wednesday and the operation had been UNK twice previously er she was er gone through all the er various tests which took her four hours cos she had to find all the places herself there was nobody to show her to x ray and various other places erm she was prepared for the op and then was sent home because there wasn't a bed available
and told to turn up the next morning waited another four hours finally a patient who'd had an operation for a serious UNK bladder operation two days before hand was kicked out of his bed and sent home so that she would be put in the bed given the operation
this is actually the state the of health service and the truth is that all of these UNK changes are really not gonna solve the basic problems of the health service which is under funded and under UNK
so i think we should say we are sceptical and i think the paper puts it correctly er we are sceptical of whether the reforms of the first consortium in fact is going to meet the needs in terms of new health area and i know that time will come they're talking about the lot it's gonna wonderful and that the our economies should get all i can say is that the likelihood is the only f the area committee er so that residents can comment managers but since we've already had a nine hundred percent increase in senior management in the health service in the past five years up from nine hundred to over ten thousand at a cost of fifty to two hundred and fifty million pounds i'm rather sceptical about that one as well
so in general i think we should be as sceptical er and critical of any of these proposed changes and the key point of course was the at the lack of accountability but there'll be even less accountability one UNK in the new consortium
final question perhaps we should raise is well is there actually gonna be a need for it in two three years time down the track
if all providers going into trusts and if all er purchasing gonna be done by fund holders the majority of whom are confident at this stage they'll become fund holders what actually is the role of the purchasing consortium that be and role of the health authorities as such er other than perhaps to collect statistics in the future of our time the climbing and quality of the health service in this area
thank you hugh
anyone
who wants to
yes
thanks
erm i really feel that this consultation is coming more than a too late because we started on the slippery slope when the consortium was er first UNK of o you know about a year ago and set up in april and that really this is the sort of the UNK next move and this consultation is far too late
erm i think that UNK has raised of very personal questions that we have ask about this erm the question of local accountability of the health authority board that will be created by this the to service this new joint health authority would in fact be the size of the existing one for west essex and we would ha have only a third of the representation that we currently have the whole of west essex we'll only have two non executive members on the health authority board and i don't think that is terribly accountable but certainly a considerable reduction on what we've got at the moment
erm not only will people have to travel a lot further for treatment as was admitted at the public meeting erm last monday here in harlow but er if people want to is maybe they'll one or two less senior f the area committee authority they will have to travel to UNK or colchester or whatever by absolutely UNK public transport if they don't drive a motor car to actually attend those meetings and that's not democratic or accountable either
erm on the financial side i don't think savings of a hundred thousand pound or the pay an non executive out of a budget of two and hundred eighty million for the total of the three health authority is actually a heck of a big saving to justify what's happening
erm what this is really about i think we all recognise this is the erm purchaser aim to increase their leverage in the contract situation as against the providers on the other side of contract and in fact i think we ought to tie this very much more in with what this authority has been saying about the proposals of the trust on the provider side because i think that this is an argument against the whole district n h s trusts that we're getting but it is encouraging the situation in which health authorities have UNK on the other side of the contract are going to want to band together and merge to create a larger block in which to negotiate with their whole trust providers i think this is a very dangerous situation and think we needed to tie the two together as an argument there
erm and i also need to be concerned that the health authority i think is claiming that this merger will actually give them a better erm size population for research purposes for purchasing however i think that it may well be that particular health needs people in west essex and harlow in particular which has for example a rapidly UNK population and therefore needs facilities had not been planned into the town by way of health erm that those statistics those pockets of need are going to get UNK in a much more large and vast UNK statistical picture stretching from hertfordshire right across to the coast i think it's too big a sample and we need to make sure that our specific needs aren't going to be UNK in all that
erm it's quite clear there's going to be no more new money for patient care and without that i don't think we're going to get the increase in quality of service but that we actually need
i think also in those very tough times ahead i think it's a very difficult decisions to be made about what services are provided erm and what operation people are actually going to be able to have done and i wonder how much local people are gonna have a chance to say anything about that in the situation in which their health service their health authority is based so far away
erm i've mentioned UNK i would raise that again i'm a non driver erm it's easy to hop in a car and get from here to chelmsford if you want to do it by public transport it is a nightmare erm the meeting here on monday which was very poorly attended and i understand that's been the pattern right across the area and i don't think the health authority is that interested in finding out what people have thought to be honest
erm it is admitted that people are gonna have go much further to get their treatment ah that was quite clearly stated as part of the down side of it and i don't think we can tolerate that until we've got a decent public transport system that's going to allow patients to get by public transport from here to colchester or UNK or UNK or wherever and er and their relatives and friends to be able to follow to visit them if you know as necessary
erm so that's a whole of responses to this i think we need to be far more clear in our opposition to this i think it's a very dangerous situation it's one that's happening across the country we're not the only UNK and i think UNK have been very dangerous things from the beginning and are leading UNK to the merger that we put before us as a proposal tonight and i think we really should be quite UNK in our position to it
thank you
any other comments
simon
hello
as you saying to us all only to be said interest in the matter i in the erm the UNK matter to
the problem i've found with paper erm it was confusing misleading and erm very misleading
throughout UNK of people who also come out tonight there's been obviously er a potential saving of a hundred thousand pounds on members erm i i'm not gonna i don't that's right
that's your salary simon
yes
yes
too closely i don't actually recall seeing in the er in the actual wo consultation documents erm funding is not one of the issues being addressed by the merger with
you went to the public meeting simon that's the problem
i'm sorry
you went to the public meeting that is what
they
they said
they actually quoted a hundred thousand pound
er
figure did they
can we just have er just one person talking please
simon will you continue
they were
sorry
what the government what the erm the consortium and UNK about er is improving the identification band that was hanging over of health care once that recipe is will get much larger consortium er it's much widespread of er UNK expertise er UNK in assessing health needs er think about one of those areas that have been saved from in west essex over the last over the last few years and by going into a much larger group with more resources erm there will they will be able to actually er work er far more effectively in sorting out what's actually needed
one of the other things i found that people are conflicting in the paper erm is of people having to travel further erm if i can just yes on pa on page three paragraph this is the choice that seems of the area and the travel and on page four paragraph one the version says that local people will still get a choice of i in the london hospitals
we could only er in it's not quite clear whether erm we're in favour of sending people all the way down to london for their health care but we're not in favour of sending anywhere UNK where more local for the erm you know i i'm not quite sure what you want you know what point the lady's trying to get across there
in
er
in a minute UNK if
but recent problems on
i know they propose
then o on page five i found a quote that there was nothing particularly in the consultation document for merger referring to finance apart from the increase coming from the changes and that question er the i take your points er in fact referring to the and provider unit
well in when you're considering the possible merger of the three health authorities they haven't UNK any one particular private er provider unit is not really the crucial issue at hand
if you wanna make a point about that well we'll point about them erm there is er a comment erm in this erm yeah on paragraph paragraphs four and five page five the first of we will buy them including all the legislation that will reduce and if you got up to page three paragraph six there's a claim that levels are eight percent higher on the same money
but you know the these people ha have hardly been treated erm and a contract for obtaining more health care year by year so you know if yo if you're saying that erm these wi will reduce or that the action has already taken place it can't reduce erm so then again it's not really relevant to erm the proposal of running a health authority you know these people should talk
erm i've i think i'll erm was talking about people attending the health authority meetings at the moment but the local health authority do move meetings around UNK bishop's stortford harlow and one over at erm and this apart from it's was only us coming from harlow at the meeting last week and the health authority met in harlow er you know the me the meetings are moving about they are there for people to come to but if they're not coming to the meetings while they're o on the doorstep then really what else can the health authority do to me to make people come
you know i erm hugh was talking about erm somebody being thrown out of hospital after UNK bladder operation after only two days well fortunately these days there are one or two UNK in er in health care erm to erm which is very much easier to er operate on people if you're if you if you're going to put them out cos the UNK more er simpler it's far less stress on patients and they they're becoming a lot quicker er clearly if UNK out er the way is completed then er obviously things are UNK with the chief executive of the health authority and i'd like to give you this october when the chief executive was
yes
best person i think you know
erm there is just one may i just er make one final point erm paragraph on page four refers to improvements in services of minority groups and also on page five and six the need for sa input into priorities shall not be able to for this
one of the main purposes of o of a consortium is actually looking at the health needs erm it's UNK that i've i actually got o on a number of occasions that i've er i think involvement in assessing health needs but i've actually answered anywhere er and i'd very interested as to how or what kind of input erm we will be looking to on that
thank you er simon
er if they want to come back on anything hugh
do you no
no i mean
no right
i could come back and then
yes
can i say to simon that
er but is are there any other questions before er on the report that er UNK and UNK has
i think we ought to have a an adequate response UNK to the
yes well just a minute
i want er i'm just asking if er anyone's got er comments to make to UNK and then UNK will reply to them that's the point he's got to reply to some of the comments er that er simon has made and then we'll come to what we want our response to be
so as there's no other comments er UNK would you have you got any
yes chairman the figure of a hundred thousand as we said did was erm a figure quoted on by account UNK executive of the purchasing consortium erm that was spoken at a public meeting held here in harlow last week erm the issue of the transport around the area erm was accepted by the chief executive of the health authority erm or of that of the consortium erm and the and the view that it would be much more difficult with the lack of public transport to get to the more UNK remote areas of essex the reason that the erm reduced use of london was put into this report was also erm clearly stated by the chief executive i it's their clear aim to provide more of to purchase more of the services from within the north essex area and that was stated in a major part of the UNK of their erm achievements and that automatically means a reduced amount of choice for those people who would otherwise for to london
erm it is er fair to say that UNK far easier to get to er from harlow than certain areas in essex are erm those are direct comments from the chief executive of the proposed erm health authority
the financial position of the provider this was erm well in the report because the consultation document that was it quotes a figure o of erm in the amount of UNK treated erm with the same amount of money
however one has to bear in mind that at the last meeting of the west essex health authority erm they are saying that they can't carry on treating the same amount of people erm because they're overspend already this year and that they will not treat these er extra UNK referrals without prior funding being approved and that was co that was actually stated at the meeting last week
erm so that was put in the meeting to show a balance if you like between yes they've achieved an eight percent but over last two years the UNK unit have run deficit and erm one UNK with the other and that was that was also something that er that's
erm
not true
the last thing i would say chairer on the erm what else can the authority do
health authority meetings can't they aren't very well UNK erm and in fact sometimes we have go over and get our own agendas and er i would suggest that perhaps would it be possible for them to be much better UNK than they currently are
yes
thank you UNK
now er erm are there any members who want to add to er what's er has been written in er this er response
i think that er
UNK has raised a point about er erm UNK er and consulting local people and to let local people know erm when the meetings are then local can't go i'm sure that if they really wanted people to come they'd make it much more er in erm with the advertising so clear that er people would be able to and also if they had it at the times when a their meeting at the times when it was mostly convenient to er the general public
hugh do you want to comment
yeah i was gonna move erm on a suggestion that we had not been convinced of the need for this consortium by er so far and that certainly we as an authority er have remained opposed to it on the grounds that we've stated the terms of accountability in terms of the er sensitivity to local needs in terms of transport issues and in terms of the clear intention to restrict patient choice erm which i think is a key think which should be UNK
yes
the evidence that we've found out already from c h c is that the operation of the n h s reforms has restrictive patient choice because UNK those referrals to london teaching hospitals which used to made as a matter of course if treatment is unable er UNK in harlow have actually been largely stopped i got the detailed figures from the purchasing director erm er recently in the c f c minutes and it shows a UNK number of patients being referred to london teaching hospitals erm and this is clearly the reason as this points out in this paper that london teaching hospitals are in serious financial problems and four of them indeed are being threatened with closure by the UNK report and i think many patients in harlow would much rather as er people have pointed out go to er UNK and u c h should they still exist than to go to colchester and er but this is this a key question so on the basis of the this consortium doesn't meet those criticisms indeed make the situation worse i move that we oppose it in principle that UNK reports on that line
so seconder for that
seconded
seconded yes but UNK
erm ya i mean i've already had what i've had what i've had to say about the content of the thing i was merely going to ask where we go from here
i'm aware that our backs are up against the wall as regards time because the response is meant to be in by friday erm i don't think actually that this is the paper that UNK is presenting although in fact surely raises issues i don't think it is actually response as it stands i think it is a paper which raises items of issues for this committee to consider i don't think in itself it serves as a response
erm i wonder how substantially it's going to re written first in order to make it a response rather than an issue raising paper and ah secondly in the light of what we've all had to say this evening and if it is to be re written i wonder erm who is going to actually see it and approve it before it goes off in time to get to the health authority by the day after tomorrow
well that's er
cos normally they
a matter will be er that we going to fight er easily er so i mean i it meant that the er that er some more should be brought out so that it er does er UNK to what er these er government departments er expect as a response rather than er as this considered issue raising er we can er UNK that er quite er easily but er i think er the main point is what hugh has said that er we opposed it because it's not going to help in my view it's not going to help er the patients the patients are not going to come off any better as a result of er these er what i would say and i feel and er the i i'd like to know what er the UNK think about cos UNK usually erm er advise their patients if they have to wait a long time from one hospital they would advise them to go into london and er if that's been stopped as been er that's been stated erm then erm er the UNK are not going to feel very happy about their patients er getting er erm a lesser service
so the patients and our residents are our main er concern and er if we all er oppose it in principle and er then er let us see how we'll erm er UNK this er response
alright
jim
yes jim
considering i mean there is a closing date quite quick
mm
well may i propose that we put all this along of the lines with flexible that they expressed the committee tonight and use
exactly
we use
right thanks
er i don't know if you er meant er the various plans to achieve er i in that order but i certainly want obey UNK choice er a at first that's the reasons i've found
well yes that will come out er
and you mentioned UNK i mean this is one way of almost perhaps forcing some UNK to become er erm a fund holders because then they can go an and buy their er patient care from wherever they the they want to
but this er if they're not fund holders that they er and then it's a way out for er
yes
yes
right thanks er ann
right we agree with erm
agree
thank you very much
on the next er item er the er erm an UNK member to represent the council on the purchasing strategy group ee er you would
i would like the move
well i was going to say we're take it to council alright
alright
yeah okay
erm can i
yes
and i've kept
and now
last week
erm on the next er item er we have er on item ten we've got the welfare rights and er advice and we've got quite a long report which i hope you'll agree is an excellent report er and er sue is here to present it
sue please
page seventeen to ninety four
erm because the report is er quite a long report mainly the er part of the report erm i will pick out the most important comments and if i could take the first part of the report first erm this concerns a new staffing structure between er newly emerged welfare rights and advice service
erm the council erm the welfare and associate UNK advice centres since nineteen seventeen eight however until march of this year erm the staff the counter staff within the advice centre were divided into to two departments er the information and community services department reported to committees and as a result of the general move within the council and the service department to er neighbourhood erm offices and called the support services
we were asked to erm come up with a new structure erm and it the purpose of this report and to put that
the i think the erm the main point that i'd like to make is that erm the structure as it's posed erm is for the same number of staff erm however the three what were UNK stroke managerial posts erm have changed we feel as a result of the merger and therefore and there are three er little posts mainly a head of people called a head of and a head of the support a support services manager and a support services officer and erm the appendix details the main er functions in each post er those posts
but erm certainly they er if they are er graded as we anticipate there will perhaps be a small saving in fact as a result of the merger
and i think they are graded slightly higher than the as they will come out at the same cost same overall costs
and the new structure erm moves towards erm team working across the advice centre UNK of three teams er and also takes on the critical self managing team so that erm in terms of the this work and technical support that er has in the past been offered by a team leader er team leader and advice centre manager that will be in the future will be offered by a senior member of staff erm for each other and for less experienced staff
the teams will er in the service part which is the second part of this report is who
erm the service channel will be divided into the three teams and the teams will be expected to deliver erm an agreed level of service within the which ever is available
so UNK the first part of the report i recommend that the structure as outlined erm be approved and that the necessary recruitment take place as soon as possible
er i understand that if that those recommendations are approved this evening that will then go to erm council staffing erm which is currently erm decided the overall er priorities intended
okay i don't know whether i repeatedly er members of the council like to ask questions about the structure so they can ask and i can move on so
the next well i'll give them tha er UNK er jim yes
yeah i will take only part of this debate as my daughter works in
alright jim okay
er ann yes
now personally i understand that the benefit shop is o er will be moving to the advice UNK of centre shortly
er what co operation or a ar you
the these could of been yeah they were bringing er an i'm bringing it in because i
ann i'd rather you keep the reports if you don't
yes
mind
an and perhaps for that i've never heard that one before
or jumping up the council's face
the of the benefit shop i make people advice and several of us were set on er that you handled recently er i it was the
am i allowed
yes you can
yes but er we're really dealing er with
yes
the advice centre and what has happened to with erm er i've er if you've read the reports you'll see that er that had been working er under er a considerable amount of er stress and strain
erm there's been a reduction er in the er staff er because er people have moved on and er i take UNK point about er if it weren't for the fact that erm they'd got fully e experienced staff who've been there some time they haven't not used to this churning over o of and therefore that has paid off in er in er in erm so far as being able to deal with the problems that have arisen and er you'll see further on er addition UNK of the work that's been done with er in this area over the town
er the so something must be done quickly i fear about the er management er of er the new structure and i hope you would agree to it unless anyone else has got yes
er i is
harry
council gonna erm pose it in the areas closer to it
well er that's been that's been outlined in er i in the er the report
yes but i think
all i wanna ask really is that erm er is the staff happy with it
i mean that's the main thing i in that staff
as long as you that situation i mean that's the main thing
well
that it means that we've got there's going to be er a certain amount of extra staff though required that's what's in the report
well you can start by not depending on the structure er the structure of which UNK speaking
yes
yeah
seems to me is a very sensible organise the system most effectively er whether there's any but that's not affecting the structure
bit
and the structure
i've just asked sue i'm sure you wrote this with the full support of your staff
yes
yes
well i'll second what peter said
what did you say again
erm structure
and very system
just a minute
structure is the
the
the er sue wants to write it down what you've said are you moving that we
yes that er the recommendations that er presumably our service approved which has got structure in it does that er
yes
bu but chairer it's not a UNK little structure it's a guaranteed performance and what's it committee
they do that with this recommendation
sorry
the
it's not the practice the questions of structure guarantee performance erm p and q committee
er yes but er i under stand that this is going to
yes you've said that i mean to
er another panel isn't it
it's going to be erm
in actual fact jim is right it's slightly complicated
service plans come with relevant committees being this one in this case but structures and structures strictly speaking are still the remit of p and q so i think it might be a courtesy to let me have a look at the structure because they are simply right UNK of the organisation p and q
yes
as i think UNK would phrase it
yes
erm but i think it would really be a courtesy
certainly the request of staff then could turn into of the panel erm but i think at the same time if people want to look at the structure so that they have a complete view of the structural organisation
yes
that would be erm
that would be a part of it
in
okay
we agree with that
agree
agreed
nobody against that
no
right
thank you
very much
so that er finishes er and erm the page
now we go on to er housing er issues
er and this is er paul is it not
yes thanks chairer
yeah
the report on
oh sorry
sorry
sorry
there is the second part of the
oh
but i thought we
erm
just explained that
to service the service UNK which i don't think will be controversial but erm i did just seat for the first part of report the little bit about
yes
did you want to er well
well
i thought that members had raised
yes i thought but then there's but briefly er sue i was going to wanted to point out in fact er you just er if you don't mind paul i'll just go back
mm
to sue wanted to point out that er erm how well your staff had er worked on er that what they had done er all over the town i in some instances er enabling people to get to their rights by you know taking them to UNK which is quite er time er exercise
i certainly don't erm propose to go through the service requirements to approve it but i did say that to start with i just wanted to clarify that all the policies have been
by the people and
yes
that i don't
yes
yep
moving straight up there
mm
right
thank you very much
right er paul we're going over to
yeah page ninety five ninety
yes
six report on field development
erm members will remember at the last er personal services committee on the twenty fourth of june er the option to put forward by the environment trust and UNK er builders was accepted as the one that er officers could pursue and to actually get some final proposals worked up and bring back to both the neighbourhood committee and this committee
erm at that erm meeting members did er bring up a number of points er the comments and questions which have been put to the environment trust and the answers to them are there on page ninety five under progress to date and on onto page ninety six er the main ones really are the question as to whether er any rented housing could be provided erm in the scheme is dealt with there the environment trust only develop for sale or for equity share er they're not a housing association they're a charitable body erm so they didn't feel that they were able to er take on the role of er provided rented housing in the scheme
erm the other main point which was raised by planning if you remember was that erm they wanted officers to evaluate a two block scheme er because they wanted er good access to the land to the rear of UNK for er perhaps some future development
when this was put to the environment trust erm they were er unaware before that stage that there were erm may be proposals of developing that land and expressed an interest in being involved if that ever came to UNK
erm now we have as an authority to negotiate er to put that land together erm the UNK hut is on some of that land at the moment and we've failed er to do that in the past
where the environment trust since our initial meeting have spoken er both with essex county council and community groups in the area and have made substantial progress erm on the idea of er using some of the land to the rear of er the existing UNK block er so they do want to come back with some wider proposals for a larger scheme which will be much the same as regards the UNK block but will include nine er additional homes erm and they will be two three bed houses and seven er two bedroom houses
erm it's quite an interesting erm er addition to the er original proposal but clearly members will need to take a view as to whether er they want erm the environment trust to do that but erm er what i would suggest is that we bring back er some final proposals from environment trust at the next meeting er for members to have a look at
the er other recommendation really is just a UNK note the outcome of discussion so far it has been to the erm we did take the paper to the UNK street little UNK er committee er in this cycle and there were no comments that came er from that committee
right
i don't remember maybe i've got a poor memory but er i can't remember you mentioning that the erm area committee but er there was erm going to be another block there and that er the er this er trust er environment trust had let one of the UNK er and consulted with the UNK people
okay at that point in time they hadn't actually er taken
ah
that consultation they were waiting to meet with the county er
oh
to
yeah
er well erm i'll be very interested to know whether er what sort of consultation with the UNK er people that they've had and erm when er i recall asking about erm er some of these er dwellings being for rent and erm i thought that you said er i it was a possibility
but then you come and tell us well they're a charitable trust i would of thought that a charitable trust would of been very er happy to have seen the some rented accommodation
so er but er that's just maybe a bit
yeah
bit of a
yes yeah i i'm also very disappointed that er in the negotiations that they didn't er come up with any sort of housing erm i think the it's UNK any future negotiations with other partners or developers UNK whoever they may be i think it's important that we have er we strike a balance between bu houses for sale and rented accommodation because i mean they need to now the building er this house for sale and each time we knock down flats or building and ga gave the land free of charge to the UNK we have to de count people those people are moving th the existing te er people on the waiting list and they're getting moved further and further back and er i think i it's a very worrying situation where we are continually giving land free of charge and they're getting no rented accommodation
i mean well if i remember in harlow er we i in nineteen seventy eight we had twenty thousand er social er council housing and about nine thousand owner occupiers the situation that UNK been reversed where we where i by the end of the century we practically have about three thousand social housing and about twenty two thousand er owner occupiers
erm but er i hope you're not going to way that er westminster council has gone for each er th their property into UNK they bought it up do it up and UNK it on the open market when a few yards away there are people no a er now sleeping under bridges and UNK
now i think that's disgusting
and er we'll be a part i know as councillors labour councillors we are caught in a trap because due the financial constraint that the government has placed upon us there is very little we could do but oh i'll get i er UNK of comfort from the UNK who may decide to give us a few social housing
i'm concerned for the people who are waiting for housing i'm concerned about young people who are living in i in ten er on the tenth floor of high rise flats these people have been waiting a very long time and each time er the er these they are the properties are er de counted they are going further and further behind
so i think any future in and negotiations with the er there has to be provision for social housing
well i think that when yo we're going to get a hundred percent nomination there
yeah perhaps i could erm reply to one or two of those points
yes as you pointed out we have been offered one hundred percent nomination rights to er these equity share units the er partners which members have shows as erm er the environment trust are a charitable trust they're not they're developers they're not speculative developers
erm the point that they were at pains to make as well was that erm that because of the low cost nature of these homes erm the charge for a mortgage would actually be less than er is common in a charge for most association properties with similar sites erm in terms of rent
erm members may also remember that er for the schemes that came forward on UNK were a result of a er an advertisement being placed three of the schemes put forward erm were for sale of equity share one was put forward which came er to the last meeting in this committee which was a rented scheme erm but was for people for members took a view the erm the environment trust scheme er would prove a better option er in harlow
UNK
yes erm hugh i want to ask you as erm the chairer of the area er committee erm if you're happy with
yes i mean i think that we had a big discussion at the last area committee on the scheme and the problem was of course that the detailed plans er for the consultation erm to the i'm at i'm a bit worried that at this late stage there's this new idea of building on the green wedge at the back and i wouldn't like to think that the scheme should be delayed the important thing it seems to me is that it should press ahead and
and UNK ever since it was built right next door to me when i was living there er many years ago and er get the new development done and so that i don't think we should hold on
erm i'm rather sceptical about the notion of building on that green wedge at the back
it's does smack to me a bit of in filling and er UNK is quite a dense area already a ve a very dense area erm and erm i'm you know i'd like to see any detailed plans on that before we even look at one in principle
i don't think we should hold up this one because of it er so i would like to see the more detailed plans coming to the next meeting of the area committee er so that residents can comment on this
yeah but isn't that going to be incorporated in as one package
well i wasn't sure whether paul was saying it's gonna be held up because of that
no erm
we
no i've had a meeting wi with colleagues around the table with the environment trust in the last couple of days and er
yeah
just that issue was raised that we would not want to see UNK of UNK that block held up by this
mm
we would not want to see the scheme a held up or at least the timetable that we could set down
right
erm the assurance from the environment trust is that i it need not happen erm it may not hold things up
mm
erm providing they could get some planning applications at the next er committee cycle
mhm
erm yes this is part of the planning process in any case the er the suggestion proposal all being
yeah
okay thanks paul
yes you wanted to say
it was the thing about er my understanding is that people in the area and it's probably the most UNK area in the whole of the town are very UNK about this
i think in general term they will go along with the erm the de UNK or the destruction of the er but my understanding is they are UNK their judgement until they've seen some version of the plan
mm
but er any attempt to put anything on at the back to the extent right up to the UNK hut in UNK hall will i think generate a lot of feelings about
mm
it in the area
something like i think we've seen before so er
mm
yes
right so
yeah can i just
sorry
oh UNK
wa thank you
paul was saying that i mean they're a hundred percent nomination housing the people who need the housing most are aren't the ones who who'll be able to er to use the and there's no housing strategy on er o on the equity part the there might be only a tiny bit on the rent side but it doesn't homes fo for the people who really need it even if they've got a hundred percent nomination flats
okay could i actually say something here
erm listening both to what anna and terry are saying here i think er myself and the colleagues in housing are very well aware that what this council doesn't have is a pre developed strategy of social housing
erm we've actually developed social housing really rather as it's been an opportunity we've grabbed it and we've done it you know some of it's been very good an and nobody's knocking that but i think it is time that we took stock and actually had a proper policy and a proper strategy on sa on social housing
can i just say to you that that's already been developed and worked out we're intending in the next cycle to bring you proposals for a housing strategy er on social housing and within that we're intending to run a series of short seminars for members to give members all members not just members of this committee but members of all area committees until everybody has that information background information on things like social housing partnerships housing association grant so that everybody's in a position to actually er see and make a decision on what this council wants out of social housing but all of that will take place in the next cycle chair
mm
so that i think the sort of questions that are being raised here will be addressed and will be able to be put within that complex that overall strategy which i think now is sort of pretend it doesn't exist at the moment
and i think it is important so that decisions like this can be made within a er a framework that we've all you know been part of and na are happy with agreed to
though i think that will be happening in the next cycle
yeah
thank you
yeah that's very helpful
so could we get back to the recommendations
agreed the recommendations
agreed
thank you
next er item is er on er the consultation paper on the UNK site policy and illegal camping
thank you chairer
erm
it's on page ninety nine
yes page ninety nine of this er thank you chairer
the er consultation and on the eighteen of august erm was circulated to many members on the fifth of the september a thirteen page document erm it was true to say that the er consultation paper contained some fairly radical proposals for changes in dealing with er UNK and travellers
give them
erm amongst other things erm UNK the responsibility of local authorities to provide sites erm have the new powers to move er illegal or UNK erm on from the land including er season UNK in certain instances erm the UNK by the government of er grants for local authorities to provide and construct sites having spent fifty six million pounds erm doing just that since nineteen seventy eight according to the report
er various changes in planning proposals erm and indeed erm encouraging travellers who are perhaps no long travellers those who are resident on the sites to move progressively into government housing
er a particular concern at the time of writing the report was the position concerning the long outstanding proposals to develop to UNK the two sites in harlow erm to date we have no information from the county er there was scheduled to be erm the meeting due to take place on the twenty second of september but the county er cancelled that meeting so it's impossible at this stage to give any further comment on that erm although i believe that UNK being taken up
er comments are required in to the by the thirteenth of november er and the associations of district councils have asked us to comment indeed by next week er so UNK views on the consultation paper are
chairer
well er i've got quite a few comments but i'll ask
first bill
the
yes but on the last comment that er chris made er bringing us and the letter to county about the failure of the meeting on the twenty second cos we feel that they are just lying down to the situation and not pursuing a pursuing the d a p about whatsoever and erm we are certainly in john's letter probably get it signed tonight complaining and asking for a meeting as soon as possible because we feel that they ought to be pursuing the question of these two sites they're dragging their feet
on the question of the government's proposals i'm entirely opposed to the er the idea that they should wash their hands of their er obligations er the nineteen sixty eight act as a number of members know er gave it as they are the duty of a local authority to acquire some sites for UNK some local authorities er UNK that and er they actually provide the sites like harlow other authorities just ignored it
completely ignored it
so if they if they removed the local authorities judging we'll be in a terrible position
an absolutely UNK situation because then the local authorities that have continued to avoid doing what they ought to have done will be rubbing their hands with UNK while the others who have a social conscience a moral social conscience will be put under tremendous pressure
so we must oppose that and er also they're asking for new powers er to move illegal travellers from land this is just another device because of their failure to provide sufficient sites throughout the country and if the of essex county council do their job er they don't need these new powers what authority ought to be ha er having are powers to provide some er camping places for people
and er the question of the grants as well i'm opposed to the fact that they they're going to if we don't hurry up er these two sites in harlow will not never be completed
if they stop the altogether we have to act very quickly
so i'm against all their proposals i think they're an absolute disaster
chairer
thank you bill
er
could i just ask a question
yes
could you tell er could i mean have you got any information about the grant here
er because er our submission for a grant regarding these two sites were submitted prior to all this coming forth
yes
so therefore it must be granted
now will tha i had hoped that we'd have an information that we'd have information at this meeting it's the thirtieth now
mm
right
and i had hoped we'd get the information have we got any information on that
well it's a hundred percent grant that the d of e gives to er the er county council so then it's really it's transferred to us isn't it
except the payment of er the erm th the manager of the sites or the warden of the sites
but chairer i have
spoken to officers at county in the last few days to
mm
try and get some information on this they felt that they were confident that at the end of the day that erm approval would be given but erm i asked for it in writing and they said we wouldn't be getting that
oh
well
we would be getting it
ah we wouldn't you wouldn't
we wouldn't be getting it
well i ca i'll ask a question then so that will have to be answered
but in reply to er terry when yes of course we should get it if it was prior to their new act
er but er
the there's no morality with this government i'm afraid terry as you and i well know
UNK
right thanks chairer
i've already put in our comments in writing on this to chris and i'll just sort of draw some of them save me repeating them
erm certainly as a group we welcome the fact that there is a provision for travellers in harlow on the two permanent sites and we also welcome the UNK er of the to happen although i very much hope it doesn't
erm i'll go through the consultation paper and pick out sort of paragraph by paragraph and any that we particular agree or disagree with
er certainly in the first paragraph we would say that we have drawn attention over the years to the nuisance of illegal parking erm by travellers particularly in stewards erm while travellers have the right to live their own lifestyle we also believe that other residents have the right to live free from that kind of nuisance and problem and that it does need to be addressed somehow
however this definitely isn't the way to do it
erm we will continue to say that harlow should have applied for designation years ago erm it's very
sorry can you repeat that
harlow should of applied for a designation a long time ago if harlow had been designated then surrounding councils would have had to live up their responsibilities to provide adequate sites for travellers which they have not done and UNK governments have also failed to apply the caravan sites act nineteen sixty eight adequately
if they'd done so if they'd insisted that local authorities did provide the sites they are supposed to provide i believe there would now be sufficient pitches for all travellers and that they wouldn't be used for illegal parking erm at the level that there is at the moment
er on paragraph nine the government's own figures show that there is a shortfall of UNK while the others who have a social conscience a and that they've mixed the site provision isn't keeping pace with the growth of the number of UNK and yet what it's proposing to do in this paper will make the situation worse by removing any incentive erm and any requirement on local authorities actually to provide the sites that are needed to make up that shortfall and it's quite clear that what this is about is actually what it is happening in housing in general and that is shifting provision from the UNK from the public to the private sector
erm there's also a very strange statement in paragraph which says that the nineteen sixty eight act is intended to provide a network of sites to enable UNK to move around or settle but in practice many UNK are settled on permanent sites and it seems to me that is the logical result of having insufficient pitches in that if th you know there aren't enough pitches for you are not going to get up and go from a permanent that you've been living on and move off in case you can't one somewhere else and that seems to be the inevitable logic of the government's own failure to make sure that there is adequate provisions in local sites
erm the caravan sites act nineteen sixty eight er paragraph fifteen did actually i think address the provision government sites quite well or it would have if it had actually been properly implemented in that there was a UNK and stick there was stick or requirement
for a site and the UNK is actually being able to apply to designation whether you lived up to that
now it seems that UNK governments have just haven't lived up to their obligation to UNK the stick and harlow council just haven't had the sense to reach for the UNK in that local people are caught in the middle
erm on paragraph twenty erm the government's proposals will UNK all the camping which takes place outside recognised sites while at the same time i've already said removing any incentive or obligation for local authorities to provide enough sites anyway so i it's a total squeeze that on the one hand the government is restricting the number of pitches and then UNK everybody who hasn't got one
erm paragraph twenty one we'd certainly oppose any move to give local authorities the right to cease homes of travellers erm especially in view of the shortage of the good pitches i that is just totally and i don't think that that's on i hope we can oppose that
erm i don't think the on paragraph twenty three and consequently the suggestion that kind of permission really are realistic at all erm i think this government is totally obsessed with owner occupation at the expense of all kinds of housing whether it's permanent rented or anything else
erm and this seems to be the whole kind of class of which the government is coming to this document
i
a teacher needs a kid needs to have a teacher comment about its progress in some specific area of literacy such as a syntax
mm
or its spelling or its grammar then you as its subject teacher should make a
UNK there
comment to that effect
mm
specifically and UNK to that child
i'm sorry i don't like the term literacy i don't i think it's too er i think right you need
their spelling
er literacy is it's one of the general skills i'm sure it's down as literacy UNK the other one
it may be but yeah
but then we are con if the argument on the one hand is we should conform to what the government's saying and i'm saying that's what the government says as one of the general areas we should address i can't be wrong both ways if you follow my drift
you can't have your cake
mm
and eat it
well on the UNK targets for english they what they've done is they put the spelling and punctuation underneath presentation
mm
they talk about surface features but i mean that's gonna be e even more for people to understand
well jus just to UNK the mood for a moment and to go along with high UNK words here are some
ha
high UNK words for weak oh poor rather poor here we go UNK
oh UNK yeah i like that
there are better one's
that's crap
there are better ones to come
UNK
UNK
UNK
is nice
UNK
UNK
listen
what's this
UNK
god that sounds rude
that's
UNK
ooh ah
UNK and finally UNK and UNK
oh well
ah yeah
can we settle for UNK stroke UNK and then move up the
i'd love to
thank you for bringing a little bit of light in
UNK
mm
that's great that one
right erm
that's disgusting
to how we doing
are you are you seriously
saying to me right as a parent you choose a qualification you like pulling out your personal c v and as a UNK that literacy is a high UNK word
to some people it might be yes
i
bloody hell
well i think you know
that's not very good english
i
if today it is perfectly
but
appropriate
with all due respect we will meet that
more and more once we have to put descriptions of levels down there will be words
mm
there that they don't understand and it's
but that
going to be educational programme
but i think this is this is something the kids will use as well
the they make it so obvious
yes but the UNK if the UNK gonna say well what's literacy
and you say you know
that's right
and you say well
reading writing and spelling
you're a you're a it's all you know
and all that stuff
your english
yeah
yes
or language not english
yeah
but language
language
yeah
you see because if you start doing it like that i mean you could say th the mathematical skills you could say well he's good on number but his graph work is poor and you know he di you know you cannot you can't
yeah
you can't be that
alan me for me mathematical but i accept what you're saying that you mean numerical for most of that UNK as opposed to
no i said that
wi with all due respect you know we we're talking about the precision of the word and when you actually come to a ten point scale there will be some UNK anyway in the is it a six
is it a five
is d'you know what i mean
mm
so i think there's going to be some balancing anyway
you you're discussing this and that instead of putting presentation
i put and UNK
it's possible then
pardon
then
instead of putting presentation i put and UNK
it's like you know do we read them though
mm
mm
she does
well it's a that's
right
just a fact
mm
instead of presentation i put writing and UNK
ah yeah
to make it easy
it's our duty anyway to get these words though the last minutes of discussion have been possibly the most valuable cos if we cannot use language accurately
it's about language it's important
yes it is
then we're not doing our job then are we
yes
you're absolutely right
that's right but the trouble is using language accurately with all due respect is to some degree
that's a
from where you're standing
terrible expression with due respect
with limited respect
is it depend on where you're where you're standing doesn't it
when really it means with no respect
oh that's UNK
wouldn't be sitting here going through this process if i if i hadn't got no respect for your
could we have UNK down there
well i was UNK
i would quite
t
like that
right
colour coded UNK for the classes
ca can we just go through
at the moment we've got effort and behaviour acceptable we've got numeracy acceptable and we've got literacy acceptable with reservations but tough UNK
we've got attendance i was going to suggest that we made that attendance stroke UNK
mhm
if you get that all in
be in on time
yes
yes
mm
i agree
yes
so ca can i effort what about this concentration bit that was a query
er
mm
what was on the UNK what did we have on the UNK i'm not saying the original list is like is right paul i had something in there about homework whether people wanted
no
the premise on this was what do parents and i know the words are wrong but at least it moved people along way er what do parents want to know about their youngsters
er very simple and
it's hardly our authority
that was my feeling
is it
sorry
hardly
no well i'm saying to you the same sort of things in general skills and abilities there are certain things that we required to put in the er numeracy the literacy er to some degree attendance and UNK although we don't have to do it on a subject specific basis erm we everybody wants to know about he young ho whether their youngsters are trying i e effort ha whether they behave in lessons
erm do we want areas like working with others do we want homework
i mean that's what you're saying
not on skills
not those two
you don't
you did
want homework
no
yeah
i don't want homework
no i don't want homework
no
nobody seems to want homework in
no
why's that
it's spontaneous doing it off their own back
well how do you make a comment on how the kids done a homework
it's very difficult on a ten point scale
wha what's ten for some kids
sorry
may be three for another
we have a homework policy that is accepted in the schools
we don't need comments
no i'm just asking i'm not
yes
i'm not trying to be
mm
i'm just asking
testing us
why
well i haven't i haven't got an axe to grind
andrew homework
i think that it isn't a general skill it at needs to be commented on i think that it needs to commented on i think that it ought to be commented on in the comment box
yeah like he never
right
handed in a piece of homework
yes
all year
yes
would yo would
yes
i when i do the comment thing put in would we i say i that's UNK
would we put some guide lengths on things
yes
that might be commented upon
to give
yes
people starters
yes
for five
mm
yes
mhm
homework things that might be commented on in this
yes
section art colour of your socks
yes
i have put on my er general skills and abilities working with others i wanted some social
could we not
is this
summarise that
is this
and put the collectively
are they
put a collective noun for that which
i
is what paul was saying
it's
a minute ago isn't
mm
it
it's
it's what did you say
paul
pardon
horrible
it's got to be ca often work sideways from working with this door open
no
no i just
no
opened the door about a minute ago
no i think that so social skills
then
perhaps
yeah some of it in
social skills
we are required in the same way as we require numeracy and literally literacy literally
to have something that indicates how the UNK gets on with others i'm sure that's one of the general skills and ability
social skills yeah i think UNK the whole lot together
mhm
how you get on with other people
what about listening skills and speaking skills
well hang on social skills
cos UNK have to be clarified to some degree
you're gonna have a great deal of
body language
but the words will be in the clarification needs to be for
as a as an addendum for staff doesn't it
yes a clarification is for the staff not for the parents
oh no
well obviously not
ca can i
or we'll be writing the whole books for them
so UNK there okay
could i can i say something about
have faith in our prayers
i think that we should be aware of what these levels
mean
i think that we must whe when we're we must come to some sort of consensus in the staff as to what the levels mean in inverted commas
can i suggest UNK below average rather than poor
i'm afraid i don't like that average
i know it isn't ideal
ooh no
but it's er it's a little bit better than poor
i prefer poor
i like poor
i like poor
mm
let's have a vote on it
below average
UNK
poor
oh not poor come on
how can you possibly like poor
the negative UNK of a word like that come on
but some of them
well
are bloody poor
well wo well one out of ten is indicating that they're poor
i ye yes and i agree with that but we're supposed to be communicating with the little UNK right
no i'm sorry
in a sensitive way right UNK the positive
no we're supposed
to be communicating with the parents
parents
exactly little UNK that's what i said
but we're not UNK it's not UNK to the kids
i agree with you but you i mean if well you might as well say UNK
levels one two and three are UNK
can i can i
i mean if you're going to take that to the ultimate lengths
the way that you lot are going on
why UNK you know the word is shit
it's bloody john UNK version of educational terminology
with all with all with all due respect
oh
sold to UNK er mini UNK
i can we leave the word poor and below alone for the moment so that
right sir
angela can reflect
yes sir
upon it
and come up with other alternatives
what
we get what you're saying but at the moment er can we stick on skills and abilities and try and
right
get in here
sorry
i'm stuck for a word i've asked angela i can't explain to her what i mean it's awful when you when you got a word at the back of your mind it's one of those words where UNK a kid ham anybody any person can er realise that something needs doing and do it without being told to do it
er they have er a se
independence
sense of responsibility
some sort of a level of independence
responsibility
no
none of those things
more creative than that
er you know perhaps if UNK might have UNK approved it of it you know it's
weird
i'm being
go on carry on
i don't know what you're getting at what
you don't do you no
never mind as an extra skill
o okay
oh as an extra skill
as an extra skill yes
yeah
perhaps it's so rare amongst
at the moment
children that er this it seems unlikely that er
UNK
that's a UNK
no
term
at the moment
UNK that's a
no
UNK term
i think i think you're all getting a bit tired are you not
well the cab firm said we could
i'm sorry to have brought this down to
at the moment we have
what have we got
i effort behaviour
yeah
literacy numeracy attendance UNK and social skills
right
well
is
writing and UNK can just be called presentation
right
er
give us again what you've got i want effort behaviour
effort behaviour literacy numeracy attendance UNK social skills and presentation
and have we not gotta take care that we don't we don't have such an enormous list
oh yeah
that people are gonna be going
well all that all we've got at the moment alan is a list of things that we feel should be in there
but
it may well be that you'll say well we want to put these in a specific order
aha
or that we want to leave some of these out
all i'm trying to do at the moment is to sort of get
is do like a shopping list
ideas of er
aha
a shopping list
on there because i this following instructions i remembered why i put it now we are but one you were saying that
pardon
we're obliged to report on social skills and so forth
mm
one of the most important things that bias report on is problem solving and that was my attempt at problem solving
is it
the word that i'm looking for is
problem solving
no
no
that's two words
ah shit
one word which includes problem solving
can fo can we for the moment you have a specific task andrew
which is to come up with a word
can we put can we put problem solving in for the moment
mm
do we agree that we want something that says
well you see following instructions isn't really problem solving but it's sa partly a long line and the UNK would know what it means mm that they know
i mean i would put that under group work and social skills and no er the way i would approach it but it may not apply
i quite
d'you see
like problem solving
we i'll have to
alright well go and
go bu
do some then
i'll have to back through my
instead of
general skills
alright problem solving at last
so at the moment we've got one two three four five six
there's only an extra
so seven eight
fine
there's only an extra one there
one two three four five six seven
we could leave literacy numeracy no
there's only an extra one there
literacy numeracy we have nothing
fo nothing for co UNK out and UNK in following instructions is out problem UNK in er UNK numeracy er social skills is extra
and presentation i've got
presentation is writing
yeah
and UNK
yeah instead of writing and UNK
any further comments
ah isn't behaviour in social skill and then we could drop that as a separate one
no i think the behaviour
no
is very important
you want to want to see that separate
no i'm not saying
it may well be a social skill but i think it's
aye
worthwhile
it's a one that's
you want it identified separately
we would
yeah
have to er i'll try and come up with some talk of some sort of definitions guidelines of i mean UNK effort i do you have to explain effort
not really cos
no
cos i come back to what i said about five minutes ago
yep
these levels erm they've got to be in the context of the levels of the national curriculum or fail to be valuable
we UNK have everybody putting UNK and tens and nobody putting ones twos and threes because then it becomes meaningless er in relation to the section it's got to bear some relation to what sort of standard you expect from a child at such
what's this
for what
at such an a
it's for
well these are te it's a ten point scale
mm
this effort thing
yes the all these
oh i didn't know that
have to be at that's why it's a ten point scale
yeah but i don't see how that might have to relate to national curriculum er
well that was one of the reasons for doing
it on the basis that there's a sort of UNK and that we're trying to set a
consistent standard
yeah you've got a ten point scale but with effort we can hardly say hey there's a class there and you haven't you haven't put anybody down as poor
oh no
no
ah we don't have to
i'm not saying
apply that
i'm not saying that what i'm saying is that we must all have at the back of our minds a sort of considered opinion of what's
aye consensus of what
a consensus of opinion of what levels
yeah
are yeah
right
well hopefully we already have
well i think i think it's i think it's it something that should be
UNK
UNK at a whole staff meeting
yes
that we should
yes but the that we needn't worry about at this stage i think
what for these
for these here
yeah because invariably somebody's gonna put erm behaviour eight and everybody else is gonna put behaviour two and it's gonna become meaningless
well no
it's gonna happen
well no cos some classes
not necessarily
but eight no but eight in terms of in terms of behaviour
aha
er is very good and if you it's level a at g c s e in the area
well it shouldn't be like that
ah oh ha no come on don
no it shouldn't no i disagree with that
you can't quantify their
you can't
behaviour
no
i can see i can
i me
see the point of having
yeah
UNK of er
mhm
like that but not to that
mm
fine point it's UNK the kids too much
no i alright i yeah
and in some class rooms the kids are gonna go down for a variety of reasons they're gonna they're gonna work their ticket and in other class rooms they won't
and the gi that's gotta be reflected
oh yeah i ca yeah i accept i'm being
what d'you mean
UNK but i
well i tho though i take what UNK saying in a general
in a general way yes
actually i wouldn't mind it staying open cos i'm a bit hot
right leave it open
yep leave it open
is that alright
andrew could you come and hold this door
certainly
it's still
i'll put head in
erm
close it
we we've gone over er i mean are we basically happy at that
so we need to re draft it we it needs to be sort of re drafted in a format
yes it's thanks very much
that we've got
for doing that
and if i didn't say it strong enough as UNK done it has given us a real basis to work on don and it is appreciated
mm it is
yep
we pupil teacher date does that still apply
yes it does doesn't it
yes
i was just thinking about whether people sign but it does no it still applies
oh andrew it doesn't ma
no i mean this UNK that was you know or stuff erm we've got more categories than we originally started with
well you would just need an extra space or two spaces on the bottom
d'you want to look at whether you put them in any particular order
i think you should yeah
yes i think or i and things like effort and behaviour
behaviour
are important
well we
individual as opposed to things that are hard like
we finish in five minutes i feel that
mm
i asked terry to come along because one of the things i tho i tho i hope we might get round to spending a few minutes on was about alan's raised it before about records coming in er and what the state of the game is in records coming into us and how we're transferring that information or not transferring that information onto UNK onto department's national curriculum er material
mm
is starting to flow into us
yes
er and there are i implications for you in as much that my UNK idea would be that everything in terms of a subject would be on a separate sheet so that
mhm
maths information we had a child would go straight to the maths
yeah
department etcetera
but would it
yeah
whether
well
you would
the point i'm making now is we've got terry here
yeah
just to give you some background information cos we do need to address that i know it's a side issue from this are we fairly happy with that
yes
other than
poor
poor
i'm strongly thinking that at
what else
some stage you've got to say to a kid
right whilst
you are not good
you have that on disk
how much how UNK is it
i agree
for you to do
no i can i can move it i can yeah
right so would you do that for us so we
yeah
can at some point get together and then
i can't do it here
oh no
no
no
no
i haven't got a dictionary
well you've got friday night don't be so silly
mm
erm
all over your place on saturday
we can we can review that again
right okay
aye saturday morning
is that okay
so tha thank you very much for that a little bit heated on occasion but we've got there
good though wasn't it
no i get very offended and upset
and UNK cos i like UNK and light
go back to what i asked terry about just so that you're in the picture really
yeah
i think one of the biggest problems we've got or i've had in the last couple of years is that we've got so many primary schools that we get children from spring gardens and western are now producing national curriculum information for which UNK has got
it's come in different ways maths english and science from spring gardens is separate sheets which we can actually take out the files and give to each department there's no problem there saint john's again is separate sheets UNK isn't it's actually on UNK sheets we either cut them up and give them out separately in some form or whatever and what i've what we hope to do over the next maybe this year is to ask them for a sheet each for each subject that we can actually take out of the file and give to each department so that is has arrived it ha did arrive last year but it arrived in such UNK that we didn't actually give it out but we certainly have it this year and UNK and i certainly UNK anyway will get that together and give it out to departments
i know paul's been down to UNK saint john's and they are quite far ahead believe it or not they have got separate sheets for most subjects and we'll able to do that english at UNK spring gardens is good so it maths because that was actually dealt with by erm barbara
barbara
who is now left but never the less it's been taken over by
yes well the ne the new girl's very
yeah and
very good as well
yeah to yeah she's okay UNK but there is somebody specifically in charge of each of the areas within the primary schools they keep changing because they keep leaving but i mean obviously the there is it is going on
the problem i have is putting them into forms and last was a was a specific example because we ended up with our seven g n and i took the i the information from each of the primary schools and put them into form classes
now this year what i've done is actually going to see the form teacher and look at the classes and they've actually given me a lot more information this year and hopefully keep our fingers crossed the classes are very varied and we have good we have UNK and we have the not so good and we've tried to keep those like that
yeah we are not so
it is
good
it is
well not saying tha i mean i and again i think what i need to do is get a sheet again obviously working with yourselves and rod to get you more information to make sure the classes are not and don't get same situation as last year
are we in a position terry then for every child t to for example with years with seven or eight etcetera to say to alan
yeah
