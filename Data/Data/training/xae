right there's a sheet er that indicates er what we are aware of the mathematical ability sorry the aye the mathematical ability o of every child at i e from spring gardens it will be a separate sheet
yeah
but from wherever you said if they're using one sheet for all three we would need
yeah
at the present time to photocopy a couple of extra ones so angela can have one
that's right
and don can have one
that's right
yeah
i don't i don't know that you need to do all this i mean we would like ac i mean as far as i'm concerned we would like access to this information but i don't particularly need some pieces of
to keep it
paper to keep
i think that's very well sa
i mean if they can be put in a room or
you know if the
in the
if there's somewhere that we can
secure room for the staff to just to
look at
look at and UNK and take the information that they want rather than putting what sounds to me a lot of work on some
because in actual fact i would i would be interested
mm
in not just the maths you see
yeah yes
mm
i would i would want
mm
to nick the whole i want to know english as well
like english as well
look what i'm saying
what about the small staff room
secretary that could be got that way
can all the tables
there is no need for you
to do
right
an enormous amount
yeah
of work
right so in other words we just take it out of the files keep the children information in the UNK office and just extract what you want to put in somewhere else
but you would put it in UNK order
order
not form order because
not form
they'll obviously be moving about and tutors can't be UNK round every two minutes if something goes wrong
have to be secure
it could go
yeah
mm
with respect will these people not be getting UNK soon
they have all our have got UNK
so won't this information be on UNK and can it ju not just be transferred
i'm not sure andrew
erm
i suppose it must be
wouldn't that be a better way of keeping anyway
well possibly
but what about the current situation
fair enough but in the future so as not to have to
why can't just simply pass it round people
these people won't be on si the some of these primary schools are on
well they are yeah
spring gardens and have got UNK
everybody's had UNK training now
yeah they've all got it
er
all our primary schools have got it
bob was down with his secretary at
last time i went in everyone got called
yep they all that
yeah
you're kidding me
extract it but keep it in your room UNK then if the maths department say hey look can we have a look at that during the
have it there for the first month or something
yeah go
well as if i mean i've got a draw in my filing
cabinet so as UNK that says
what er
that
but filing cabinets tend to put people off
no
we will ask i mean it's not gonna be something that's vital
i've used a filing cabinet and it's put me off
yeah
but at the minute
we no it'll go
we will just ask you can we have a look at it for a few days
it'll go it'll all go as it's individual sheets in a box file will it not
mm
in a single box file with cap on
oh well a box yes
it can go in a box file
i've got a box file
ah
can we have the box file if you could bring that in
that's saves me bringing it
a box file yeah
that could be kept in UNK room with
oh
national curriculum UNK on
mm
it and it's
yeah
there
mhm oh yeah
sheet on the top so
if somebody takes it away
yeah
they
oh
sign and leave the sheet
that's a good idea
yeah
and
here
yeah
but when you
jolly good
when you did make the point about not having information i was concerned about that
oh yeah
it was an UNK
yeah
on my part that didn't get passed down and it is important that's
but we
UNK
yeah
i mean we were
if we UNK about not having it back you know when parents came in june but we don't need it immediately you know it doesn't have to be UNK so that we all
but the
have it within the first term
but for the from a UNK
it is
point of view when the UNK been com when so it's coming in and being sorted it is better that it's done at that particular time
oh yes otherwise yeah
rather than filing everything away then having
yeah
to stop and go to files and taking it out
it's one
yes
of those jobs
but
you're better off doing
but terry has enough on his plate without having to separate them into maths and this that and the other and photocopy bits and pieces
because we don't ne we don't
yeah
them permanently we
yeah
just need to look at them
that's right yeah
yeah
the be all and end all
right mine is a
cos i will copy down anything that i think
yeah
is important
angela
yes
in the UNK in the various schools that i've worked in i i've
right
made a list of all
is that two
er six erm i've made a list of all the different words that are used for crap on reports right
special needs cause for concern inadequate unsatisfactory below average and weak
unsatisfactory
and does do any of them sort of leap out and you think yes i love it
no
in a sense i like below average i'm concerned about getting the two damn words in isn't that pathetic really
below average is the best of
can't we just back it along a bit so that andrew can you know
certainly
could you call it UNK
yes certainly tha that can start there finish there
i thought it was er
and they'll be loads of room to fit in
below average
i shall leave poor in when i do it because i can't get it in
that's fine
mm
i know a good doctor
i take what you're saying
by the way
it's in the spirit of trying to be positive i'm
aha

no
no it doesn't does it it's spelt in a different way isn't it
what's that bear it any longer
that's right b e a r that's right
same as the animal
it's also the animal so that you're actually left with three er words that sound the same two of which are spelt differently and the third which is the name of an animal okay
they did do then put a pencil to there mm you've already done it haven't it
there was lots of bare people on the beach
oh dear me there are lots of bare people on the beach right what about fare what are you going to do about that

f a i r
f a i r yes and this one is f a r e
no that's spelt the other way f a i r anyone help him
f a r e what does it mean
is it was a fair idea
no that's the same as

the next one then er
UNK now what sort of UNK is that
rabbit
yes it's it is the same sort of family as a rabbit a UNK
how do you spell the other sort of UNK
h a i r
h a i r and that is the hair that's on your head i've got long hair dark hair
now what about what's the next word
scare
scare
scare now put that in a sentence
erm
what sort of word is scare
erm a kind of when you UNK somebody it's scare
yes so it's a scare so what kind of word is it
come on get it right
is it er can i put it in a sentence
no would you tell me what sort of word it is remembering what we did at the beginning of the week
yeah but that's the what it means i want to know what kind of a word it is
yes i know it's spelt
is it a verb
no it's not a verb come on what is it
a noun
yes it's a noun it's a name of something isn't it
because we were doing that at the beginning of the week a scare you could actually get
right so can you put it back into a sentence again then
shirley
you've got a scare on i saw UNK
we've got a scare on we saw UNK yes that was it
right what's the next word
share
share what does share mean
you share out
you share out can you put that in a sentence
i like to share out my sweets
oh that's lovely i like to share out my sweets
digging
digging they're going onto double gs now why would it be double g
one put dig and then and then ing
yes but there is a rule isn't there
oh yeah
ah yes trevor
because is it cos of erm if you put d
no not quite you're nearly right come on
is it because the i sounds like
yes you would actually get a magic e right or a magic i making that vowel right say its long name so it would be quite difficult to say dig UNK
right lets try the next one what's the next one
er bigger
bigger that's for the same reason there you've got an e and so because you've got the e we can double the g to make the i go on go on say short for
it would be UNK
it would be UNK but what is g and e say itself
g isn't it
yeah so you've really got to protect you've got to protect that i okay so can you put bigger in a sentence trevor
erm er the man was bigger than the boy
a man was bigger than the boy good
charlie the next one
erm parents
yes
i love my parents
oh i am pleased i love my parents good spare
i let someone borrow my spare pencil i let someone borrow my spare pencil
prepare
prepare what does that mean
erm you prepare something
can you put it in a sentence for me
i prepare for my music exam
i prepare for my music exam if you're going to do prepare what are you going to put on the end
yes i would care for when i had to do something rather than just go straight into that good
UNK
UNK mm we know all about that don't we
i UNK when somebody
i UNK when somebody
erm
no if you say UNK you're actually saying the present tense so UNK
UNK
UNK would be better because it sounds as if they've already chosen
we all have a UNK yes it can be a UNK until if you're using UNK and a UNK what sort of word is it
a noun yeah if you use UNK then UNK what sort of words is it then
what oh dear oh
it's not an oh dear word no
it's a verb
thank you it's a verb right to do something so it's the same spelling that can be used in different ways
what about the next one
UNK
UNK
i wore my UNK in the swimming pool
i wore my UNK in the swimming pool good
right the next one
erm trigger
yes
a man pulled the trigger on his gun and shot him
yes absolutely
UNK
UNK
erm i had to have my UNK checked at the airport
i had to have my UNK checked at the airport you see what's happened to the end of that word look at it right you've got age at the end because what rule is working there
got a double g
pardon
got a double g
no have a look you're only looking at the beginning of it here try again
it's got the e on the end
and what sort of e is that
not the magic e
yes it's the magic e isn't it and what's it making that a say
a as opposed to u isn't it so it's really like UNK age so if you say it quickly together it becomes UNK yeah okay the next one oh sorry put it in a sentence
suggest
suggest
erm i have to suggest that the erm the had er
mm that's right i had to suggest the UNK orders
i suggested
how what would you put on the end of suggested
e d
e d even though when we say it sounds like
if you said i made a suggestion what sort of word would that be
come on you're all asleep now a suggestion what would that be
a UNK
yes come on charlie be brave a noun yes a something isn't it a if you write a or the in front of a word it's usually a noun okay so just keep listening for the a and the
the next one trevor
erm beware
beware right and a sentence please
beware of UNK
beware of UNK
charlie
erm
third one down
i had a nightmare last night

UNK
UNK
erm i know a UNK that UNK
i know a UNK a UNK that UNK
why couldn't you actually have j u g one g l e
why couldn't you have the spelling j u g l e
something would happen to the l
something would happen not to the l but to the vowel
hello i'm terribly busy UNK actually i've got a full lesson at the minute erm i'll try and sort that out as soon as i've finished this lesson
okay thanks for telling me UNK
thank you bye
UNK
yes because what happens when you've got just a very thin l the magic e can even work through it u right so it will be UNK yeah UNK that wouldn't be the right pronunciation at all okay let's go on to the next one

right just sit down for a minute and let's michael read his first
the monster from the UNK
i saw the monster arrive from the UNK he looked at the when i saw him i ran
the monster from the UNK
when i was walking past the UNK one night when i was on my way back from school i heard a UNK noise behind a bu bush when i went up the went up first to the bush a big UNK like thing jumped out from behind the bush it gave me such a UNK i nearly UNK
i started to run up straight up the hill erm lucky the monster was running straight at me and sticking out of the crowd and he UNK over and after the end
my home
my home is near the trees and i live there in my house there is
i have lots of places in my
and i have one pigeon and a dog
my home is made of wood
and the roof is made of tin and the colour of it is grey
it has two doors one four windows i don't have the garden or oh in my house there are six rooms and one of them is er one of them is my is my room and a picture and a
my and
room and er
my home
i live in a tree so does my mum tree house my mum and my dad and my brother and my dog and dad live there
our house is made of wood and is dark green
we have four windows and four doors we have got a there is a big hill in front of it and it is good but if it if the tree house because we find the trees and then and then we were we play in the tree house sometimes with the dog
inside our home we have a lot of furniture we have four rooms one in the bathroom one in the bedroom and one in the lounge and one in the kitchen
right then
i like erm christopher and simon
yes i know take your books and show
right erm jonathan here
right john has written a story about his home right it's a good descriptive story on how people live
until one day they couldn't think of any way that you could may improve it
my home
i live in a tree house my mum and my dad and my brother and my dog and my sister
our house is made of wood and is dark green we have a four windows and four doors
it has got wooden roof
there is a big hill in front of it and it is good but erm because we climb the tree and climb it and we play in the tree house today with the dog
inside our home we have a lot of furniture we have four rooms and one in the bathroom one in the bedroom and one in and one in the lounge and one in the kitchen here
okay right
so if we cut out the one
they might
it might flow a bit more easily might it
that's good it was alright apart from that you describe where john and
are living well
yeah i didn't see which sort of
no did he describe the house though
yeah
yeah i think his description of where he was living in the tree house was very clear
i think he could improve it just a bit jonathan
and then it might flow a bit more UNK might it then right michael bring yours out now please
just a minute john right michael i want you to read yours through once more for me please
do it about the monster
monster from the UNK
when i saw the monster from the UNK one night i was i was i was frightened i was he looked liked a when i saw him i ran back to camp and i felt frightened i UNK under my sleeping bag the end
right see michael was describing that how he felt
yeah
how did feel then
frightened
you think that he came out quite
what christine has said then do you think
well you said he went under a sleeping bag
aha
and just i UNK under my sleeping bag er then i thought er the UNK what would happen to the monster and so he might of stayed there on you know all night
john
well he did say that the monster was rather large he looked like a bird
with some UNK out
what else could you bring in his bag
anything else he could of put in the hat UNK
he vaguely saw the monster and then he ran back to the camp where he was camping but he didn't describe
where
yeah where
so he could of put a little bit in about how he ran back
yeah
and what he went through in
that couldn't he
yeah
right the people who have not read an essay out yet i want you to sit just a minute michael next to somebody and i want you to read your essay to them and see what they think about it and how you could maybe improve it and i want michael and john to go and show steve your books as well now please right boys do that now then yes could you take yours to show
please
do we have to show both
not sure it's still working
it's still working
the thingy
is it recording us
is it recording
yeah
my dad's got all this
sorry steve erm
that you're not going to read your essay and
and that isn't
essay either work your book or and get it
er yes well it has to be up
and when you've finished it you can then do a picture about your
aha and that gets rid of it from the front page
sorry rod do you want me to
no it's okay er just carry on cos i'm just looking for a piece of paper to write it on
the was that the first one was more or less science orientated an i looked at it and thought how i could how i could make it such that it was common
yep
er so that angela could use it you know
erm and i came up with this bit sort of the middle bit national curriculum levels would be er your own thing right
that wou tha that bit would be erm different for each subject
the middle bit
yeah
whereas
these
the top bit and the bottom bit with the at all
mm
and the format would be the same and you just have different names on the top here
yeah
so it would be the same sort of format
and if you didn't want to do national curriculum levels or it wasn't appropriate then you could continue your staff comment now or you could draw a wee picture there or something like that you know
yeah and comments
er the first thing is i put on the top of my UNK that i'd rather the pupils weren't involved at this stage i'd rather they were involved in the over view with form tutor
so i wouldn't have taken make a pupil comment on that section
i'm not very happy with my box
why what's wrong with it
well the first one
you mean you're on page two now
yes
right
well can we not talk about page one first
can we to some
yes alright then
ignore page two because it's the next stage on in fact yo because it's a UNK sheet isn't it
mm
alright
we're actually at the moment the brief the focus is to actually on what we look at what we would send out as a report to parents
that performs a second function
that's the report at the end of
right it's
mm
if you like that UNK sheet
correct
alright
so can we just ignore that for the moment and focus on the first sheet deliberately
it's not difficult
yeah
mm
because i think it gives us er it's got a lot of common things in it gives us a UNK to work on
mhm
as opposed to be UNK fairy
cos that was the problem last time wasn't it we weren't quite sure
mm
where we were starting from and i think it would be valuable to do what we started doing and actually to look at this as the UNK and decide how we might amend it to keep common factors in that we can all use because we need something that has a common UNK level
mm
in
is that is that
i did that i did that with
right
you
mm
one of the things you said angela was that there wasn't enough comment on the original one wasn't
aha
enough room so i the size of that because of that
yeah
more room
but i've what i'm saying rod is i've done the same thing
sorry angela
because
yeah i'm trying to put the excuse
i haven't been i haven't presented it as well don has
right
but i've done a UNK thing that could be UNK
right
i think this is very good one
ah oh yeah i like that i like it yep
erm just picking little bits i mean er we when we say actually what it is erm annual report do we say the annual report to parents or is it annual report just i know that that's minor but at the actual top what do we actually call the thing that we're presenting
i think i would actually prefer to leave the word annual out and just put i dunno what you wanna call it i'd i'm always
UNK about the word report
well UNK gardener
yes
community high school yeah
it will be UNK gardener community high
yeah
school that's the first thing
yeah
do we need to put on what it is
i mean is it not almost explanatory
yes we do need to put it on
we do need to put it on
i'm looking for bill is he around anywhere
bill
p e
p e
and they're in room one which is down past
okay
wherever something
in the past we've used different terms haven't we
we went to statement to parents
refuse and this tha you know
to deliberately move away from the idea of the old reporting format that's why we've used the word statement to parents
i mean that box on the left hand side there could be UNK gardener community high school and where it says science or maths or whatever
yeah
above that could be report for and then science you know
what's wrong with just a title science or
oh okay then
it seems quite clear i thought
i wo i understand that you preferred the word report to be there
well ah no
didn't say the word report
sorry
no he didn't say that no
i think that an indication of what the sheet is
yes
for the benefit of
mm
whoever might pick the sheet up
so UNK gardener community high school UNK and i would say annual out because
mm
mhm
it might well be
may not be annual
right
mm
mhm
and we either go with the word report or we look for an alternative word or words
what is what is the what is the is assessment not the word to use these days
mm
no it's not a report is it
cos if we're reporting we're not assessing
mhm
it is a report to parents and i mean under legislation we have to report
report
to parents
well i mean i was
that's
just looking at that one where we said well report to parents
annual report to parents yeah
you know and is that is that satisfactory
well that
or do we want to call it something different
in that case should call it subject report
subject report instead of annual got enough space in there only make it small
do we need subject report in if you're going i'm sorry if we're UNK if you're gonna have a box with you're subject name in
cos it's obvious
mhm
that it's a subject report if you've got report
yes
right says science or art and design or whatever
well just put report
report will do
and leave the title next to it
yes
yeah
okay
but will the
UNK although if one is eventually going to talk about the report one could to make it clear to the parents that what one is a subject report and the other is a UNK report
mhm
er therefore make a distinction between the two parts of the report
you mean rather then the report
no i think
mm
ah
we a we no
we agreed we agreed a on a fi
we need to shift to the procedure that we would probably have and a tell me if i'm wrong i thought there was a sort of general agreement without it being sort of firmly agreed that we were going to go for a format of subject specific reports still coming to form tutor who would complete some sort of general report is that
yes
not what we had in mind
and that general report would be in a sense a UNK report or a form tutor report or a er pupil management report whatever title
mm
it is we're gonna
mm
use
mm
so is that the context of the word report andrew er that you're using
well my feeling was that we had agreed that the parents would sent the subject reports
yeah
where they never have been sent before
yes
as well as the UNK report
oh yes
yes they would go as well i'm not
yeah
saying
alright yes
that would go as well
well i think that's certainly
and on that basis i'm not sure we need subject report in
just a report and subject in the box
perfect perfectly logical that
yeah
mm
but as a necessary
but we would still have a form tutor input i e a UNK
yeah but
some chance for the UNK in a
but yo
with records of achievement i e
but do you agree that everybody in each subject should fill in that
something like that
oh well wait till you get
round to that we UNK
really
yes oh yes i think that should
i mean it's a it's the
be UNK in the form of some sort of
giving what we're being asked to do we do need to have something that focus on general skills and abilities we've gotta decide what they are
mm
but yes i agree we need something like that
but the big problem at present is that form tutors get loads of information sent to them and then they
have to
summarise it and an awful lot of what has been done by the subjects
it's wasted
it's just wasted the form teacher
right if this is going on
just keep it
we said the last time did we not
that if this is going home then that sort of thing doesn't need to come from a form tutor other than a sa er a sort of UNK one as well if you like
aye it's the form tutor one needn't
mm
needn't be i mean once they've got all of this the form tutor one needn't be anything
the form tutor can well can build in a lot of good UNK that have been built in
the form i se
over the years
i'm
i see the form tutor one as being now we've got hold of record of achievement as being part of the UNK process of a record of achievement now our youngsters know what a personal statement is form tutors are happier with a joint statement it's taken us four years
three or four
three four years to get there but it strikes me that we can actually start moving towards that process not a full sheet of a personal
no
statement but we can start moving towards a personal statement
you can
right the way across the school so we've actually got a UNK format
and UNK everybody's involved in it all the way
and there's still no reason why in that sa er joint statement that our subject reports
no
to them needn't be a er a starting point a key for discussion between
absolutely
the child and the tutor
i mean you could have if you have basically what we're saying is that you have a whole load of subject reports and on the top of it you've got form tutor report
yes
which is
basically er a summary of
a positive comment an overall positive comment based on all
su sa
the other reports
UNK wha the same sort of thing as they're gonna get in the fifth year of the
that's right
to build up maybe you know individual statement joint statement perhaps on the sheet
but it allows
mm
in keeping with it allows that opportunity as you know
as a form tutor somebody's been on a residential weekend
mm
to include the other things that we've done so all i'm
trying to say is it's in keeping with the philosophy of records of achievement
that's right yes
their out of school activities
yeah
anything like that
but you should also be sure that the form tutor pro can clarify things for parents because although no matter how hard you try to make this erm a clear and easily understandable document it's only clear and un easily understandable to us
yes but all form tutors are gonna have to become aware of each UNK
cos they're gonna be
you know they're gonna be
they are
they're gonna be UNK them a all the
they are
time
that's right
and hopefully it's not gonna change
no and it'll make it a lot easier for the form tha these are the same format
mm
so that they can do that
quickly and easily
mhm
and make it easier for the parent to understand whether this is good or bad
ah yes it's just gotta the
well i don't think they don't
that choose
but sometimes
that change
parents have come to me and said so and so's only got a c it's appalling
i think i think that's very well laid out i think that's quite self explanatory to
er for us it is yes but
i think i think it's
oh yeah
reasonably clear for parents actually
i think one of the other points
makes sense
quite a lot of parents
quite a lot of parents
yeah okay
one of the other points about it is that it will erm er in the minds of the parents the they will see this one two three four five six seven eight nine ten er being used poor satisfactory excellent and it will get them into the idea of what these levels
mm
are
yes
and they will therefore be able providing it's used in that format
oh yeah
it will be able to interpret for them what these numbers mean in the middle bit
mm
mhm
don do you envisage the er the general skills and abilities being done by pupils or pupils and staff together or
i thought i well i don't envisage anything but i mean i would of thought that kids could fill it in pencil and then we do the same as we did before a and that the staff in some way put in their own
mhm
ca can we just look at a i don't know which way to be specific or to look at the general first can i just
a make some general comments about the i mean i like that we talked about that before i like the ten levels
yes
i think we need to UNK talk about what the general skills and abilities are
mm
i wonder about the pupil comment being divorced from the staff comment i wondered whether they one should follow the other
i would rather not have that on the subject reports but if it's going to be on i for the sake of UNK the comments should be together
mm you see i it's trying to find the balance isn't it
i i'm er ah i like to think that the youngsters have actually got some input into the report i think it's important
yes i'm not saying deny that
but at the same time i would want to afford er you as heads of departments er everybody's heads of department a little bit of UNK what i what if what wa we have to be careful about this that we set a standard but allow a little UNK because all departments are slightly different and want to approach things
mm
slightly differently and what i'm trying to say is i don't want the UNK to UNK the strength of the reporting do you know what i mean
yeah
mm
and if you don't feel that you can fit in a pupil comment you have to be very careful here because some people will take it as a UNK out and not do it and a that worries me and it has happened and i think it is important that the youngsters are actually given some guidance and the opportunity to do it
you're
yes
saying you're not in a position to do that in the moment or you wouldn't want
no
to do that
no i'm not saying that i've
have i got the wrong end of the stick
i'm not saying it like that what i'm saying is i would UNK yes i would like them to be involved in it a as far as my subject reports are concerned i would like our reports that we do we do involve the kids i pass them out we discuss them and i'll re draft but i would not rather not have their written sample on that piece
okay
i think they get fed up and i don't think that a that language wise they have the vocabulary in the school to be able to UNK out meaningful comments and you know and go right across the curriculum there i think
UNK let me finish
mm
er it's difficult for them
erm i think you should involve them but i think it'll be preferable if it was one to one with the form tutor i that time and the form tutor has taking an over view
mhm
and they were taking over view as well right
now that's what i'd prefer but in every you know the majority go against me and they want it in a as i say i would i think that it'd be better placed at the top
guidance
i prefer the pu pupil comment to be honest
you would like the pupils to make their own written comment in there
i'd also like the national curriculum levels to come straight underneath course one
yes
you see i felt
can we no ca
yes comments together
can we just come back to the pupil comment business one thing at a time for a moment
and can we try and get how people feel
the reason
about whether they want a pupil comment in
the reason i'd put pu pupil comment where it is because so far as i was concerned the top half of that i was gonna was gonna be filled in by staff it is a report
mm
that's the top part the bottom part is open to negotiation and that's why i've put them altogether at the bottom
well
mhm
don the staff comment one could come under the national curriculum levels if you
yeah you mean out
yes
outline then that
yeah
bit then staff comment
yes
can i come back to my original question which was yo
pupil comments
you want pupil comment
yes or no
paul
andrew your thoughts
yes if we didn't have pupil comment we would miss some absolute UNK like mr is a lying UNK
and you know only i couldn't live without that
what was that word
UNK
you've convinced me andrew
was that
is that
bet he then
is that but you
has it
but you do have to remember as i say
i've got one i'll give you my book later on angela
you do have to remember at the same time that these documents would be going home and
aha
there is a level of er oh
UNK
yes that when you
an UNK
yes that
and
we need to follow
oh
i would hope that if a parent saw er that er somebody had that sort of attitude towards the staff that
mm
the parent would have the opportunity of making an appropriate
mm
it's not only that but if
no it's not only that
if they if they did this i would it not give them practise at being able to do the
mm
you know the report at the end of five years
you know
UNK expressed a view
i'm saying the but not just stage
that's what all
chaps
oh er erm alan sorry
erm i'm half and half i go along with angela in the main that the kids in generally speaking the kids that i've talked to don't want to put their own input a lot of them don't want to because as angela says they cannot find the appropriate words and some of the others just write some stuff that i would look at
and say i'm you know i'm not very happy having that written on this
i've had
but it's
science this year
but with all due respect is some of that not to do with the guidance their receiving from us as teachers
certainly i i've told you
absolutely
i have spent
but
a great deal of effort and time in enabling the children to write something meaningful
i i've let it in
sure
you know im improve their english language
sure
okay paul
surely we've working
from er statement banks for pupils for quite a long time and why
can we
can't we why can't we be picking out UNK guidance as far everything
alright i
should be
i don't have to look if i can just
it's all UNK to say that
i don't have to look
it's all what
UNK you know
UNK
oh yes i feel oh stop
i don't have to look too far back in there when we started this whole process four or five years of throwing it all up in the air to say that i felt every pupil could comment in some way something that they had enjoyed something they felt they'd been successful at something they felt they found difficult something that had pleased them surely every child could comment on wo if it's just one of those things
wha
but i it has then
and that's on every subject that's the what UNK the point
no
UNK making
yes
i think
it be it becomes UNK
they get a
yeah
bit sick of this
yeah
you know
yo your
it becomes UNK they say i like this it was good
yes i
and things like that
but is that not part of our job to get them to think and
yes absolutely i agree with you
obviously i agree with you that we should be putting the kids in challenging situations where that they've gotta rise to the occasion and use language in an effective way but i don't know whether this is the best way these er you know a series of how much space of you got
whereas if they were involved in the end where they sat with the form teacher
mhm
read the lot i mean look what they doing language wise they're reading they're evaluating they're UNK i mean the that they're doing quite complicated things there and also hopefully there will be enough space where they have the opportunity to put something that is meaningful and they're involved in the dialogue with the form
right
teacher
paul
i for pupil comment you could ea quite easily have a joint statement there or a joint comment whereby the
or just statement
there's no
or just
real reason why
comments
once a year that er a subject teacher and a pupil cannot sit down an and come up with a
could
i take sometime
could we get round with that
could we get round that by instead of saying staff comment and pupil comment make the space
join them
slightly larger and just say
just say
statement
just say comment actually
comment
comments
mm
comments
that's what
but i have to put back to you that the onus then falls on you and UNK of departments to ensure that space is used properly
oh it will be
okay
yes that will
and i have to say my experience it leaves me to doubt i know i'm a UNK sometimes that the space will not be used effectively and
well
because people get under pressure and it's oh christ i ain't got time so i won't bother
i'm sorry
well that's
if that's very cynical
and i know it's unfair in some context
it is
mm
unfair
erm i think that is unfair
we
rod yes i agree with don i think if you look at er what the work has gone in er in the fifth year for the last two or three years and the way that subject teachers are now approaching ranks of achievement i don't see yes it's
it's not a process wi that's not a valid comparison in the sense that in
no
fifth in fifth year and year eleven it's a different ball game altogether
but why shouldn't staff put the same process into operation lower down the school
i think UNK i think because some don't actually transfer the skill if i might say that
yes but i mean in some cases i've gotta say in some cases it is inappropriate to make a lot of comments with
mhm
a lot of pupils you are giving a lot of information
mm
here and here on the pupil
mm
in some cases it may be appropriate but if you're forcing people to make comments just because there's a space to do it
mm
then it loses a lot of it's values yes
right
but can't we think about re UNK that so we get this idea of this joint statement some sort of dialogue on
okay
on there
co more comments then
right
i think that's a point to pick up on actually
mm i
andrew
on this
i'm never one for making work but on an a on although this isn't going to be called an annual report for most children it will be an annual event and i do feel quite strongly that for the child to be able to have the opportunity
mhm
of doing this and the opportunity is one where they are told to do and they will not miss the opportunity
well they're gonna
is
be told to do that when they're doing this bit aren't they
mm
when they're going to look
mm
at this bit and tick these boxes
yes but UNK boxes and expressing themselves in other
yeah but
ways the ways perhaps that are not
UNK
erm you know the what they wish to express is not available on the
mm
UNK boxes erm
that sho should be there
i know that our children by UNK er their vocabulary doesn't extend to erm what er UNK words which might really sum up for an adult what they've been going through how they've enjoyed it but what is the terrible form we had last year in seventh year was it seven g
yeah
erm george and i had that class shared between us he took them for an hour a week and i did and i if there is a class that any of us had ever taken that would be unlikely to be able to write something meaningful of this kind
mhm
that would be the class and yet they all did cos george and i insisted
but we helped them by suggesting
mm
words and er they didn't lose it they went along with it and they actually some came
yeah
up with some quite good descriptive language with some UNK terminology which we guided them with but we didn't put the words in their mouths
mm
each one came out as a very UNK and UNK comment which reflected that child
mm
some of them very negative and how much they hated doing what they'd been made to do er and others very surprisingly made it known that they had thoroughly enjoyed it
erm but the they were totally honest they didn't feel
mm
made to do anything else
but
i would not have known that children who said they enjoyed it were enjoying it
mm
cos they behaved so badly
mm
and i hadn't enjoyed it
maybe that's why they enjoyed it andrew
mm
perhaps it was in fact one or two of them said you know we like UNK the
UNK out of mr
i think you've also gotta look at it from the UNK point of view and perhaps i'm wrong here but you know when you think i mean the these are going to be done very you know er i we got a sort of time limit and kids are going to be told during perhaps a two week period
mm
right science right come on then let's get down to this
then they'll now go into a maths lesson let's go into this they're gonna perhaps do that eight times then they're gonna get a UNK then a few days time after that the form teacher's saying right let's do it again and summarise it i think it's too much
right well i part of me says the there are two aspects the other side of the coin a little bit if we talk about recording achievement and not recording failure we here have an opportunity to point out to youngsters encourage youngsters in that they are all capable of achieving in some way and to get them to write down that they have achieved that's the other side of the coin
i know it happens in individual subjects and there's the element of repetition but you are at the same time making them reflect over a certain period and say i have not entirely wasted my time there maybe some youngsters for whom it will be extremely difficult and i except that but my thinking is that is you look hard enough you can find something that everybody has done at whatever level that they can take some pride in
aha and they can do that in the summary
i agree with you but they can achieve that in a different form if that's your purpose it doesn't need to be achieved like this
yes
there is no reason why the teacher and the pupil shouldn't be discussing this bit of it
you're going to give them more of a ri a more of a resource bank if you like right to pu UNK these er these comments from
how will we class
if they take an
if
over view
right if we don't do it that way how will we pass that information which a as i understand it you want passed to the form tutor
well it's go it's all going to be there in the reports and surely the kids are going to able to form everything
no it won't be on if we use this as the document
reports
for science
no i don't mm yeah
we're immediately saying now well we need another sheet of paper because the information
no
that we're talking about
no do that right
that's the only thing that's gonna be off okay
and then we as the form teacher sits why can't the kids look at the reports as well
but will the form teacher be able to do as you would do in english and say but look when you did that written piece on so and so it was UNK the form teacher will not have that detailed knowledge that you will have
we'll give the kids some UNK you know what have you enjoyed
what have UNK
angela i would have thought
er and involve that in part of the programme you know where they're where they're involved in the whole report and assessment
for si for the six subjects
angela
form teacher wouldn't have time to do that
no you do i'm not making myself clear
that's why it should be done in the
no
no what i'm suggesting is
lesson
that the kids erm as an alternative the kids could get some help on how to look at all the reports and extract a couple of positive statements that's what the emphasis should be not that he's a UNK
right
no nothing on that sort of line but you
i think you're taking one example there actually angela
i think you're UNK
a
me
a take a couple
yes i am
positive statements right and they need a little bit of help on how to do that and then make some sort of UNK positive comment about themselves that's what i mean
mm
so
or if that if you disagree with that well put pupil comment there UNK or whatever upon but lead that on give them a bit of a leader into it
mhm
can i summarise
go on then
we're getting nowhere fast
well i ca
i mean can we
i think we are
could i could i make a suggestion
no that's important
could i make a suggestion
taking into account everything everybody said the UNK as it is course outline after course outline goes your individual bit right
subject but national curriculum levels on this one
yeah
sta staff comment comes out of there and that bit goes up then you have general skills and abilities and then below that you have a wider box which just says comments which will include a staff comment and may include a pupil comment as well cos because it's signed by both at the bottom
can i just check what you were saying there
so take the staff comment from there and instead of putting staff down put a UNK comment on this
just put instead of having staff comment and pupil comment you got one box comment
double the size of the box
comments
down there
comments
so that
that would
that comes out
instead of being there
can i have a word please
mm
it's down there
paul
i'd like i think as it is at the moment is erm is superb
and i think instead of pupil comment it should be some sort of joint say
but i think that's perfectly adequate
and i think kids should be encouraged to erm think about themselves rather than just tick boxes and i think er a group of sentences down here written by the form teacher by the subject teacher and the pupil erm as it's been done for about for a few years a good habit to get the kids into erm especially as a record of achievement should start from year seven
mm
can i just ask then if you're saying to be it should be a joint statement but you
mm
think that UNK alright is that not a contradiction because if it's a joint statement and this UNK alright you've got staff comment divorced from pupil comment
i want the staff comment and i want the a joint statement at the at the bottom
but i want your opinion i mean the sa the staff comment is going to be
well you do exactly
repetition
you do exactly the same on the erm on the record of achievement don't you
you've got a staff comment and then you have er a pupil comment which is really
well
written in as a
no
joint sort of
no you have a pupil statement personal
in the
statement
in the sa in the form in the form when the form teacher does it
you have a personal statement then the joint statement
you don't have a staff comment and a joint statement
but the staff comment is in the statement
i in the subject specific
mm
right
so you wo you would like to have it in a format similar to the very final
yes
thing that they're aiming at so
yeah
they get used to the format
mm
that's sounds very reasonable but i er i ha not having been at the level form tutor
mm
but er you know
yeah i think
for some years i've never done one of those
i take what paul's saying i think
i'm not really with it
i think there's a scale element cos we're talking one sheet here and it's a it's a much bigger exercise
okay right
but i agree what you're saying it's very valid
guidance then paul
can yeah can we can we vote on whether we're going to improve pupil comment
and then when that's decided let's decide
well let's
upon the format
get dead clear about what it is we're go actually gonna vote on
right
because it's we've gone a bi
on the
a bit round the houses
either in principle
am i right in saying then i is the first thing we need to agree on whether we're gonna have a staff comment and a pupil comment on there is tha is that the first decision
i think everybody's in agreement about staff aren't they
there's no question about staff comment on there
no
right fine
right
er what do you mean there's no question
everybody accepts there should be a staff comment on
er okay
and it's sold
fair enough well that's the point i was making
the in order to get by pupils writing these er rather UNK things that they write on the
mm
bottom of these reports why can't you make it into a pu er a joint teacher pupil comment it isn't just a it isn't in the same form it's just the same that the pupil writes that with guidance
with teacher guidance sitting next to the teacher
i think we're losing track of what this actually is paul there are you're trying to do two things at once what you're trying to do i think is use it as a learning process for children but this is an annual report for parents and i think that part of it a at least surely must be a report by the sa member of staff by the department on how the child has done by the member staff
by all means give the give the kid a chance to put his side of the story if you like but there must be er
well we've got all that there haven't we
right
yep
yeah
i know
the form that we have currently the er sta statements are they called at the moment
yeah
erm i know that the way that i do it every time
it looks rather like a is what we use
is that the one you want as a form tutor
er it's subject
oh
then i haven't got a front have i
that
er
one
yes it is there
yeah
er the comment here the way that i have been used to doing these i found that i like it and the kids can
you write yours
and they write theirs
i invariably do write something
mm
so do i
and the kid invariably writes something down
well that's what i suggested ten minutes ago
and i like that form
yes
whilst you've suggested everybody else has a right to their opinion and doesn't make yours the solution
and i think having as a separate issue the staff comment as a
a separate box er you know er is not necessarily appropriate
sometimes if the child writes in there first i say i concur with what so and so has said well done or something like that
would
sometimes the child isn't really very good at writing and i will write something encouraging and the kid says i have liked my art well yeah
can i can i
that's all they can do
can i then put to you
in fairness
i think what UNK saying is
it's got differentiation though
that we have a comment area
testing
that we have a differentiation he said UNK
differentiation
we have a
differentiation
comment area when we these go out there would be guidance which would say their staff must make their comment in that space
yeah
how the other part of space is used could be left to individual departments on the basis that
of discretion
discretion or it is hoped that pupils would be afforded the opportunity to make their own if
involved in the process
you wish so they must certainly be involved in the process
yes
or it could be an agreed joint statement and written by the member of staff
whichever way you are
oh yeah
so it allows
so what does that mean
what you're saying is
basic comment
yo you're gonna put comment
we will put
no then
comment
call that statement then
it's gotta have something before it though
it's qui comments
well
comments by who
well
comments and statement
well if you put comments and
mm
a me a member of staff writes the comment and signs it it's obvious who
has written the comment i e the member of staff has written it you could then have something underneath if you wish to that is the UNK that will be obviously the UNK from the different writing or the style of the writing er or you could open it up with we have agreed if you wish to one make it a joint
aha
statement
aha
and we would put that down as basic guidance to staff when
completing reports
yes
yes yeah
in other words it leaves the format open to the department concerned
let the cat in alan
but
would you and i'll get the food i'm a bloody expert cats
and that's sorry and they acted immediately there
terry thoughts
i mean we've not sort of included you
no i've i mean i know that in the primary schools nowadays they do allow or do let the UNK the children actually write their own reports as well
mm
cos they're actually coming up from
this year
mm
i mean they
it's the records of achievement
so they're doing it from the age of possibly eight or nine some people certainly down right the way through
mm
the bottom of the school
i've
but i still agree with
it's young to be doing it
what somebody said that the sometimes the UNK comments are kind of as andrew pointed out earlier that er
yes
it's not the sort of things that
but
you wanna see on a on a
yeah
on a report on a
but i mean
but with guidance
yeah
you see i
that's right
i agree with what you're saying but when i've done it before and involved the pupil in such a report i put it on a separate sheet so that
yes
there's been
yeah well that's what the primary school's done
ma this is prior to all this you see
yes
yes
and we had all this we've got
ha i have to go along here some to some of you with a UNK statement of you know this inclusive as opposed
yeah
to exclusive bit
mm
mm
and it allows the UNK it UNK the opportunity to be inclusive and i think that's important
well a po what about the reverse
sorry
put it on the reverse of the sheet
we then get into all sorts of photocopying
production problems i mean this is why i was asking did you want another piece of paper
i know it's a bit penny UNK
mm
oh
but erm because
mm
that's very
but rod i UNK i think it is also is good preparation for year eleven
mm
oh yes
that's a
they should be thinking about it right from the word go
oh absolutely
yeah
absolutely
as long it is joint i mean there's no way that yo that you could have something sent home to parents
right
with a UNK comment maths is crap
you know yeah
you know you would tear it up wouldn't you
ye well i would yes
yes
but so and lo on the other hand though i'd
but i go on sorry paul
a lot of the statements these kids make are quite reasonable well written comments
yes
mm
so wha what UNK done and what other people have done have UNK picked out a few great examples but i would say that erm the majority are quite reasonable comments if perhaps a little bit simple at times i don't know
does seem
andrew
i would i would tend to say the majority aren't interested in their in their own comments
erm well
but
that UNK a lot of sorry rod
a lot of that depends on the on the staff input
mhm
mhm
and how they UNK
in school
the kids as andrew has pointed out that as he and george operate
last comment from andrew and then we move on cos we've got a an agreement in what we're gonna put in we haven't got an agreement as to where we're gonna put it but andrew comment
well i'm prepared to say th that i that i think that we do good practice in that we do sit down with the children and help them each individual along with the with our joint statements
never the less it is the child speaking we don't put the words into their mouths and as such when they speak and when they write it down it's one of the possibly one of the few chances of having primary evidence of how the child is at er writing er on an official document
mm
er progressing through the years i doubt whether samples of the child's work are kept officially in any other form or anywhere else
they are
their handwriting and so on
they are
maybe they are in english but
mm
but not an official document as opposed to a subject i mean i keep all their pictures you know that
mm
they do
but it's a central
a central
mm
easily accessible
yeah that's fair enough
by anybody form so here we have each year six examples of the child's writing and thought processes and opinions at least well i said six because i ca don't really know how many subjects a child will be taking or writing for
mm
but it is primary evidence and i think as primary evidence it has an extra value to the child's records and to the school's records over and beyond what
mm
we have ever had or thought about practically
on the other hand each time they get a report they're going to have ten pieces or their work on each report
right
which i'd never have thought
tha that is what i isn't that what i just said
yeah
mm
and then they're gonna have an eleventh one when they when they do it with the form tutor
the form tutor and
are they going to do with the form teacher
yes once a year
tutor as well
mm
well once a year but they never
yeah
have to be a little parcel won't it
because we need to go through that
an example
UNK joint statement process
can we run through
this again then so we
right
can decide
let's come back to it then so we've agreed a basic heading although we need to play with that a bit name year tick indicates end of end of key stage
ooh mm
no i'm not too sure about that
we well
yeah tha that that's just
let's just leave it for the moment let's just leave it for the moment
course outline i think we're all agreed should be at the top er that is important we've now agreed a heading and comment we've got a e enough agreement that says that it will be just called comment but guidelines will need to be produced to go to staff erm
rod is that national curriculum levels or is that staff comment after course outline just there
well that's what i want to get from you now if i can
oh sorry
carry on
we've agreed comment where would the comment be placed given that i think we all agree we want national curriculum area in we need a general skills and abilities in where would the comment be situated at the bottom underneath everything between the two or what
a at the end of the main staff input
yes
so that should go there
so are you saying
with the suggestion
so as it sits now between national curriculum
no i'm asking you there but i'm asking you when's the me end of the main staff input
that's there isn't it because that's
mm
supposed to be a joint activity there
mhm
so i would suggest that it would go there
so i would
between national curriculum levels and general skills and abilities as it sits at the moment
yes
mhm
course outline national curriculum levels staff comment
erm i would differ er with that opinion because i would say that the comment as a joint comment would erm have to deal with the general skills and abilities
mm oh yeah
which the child er erm generally speaking does with they're getting teacher guidance
so the comment joint statement
which refers to what
will be about everything not just the top bit but would include comment of the whole
for that
right i i'm sorry i didn't understand i thought that you
that's okay
that was gonna be a se separate
no
staff
no
if it's a joint comment yes it should go at the end
so com wi th but we've agreed i'm sorry if i'm being UNK and boring and the rest of it but comment there would be a staff comment how you use the rest of the space assume there's a double space is now left with you given the guidelines are issued
well we're gonna say staff comment are we
are we
no it would just be comments
yes
yeah
and the first part of it that would be staff comments
the first part of it must be a staff comment
right
and
and
it will be double the size
well it won't be double the
it'll be
size it'll be
it'll be staff
yes
comment plus pupil comment
will it
so it'll be like
yeah
that
we will just put it as a space
one big block
so it'll be left up to the
a space with
individual
that's right
it'll be as a space
okay
so
and is this are the i know this again
just minor but if the staff produces a comment are they going to sign that and also sign the bottom or are we just gonna leave it that the parent will be able say
i think it's pretty obvious who's written what
that's what i'm saying
well is it
i say ro rod there's gonna be
yeah
sorry there's gonna be some people who don't even ha have no pupil comment on at all then
they have no pupil input
course they will
it will have
well no
pupil input on that bit
there's gotta be a pupil input there's no way you can do this
why do you say that
i'm just er interested that's all
so the
no the they'll be a pupil input it might well be that as a department there's a decision that the pupil would not write
yeah
on the report
right okay
but it does you are not UNK from allowing a UNK to write on a report
i'm er being a little naughty and trying to steer a middle road if you like
in other words it could be correct me if i'm wrong
i what i don't if andrew obviously feels he's got a strong process that suits him and i don't want to knock that on the head
alan i'm sorry if i'm sort of trying to put you at the end and continue and i don't intend it like that
i don't mind i just know
alan
exactly where i stand on this
well alan sort of has a feeling that he doesn't want that to happen and i want to fi i what i don't like i mean i go personally i go with andrew's feeling but i don't want so i don't want to exclude that again
mm
i want i want if
i want to do both
to afford the opportunity
i
at the same time there are people who sit in the middle ground
mm
and i think it's perhaps important to start with that we go with something that's a little bit open ended that we can review in a years time er perhaps a little bit later and say well look we have shown that we can do it UNK er the proof is in the pudding it now UNK everybody to do it this way
yes
is that is that reasonable
yeah
agreed
yeah
right
grand
er well i don't want you to feel that er maths department
no i'm not saying
don't want
no
pupils involved because every piece of work that a kid does is discussed with the pupil the only thing that i was a little wary about was a pupil actually putting down mr is
right
a so and so er maths is crap and so on and you know that's going to make this into something that we wouldn't want
right i i'm
anyone to go you know to see
i do UNK i wasn't trying to put you as the bad boy on that end of the continual i wasn't alan i'm
no
we could be here for about
he's a bad boy
so we're saying that there will be a staff comment then there maybe nothing else or there maybe a pupil comment or there maybe a joint statement
mm
that's right
that's right
so that's every system incorporated
staff comment followed by one
it's very vague though innit
no
well it's not
so we'll leave it and down three UNK possible
mm
and that's going at the bottom we're saying there right
mhm
right at the bottom
yep
yeah
so that bit that goes there and that bit goes UNK put that back in again that's right
yeah
bottom it's gonna be called comment
mhm
mhm
are you gonna issue guidelines or just leave it
yep
no there will be guidelines and you're in the know anyway so you'd be telling at your curriculum area meetings you'd be saying
UNK
as opposed to
UNK
ca oh
but you're not going to
ca UNK
UNK
UNK
but you're not going
you're no not the sweat pouring off my UNK
no but you're not going to you're just gonna leave it open
yeah for the reasons that i've said to
you're going to
we can evaluate it later on a
okay
without you know having to
well it's not that open because we're saying there must be some staff something written by staff
yeah
or are we not
oh yes we are aren't we
yes
staff have to write their comments
ah
something
there is then an option after that
and involve the child
as to whether it's a joint
and involve them they must be involved mustn't they
i i'm sorry i just take that as automatic i don't even think about it any more
i think you should write that down okay that means pupils
well
must be involved in some form
i do and i don't that's your job is can i be naughty it's your job as UNK to insist that that's happening
so you would advise rod that you would
i no it's go er youngsters are involved in it i mean that's just my assumption it's our rationale well it
at the moment
i don't know where the rationale is but it's written
i'm
that's it's everybody's responsibility
point the finger paul come on
yes
i'm not into that angela i couldn't do that
i can't honestly
why
they are meant to do it and don't do it they should be told to do it
mm
by
exactly
mm
yes but there is still the thought that a me i'm sorry
a member of staff may feel that they want to say something about a kid and it does not necessarily have to agree with what the kid
here
that's right
you know i mean i might be saying jimmy has wasted his time this year
oh yeah
then he will have under me have to say jimmy does not agree with this
yes
he feels and so on but there has got to be something that is obvious staff comment
er
yes absolutely
well yes i put down comments like that
and that is that would be exactly the right way to do it
that the kids don't agree with
you say jimmy
i think it's this
the i sa i put my reasons forward
because jimmy could then sign that
and they're still involved aren't they
aye
UNK involvement
mhm
isn't it
yeah i'm
i mean the number of times alan i've read quite a few
got your facts right
i've come across we agree er or jimmy feels now once somebody writes jimmy feels it's almost UNK that is that the word i want
that there is da yeah it's a word there is disagreement
i might be to you but it's this is going to a parent
yes
i i'd agree with alan i'd
yeah that's right
i don't see that pu that the staff comment which is gonna be the first thing need have anything to do with the child at all there is ample place
oh
if you think
within
shoot that man
jesus christ
well in the sense that they've been involved in it
no
no but the
i don't they need to be involved in it whatsoever
they've read what you've said and then say well i don't agree with that and you can write down that
absolutely
a staff comment is
but surely that is involvement i'm not understanding what you're putting forward
no i think
no
it's the way the words have been used that we're interpreting wrong
if i've got to write a comment for a start
what sort of UNK word then
then i want to write a comment i will not necessarily involve the child with
no
what i'm writing he will
er
then see that or he will have
mm
already seen it because he will be involved in that bit
aha
yep
mm
well
but if she does see it
well if she does see it yes
yes she
subtle ah
alright
if she does see it and UNK with it
that's involvement isn't it
mm
yes
mhm
we're agreed then
okay
might not agree with this
i think we've i think we've covered that
right
i think we've UNK that one haven't we
well i think so
well there you are
i mean i don't know how you
it's hard work this isn't it
i need some tea
anyone need a cup of tea
i think
on the
it's only half past two
we've only been here three quarters of an hour
well we've got ten pages to do we're only half way through the first page man
no we haven't no we haven't we we're okay because
that have been there for years haven't they
but it does need UNK unless we get some sort of consensus and it UNK you to say look this is
it's my belief but there are UNK i mean it does UNK you to present
yes
what other departments feel to your to your people because wha you do have to be careful about the UNK this is what i believe so it's right we've gotta we do have to strike a balance
i mean i've got my own thoughts i have to be careful here that you know i've got to try and pull together what you think because at the end of the day it's very important that it reflects the way we work in school not the way i perceive i we work in school because you're the people at the chalk first
i think a that there's another point that we should all remember and that is that it shouldn't just be our opinion either we are sort of told from high certain things
by who
that we have to do in a certain way in a certain format and certain things have got to be included and we've got to take that in hand as well
but we've done that in the brief that we've worked on
yeah oh no i know i know i know
we've already got past
yeah
that stage
yeah alright
fair enough
i think haven't we
but after what she said
sorry i'm being defensive sorry
mm
right so we got staff comment it will either be a pupil er statement written by the member of staff or written by the pupil themselves or a joint statement they were the three
or no on both
on all three
i it will be staff
did we alter it
yeah
it could be staff alone it could be staff and pupil it could be staff and joint
okay
the only thing it can't be just
but they're going to be
no comment
see
right we will make move progress
thank you for that er it's not it's not easy ground and i do appreciate with which it's happening and the lack of UNK that is occurring
ha
ha
ha
see this bit here this the whole presentation this part of it here
mhm
which has got to be this
is that the next bit
the national curriculum
which we
cor
we're going onto to know
i assume that's where we're going onto now
yeah
okay
er
we've then got two areas to look at national UNK levels and general skills and abilities
can i assume that we sort of are happy with the format that there should be a national curriculum level and there should be a general skills and abilities
i can make that assumption
yes
yes
okay
we UNK we cannot disagree about this next little bit can we
right the national curriculum levels i am nearly o of the opinion to be almost UNK and say there will be a space that is about a third of a sheet of a four it's down to every department to do their own i nearly said i don't care i often do care
but that's down to the professional expertise of dis departments
mm
is it or isn't it
no it's all
no they're all exactly the same
i mean there are four UNK targets there are three UNK targets
that's right
yeah
they are these and tha
you're obliged
it's just the number of boxes that you're gonna change
is everybody happy with that layout for that
yes
yeah
UNK
mm
mm
nearly
go on andrew
god
we nearly go agreements
no it's important
what time does this
erm
session end by the way
half three
i dunno i is there no tea there
half three
it's called
we'll have a
cup of tea
hang on angela
half past three today
there's an awful lot of information that i've put in there which i've UNK and much reduced from the official documents
mm
which gives a great deal more information about the UNK targets than the er two or three words
but ha they have got headings though haven't they
yeah they have
i could have put the headings on as you have
mhm
and
to take the whole bloody lot out
ha
right
oh pages
you absolutely we'd go on forever and ever and ever and er therefore i withdraw all of that stuff but in a way i feel that it would be helpful for parents probably who haven't seen this information and might like maybe a sample
you mean you would like to present it in a different way
some somewhere yeah maybe not on here
mm
not on each subject but maybe on the inside cover of er a presented re er set of sheets but wha you know however it's gonna be sent or on the back of the UNK sheet or something
you know for your information the UNK targets have quite lengthy descriptions here are one or two examples here's a maths one here's an english one here's a
mm
a science one for instance because i don't suppose many of the parents will have seen o all the UNK of the document will
no
they
they they've only had the UNK because i sent home the erm a map of d o s d e s whatever i'm supposed to call it now
d s e
d s e
d s e
d s e
i sent home the that document in with the national UNK er report
which
s
i've now lost
so in other words some suggestion that these headings
are indicated more
have a lot more yes
mm
indicator of quite a rich scene and that the
that's a nice image
yeah thank you
anyway
but you're in great danger there because you'll
you will UNK it will come like this
yeah
and a parent will say level four maths
no multiplication tables find and average and know how to work out an area that's a UNK
you know i mean there's an example of what they're saying
i think
level four this is what you do in maths
but that's only one bit of it isn't it
you know and that is a little piece of maths and tha i mean that is absolute rubbish
it's only a very small part of level four
because they they've UNK it and just put in a few little bits and pieces
mm
so you're against that because you think it UNK it
you cannot you cannot give them the national curriculum book
i think there's an element paul comment
i think we could all do what andrew's suggesting quite easily er i could do it for geography erm i just think it's making a lot of extra work
UNK
yeah
mo more than it needs
yeah
can i just say then we seem to have agreed that standard andrew points been taken on board and dismissed out of hand
no i'm not cos i think it's quite a valid
no i'm being
point he's making
i'm being mhm
erm
don
it's whether we've
i know you carry a lot of valuable stuff in your UNK
can i borrow your UNK
mm
thank you
ca can i make a point about the tick now
mm
since we're at that point
i put that UNK i he's put down UNK fro from what we will we are obliged to do we're obliged to say that these levels ha er have been erm have not been checked by sats
mhm
if they have been
mm
but i thought to th this way it was
mhm
you know we we're obliged to put that little bit in you know there's year seven year eight year ten the there won't be a tick in there and so the these levels will be whatever you've decided they are in the way that you UNK but at the end of the key stage this report will go out in UNK i in september now following sats
mm
or it'll go out in july god knows how we're gonna do it after sats in er a ye at year fourteen
so we've got to have that statement in and we've got to differentiate it some way or from the
but if you had your name and year at the top you could actually put a simple statement along the bottom because you'll only be issuing it for year nine
and eleven
well will you because year eleven is automatically confirmed by levels
g c s e
at g c g c s e
but it is end of key stage four
but we will have a record of achievement this system will not be used for years
mm
year eleven will it
so we wouldn't need it so all i'm saying is you could put in one simple statement at the bottom year nine de UNK de UNK de UNK and will confirmed by sats external test
this will not be used at er end of key stage four or something
well you use this reporting system in year ten but year eleven
we'll have record of achievement
you'll have a record of achievement and UNK this yo you'll have your own format your amended format
but aren't we obliged to produce this erm in
september
september
mm
of the
yeah
following year yeah
end of that key stage four
yes but it will be it will be this bit of it that you know the bit that comes
right
from the from the boards that we'll get cos there'll be thousands and thousands of bloody numbers
oh
that you're gonna send out to parents they're gonna look at all these numbers and oh
the end of key stage form
can be different format
mm
that
mm
the bits of that tie into
let's wait to wait till
yeah wait
the thing arrives before we
mhm
so what i'm saying is this will appropriate for year seven eight nine and ten
we're obliged to
and a
say sorry
go on
right
don
we're obliged
what's that
to say that if er it is not a sat year we are obliged to say these levels have not been confirmed by sats so the only in year nine we don't need to say that
but i think i it also would highlight if you put it as a sentence
right fair enough
that
rather we kept it in
for year seven eight parents it is coming if you like that at the end of year nine it's the end of the key stage and it's an important time de UNK da they're warned for two UNK years
i know it seems a little bit i UNK don't know what the word is i want but it is for warning
that what's happening that the end of ninth year is an important time in terms of er measuring er their pupils er relative success
so i'm suggesting that we could take that box out er and this be re UNK as a sentence either at the top
so
or underneath i don't mind which
okay
how about this then these levels have not been confirmed by sats except in the year nine report
well
i don't think you need the first
no i don't
part in
no
it's negative
well UNK individual levels will be confirmed by external tests
for year nine pupils these levels will
be confirmed by
when do they get the results for sats
sats
don
mm
when do they get the results for sats
july
so
you mark them yourself
right okay
send a report in don't you
cos we've gotta report on year nine at the en in before
mm
september or sorry in july or
mm
immediately we come back which is something else we have to sort out with our heads now
the end of august i think it is in which means then in july doesn't it
mm
for year so the sentence will be don for year nine pupils er these levels er what did you put
have been confirmed by sa
will have been future perfect
and yo and you wouldn't be indicating that that's end of key stage three
you didn't put it there
well for you know the these levels will have been confirmed by external tests
what about year nine
it goes year nine pupil
i think you've gotta put sats in sorry
the levels of year nine
alright external test bracket sats
right
you're an awkward bugger you
that's another technical term
yo you didn't put will have been confirmed in there but you want it in there now and then you put sats bracket external test UNK i can't even say it and now you wanna put external test bracket sats
he's tired
he's gorgeous
there's another technical term
right so we don't want that one we want this one
have been confirmed by sats
they've been confirmed
been confirmed by sats
okay
would you not be indicating end of key stage three somehow
or do the does everybody
alright for year nine pupils brackets end of key stage three
yeah
okay
it's important these categories are set
set out for us
mm
so
er
so we don't want this box any more then
so
what about this then
this box
yes
can disappear
that box will go and you'll have name and year
that's home
spread out more across
no i've put report down there
i've put report down there cos then you have science report UNK report and i put UNK gardener community high school cos then i need space for community
i would put UNK gardener community high school report on the heading i would put name year and your subject there or subject whatever i would UNK that up
right
a bit
mm
i think that
the UNK will be thinner
needs to stand it's awful
mm
UNK gardener high school community high school
it's a
needs to be in my opinion on it's own above the rest
report
mm
andrew's a little bit better on layout than me and i'm
what yo you want UNK gardener high UNK community high school by itself
i bi i just thought it was
where do you want report then
well UNK
gardener community high school UNK report
have i got space you see
will that not go on
community school
the top
don't see why not
i'm going back a step but i think it's
what do you mean
important
you're gonna tr er well no nothing else will fit in that page but no UNK not the package that you use
UNK gardener community high
school report
well we won't necessarily be using your package for doing this
mhm
fine
right you use yours cos i'm not there
who whose gonna do it then
well
i vote you
i'm i was gonna come to andrew's made an offer but
volunteered a long
right
time ago
that might er erm it's we can be your system what i'm saying is
is it yours
don't even know where it is
oh terry you mean
oh no just
that's alright
sitting outside the kitchen
ah
those two
a yes or a no
it's tonight's supper
does UNK gardener community high school UNK report is the heading at the top
mm
yes
mhm
okay
then below it you would have da year and somehow the subject fitted in on a line across below it
so you'd have
what for
name year and subject would go in there in that box
that's been left free
do we agree that it should be big like that
i think it i like the
yeah
idea of it
yeah
the su the subject
yes
stands out
yeah that's right
er do you want the subject er UNK the size as that
this was andrew's
no i would like
i'll sort that out
yeah
i like it like this
i think probably we'll be in a situation where andrew will do a knock up
well i think we need it smaller
there will be several UNK that we can agree on at a later date
nice and big
wallpaper paul
yep
lovely UNK
thank you very much we've knocked that on the head
general skills and abilities we're down to now
which is gonna be a UNK one i would of thought
can we agree er the layout
ten point scale
yeah
poor satisfactory and
excellent scale and ability what we need to agree on is the skills and abilities that we want in there
would you use excellent rather than good
well no ten level ten is bloody good
excellent yeah
okay right bloody good then okay
right bloody good
and can we have crap instead of poor
yeah
crap and bloody good yes and er UNK
why do you always have poor
weak
i want to convey that meaning but i would rather not use that word
it is poor
yes i know but we're sensitive
i've seen some words we
not me
i would really call spade
on the ten point scale alan
a spade
wha what's written
is there not something not poor something written ha not w
working towards
you can't be working towards there
no the i tell you what andrew's saying about poor
weak doesn't fit in
no
doesn't fit in how do you mean
doesn't fit in with satisfactory and excellent
mm no
no it's gotta be poor
aye
now hang on
pathetic
crap
shit
the boy is shit
altogether mm
un unsatisfactory instead of poor
oh
oh
another word instead of satisfactory
safe
oh
aye we're going back to
the norm
making fair progress now aren't we
yes that's right yes
he's making fair progress
one in two one in two
there's in somewhere
i'd like to think of something
let's think of something
hey come on let's cause one level one and two are national curriculum scales for somebody in our school is poor
there's no value in it don't start it off in that position as though there's an integral in it all the
UNK dictionary of
all the same
life's a little bit more complex than that
is it longmans
is that a UNK one
that's merely an over view
yes it's longmans
is that a longmans dictionary
it certainly is
that i see before me
could i call for
UNK a plan for doing harm
can we leave that word alone for a moment cos i think it's a bit of red herring er to some degree
pretty awful
it will stand unless er somebody can come forward with a very positive suggestion the UNK
blank at the moment
how about pretty awful and pretty
can
can we look at the skills and abilities
yes sir
cos you know this list is as good or as bad you want to make it
erm effort we have that in probably
yes
everybody accept
mhm
effort
there yeah
mhm
angela
yep that's fine mm
yeah
er we don't have concentration at the moment erm i'm not sure
question mark
does that fit
yes i'm not sure about that
what we mean by concentration er myself
mm
actually
ju
i made them up just in the UNK of the moment
well that's fine
mm
that's no sweat
sorry i haven't
behaviour
it up
yep
yeah
mhm
yes
er
i wrote following instructions because i wanted to somehow or other UNK the ability to actually er do something other than just er to do something on their own you know to actually work on their own
ability to actually do something rather than just copy something to follow instructions means they've got to actually do a UNK step wise thing
right
yeah we i must admit would a would a parent i mean i was at a very simple level following instructions go and get that ruler jimmy
aha
in other words you know i in a sense UNK
do doing as doing as
UNK
they're told
yes
yes
mm
doing as they're told
mm
yeah
i know what you're saying and it's different to the way i'm interpreting it
that's it we need to follow a set of step lies instructions becoming more difficult as you go on that what was intended
but you don't want to give the impression that our children are not
that's the old one
mm
yes active right okay
involvement
it must be there cos it's
involvement
underneath that UNK
alright
dictionary look
right
what about what do you want paul sorry
sorry can i some of the old can have some
oh they're there yeah
yeah i'm
what about a word like involvement
the other thing don is what are the gen what are the erm skills and abilities you see there is a mathematical theme what are the literacy we're supposed
yeah we've got yeah that
to be addressing those
yeah that's got to go in there i think
have you got to say mathematical skills
no
no
no
i can't remember what that one is
i don't think
aye not subject
i think i think
a specific
i think yes no i ju
no there
no
are general skills
yes
there are six or seven
mm
they're in the bottom of mind
they've gone completely
but would we not be calling
yes and i can't remember
it numeracy rather than mathematical
yes
skills
alright
alright no if you say numeracy then they'll know what it means but erm i fe i felt that numeracy and mathematical skills would not be applicable to all i mean i don't think it might
no
be applicable to you but
right sorry
okay
er it might not be applicable to UNK or erm hand UNK or things like that but i certainly would want to include it might be very important in my subject
and i would like to be able to include it
er i think we would oh
see i think we're obliged to now say something about erm these general skills i think in light of what's been said in the last couple of weeks
mm
there should also be in there something like grammar and spelling
no i totally disagree with that
and certainly not in the light of what's been said in the last couple of weeks that's
why
extremely UNK
what are the hell are they
what
what is that
the
i mean if we're gonna discuss that needs to be you need to go over that in more detail
is there not an element that hinges round UNK to do with the
yes
ability to
UNK
speak
yes er and literacy that's something different
mm
oh come on now
i mean the government is pushing er spelling a as something which is very important spelling is going to be part of all course work as well as all UNK now
i'm not denying that
well therefore it's important to everybody
i'm not denying that
therefore we better comment on it
well no what i'm what i'm denying is i'm questioning your assertion on what's been happening in the last couple of weeks that we should react to that on a pa on er report that hasn't been released right
that's been partially responded to some people suspect for political reasons and rushing to that on report and i think we need to consider that in a more way
but don't you think that spelling is important for everybody to
of course i do
i think UNK
well why not
important
angela i seem to rem
the wrong one
remember that just a few weeks ago that you were de almost denying that we'd have to do this sort of thing
what
do you a few weeks ago
yeah actually at the end of end of
i can't remember saying you
last term yeah
oh
when don first actually UNK this whole thing
no a no
with all due respect is tha is that re is that relevant
no hang on here UNK what i'm saying there
no all i'm saying is that i'd like to support don and what UNK just said there and i think that er we a that is what we are gonna have to do
it might not be down as black and white
but no wait a minute cos they're two issues
at the moment
i no those are two i issues
mm
first of all you're UNK what i'm saying about those figures
mm
right
and whether you believe that or not that is not UNK what i'm saying today and whether it's accurate or not
that's right
i agree with you that those are concerns but i would not like things like grammar to be isolated out from other language skills
no not grammar but basically maths and english are the tools that the other subjects
oh yes i agree with you
are working
could
with
could we work under a more general how would you feel about if we put something down like i dunno written work would is that
i've got written work
does that not writing and UNK
writing and UNK no spelling is a to my mind spelling is important
of course it is i'm not denying that
are
i to
you repeating yourself
no
if we put what about UNK and literacy
and that includes all
we are obliged i'll say it again
no we're not
we
obliged
we are obliged now to write
g c s e
to re to report on er in all course work to take five percent of our
yeah
er
that's right
course work and base ma er do something along the lines of spelling
sorry i'm not putting it very well
yes but that's assessed in english underneath the UNK target of writing
no it's a separate
but we're obliged every subject
that but anyway that doesn't ha hang on that doesn't approve what you're saying what i'm saying as far as english is concerned that's assessed underneath the UNK target writing
mhm
what i'm concerned about is put things down like that er like that it encourages erm an appreciation of language skills that are UNK partial they can be pulled apart and it's not the model of language teaching that i would like to promote
right
i'm not saying that spelling
mm
isn't important obviously as an english
mm
teacher i'm not going to argue that but what i'm saying is that in this report i don't think that's necessarily the appropriate format
well how am i going to report to parents our spelling
well reporting them un underneath the writ li literacy that is that it's a literacy skill
but i think it's a bit more specific than that isn't it
right
if they don't if they can't spell they're not UNK
and if they can't write in sentences they're not UNK
so you would just put in something for literacy
so
well what i'm UNK but as an alternative i'm suggesting that as far as that's concerned you put down
well we
no i don't think most of parents would have a clue what you're talking about
i'm sorry
don't you
no
but we've
don't apologise
but you haven't argued with that mathematical UNK and i think it's a comparable situation
is it not
yes well i would object to
i'm not su
somebody talking about mathematical skills
i think we're saying the same thing
mhm
i'm trying to take an overview
yeah
i think UNK saying exactly the same
i'm trying to take an over view
that alan's saying and i think we'll have to respect that with all du
mhm
with all due respect
ah but at the same time we don't have to comment on mathematical skills at g c s e
no
no but the ar the previous argument was whether there would be an un sa understanding of it we won't understand literacy
i think we have to recognise UNK concern if er a subject area that she's trying to present and she is not UNK you from doing what you've got
oh no
to do she's just offering a different way of doing it
if you like a different heading under which to do it
well
so she would put wha in you would put in what sorry
just literacy
i would put literacy
because it involves more things
no i disagree with that
yeah i disagree i think i would still like to put
yep
spelling grammar punctuation
yeah but
whatever
but these
is that not all part of literacy
yeah
if you see if you put down literacy the whole UNK in there i mean if you're going to put i put isolated spelling it i it encourages a very limited view of what english is about and success in using language
it's nothing to do
angela
with english
at that oh
andrew comment
that's
on that
course it is it's language is a
i mean a you sit outside it i
medium of learning
any axe to grind
it's not english subject area i'm talking about
erm yeah the axe to grind is yes i pick up the political stick here er that was you know that you know from the other the other end to you and yeah yes i also think we're being beaten with a with a with a stick here for three UNK er if we're forced into the corner of having to use an UNK white hall UNK er
UNK educated
UNK educated persons er view of what it is to be well educated i e we've got to comment on the spelling as if it were important
but i think it is
i think it is yeah
ah in the way that they
i agree with what they're saying
in the way that they're saying it
i agree with it i
in the way that they're saying it
mm
then no
but if as UNK taking full account the subject UNK and our own knowledge of it we would care to make some comment then that is a different thing altogether
mhm
so that if we deal with it er in a way that we can find a professionally acceptable
mm
then i think that we ought to comment on it but if we are doing media response
mm
then i don't think that we ought to go along with for instance just using a term like spelling to
mm
summarise
it's
something which
it's more complex
is more complex than that
yeah
that's my i'm not saying it isn't important
professionally if we did that we'd be UNK ourselves
i think
absolutely
with all due respect here we have to respect the UNK wishes er i mean on the one hand we're UNK alan's er and i
no i i'm gi it's not my i would just look at mathematical skills and saying that you're not really yo you don't really mean mathematical skills
i mean for most of you
aha
yo you know i mean i if andrew were saying he's pretty limited at maths you wouldn't really be meaning limited in maths you'd be meaning UNK limited in
certain skills
numeracy because andrew wouldn't have been testing algebra or things like that you'd have just
been looking at the numbers
oh
see
oh
and that's what i'm saying
mhm
so you're wanting a general
yes that doesn't exclude but includes all of that but at the same time although everybody that's going to read it may not understand the UNK of it all as professionals we're giving more than a passing nod so that was something else er and something more involved than english teacher than making them jump through UNK
mm
and cross t's and dot i's
but that a that's what i said
if it's just a
to you
no if i may aye i er something's just occurred to me and we are looking
we are looking the other heading here of general skills and abilities
and se spelling
spelling is very specific
is specific
mm
and on that basis i would
but
go along with literacy
li literacy and
and i think i'm always inclined to do a colin and say you know
right
i've made my mind up and that's the way it's gonna be
i hate
but
doing things like that but i believe quite strongly what UNK saying er if you came to me and presented something ba a total er conviction that it might be in a sense damaging er the er the concept people have of your subject or might have i would listen very carefully to that and i also ta i remember gordon saying some time ago and whilst gordon drove me crackers he talked about the government saying you've gotta do this you've go and he said there are things that we must believe in as UNK ourselves and UNK
i agree
ourselves despite what the governors
mhm
er the government say to us
and i believe personally in this context it would be foolish at the moment to go down a narrow road until such time as we are ca
did i tell you what's on my desk UNK i told you didn't i
i didn't take did i
what's on my desk downstairs right at this moment
you'll like this
is that sealed
i bet you're right
what is on my desk at this moment
two UNK books
oh yeah
isn't that sad
isn't that sad
and i'm actually UNK publicly that there are two UNK books on my desk downstairs
and i had a
and you think it's sad
i'm a bit worried you
you've gone over all quiet
i don't think
just not sure of
i thought of christine
making it
oh i meant to bring that with me
which has a UNK
and
we'll do the questions and answers today children
right
stuart
mister
you're very quiet there stuart
chris
yeah
as long as your enthusiastic about being here
that's why i like
actually that might spring better
tracey
oh
yeah
get it right
ann
yeah
hello
good
daniel
yeah
yeah
congratulations
sooner or later
jonathan
yeah
he's UNK you sa you said that without moving your UNK
that was brilliant
i know
and UNK
yep
and matthew
matthew without a voice
UNK and joe
yeah
and steven
on holiday
i'll fool them i'll lock that door
oh
he always comes in that way doesn't he
ha
right people
two things to do with you today mainly one is to whip through at least part of the isomers work and i say part of it because you'll be coming back to other parts of it a bit later on when you've for example we'll coming back to erm isomers work
and at various stages during the organic you'll also be coming to what we call optical isomers
what i need to do is to go through them with you and make sure you fully understand what they what their origins are etcetera because isomers we base the questions are very common so i'll be able to talk about marks
and what do marks make
prizes
prizes yes a prize of that little envelope says UNK you have passed
it doesn't actually say that it just gives a but if you say UNK i have passed
not me cos i've already passed but you
yes
are you gonna do passing
right i want to go through isomerism and then go straight onto the erm e go UNK glad you made a bit late but er
i thought it was
sorry
you think it might be
actually it's a good one
michael now that is a UNK
mm
mm
er some of you won't understand that
are you a UNK
i don't think so but
he's fa he's famous
UNK he's on the poster
quite genuine
you are serious
absolutely ge stuart is that true
that stuart never lies
he's going to cambridge so never lies
is that true
no
sorry
right so let's go over isomers and then start on the hydro carbons in some detail and pi the first mechanism we're talking about mechanisms general as well
as far as UNK is concerned you haven't got to do an awful lot
there are only about six mechanisms you actually need to know
one of those you've already met in detail in terms of UNK as that was the idea of reaction wasn't it chris
yep
yep
the other one also came up in UNK and that's this business of nucleus nuclear UNK
that's
yeah
sorry
that side you get the UNK take that's right yes
more
UNK assume
erm alright it's alright chris it's alright
it's all beyond you chris i know
it would be easier be easier
it's all beyond me at the moment as well
right so if i just start on isomers across the board
now you must remember in the link sheet make sure you back up whatever you're getting here
make sure you back it up with the exercises
and of course you do have to log it one of those various exercises and so on
if you don't log it i'll assume you haven't and can i point out to you there's parent's evening coming up very soon thank you very much
and i'll have a chance yet again to talk to your UNK and UNK before yo you actually take your final exams
what happens if you kill your UNK and UNK
pardon
what if you kill your UNK and UNK
if you kill your UNK and UNK i'll have to talk to you peter
you better UNK them
it's far better to erm keep your UNK and UNK live or at least you know do a psycho job
with the stuff that we
ma already
right children
first of all tracey you can have the first opportunity to show how little you know
sorry this it on here
sorry
right yo
oh no mustn't
how your knowledge is in millimetres no i mustn't use millimetres
makes up the usual thing
she's had a lot to drink
she's had a lot of off me today
that's ah she's took it well
she's not talking to me mind but she's took it well
right if i put the word
shit
erm thank you
the word
by the word i describe what does that suggest to you trace
er speak nicely cos
because
you're being recorded
it's a like er using the same components but put together in a different way
like different
no
different ways of putting it's hard to explain
it's this
UNK that is
but no
that was a good try tracey
that's a good try
emma
let's get the other half of the female vote
don't suck your thumb dear
it's so
erm
what's an UNK
it's something about
haven't got a clue
no this is quite serious now
no i don't really know
erm
choose somebody emma
daniel
oh shit
danny i was right
your turn daniel what's an UNK
it's got the same nuclear format
right first of all they're compounds make sure you take these down please
compounds with the same UNK formula
and obviously therefore cos they obviously therefore they've got the same improvements on here as well
they're the same UNK formula but now what's the but chris
UNK done the hard bit for you what's the but
you've got UNK ones that doesn't match erm
i just said they had the same UNK formula
oh right
christopher
er
the same UNK formula but
let's put a word in for you
different
structures
er yeah okay
let's say different structural formulae
in other words the atoms are actually arranged in a different way
they're UNK together in different ways
now there's two main classes of isomerism and don't just exclude er or don't just include organic isomers cos we ge get organic isomers as well
you get occurring in yo in your organic
especially actually
and you'll meet some of them when we actually do that area
but generally there are two main classes of isomerism that we deal with and very much like the UNK on hydro carbons that i did there's a whole variety of ways they can be classified that you've seen
this is just one model
yeah
this seems to work well most seem to fit into it nicely
first of all we have what we call structural isomers a whole group of structural isomers
and then we have a group of two which are described as stereo isomers
now the thing about those two words what do you think stereo isomers is all about without actually saying a specific type of UNK
what does it tend to suggest
what is it
UNK
two forms at once
more than one form of UNK
well that's for the isomers anyway isn't it
yeah
i know what you're saying
you're getting close cos you're UNK or you should be concentrating on the wo on the part of the word stereo
oh
UNK
no not really
it's all about space
if i stereo isomers
have a similarity in that they exist because of UNK aspects
and you'll come to understand exactly what i mean by that it's all about three UNK space
where structural isomers are literally what the word suggests they have different structures different ways of linking the atoms together
but the stereo isomers are all about three UNK space that's how they tend to differ as you'll see
let's start the structural isomers and we can use this as an opportunity to look at some aspects of the
now you should all still be working through the on a continuous basis
i am aware that i am aware of actually two people in the second year who have never used it so far
now those two people or others who haven't used it much you really must get into this disc
it's the easy way to learn or it's easy it's easy way to understand and then learn the UNK
you have to have a UNK a good UNK with organic UNK if you don't you could be throwing marks away even before you get in that exam room
cos there will be aspects where you will have to use UNK
that they ask you specific questions of that naming it's a multi choice more importantly in your written answers you will have to in you are expected to include and correct systematic ohms for any UNK that you deal with
plus of course it means you're gonna go back in that direction so if they say something like erm two UNK active with you need to be able to get structural formula from that name
so you really have got to get to grips with it
they're something you should be using right the way up to the to the actual exams
and there's at least eight UNK available at the present time and more could be made available
not for your own use i UNK to add
they've set up increased the numbers of UNK in the library in the workshop er there's no increasing them up here cos there's we need to buy a computer but certainly up and in the workshop and in the library
you must hit it on a regular basis
it's the easiest way to get to grips with it
and those of yo you who've been doing it for some time will now realise how easy it has made the UNK
you learning without even UNK you're learning it
right so let's start the structural now there's a whole range of different types of structural isomers
position positional isomers branch chain functional group and there's one other odd one which has a very peculiar name and the name it normally goes by is a fairly old name now i'm not sure at this stage if that name is still used but what i'll do is to describe the form of the isomerism first and let you decide what you would prefer to call it
in fact i it does suggest one of these other types of these isomerism depends how you view a functional group
but i'll tell you the name that is used or was used afterwards but i don't know if that name is still used i certainly haven't seen it in a text book in years
but it is a genuine form of isomers but you may like to include into one of the others
well that's entirely up to you but we'll see how we go with that
right let's start with position isomerism
now position isomerism is all about the position of the groups or the position of functional groups so it's not just necessarily groups on their own it could be functional groups
now i've made a distinction between those in other words a group maybe a methile group now methile group is not a functional group it's not something that UNK the properties of a compound necessarily
and the influences that doesn't dictate and a functional group does
where as a functional group might be for example a no age group which does tend to dictate the properties of that compound
so there is a difference between using the word group and functional group
also now i tend as you've probably come to realise i've tended to include specific types of UNK arrangements as a functional group for example i call a carbon double bond i call that a functional group for the simple reason that arrangement of bonds UNK the principle properties of those compounds and in that context i'm then using the word group a bit more UNK instead of saying it's a group of atoms which dictate the properties i'll say it's a group of atoms or it's a special grouping of electrons which dictate the properties
yeah
and so did yo can you see the difference between those
so there's all those sorts of possibilities
now let's look at some examples and get you to name some of them as well
positional isomerism is very obvious the only thing you have to watch out for if the give you structural formulae especially multi choice papers they're buggers they are when they when they do this sometimes
they may draw the same compound but making the same structural formula but drawn slightly differently
and i tend to draw most o most of us tend to draw them as straight lines with branches coming off they may actually show the chain as a twisted chain or UNK chain or going in to form a square or something
so you really do need to understand the UNK in order to be able to say oh yes those two compounds are the same
just been drawn differently
you really have to watch that
so let's start with position isomers and some examples and try and select examples using these
what i'm gonna to what i what i intend to do is just show the skeleton in other words most times i'll tend to do right
just a quick and easy way of doing it
let's take this example here i've got a carbon chain there and i'm going to put a methile group there and i'm going to put a methile group there two three that
identical chain again let's have a methile group there and one there let's do one more of those a methile group there and a methile group there
now in terms of naming these always you go for the longest straight shape that you can by straight really is in inverted commas what we should really say the longest continuous chain that you can find in other words you'd have to go back on yourself
now if you look at all of these and find the longest chain we you can actually get in that respect is a six chain isn't it
there's nothing longer than a six
do watch these examples i'm putting up by the way cos i muck these up
sometimes
i find this a bit UNK to keep doing this so i tend to you know slip up sometimes
please check what i'm doing
it's called thinking
i've got this i can't that one
erm let's just take that chain in each case because it's it is a
chain and we tend to read better write UNK left right up a bit down a bit across down a bit up a bit and so on
let's pick someone completely at random now we've had tracey UNK speaking
and emma
so we've done our what we should do now we're giving the ladies full consideration first with the gentlemen
haven't we matthew
UNK ah
john
would you like to name that compound for me there please
i mean that's not that's not a request
as long as you understand that's an instruction
what would you call it
obviously it's gotta be based on UNK isn't it
two comma five di methile UNK
you want two comma five
dash
dash
yeah i was gonna say that
yeah you were just testing me to see if i
ah well
get it
dire methile UNK is that what you want
no i said UNK
di methile UNK
x
dire methile UNK
er let's see daniel silver UNK from his UNK
dash dire methile
we i haven't asked you the question
let me ask you the question first
will you explain why that's correct
if it is correct do you agree with me
yeah
alright
why is it correct
the two's there cos the UNK groups
UNK what's UNK
UNK
methile
well one of them's on the second one and one's on
the fifth one it's cos it's ta it's
what you should be starting from is the longest chain
yeah
longest chain is the sixth chain so it's gonna be based on a UNK
yeah
there are two methile groups one in position two one in position five
does it matter which end you start kieran
hello
kieran
no
oh no i go sorry that's the answer
is that is your answer
yeah
is that your ar no you're answer was no
yeah
it doesn't matter which end you start from cos either way it it'll still be two five
er chris you s suddenly become extremely interested in what he's writing
do his UNK impression
in other words if i put my head down low enough he can't see me
no i'm trying to write my down
yes chris
was is he gonna
we'll wait yes we will wait that's fine
i'm writing
i'm going to wait
i think we've waited long enough
well that's alright we'll come back to chris
no it's okay i've done that now
oh good
you're ready to
well i'll try and do that
oh that's awfully good of chris thank you
erm what would you call that one chris
er
you don't need any help christopher
okay
this is not a difficult
two
one
and then a three dash die
three dash die
yeah three dash die methile
sounds like a bush
er
come on look i'm listening
these are not but i am
erm
oh ha
no
no see i see i alright no
alright okay hold on i know
what
erm UNK
er i'd say four three four comma three no that'll be
fine thank you UNK
jonathan
three die methile UNK
in between
well let's
the threes
let's get the grammar in as well
three comma three
yeah dash die methile
dash
UNK
die methile UNK
yeah you're longest chain is a six so it could of been clearly based on UNK
and the two methile groups so it's gonna be a die methile
it's gonna be a it's gonna be a die methile UNK of some description now to indicate the positions it's either three or four we take the lowest number both are on carbon number three
so it's three comma three dash cos you have to indicate because you've said die methile you have to indicate where both of those groups are not just one
alright
that's good
which means i should have the last one doesn't it
emma you were smiling or UNK one of the two
erm three comma four comma dash die methile
what
yeah
and comma
yeah you've got this right yeah
three
no
comma
they're laughing at me
four comma
i ain't done nothing
dash carry on emma you're alright
die methile UNK
die methile UNK
anybody agree with that
missed one out
missed the last one
anybody agree with that
no comma
the alternative could be start from this end is still three four so it doesn't matter
now these are examples of positional isomers just using ordinary groups they only differ in the position of those functional groups sorry of those groups
now in terms of functional group isomerism i'm gonna take a slightly different example right let's take this one here first of all i've now started to do what the UNK will do now i'll make them identical structures there somewhere and you really do need to be able to name them in order to see where they are or if they are
matthew no UNK today
would you like to name that one please matthew
and again that wasn't a question
always start these off by considering what they would be if they were UNK
so if that was an UNK that would be what
dunno
four carbons
yeah alright
read these UNK
if that was an UNK that would be a butane four carbons
this is an alcohol it has an o h group so it is a UNK but you have to indicate where the o h group actually is it's either on four or it's on one
oh yeah it is
so you'd name this as butane in other words you're saying it's a butane chain you take off the e you will add o l and if there are positional isomers possible you have to indicate the position one o l butane one l one o l butane one o l
butane one o l
chris
what's that one
butane one o l
exactly the same right
er kieran that one there
butane two o l
butane two o l
stick with the question mark
it's an o l
you say it as though you mean it
not
butane two o l
not butane two o l no you see you yourself
why is it butane three o l kieran
because you have to take the last number off it
take the last number right
erm tracey that bottom one can you
ooh er
see it from there
sorry
sorry
i'm not sure
sorry a tha that was ac that was completely
pick somebody else
stop picking on me
do you want your sticks
and that was completely UNK
pick on
but can you
pick on somebody else
tracey talk at me
she is
that
i am
where's the pu let's put it up there
no i mean quite seriously we're gonna have these things removed cos lose er a third of the anyway
let's write it up here a bit
i can see it really
oh we i wasn't sure if yo if you could
oh
shall i just look past matthew instead of trying to look through him
oh
i just look past matthew
that wasn't called for was it
what's matthew done to you lately
right come on
right longest chain longest chain you can find
now with this
little compound you've got to choose the chain that carries the functional group
three
right listening children
no
you've got to choose the chain that carries the functional group in this case
so
and it
you're looking at this chain here
so that's gonna be based on UNK three carbons
yeah i know
pro is that UNK one o l
it's the one
it would be
next to the c
UNK wo it would be UNK one
yeah
o l but it's a UNK one o l because you're choosing this chain here it means that you've got this group as the UNK and you've replaced one of the UNK with a methile group
oh
so we start off by saying it's based on UNK there's an o h group so it's a UNK the o h is on carbon number one of that chain so it is a UNK one o l
yeah
but you've also got a methile group on carbon two of that chain
right
so it's gonna be two methile UNK one o l agreed
dash methile is it three dash methile
mm
two dash methile
well yeah you're right yes you're right no i shouldn't say that
yeah
two dash methile UNK dash o l
dash dot
do that get an UNK
how do you join the erm the methile and the UNK together
is it a comma is it a dash or what
or is it all one word
one word
right
right now what would you call this
and clearly these two here let's get rid of let's get rid of that
these two here are clearly position isomers
they only differ in the position of that o h group
what would you call this
UNK out
i mean where would you put it
mm
in terms of it's UNK
would you call it positional
or and can you call it positional
yeah
yeah
not really can you
well
it is if you had the other compound where this o h group was on carbon number two as well then those two would be positional isomers cos their carbon skeleton would then be the same and all they would differ is in the position of the o h functional group
yeah so if you had if i try and draw it much the same if you had that and let's choose let's choose er well le let's keep the same let's keep to the same carbon chain if you had that the carbon skeleton is exactly the same the only way it UNK is that the o h group here is on carbon one of that chain that we've chosen where as here it's on carbon two of that chain
so those two would be positional isomers
yeah
but either one of these and what we've already put up you can't really call them positional isomers cos the basic carbon skeleton is different
can you see the difference between those
what's this
if i got these two they are positional isomers because the carbon chain is the same and the only way they differ is in a position of a functional group
yeah
these two here are also positional isomers there carbon chains are the same the only way they differ is in the position of the functional group
yo but you can't say that either one of these and either one of these are positional isomers cos their carbon UNK are different
yeah
it's a bit subtle
right finally something like a carbon just do a simple one they balance for the carbon skeleton these are true positional isomers no other problem with them at all er erm
UNK what would you call this one
don't cry
i'm sorry to ask you a question UNK
can't you be nice for once
i couldn't be nice if i i've been an absolute UNK today
i really have been evil
then you confuse him
i can have one of these now i've been the worst i've been for about six months i really
ain't i trace
if you think about this it's based on the four carbon structure so you've gotta have a few in the name there is a carbon double bond so the basic structure we've got is the butane but as there is more than one position you could have that carbon double bond now to indicate this position and so this one would be called UNK it would normally be a butane but to indicate it's position UNK one e and again you're taking the lowest number so instead of it being a UNK three it's a UNK one e you start at the appropriate
so this one would be called UNK two e and so again these are true positional isomers same carbon skeleton they differ in the position of the principle functional group which in this case has to be a special electrons
yeah
right
branch chain isomerism what do you think branch chain UNK la isomerism is tracey
why me
i'm not picking on i just this is to help you
i like to help you
don't be dirty matthew
it's where you got the er the branch chains coming off of different positions
different branch even
oh
yeah try to use the word position
try not to or try to
try to use the wo try not to use the word position
oh alright
cos that takes you backwards
it's things like this er five my father's getting excited
right they are typical UNK branch chain isomers
they're the same UNK formula the only way they differ is in the way the basic chain is structured
they're all UNK
this one you would just call UNK
this one your longest chain is a four chain so it's based on butane and you have a methile group on carbon number two taking the lowest number of carbon number two of that butane chain
so this would be a two methile because if that's butane the methile butane
this one here your longest chain is a UNK chain a three chain we've now got two methile groups as UNK what would you call that matthew
oh
methile
oh god
robin
what on your nose
no
yo you were looking at me matthew how can you be writing something down
that's the erm
what do you think matthew
say it again cos i wasn't listening
what do you think matthew
let's ask somebody else shall we
yeah
do you think that's a good idea let's ask somebody ask somebody else
let's ask kieran
why doesn't he ever ask
right oh god
is it er
two
two dash two methile
two da two comma
comma methile
so what do you say then
two comma two dash methile
die
die methile
die methile
right you got it wrong
longest chain
methile
die methile
prop pan
UNK
you know you put an e under the first one do you have to
no you don't
you cannot put an e in front of this one
that is not systematic UNK that has gone like that for ten years universities still use it
that is just called UNK it is not called e m UNK any more equally you don't have sec UNK alcohol UNK alcohol they've been out for ten years
it looks good
alright
right now that is just UNK these are all UNK that is specifically UNK
UNK
right so that's an example of branch chain isomers
now functional group isomers what does this suggest emma
don't you swallow that UNK
finish that up
penny saw them first
then when you've done that
cruel
unless it's the golden wish
sorry
emma
what was the question
what is fu functional group
have a guess
well wha what do you think we mean by functional group isomerism
erm it means they have the same functional group
er they do not they in fact have different functional groups
okay different functional groups
same UNK formula
yeah
different functional groups
yes
so for example this one here very close to keith and trevor this one here the best possible thing we can give to matthew
what do you think
uncle john what's that top compound what type of compound is it
UNK tracey that bottom compound what type of compound is that
tricky actually
mm
it's neither one thing or the other
either one thing
yeah it's me methile
it's methile yes
methile
absolutely right
it's a methile
so here we have this what's this what UNK likes it gives him his classic way of getting back at me
this is an alcohol this is an UNK now while we've got the opportunity we'll talk about the naming of UNK before we get onto this last form of structural isomerism
this if that o h group was not there the UNK it's an o h group so it's an alcohol so you take off the e add o l and your positional number is not required
so it would simply be UNK for UNK whisky UNK
ha
UNK matthew
generally industrial UNK is UNK
and it's got UNK in it as well
industrial UNK is UNK
what you're thinking of the pink stuff has the UNK in it
yeah
that's why you go blind if you drink it
and that's where the term blind drunk comes from
what is called industrial UNK is UNK
and
because that's the old term that's been used for however many years and it's still used by industry
cos i did say earlier that universities are behind in terms of this UNK and so is industry
so you still you still buy it it's actually UNK alcohol
but they're now ca they're now catching up they're now putting on the label its proper name
but customs and excise still call this industrial UNK unless it's pure UNK completely pure UNK in other words no water in it and then they can call it absolute alcohol but they don't specify which alcohol it is look
got some they've got some old terminology still around the UNK still in use around UNK it should be
and UNK wherever you go
right now this thing here what you have to e do have to do is to imagine that it's an UNK with this oxygen containing group butane
now in this case it doesn't matter which one i use because they're both exactly the same
this group here the general group if i put o r and that r represents an UNK the general name is UNK
if we specify what the r group is in this case it's a methile group this would be called UNK so there'll be UNK group is the UNK
in this case without it this would be UNK so this would actually be called UNK
some are UNK is an sort o an analogy
UNK
that's where UNK gets his UNK bit from
those of you who do biology who does biology here
yeah there's always one or two
those of you who do biology and have UNK if you're ever bored silly right
like us
when you're bored at other times let's put it that way if he starts doing any bio chemistry at all start as start asking him about the proper names of the systematic names of things and you watch him UNK
he was talking about you yesterday
yeah he was
he said he thought had you behind him
really
what did he say he says UNK
he said UNK
no i was trying to say was
oh no
i i'll talk to you about that later emma actually
what i was trying to say was if you're really bored with him and he's doing is any form of bio chemistry start asking him about the correct names what are they
say it you say it like that what's the correct name
cos straight away yo you're implying that he's wrong
and he really UNK
his hair always stands up on end
it's brilliant
and he starts going oh UNK and he stamps his feet
it's ever so funny
it really is UNK
so you should do it
that's right
you have to get him wound down a bit you have to do it you know of a about half an hour or so ask him for the proper name
it's absolutely brilliant
he goes mad
he's you see bu but after about twenty minutes or so he loses touch with what's what you're actually doing and if you catch him just right he goes UNK
it's really funny
stamps his little feet
UNK feet
anyway he's actually a good friend he knows i say these sort of things about him but erm it's good
i'm gonna tell him
right so this'll be called
yeah
this will be called UNK
okay
now that's and example of functional group isomerism what i'd like you to do now is to try and decide what these two things are called i'm gonna put on the board and try and decide what you would call them in terms these general labels under structural isomerism
if i just draw the carbon skeleton
oh no i i'll put the UNK in for you as well because i'm helpful like that
it says so in my c v
right now they're both UNK try and name them first in naming them take the biggest hydro carbon chunk that you can find and pretend that was an UNK so the smaller chunk then becomes the UNK
so for example in that first one the longest chain you've got is a three so it's a UNK it's an UNK of UNK
once you've got the names then decide what you think what type of isomerism you think it actually is
it's really weird
and i'll give you the old name for it
alright
UNK pro UNK
yeah exactly right
the first one is UNK in other words you're saying effectively this group here wasn't the longest chain you can get is a UNK
so you got a UNK group so this one
page six
is UNK
now what about this one
mm
UNK exactly right
exactly right well done
these are some of the most difficult well it is compound that UNK don't are extremely difficult to name
and the they're effectively fairly easy don't do much on them you won't oh yeah you meet UNK very much at all
there was a time i can remember i was at school cor
yes i can think that far back
so can adam
yes
no i think i find it easiest i remember when i was at school and you can't remember when you were last at college on time
ooh
exactly
erm i can actually remember making UNK as a practical i mean it's something you wouldn't dare even think about doing now
cos the UNK actually lethal
you know what i mean it's a UNK it'll send some of you more asleep than you already are
also it's
it's so UNK you go anywhere near a naked flame sorry flame
what
you don't even use you don't even need to use a naked flame you just need a hot surface like UNK
and it UNK all on it's own a terrible state
also any of you go to university to do course you all will to some extent cos you love chemistry so much
it sits here
we never ever UNK without checking first that it doesn't contain UNK organic UNK which contain this and single bond cos things UNK
yeah
but yo but luckily we had to check our bottles to make sure there's no UNK in them
that's lethal stuff
anyway
now what would you call it UNK
i'd call it functional group isomers
justification
because erm the actual functional group on the end it's only just it's only just been moved
what is the fu ah but what is it's the wrong word
what is the functional group
i'm not having a go at you don't be so UNK
what is the functional group in UNK
the functional group is a UNK option to two carbon atoms
mm
which you've got in both
yeah
the UNK and the UNK are not functional groups
it's that arrangement of
UNK carbon oxygen UNK carbons that's the functional group
irrespective of ho how many more carbons are attached to those two carbons
it's tricky
erm uncle stuart long time no
what do you think stuart
what would you call it
well the only thing is
speak up
the only real thing that seems to be changing in is the compound in position of the UNK
is this how you spoke in your interview then stuart
yes i'm awfully glad to be here
god i'm so excited at being able to come to study and
that's right
do my degree i can hardly wait
oh my god
that's not fair
that's not fair
why do you speak and UNK around
it would help
it would help
calm down
should have told him to his face
shut up
yes go on what you were saying
er well you've totally made me miss my train of thought
er
that wasn't what you saying
well you made me
you were saying you were talking about UNK about
you are moving the position of the oxygen and although it isn't a er a er well no functional group
no
the function group is the fact that it's simply UNK to two carbons
and er
which doesn't really help
would it would it influence the er compound by the
that's right stuart
the influence is the physical property but not the chemical one
UNK are UNK are UNK
would a methile influence in the same way
no
yeah as i've already said
well then the carbons you get is
what he's really saying is that he doesn't know the answer to the question
well i've eliminated it's impossible
i know you're UNK yeah and al and also UNK half the brain cells in the room
this is still
is that it
yes
he did actually say that
yeah it is over now
back to UNK
no i know what you're saying er
so it's not a positional UNK
it's very difficult
you can't really call it a positional UNK as such
what about the UNK arrangement
is it an UNK because sort of
what
thank you
he's doing a level maths right
there's three there
well there's four five six seven eight nine ten UNK right
brian
no
daniel
do it on your own
daniel alright daniel can't add up to ten
look i said
right wha
any of them could add up to ten
look you see there ah he's got two different numbers of UNK up there
yeah well put me down
cos i'm in the right
well there you are that's it
who can count up to ten
me
without a calculator
without a calculator
it told you
right then
that's what told me
a level maths
you could
oh i don't really
a level sums
right sums the answer is
the answer is matthew
do you wanna keep it
is that you can't really
call it any of what
we've seen up to now not with any with full sort of real erm
b f d it's called
ain't the first diploma b f d
there is a word that's used there's a term that's used for this sort of effect this is the term it used to be called
UNK
it's a UNK
a UNK
what's a what's funny
it's a label that's all
there's no joke there chris
yeah these people will laugh at anything today
well they're su they're stupid boys that's why
say that again
can you slap
then
all of them
can i slap all of them
mm
you only have to slap this end and it passes along anyway
yeah do it
it won't do any damage cos chris is in the middle
you're like a UNK
UNK
hair
well
anyway by the looks of it there won't a there ain't much longer at least i kept mine
for forty six years
mine's
jus just brush it back let's have a look see if there is anything in there
can't you brush it back together come on
good grief
cor
it's like looking at the mirror innit
a UNK hair line is a sign of intelligence
thanks al
obviously it's a genetic UNK with chris it's not worked with him
oh
ha
throw up yeah
right
an used to be called UNK and i say it's not a word it's not a term i've seen on for many years and you don't seen it many erm modern organic UNK
i think it's still around and they've gotta call it something if erm if you think
word
right now
stereo isomerism next exhausted UNK
you ought to
not a lot
we've exhausted the structural side of isomerism now we can look at the stereo isomerism
now the stereo isomerism is all about UNK chemistry much more than just the way things are attached
yes
it's not just the way the things are attached together joined together it's more about the actual space how they're arranged in space but
there are two forms of stereo UNK that we recognise and don't forget these labels are purely arbitrary
the first one is called UNK isomerism in some books not that you ever read will read any chemistry books but just in case you UNK over one day and fall flat on your face and there happens to be a chemistry text book open and you ha just happen to read one or two of the words as you go unconscious and in UNK case if you wake up
UNK isomerism is sometimes or has sometimes been called UNK trans isomerism
it's not the right term to use not really
UNK trans c i s and t r a n s
they're laughing again are they
if go like this to daniel you can slap them
don't be like that
actually
you're not allowed to slap
you're not allowed to slap them
why's that
my mum told me it was UNK
you're mum told you
yeah that's naughty
bet he's gonna take
your mum told you what
yo your mum told you to do it in the UNK
i meant rude
i was gonna say when can i come round and see your mum
why is it rude to slap people emma
they deserve it
they're boys
slap you
maybe i should see behind
right UNK results when you have rotation about a bond axis prevented
if you draw a normal carbon single bond which is a UNK bond what's a UNK bond daniel
it's where two
e t impression
yeah like that
yeah end on overlap UNK daniel but i i'll take i could be quite UNK but there you are
end on overlap of the
now there's free rotation about that carbon axis
now the other type of overlap is UNK overlap where the is always o UNK that way and you try and rotate about that bond axis you'll break the overlap
and any double bond will consist of a UNK bond and pie bond and because you've got the pie bond there it then UNK rotation about that carbon bond axis and providing you have different groups here different groups of at each end or just one in there at both ends you can get two different isomers
when the groups are attached on the same side of the double bond that shows we use UNK dash in front of the name
so you've named it UNK and then looked to see where the various groups were and put UNK in front if you had that arrangement
if they're opposite to each other the same type of idea you've named it just one in if you draw is
it used to be a UNK of UNK or a UNK of UNK which will do the job
nowadays they have obviously UNK which would be er much more easier the same sort of thing as they have in UNK
so the light that actually comes out will be UNK in specific planes but not all planes every plane in
it will then go through a container now that container ultimately will contain this is why it's called a container
will ultimately go through the solution that you're looking at in terms of optical activity it comes out UNK end cos light tends to do that you know it'll come UNK end and at this end after going through a length system etcetera will be a an UNK
just one
just one
very difficult to look through to through a lens with two UNK at the same time
unless they are pre UNK eyes you know they sort of they come out sort of go down together and be just above the actual UNK
thank you for that philosophical thought
it's alright
now the way you use it varies one way to use it is to start with this empty and you'll find that this end here the actual UNK can be UNK it has a scale like as in fish stuart
sorry
you know the lines
or as in weighing you could have picked weighing scales as an example couldn't you
weighing scales
weighing scales
don't you the balance stuart
weighing scales ah well that's sad
that's really sad
can i just talk to you about them ones
i'd don't do that again
after i've heard their conversation for god's sake you know have a bit of heart
yes that's what it means it means weighing scales
what he meant was a balance
erm right if this you're enjoying this mark aren't you
dunno why they'll start me off now
there are various ways of using them one way to look through which yo which you have to see the light you know otherwise you won't see it
yes daniel it's true
don't UNK in surprise
you do actually have to look through to see the light coming out
you look through and you rotate that UNK until you've either got maximum UNK cos you got a second UNK system in there as well you see you either get maximum UNK or complete darkness
what you then do make a note of that all that as i read it to you what you then do is to put your solution into that container you have to otherwise it comes out the ends
put your solution into that container that solution is of a known concentration this path then is also known matthew
this path then is also known and in terms of accurate work they also know the temperature now i'm not sure if there's a temperature effect on rotation but it wouldn't surprise me if there was
anyway you then look through it with the solution in and you'll find that if for example you started off with it completely dark you'll find it's then grey cos the plane of UNK been UNK now it's where there was no light getting through now some of it is actually getting through cos it's been UNK
and so you then rotate the UNK christopher
you then rotate the UNK
i was trying
yes but UNK talking
it's UNK turn
well shut up then
oh god
you then rotate oh look at this
i really hate you danny
listen to this
he's totally
you then rotate the UNK so you get back to the condition that you had before
so if you started off in complete darkness you rotate until you get complete darkness or the opposite
and you measure the angle through which you've had to turn to get to that position and which direction you've had to turn it through or rather which direction the light had been UNK through
yeah
and that gives you something called specific rotation which will be a constant for those conditions indicated and for that substance
now one of them will rotate to the right one will rotate to the left what you need to be able to do is to identify the condition that will give that give rise to optical isomers in other words to be able to say yes that molecule will have optical isomers
optical isomers are sometimes called UNK if you have trouble with language then we'll call them UNK if you're a UNK you call them optical isomers
actually we was just saying that
that was just UNK
UNK
yep
what does it mean
what UNK
no UNK or whatever it's called
that's the name for optical isomers
it's the posh name for it's the one that chemist use
you know optical isomers alright
UNK is UNK
right now you must be able to recognise in either a structural formula or a UNK formula you must be able to recognise existence of what is called and UNK centre if you are a chemist UNK centre if you are a super chemist if you are a UNK an UNK to different ones
that's assuming there's UNK and chemist
ha
i'm a bush
aye
that is a bush
does look strange
right
so what you're looking for in any formula UNK talking matthew
what you're looking in any formula say from a carbon compound you would be looking for that was UNK to four different groups it doesn't matter what the groups are it doesn't matter how big how small they are
and that one as well
but they're UNK to different UNK so for example if one had something like this er let's call that see three page seven if i had something like that central carbon there and when they draw these things at an exam paper don't expect it to be the central one
i could've actually drawn this quite differently and maybe one of the carbons of on the side yeah
that carbon that i've got in the centre now and the convention is to use a little star
ah
that's definitely bent
put two in here er i get that sort of UNK spirit building up
UNK
UNK
on the christmas pudding
i thought it was a fairy
pardon
get the
i never
he said UNK
little heart bless her
what's the oh
no i won't ask
don't so we use a little star on the UNK and it may not always be carbon cos we don't get this sort of isomerism indeed like compounds as well
use a little star to indicate which is the UNK centre which UNK centre and all it means is that if you were to UNK if you had a UNK molecule in other words it had four different groups attached to it what it means is that it and it's mirror image this is the way you actually draw it and answer the questions you draw you draw it as if there was a mirror image
that's why it's damn tricky to do it
you draw it to show that it has a mirror image so what you find in practice is that it and it's mirror image are not UNK
in other words like your hands and feet etcetera they're mirror
images you can't thank you they're mirror images that you can't UNK
you can't even UNK to that extent cos they're slightly different can't even UNK that my fingers can't UNK cos they're slightly different
you actually make up a structure like this UNK carbon we did have another one but er obviously there's some students have erm decided to do something different with the er things that's all that's left
not funny kieran
here i'm holding hand model hand
here i am holding a model of a UNK carbon in four different groups of ten and here is it's mirror image
it's been a
it was
honest
that was it's mirror image
so that's been changed out of that
pardon
right and there's not really enough
i mean gotta pretend there's another one of these there
but there would of been
there's it's mirror image and what you will find is that you can UNK side by side and two any two of those atoms there those groups but then straight away the other two are out of position the other two have reversed
so if i take this one and put this one i can UNK the red straight away i've UNK a group but look the blue and re and the white are out
ah
watch see it goes
can you see that
no
it's sad innit
or i can UNK the green one
notice now that the white one the two white ones are UNK but now look the two UNK and the two blues are now not UNK any longer
that's what we mean by non UNK
UNK trying to work out how a bless her
i know i've only got one left yeah
but it would have been a
yeah shut up
oh i'm tired
so optical isomerism results
optical isomerism results when a structure and it's mirror image are non UNK
right
this takes us to four fifteen
i know that cos it says so on here
it might be wrong
what i wanted to do today was to start to talk about mechanisms but i think i've exhausted my erm what's the word i'm looking for
pardon
ooh
what was that
pardon
UNK
i didn't hear you then
what we'll do is we'll leave it at that doesn't mean your going anywhere
now are there any aspects about the isomerism you want UNK apart from the whole lot
do that one again
that last one you just did i didn't understand a word
no
of that
well the thing to do maybe i should have a word with him
well i understand where you got that
now be subtle about it
your explanation was a load of crap mate
no danny i want to know about it right
but i don't understand what you just said then
ooh now you've made him mad
ooh
i needed some
UNK really with his shirt
can he turn UNK than his shirt
can you specifically make a different erm er optical isomers
you can to some extent
what about
when you
when the chemical reactions very often the two that are produced erm well usually when you ca come into reactions and materials that are produced are a mixture of both isomers
in other words usually the chemistry is non selective
yeah
if both isomers are being formed
tha that by the way is called a UNK or the
is this
UNK mixture
a what a r UNK
a UNK r a c e n a t e or UNK mixture
what about this though
hang on
that's UNK
said yeah but you can have
to some extent you can yeah
it's a mixture of the
but with optical
you try to produce a particular UNK what you normally
have you
get is the
UNK mixture in other words both are there but it has no ah
both are there but it has no effect on plane UNK light for instance like as if one of them is trying to rotate it to the left by so many degrees and the other one is UNK to the right by the said the amount
so that they can only twenty
yeah
what we can do now we can use systems to once we've got the UNK mixture we can use systems to separate that UNK mixture
we can also use biological systems to separate them because biological systems like protein UNK and things like that are very selective in terms of the one they the UNK they will pick up
if they do happen to pick up the wrong UNK erm these isomers by the way you'll find things put in front of them like you often find a little d or a little l in front of the name it means UNK to the right and UNK
lever
alright i'll get out the way then
UNK to the left you find these this UNK appearing in front of a name if it's the compound is UNK active
if it's a UNK mixture you sometimes find saying that both are there
biological systems tend to normally pick up a particular UNK in most cases if they pick up the wrong one it will affect for example the protein chain it will affect ultimately its three UNK structure and therefore it's function
now it may or not me UNK if it's a minor alteration in the surface geometry then it may be so slight as to make no difference in the way it performs so if for example it's an UNK it may not affect it at all
but in some cases the having a different UNK can affect the three UNK properties in such a way that it will no longer function efficiently as an UNK as a UNK to the reaction it's supposed to UNK then you start to get problems
so some genetic problems are a result or a shown to be the result of a wrong amino acid being incorporated into the protein chain and therefore UNK and on and on and on
but we can now use biological systems to actually separate them and actually select particular isomers
but normally UNK speaking when a particular reaction takes ta careful of those emma
emma
take the pen out of your nose dear thank you
she's now UNK the end of the pen
at least it wasn't stuck up the bum
erm UNK speaking if you carry out a reaction which can produce an UNK active compound you would normally the UNK and then you have to separate by either chemical method or the physical method and it's usually not very easy
if you're gonna separate UNK say for example you produced erm an organic acid which is UNK active the things you would normally have to do is to use a base to make the salt of you know you make the two UNK salt and then separate them by a thing such as UNK and then we generate the acid afterwards very tricky
not as tricky as the original one this effect was discovered i think by UNK in UNK acid and he happened to notice he had a proper UNK acid UNK
that's the sort of question to ask UNK by the way he says UNK acid ask him for it's proper chemical name
what is it
i dunno
it UNK it goes down a bit
anyway he happened to notice god knows how like cos this cry the UNK you used were quite small
he happened to notice that there were UNK which appeared to be mirror images of each other
and so it goes beyond the actual UNK stage if you can have this compound in UNK form as you can most though you might have to reduce the temperature or whatever but then all is gone UNK eventually you'll find their UNK are also mirror images and what he actually did he UNK picked out UNK which were of one particular shape as opposed to the other he actually separated all the UNK physically by using UNK and then found that they ha you know the two had a different affect on plane UNK light
incredible
now in answer to your question christopher
yeah
i've now made single UNK cos i'm like that single handed
you didn't have one ready or anything
i did but some students took it bits
i now have a molecule of this there it was there again now it's back in again and out now they're gone now they're back
it's magic
what i have here is are mirror images alright
complete mirror images yes
yeah
now you find that those mirror images are not UNK so i can in order to UNK the red and the white if only i can on doing that straight away the blue and the green are non UNK
so those two things would be optical isomers one would rotate the plane of UNK light to the left the other would rotate the plane of UNK light to the right
cor
trying to up it
yeah
yeah i think i got that
any other questions
price of fish meaning of life
when you've finished the class
what is erm the meaning of life
can we do it
thirty eight and half
thirty eight point five
the meaning of life
yeah
no it's forty two
forty two
thirty eight point five
i have it on good assurance
it's thirty two
he thinks your mad
actually
any other er dunno where you're going it's not time yet
let's spin this out to the last possible second
it means like thirty eight point five
i know
right any other questions about what we've done today
oh
nuclear UNK trans can you have say with two b's and one carbon
can what
can you have the two b b's and one carbon
no because then you won't get isomers
that won't be UNK they won't be erm UNK isomers
now if you and if you rotate one
oh yeah it's in
you get the other one
positional innit
yeah
you keep changing the carbon
anything else
i must just say to yo you're dying to ask like what he's doing over the corner
not a lot
i feel sorry for you mis obviously a second time being in contact with daniel
yeah he is quite a shock
UNK knows
UNK a real
he still does nothing
that's right
he was talking about you before you came out actually
yeah
he was
you should have been here early UNK i missed your presence
excuse me
right anybody else at all
what's that noise
that's on b c one
what's that noise
it sounds like a cat when it plays up
i worry about you sometimes emma
i really do worry about you
who saw the mary UNK experience
yeah
who saw UNK in his pint glass
i didn't
really the only thing i was disappointed about is that he didn't drink it again
if that had been a true man he'd have drunk it again afterwards
but he's not a man
waste not want not
that's very true
but he thinks he's a man doesn't he
UNK a UNK
emma knows that
i think we leave now
i think that's probably a very good place to leave
thank you for allowing me to
so one final technical point election expenditure
erm in local elections as again in parliamentary or general elections there's a limit as to what a candidate can spend
at the moment that UNK a hundred and fifty pound per ward or division
plus three pence per vote
er which you might think that again sounds odd and UNK but by the way note i said between w er it applies to both ward and division
we're aware of that distinction are we not
what's a ward
well that's what somebody stands be elected
to s for what to be elected to what
to the council
what council
district council
good
what's a division
it must be county
correct
you represent a ward at district council level or metropolitan council level
you represent a division at county council level
a division is a grouping together of wards
we have the example in harlow i've forgot how many councils are there in harlow thirty six thirty eight something
yeah it's thirty six isn't it
got to be because of the election
erm they all represent an individual ward
there are i think it is what four county council harlow so wards group together to become county council divisions
yeah
where does that word come from ward
no one's ever asked
it's probably anglo UNK
okay erm further election expenditure
election expenditure is the responsibility of the political agent
oh agents exist in different forms really erm i'm gonna be we'll be mentioning the notion of political agents in central government later er in ce in general elections later on
erm but there is a similarity in both er elections yeah
anyone standing for election at local government level has to have an election agent
however you can be your own agent
the agent has to fill in the financial returns has to send in a report of financial expenditure
normally of course a party will appoint a single agent
in other words at local election at local election time the conservative party will have x candidates standing
there will be a conservative party appointed agent who will act on behalf of all those candidates and simply fill in the election expenses the accounts are submitted to the returning officer
it's an offence to er exceed the er expenditure
okay now here's something coming up that is not only UNK it's confusing to students it's even more confusing to er the general public
and this is what we can UNK er the electoral sequence
big diagram coming up
okay at the top of there eighty four and ninety four they're years believe it or not
and down here we've got the names of the different types of council
at the top county council second metropolitan councils that is all metropolitan councils that is of course if you remember a metropolitan council in the area in the area of the old former UNK merseyside county council the metropolitan councils would be liverpool UNK saint UNK now they're examples of metropolitan er councils
so metropolitan councils and here's where the UNK begin to creep in metropolitan councils and some non metropolitan councils i e district councils so they're in a separate ca separate category with this electoral sequence
then we have most non metropolitan district councils
and finally london UNK
right before i fill in some of the details on this again an important point to grasp coming up
in general elections we don't normally know for sure until a few weeks beforehand what the date of the election is going to be
all you really know about general about the general election is that it's gotta be held before the end of UNK statutory life of five years
yeah
and we had an example of that a good example this year of course with erm that in that in the spring of this year john major erm had to call an election before june twentieth i think the date was because by that time then parliament would have automatically been dissolved
yeah
and john major chose to er erm call the election dissolve ask for the UNK of parliament last year and the election took place in er in april
why does it have to be on a thursday
it doesn't
oh
the general elections
mm
it doesn't
i thought it did because that was the only day that wasn't a
no
however it just so happens the last time an election wasn't on a thursday was in er i think it was nineteen thirty one when it was held on a tuesday
but there is nothing laid down in law whereby it has to be a thursday
that was one of the questions on our entrance exam was
what
what day's general election held
mm well the correct answer is that normally a thursday but there is no statutory er obligation that it is thursday
and indeed in the early part of this century and the nineteenth century elections have been held on monday wednesday tuesday never a friday never a saturday never a sunday
yeah
it's just one of these common that's general elections we're talking about by the way
we've slightly UNK but i take your i take your point
it doesn't have to be a thursday
it just so happens that for the past sixty years it has been
no erm it's more recent than that i think in nineteen fifty the election was on a tuesday
i think it may even be more recent than that
not that i was there in person
well i could have been but i couldn't have voted
erm i was two that's why
but anyway we've UNK the point that the general elections it's really down to the prime minister to er to ask for the UNK of parliament and the prime minister will normally a will normally ask for the UNK of parliament when he or she thinks they've got the best chance of winning
major's ex example was rather was rather a good one because he was running out of time
he didn't want local elections held before the general election
he UNK what the results might have been from the local elections and he's an example in fact of a prime minister who went into the elections UNK in the opinion polls
it doesn't you know it's not something you would normally do
not when you do have a choice
however let us return to local elections
every councillor is elected for a fixed four year term of office
and we can predict with certainty the date of local elections because local elections always take place in may
and they normally occur on the first thursday in may
they don't if that UNK may the first then it's the second thursday but it's normally the first thursday in may
so we can we can you know exactly when a local UNK term of office is up because it's fixed for four years
however and this is why we've got this big diagram coming up however different councils are elected at different points in the electoral sequence
each council's elected for four years but councils aren't all elected at the same time
i can illustrate county councils a dot blank here in eighty four eighty five an election year for county councils i e essex county council dot eighty nine an election year dot and ninety three you'll all be er happy and UNK to know is a county council election year so next may thursday county council elections will be held
metropolitan councils the big city ones with the exception of london of course and some non metropolitan councils out of interest harlow is amongst those some non metropolitan councils this is where the confusion often UNK in
i'm writing figure ones there dots blank year one third one third one third dots blank year one third
one third
one third one third dots one third
you'll be amazed to know that the system for this for elections to metropolitan councils is called the system of election by thirds
what does it mean
it means that one third of the councillors are elected in each of three UNK years
yeah
and there is a blank year which UNK with county council elections
UNK an example of that
how it's done in practical terms is this each harlow ward returns three councillors yeah
they've all been UNK these three councillors have been elected at different in different years okay
and so a harlow councillor who was elected in nineteen eighty eight yeah
was up for re election in may this year nineteen ninety two
that's one third of them got it
why do they do that is it
well i'll come on to that in a sec
okay
yeah
it's a good very good question
but do we grasp that
i mean some people are looking at me as though i've just revealed some dread secret
the world was gonna end tomorrow
grasp it
yeah
like a good example the ninety three one the ninety two one rather this year was a good example because there was erm a UNK battle in old harlow where the leader of the council richard was up for re election
and as you may be aware that er in the local elections this year in may the conservative party did dramatically well much better than it did in the general election yeah
and so therefore richard was seemed to be he would be in he was gonna be in very grave difficulties in getting re elected for old harlow
old UNK a very interesting ward
erm it's old harlow and UNK street it's in therefore it's in the UNK part of town but many of the UNK of old harlow and erm UNK street are sort of st are i suppose you know UNK liberals UNK yeah
it's a bit like UNK yeah
it's got two labour councillors and one conservative councillor used to have three labour councillors
but there was a really big party struggle there and in old harlow erm conservatives of course very confident
er there was a UNK party battle but i think the turn out the local election turn out was over sixty percent which is dramatically high for local government elections
erm UNK home by a by a by a small number of votes yeah
the liberal vote there almost collapsed to nothing erm while the liberals obviously voted labour UNK in order to prevent the conservatives from a UNK the ward and b erm removing the leader of the council which would have been which is what they were obviously UNK for
erm it comes back to the point which has just been made about the er about the erm why have this system of election by thirds and almost UNK on the leader of the council yeah
so that's er that's the system by thirds
one third of the councillors in each of three UNK years are up for re election
and there's a blank year in county council here
of course it's not a blank year for the hard pressed voters of harlow because they're all voting in the county council elections then for the for the number of for the for the er county councillors who represent at harlow erm at county hall in chelmsford
have there ever been surveys done erm to see how many people actually understand
yes
the system
yes
and how many do
not many
it's not surprising
mm
people get very confused by it
mm
and they don't figure they get more confused when the county council elections come up in ninety three
yeah
it's even more confusing cos some systems of by thirds i think they go they go on wards there's some wards don't have an election one year when the neighbouring one does
do you see what i mean
yeah
are there any limits to how many times you can stand for councillor
well apart from death
i mean my erm my uncle getting familiar about this yes
my erm my uncle jo yes
after whom a huge block of flats in liverpool is named after yeah
morgan heights yeah
not to be confused with
he er he stood down as erm as a as a er labour councillor in liverpool in UNK er ward what are we in now nineteen ninety two in nineteen ninety or ninety one yeah ninety one at the age of eighty six
and he'd been a liverpool councillor off and on for over fifty years
twice refused the offer of the parliamentary seat at UNK
anyway most non UNK district councils oh by the way sorry and parishes i always
we always forget about the poor parish council don't we
they like the county councils go in for what's known as the poll council system as opposed to the system of election by thirds
that is just as a county council in eighty five all the councillors are up for re election just as in a parliamentary general election yeah
in eighty seven all the councillors of most district councils are up for election
so if you go up the road to UNK their elections take up all the councillors that are elected together
eighty eight eighty nine ninety one there's a again a possibly interesting link here with general elections erm eighty three of course was a was a er an election year for non metropolitan er district councils yeah
it's just it's just off our little chart there
those elections take place in may right
in may eighty three and again in may eighty seven margaret thatcher chose to go to the country the month after those elections
june eighty three and june eighty seven
four in both those occasions she was four years into her term of office
elected first in seventy nine and then obviously in eighty three
and what happened in eighty three and eighty seven of course was that the local elections take place the conservative party managers analyzed the results fed them through the computers and you could come up with the fact that you would looked like you were set to win a general election
and so therefore the local elections were seen as a UNK to the general elections
why
because it also happens it happens to be the case that in local elections people tend to vote on national issues or perceptions
they don't vote on local issues
local elections just tend to be national reflect the national concerns issues or reflects the UNK of the government pa of the governing party or whatever yeah
you don't tend to vote on purely local issues
one of the reasons for introducing the community charge that and it's UNK that it was just possible especially in nineteen erm ninety erm that the community charge was meaning wa was bringing about a change where people were voting on local issues the prime local issue of course being what would be the level of the of the community charge
and that was one of the UNK of bringing it in that it would raise a sense of er it would raise erm the actual percentage of people voting in elections and it would make local issues er more pertinent at local elections
we will never know how that would develop because community charge has been abolished but anyway you will note of course as well that last year in nineteen ninety one the conservative party managers looked at the local election result and decided not to go in june ninety one cos they UNK they would get beaten
surely if the erm turn out is er erm doesn't really
it's much big it's a it's a it's an incredibly wide sample opinion poll
because we're talking millions of voters yeah
if you get a forty percent turn out in a local elect within england yeah
if you get a forty percent turn out in england and wales we're talking many millions of voters
and when you think that the biggest opinion poll samples are what five ten thousand
so it's pretty it's a much more accurate guide than any opinion poll
erm again i can't help but s er getting slightly UNK but it is rather interesting that john major this year decided to go for a general election before the local elections
the advice was not to hang on and see what the may elections er looked like
couple of reasons one was on a much smaller sample yeah
but b of course if you did badly in those elections in may the government might have done badly in may then morale would have been rock bottom of having to go into an election he would have had to go for an election six weeks later or they'd run out of time yeah
but the real the real glorious UNK i think that cheers up erm UNK like me political UNK is that in those may elections the conservatives did dramatically well compared to what they'd done in the general election
in the general election they'd won it but their majority was down
in the local elections their share of the vote was and they did very well
why
anyone possess any theories about that
they were reflect they were reflecting national issues erm like the
well did it really have time to do that
just on a were just on a general high anyway after the election results
yeah
there's that fact that the conservatives were on a high of course
i mean these local elections only took place what erm four weeks after the general election the conservatives were on a high and UNK therefore you could say that what
labour voters are gonna be UNK
labour voters were er to say the least dis
disappointed i think is more the is the word rather than UNK isn't it
disappointed
UNK
yes possibly UNK is the better word right
but there's another interesting fact that as well erm and it's borne out i know opinion polls had a rather bad erm er got a bad press in the general election er because they weren't very accurate and it was odd this because their accuracy levels had becoming er had been becoming UNK er accurate say in eighty seven you know
but they take opinion polls all the time i mean shortly after the recent general election they were taking opinion polls a week later
they d they do it all they do it throughout the year we just we just don't there's just not so many of them and we don't read about them so much as we do before big elections
the point is this after a general election the party that's won it's share of the vote in the most in the in the opinion poll taken most immediately after the election it goes up it's higher than actually what it gets in the general election
why
this is just purely a human fact
people want to be associated with a winning team don't they
a UNK and a UNK over there yeah
there's a tendency to associate yourself with the winning with the winner
yeah
and people who might even have voted labour or UNK at the general election at the first opinion poll they'll say they vote conservative
so it's strange but it's er maybe it's not so strange
why do you think get it so UNK wrong this time round in the general election
i beg your pardon
how did why did the erm opinion polls just get it so UNK wrong this time round
well they've come up with a lot of theories haven't they
erm one the UNK of many conservative voters to reply to opinion polls for s some reason
two erm in some areas erm people are just bloody minded and say they're gonna vote one way the oth the other
there's n it's an interesting fact that as well that erm opinion polls are very often it depends what the question you're asked and when during elections people are asked are you prepared to s to have either a lower taxes or b spend more higher taxes and spend more on the national health service well people always say oh yeah oh yeah fine
i want every possible penny spent on the national health service they don't want to be thought like UNK the hun yeah well something like that
so when you're asked do you believe that the entire gross national product should be spent on the n h s people say yes of course
cos they don't wanna be cos it seems bad but when they're in the when they're in the ballot box when they're in the voting UNK and then they're faced with the question then do they want
yeah
pay more when it comes to the crunch
erm so th that's a factor
the other factor as well was the high turn out in the election
the turn out in the recent in the in the april election was very high
it was what seventy eight percent over all and in and in a large very large individual constituencies you were seeing turn out in the eighties
eighty six percent in a couple eighty four percent
and if you think about it you can't get a much bigger turn out than that
cos if about eight percent of the people don't have to vote anyway some people aren't gonna vote
you can't really get much higher turn out than about eighty four percent eighty five percent in practical terms
lot of people aren't there and they haven't bothered to get a postal vote cos they're on holiday or whatever you know
so the high turn out was a factor i think in the opinion polls
it UNK lots of conservative voters quite simply thought they were gonna lose so they went out and voted
mm
well i mean now that doesn't sound that's not such a an irish statement as it sounds actually
in eighty three when it was obvious that the conservatives were gonna win because then if you if this is history now but the labour party was led by michael foot then it was it was in no shape to win the election in erm the conservatives were led by thatcher she was on a high after the UNK war the conservatives UNK home
in fact er they should have done a lot better but a lot of conservative voters didn't bother going out to vote cos it was a UNK conclusion
yeah
sounds remarkable but it's erm it's true
okay and finally erm are london UNK erm yeah blank eighty six election and the next london borough elections will be in nineteen ninety four so they've been in nineteen eighty six nineteen ninety and nineteen they will next be in nineteen ninety four
so it's argued of course that this electoral sequence especially election by thirds is a reason for public confusion about local government
it's also a reason for the public confusion about who does what
again especially in conjunction with our system of election by thirds
the people in districts like that they seem to be UNK voting forever voting and in the blank year they're voting for county council elections
or they're voting in county council elections
now the question was raised earlier what is the justification of this system of election by thirds
by the way erm for non UNK districts they can choose whether they can have election by thirds or not and you do occasionally get r you do occasionally you can get very occasional examples of a of a dis of a district council opting to switch from one to the other
again i've forgotten the entire erm it's not easy er th the rather complicated UNK about this erm er the great man comes to my rescue as usual burn
he says a local authority can apply to change the electoral system at any time i e a district council but not more than once every ten years
and there must be a sixty percent majority vote at the council meeting in support of the proposal
so you can vote to change harlow could vote to switch to a whole council system
but it would need a sixty percent vote on the council and once they'd do made the switch they couldn't switch back to a system by thirds for ten years
yeah
as i say i a couple of years ago an authority did do that it UNK
it does occasionally happen
so what is the justification of the system
well its supporters say that it's justified on the grounds of democracy
what they mean by that is that the council is in close touch with public opinion
they also argue in favour of it on grounds of continuity s so the two arguments here are one democracy and one continuity
on the continuity point their argument is that under the system of election by thirds you don't see a dramatic switch in the party control of the council
or a dramatic switch in councillors themselves as you sometimes get in whole council elections
in a whole council election er if the ruling party is UNK behind in the opinion polls then large numbers of them will be swept out of office and the opposition will get in and the argument is that then you see a you see a suddenly see then a UNK of policies
whereas a system by thirds means that it's unlikely that the council or at least a lot of councils will suddenly have a quick switch around and you'll get a greater continuity of policy
i think it's a rather confused argument but perhaps
if you if you have elections every year and it's a quite tight one you could get a different party in power each year you could change it each year couldn't you
you yeah er yes i'd er you're quite right at the moment i'm just in a sense presenting the pr you know the arguments of those in favour we we'll make this point in a second yeah
this these are the arguments they present i mean i i'm not inclined to i'm inclined to think they're somewhat UNK these arguments but the argument of continuity is there
on this er further to this point about continuity they make the point as well that a system of election by thirds makes it more difficult for the officers of the authority to dominate the councillors
because you're not gonna get such an UNK of new councillors yeah
people who haven't been on a council before
this is the argument that suggests that senior officers are rather like sir UNK figures in yes minister who take the view that there's nothing wrong with the government except for all these elected UNK that UNK the place up
and get in the way and if only the civil service could run the place then it would be a lot better
and you get a similar view of that very often by senior officers in authorities
one UNK with some authorities they they've got more justification for referring to these elected UNK that get in the way
what proportion of councils opt for a third system
thank you good question i forgot to mention it didn't i
yeah
erm the figure is there are as we all know how many district councils are there
non metropolitan district councils
hundreds
yes there are hundreds about how many hundred
several hundred
several mm
three hundred and thirty
three hundred and thirty three
oh of course
yes
so there are three hundred and thirty three non metropolitan district councils
erm of them two o five opt for the whole council system
and therefore by a UNK of arithmetic we come up with the figure of what one hundred and twenty eight go for the system by thirds
it is a third
yeah it's a third
the argument against the system of election by thirds of course the arguments against are roughly these one an obvious argument is that it is UNK it it's confusing to the public the system of election by thirds is confusing
it's also argued as well rather counter to the UNK of election by thirds that it's UNK
good example in ninety two if harlow council had been a whole er whole council election in nineteen ninety two it's highly likely the conservatives would have taken control
but they couldn't do that because only one third of the councillors were up for election
do you see what i mean
so it's argued that it's frustrating to the er to the UNK it's also argued as well that the frequency of elections tends to produce lower turn outs
yes i i'm inclined to go along with that to some extent i remember once er i think it was eighty four because in eighty four or was it eighty four
when were the last european elections
eighty eight
eighty seven
no
eighty nine
eighty nine
it was eighty nine wasn't it
yeah
eighty four yeah
i remember in eighty four erm there'd been a general election in eighty three erm there'd been one third elections in harlow in erm i in eighty three there was er a gen the general election and another system of election by thirds in eighty four and then the european election being told by one el elderly lady that there were too many bleeding elections and therefore she wasn't gonna vote
but there is that again a confusion so a target that perhaps election by thirds reduces public interest possibly reduces turn out
it's not perhaps it's no accident er maybe those or other factors that you do tend the lowest turn outs in metropolitan districts the big city districts
and there's a not UNK point as well that UNK it's expensive
because these elections have to be organized three years running
and who pays for it
the community charge pays
there's a tendency erm as well to suspect that one reason why many non UNK districts have election by thirds is that they are generally more urban ones and the reason why they go for it is to keep the party machine in a permanent state of UNK
so we could one c er the argument there is that the party political argument in favour of election by thirds
by the way er we may er be UNK to know that erm UNK labour lost the ninety eighty seven election but in it's manifesto in nineteen eighty seven labour proposed annual elections in local government
hm
i don't recall well in fact i'm being UNK because i know for a we know that it wasn't in the manifesto for nineteen ninety two
what the impact of annual elections for local government would be on turn out is difficult to say
i suspect disastrous
but i might be wrong perhaps i'm being too cynical
two very brief points here voting turn out and voting patterns
we can make a very simple point here voting turn out in local elections is lower than in general elections yeah
turn out in local elections is approximately forty percent that figure is covering all local elections
and it's a u k average figure as well but we're talking about forty percent
you've got variations
you get higher turn out in non metropolitan districts than you do in county council or in metropolitan district elections
you get low you get low turn out in inner city areas where the metropolitan districts tend to er tend to be
so the average vote in local elections is round about forty percent
turn out in general elections mid to high seventies
as we've said the most recent election turn out was what seventy eight percent highest for twenty years
erm voting patterns not much to say really on this erm if you want to read up on this there's a little UNK rather interesting section in burn on this in his chapter on local government elections
who is most likely to vote in local elections
well the people who are most likely to vote in local elections tend to be the people who in greater numbers if you see what i mean are more likely to vote in general elections
or to put it another way the people most likely to vote full stop
the person most likely to vote is a white middle class middle aged male home owner
i suppose UNK from that you might UNK then that the person least likely to vote would be a black female working class tenant
there's some truth in that
owner occupation seems to be a factor in more greater UNK to vote
that may be significant because of course owner occupation has increased quite significantly in recent years to the great regret of many of the home o of the occupiers i mean
and whichever way we look at the figures though there is an UNK to vote in local government elections
there are exceptions to this i would suggest that very high turn outs in the er local election local elections in harlow almost certainly because there was a lot of interest in it press interest because of the great battle in old harlow and that appears to have had a spin off effect on turn out in the other wards as well
what exactly do you mean by UNK
by
UNK
well the fact that in a general election situation people will go out and vote
in local elections they won't
if er if i was to further UNK that i would argue quite strongly that a lot of people see it as their duty to vote in general elections mm
erm they don't take that attitude to local government elections
by the way it's not just local government elections european elections as well
i mean turn out in the er in er european elections was er in nineteen eighty four it was thirty two percent and in nineteen er eighty nine thirty seven percent
so less people vote in euro elections than vote in local elections
the question is of course why
you get much higher turn out in local government elections in western europe we western european states than you do in britain
why are people less prepared to vote in local government elections than they are in general elections
let's throw it open
well people don't understand the system and they don't think that things will affect them
yeah
yeah i think that yeah
they're both good points especially the latter one that people don't particularly think that a change in local government will affect them
could we go further and suggest why they think that
got enough power
yes i think there's a tendency to take the view that basically local authorities simply administer and does it really matter who's in power at the town hall
now erm well let me start again people think okay if the conservatives win control alright it might be another fifty pence on night class at the er at the college you know something like that erm it might mean erm a few redundancies in the town hall and a greater level of privatization but s but people tend to think well so what so long as the bins are getting UNK
mm
and after all much of what local authorities do is what
well perhaps i've UNK it wrong much of what local authorities actually undertake is what
what government wants
or even more you're on the right track yeah
but it's more than what government wants
UNK
it's more than it's what the government UNK
most of what local authorities do is in a sense not really party politically controversial because they've got because most of the things they do they've got to do they're UNK to do
in other words you couldn't stand for office in harlow and say for instance erm if erm if we er win the election we're gonna stop the sale of council houses
yeah
this is say labour speaking
or we're gonna we're gonna spend on house building all our capital receipts cos they can't do it
yeah
essex county council the conservatives couldn't run for office there and say if we're elected we intend to er UNK the entire education system and stop financing it
because they can't
at the moment the law makes the law UNK them to do a b c and prevents them from doing x y z
so the spin off on the electorate is perhaps well does it really matter
now community charge may have made a difference but what did government do about that to s in a sense ironically to go against one of their one of the one of the most basic principles of bringing it in
i mean community charge was a factor in the nineteen ninety london borough elections but in nineteen ninety the conservative party was doing very badly in opinion polls
this is just a few months before the UNK of margaret thatcher
but in nineteen ninety in london not only did they hold on they won dramatic UNK in a number of london UNK
UNK where they only had a majority of one they destroyed the labour party
cos there they had a UNK choice then of voting for erm a very low community charge and potentially voting for a very high community charge
and most people chose a low one
but what did but the government in a sense even ended that as a viable choice by doing what
erm rate capping
charge capping yeah
one charge capping which prevents authorities from putting their community charge to over a certain level and two UNK famous budget
well he took it down by a certain amount by putting onto vat
he put it on vat
so in a sense community charge was being UNK down as a factor by the state taking over payment in a sense
i don't i don't i mean i don't quite agree with what you're saying cos you seem to be saying whatever party's in power in local government it's gonna be exactly the same
no i'm not saying
same sort of direction continue to do the same sort of things
yeah i i'm acting as UNK advocate in a sense
i mean these are factors which are given which are UNK out as reasons
it's look we've got a problem haven't we the problem is there's low there's UNK low turn out in local government elections
you've got a couple of you get UNK you got a UNK in nineteen ninety on the community charge when you got a high turn out in london UNK especially yeah
mm
in other areas where community charge is not such a factor you don't get it
but we're still we're still stuck with the problem if it is a problem of UNK low turn out for local government elections
and what i've said is i am in a sense acting as UNK advocate
it's in giving reasons for that
and you're quite right i mean it might be argued that there are big issues in local government still
yeah
whether they build a new recreation centre whether old people have free passes
it might mean it UNK er i suppose in a sense that doesn't matter very much to me but i suppose it might matter if you're sixty yeah
but nevertheless agreeing with you to some extent there are issues in local government there are issues but s even so people don't vote
well it's probably in tory newspapers not to UNK local authorities
but it's always been the case
you know i mean we look i mean it's inter one of the reasons for the nineteen seventy two reform you know one of one of the er factors in it was to attempt to raise levels of participation in local government by making it more understandable
hm
i mean what are the essential differences between european local erm county systems and
well yeah and there's a couple of factors one is a good they may er some of them have got more power yeah
some of them are on a bigger level
there's another interesting factor as well there's a greater participation of national things in local government in a number of european states
erm for instance er UNK leader of the erm o of the erm u d f in france what is he also
mayor of paris
yeah
and you'll find even UNK is actually the mayor of some little UNK somewhere you know some little of housing
yeah
there's a more there's a greater link between national figures and local government
UNK in the united states of course
you know i mean a UNK for running for er president is being governor
UNK was governor in california bill clinton is governor of UNK
these are in a sense although they're pretty big they're in a sense local government type positions
so you know i mean erm you've got evidence from the UNK er survey which produced the UNK report
these are just examples of er of question of answers to questions burn asks the question which i've just asked why then does low turn out persist cos he's just made the point above that there are big issues in local government
there are issues of spending there are issues of building there are issues of direction of the pa of the of the authority yeah
erm UNK quotes some people they're all the same so what's the point
erm sixty six percent of people believe that the people you vote for say they'll do things for you but once they're in they forget what they've said
others blame the complexity of the system
confusion caused by the voting system
of course to wrap this up i suppose there's one other fact that perhaps the low votes in local government could be seen as w either two things depending on whether you're an UNK or a UNK i suppose it's a bit of the argument like if you've got a half UNK and is your glass half empty or is your glass half full you know
erm one argument is that people are making a deliberate and adverse comment on local government by not voting
they're in a sense voting with their feet or not voting with their feet you know they're not they're not voting yeah
erm course on the other hand the UNK could say well the reason why people don't bother voting is cos they're all pretty happy with local government
wonderful art politics isn't it
mm
these are these wonderful arguments where you pays your money and you takes your choice
mm
both could be true
both could be true
but it would be UNK i think people would be UNK if turn out for central government dropped to forty percent
turn out in general elections
i mean the lowest turn out in any of the constituencies in the general election was much higher than the turn out in local government i think the lowest turn out in any individual constituency was about fifty four percent in the general election
and that's significantly higher than the local government turn out
if we become like more part of europe if europe gets more power than er then parliament would have less power well the same thing could happen in the erm central government elections as well couldn't it
could well be yeah
if yeah that's an interesting point
if say for instance one moved UNK down the road to european political union and westminster ended up with something like the powers of UNK district council
then possibly turn out in general elections would be low
yeah
we'll wait and see
okay
the disaster what other UNK that they might
harmful effects to the environment
right now can you think of a particular example of where that has happened fairly recently alison
erm the UNK
the UNK yes and you were you there
so do you know anything about it in particular
well it's not just that it destroyed
and what's happened since do you know what's happened since
well erm of course it took them quite a while that the people
i thought he flew down there
to actually offering aid
or whatever and what's he done then since that week has he actually
he's ceased fire
he really is
yes
because you see once it's gone out of the news erm we don't hear any more about it the immediate distress of the people isn't obvious
yeah because of the
that's going to be long term then isn't it the water
yeah
how far is
in order to help do you know
a couple of hours
right and how big this
will be bigger than our
pack full is it
that's brilliant yes
tom can you think of another match
got anything to say about this one
in russia when we had that
yes
that er nuclear
yes it's chernobyl he was looking for the real word there a nuclear what
a nuclear power station
alright no but the actual ray of the of the plant the nuclear reactor right what happened
do you remember what happened then
well the
that's right
it's still they can't afford to shut it down but should they shut down cos it's very a lot of the works safety standard
yes what's a good word for a
safety standard becoming an
make certain that it's safe
what happened to the surrounding area don't you know
yes and
yes er those that were willing to go
yes
they made the area around the reactor a non living area the problem is of course people that have lived there for a long time don't want to move and so over
intended to stay because the immediate reaction to something like that happening isn't necessarily erm all bad i mean people are quite glad that they are still alive and they're quite prepared to put up with the possible UNK of the consequences of that so that they can stay in their own homes
the reactions after UNK er when the bombed had dropped were erm somewhat strange people with documentation say that people even though they were injured didn't actually want to move away from their home early erm and so that possibly the same sort of thing happened in chernobyl
what about letting the rest of the world know did chernobyl have any effect on the rest of the world with that explosion
damage anywhere else
right if so what happened to that then
and erm acid rain
well that's slightly prospect yes there's something else
what would the world do erm to find out how much damage chernobyl had done
well then did we all just sit there and say well you know don't rot there's nuclear sort of UNK and er oh dear erm what we going to do about it and decide should we get on onto it
they did put
over and see how much
there was and what could we do about it
they actually did send teams of people erm nuclear scientists to chernobyl to try and get just how much damage was being caused and going on being caused but there was i think you probably don't remember because it went right by
UNK has gone out of the news now once something like that has happened there's always another disaster coming behind that actually takes over the headlines so about six months a year two years afterwards they were still finding that in parts of europe the general level of nuclear activity was higher than it had been before chernobyl why would that happen
erm
welsh wales in wales and in the lake district they found that the er level of nuclear activity on the surface of the field as it were and therefore reached the animals is higher than it has been how would they manage to do that
well if doing an explosion i'm not really sure the nuclear reactor materials
right
put into the clouds
the atmosphere
and in the atmosphere and they would be blown over
that's right
yes exactly the government
with the er man with no
in the world
right
and it was because of a nuclear explosion
right
and all the sheep had died and
yeah and what did you get you see you get UNK going on in plants so that you get at the moment when the plants themselves are altered it doesn't necessary mean that they're killed off it doesn't necessary mean that they are killed off it means that the actual genes alter that they go on breathing so you get UNK sort of UNK you know UNK that'll normally be about that size suddenly become that size
that they're the biggest
in the world
now why
i'm not sure but i
no well that in itself that's not another problem
but er the UNK is like is huge and
mm
like twenty
where why might it be that if we're actually talking about this mutation and things have changed it
how do they test nuclear weapons for instance
well not to no they test that for
but they actually have controlled UNK and what sort of places would they need for those
in the desert
yeah not in the middle of manchester or london or wherever they use
they use er a very sort of UNK area obviously and so you do get erm plants and animals having to well change it so that they er you take as it were that the genes changed some does mutation probably alright some probably not
wasn't it that the UNK who about twenty odd years ago had britain test all of their erm nuclear weapons
yeah
mhm
in er sort of scarborough
that's right yes
and it used to be christmas islands where literally they did the first
of nuclear protection and the people that were involved in doing that
have actually UNK themselves in as much as it seems to be that
which is a mutation itself actually is more is course
it is have been associated with nuclear activity
right can we leave that one then the other one that i thought about is probably an oil disaster here we have an oil UNK what was that one off the north of america do you remember where it was
yes that's right and what happened to that
yes an enormous amount of oil and what was
well all like UNK and they would destroy them and
yeah
and the animal life that was destroyed there in fact that amazing picture of the oil UNK that looked liked the sea remember it
yes
yeah
and said that it
in the same sort of way salt water
there was a kind of to the whole thing can you remember it
yeah
i mean it was in a sense beautiful but really
okay can er nicholas go ahead and read number nineteen please
states shall provide prior and time UNK and relevant information to potentially affected states on activities that may have a significant adverse trans UNK
UNK
environmental effect and shall consult with those states at an early stage and in good faith
right
what do you think it means
now take it sentence by sentence what about the first one
i don't know whether if you think there's going to be a nuclear UNK and you have to inform all the other countries in europe and the world or whatever
if we were talking about testing weapons or if we were talking about testing new equipment which involves that then you would
other states as a country and inform other people what about the next bit
take the last phrase at an early stage and in good faith
country in europe so they think they're going to be testing their weapons and for the
tell the rest of europe that they
yes you've got to have an agreement haven't they
and so that and this is how erm states countries actually learn to get on together and trust each other
the UNK thing is it for
is that er we learn we learn terribly slowly to actually trust each other rather than be UNK
can you do the next one james please thank you
women have a vital role in environmental management and development
their full participation is therefore essential to achieve sustainable development
right that's a very
one isn't it
yes
right women have a vital role in environmental management and development
well it shouldn't just be men you know it should be women as well
you can get
in there and er children will grow up
right now what do we call when you say doing it what do you actually mean
erm helping to clear up
what up all the time
well erm it's sort of
that erm there should be there are a chair they are a chair of women that erm that still knows the chairman
yeah
and called the chair person
yes so we put we will be becoming politically correct yeah
we shouldn't erm offered more sort of more
if we actually very quickly which round the world was meant to be erm those of you which are familiar with other countries what about women in say america UNK are they do they participate in the same way as they do here
for instance you've got a you've got er staff here half of them are women would that be the same situation in schools in there
no probably more than that really
right why would you say that
i can't i can remember having a games teacher
being a man and the rest but then he would be
wouldn't you and women are naturally alongside young mature
has anyone got any comment on that do you think that it's a sensible thing to happen or do you think men ought to be UNK teachers
well er at our school it's just like that and then
three or four years into the school
yes
be a games teacher and all that
yeah you don't know my
still in one way in european and north american situations women do seem to have the same sort of job opportunities as men do what about somewhere like africa what about the west coast of africa we talked about UNK and west africa quite a lot what about women involved in there
erm
anybody idea of what that is
or
and erm they sort of work and most of it some of them
walk sometimes walk ten miles just to get two bottles of water
yeah
so you're gonna go and live there tom
erm yes when i when i was living in UNK the women were the one that at the lower end of society they were the ones that lived
they were the ones that organized the mini markets run the
town they would have a minimal allowance of vegetables or meat or whatever to sell it was the women that did the UNK it was the women that actually got enough money to feed the family and the men were really quite an
lot they thought that lot was set below them that the women had to sort that side of things out and they erm really set a great
put in a great deal of their time erm going to work and that could be working for er a european or an american right er some sort of help in the house or in the garden or whatever so you had the men doing the same sort of tasks the UNK as it were for europeans and americans and the women looking after the economic development of that little
do you see completely different to work i mean i tried to imagine my husband me coming in here to work and he going to erm the little sort of erm the maid in
was actually it isn't right it doesn't feel right does it
cultures are different what about india
what happens there
any idea there
erm
i think it depends what members of society we're talking about right if people are educated and they have a way forward to improve their understanding then they become less and less involved with a
day to day tasks right
here when they're talking about women i think james was right women do have a vital role at the beginning in all cultures what i'm trying to say is that they have a vital role increasingly as they become more and more educated too
nick
i think in india anyway i think there's more of the man that do the work because the women or the men makes the women stay at home and sort of sort of make themselves look very beautiful and
how do they do that
and bring the children up very well become great
business men and women
i think of it when we make these great UNK that is
they do all sorts of UNK of things in india combined to make their lifestyle different but they would some people in
if you're rich enough if you have the wife that you want and you've got the children that you want and you've got enough money then you can live that sort of lifestyle if you were obviously quite
er you may never of had a house at all and yet you still got your family
a different lifestyle in fact
we're going to go around actually looking
varied situations in which that sort of lifestyle as possible but the absolute opposite happens within the same city as well
could we just go on to twenty one and we might just sort of stop this part of the lesson there
could you erm read that for us erm adrian would you
which one
twenty one
the UNK ideals and courage of the youth of the world should be UNK to UNK a global partnership in order to achieve sustainable development and ensure a better future for all
right that was a very big statement the youth of the world and you happen to be the youth of the world there's a lot of you so how there you are you're in charge of the world how are you going to do just that
the UNK has anyone got a definition of UNK
prospect of they're not
