have you thought about it at all
no
can you think about it just off the top of your head
don't know
how do you see yourself you've actually left
you've got yourself around the
what's going to happen next
your own team you've got three a levels and they're all UNK what you gonna do
erm
go to oxford
yeah
go to oxford yeah right what you going to study when you get there
i haven't thought about that
what are you particularly good at
erm i'm alright at maths
you're alright at maths so it looks as if maths might as a scientist possibly might be
there you are you're you've got your first class honour degree you're going to do your p h d
right
and er adrian doctor adrian has just got his er ticket for life now are you going to do anything er can you imagine what you might like to work at
no
you have a little think about it i'll come back to you in a minute anthony
well i'm gonna be a lawyer
you're gonna be a lawyer
yes
right and how is that going to help the world by anthony being a lawyer
erm to stop too many criminals be safe and innocent people
right so there's your loyalist family
are you going to work in there or are you going to work in
no
you're going to work in there you've just been given a your standard value which is gross thousand and thousand of dollars now how are you going to spend that money that you've got for
bearing in mind your lifestyle is finished bearing in mind what the sort of thing your father is doing erm where are you gonna live
tell us about being
well erm i put
a majority of
erm i'm not sure you can get can get in a big office
right
and then
right and are you what sort of fee are you going to charge us
would it depend on the circumstances of your client
yeah
okay there was a little bit of doubt in there
there you are you are an UNK person
ha
you're a great expense in english and also in
where
you got to eighteen chosen your a levels you've just finished your a level you got your results and the best way they go to what
all as and what subjects are they going to be in
are they going to be the ones you er like and that means the ones those are the ones that you do well
erm a scientist
erm
and then you after you've
you've got your degree what you gonna do
bearing in mind this is the world's
question
here i am world what's the attitude to the world going to be
er i'll certainly pull a few changes and
yes
so i'll have to think of someone that may need help in
better changes for the
right
yeah i think what has happened at the moment is that he would be almost UNK because there are so many things that are wrong with the world that it seems to be because we get so much information as a
if you watch the news watch the nine o'clock news tonight and try and UNK out how many things you could put into a negative pile and how many you could put into a positive pile and i think that you would find that the negative pile
seventy five per cent way up now there's something in the human spirit that actually says i would like to change that but we really don't want the children to die in UNK do we
we don't want the children from UNK on the streets etcetera because there's sort of an awful UNK about us because we think we're doing one person how on earth can we actually do anything you see if enough people think together that if possible the change happens then it can happen right and you are actually the ones that are going to have to be considering that you are a world's visitor you are not just tom and you're not just anthony right erm you've really got to think what about jayne there you are ideal jayne
right
and i'm not really sure about
what about your life do you see yourself just really
do you think that's the sort of thing you'll like
erm that's
yes
so you think that
yeah
i don't really mind
no i know it's a bit early erm but it's not too early to start thinking that you are a world citizen you're not just jayne and you've got a contribution to make because if you've got this
opinion that you've got this
you're not just giving it just to james
what about you adrian now have we got you into any particular situation are you going to follow dad's UNK do you think
well erm
yes
yes
are we saying that that's us
yeah
i mean would you like to i mean dad works from home doesn't he has link ups with london but he's basically got all his equipment at home
do you see yourself having the same sort of lifestyle now like james
no i couldn't too complicated
right you don't think you couldn't you're not at
i don't i don't think i'd be able to put things together
right
or in this case
right but on the other hand it's early days yet
what about your involvement with anything that might help the world
yes
that might be very useful as long as you didn't er
right well we've not got very far erm what i wanted to do with you next week is going to go immediately onto this programme which i promise i'd let you see and the first one is actually funnily enough
it's er you get film of erm a third world
where the population is far in excess as the
and you then get more film at a modern
somewhere in UNK the central part of it where it's still falling to bits and

that's right
i think you did send this in intending it to be a postal application mr
i did yes
but er your worships the matter was adjourned by your colleagues until today because er mr did indicate on the application form that er he would not be in fact operating the bar himself but that it would be somebody else
so i think your colleagues wanted more information about that so
yes
who will be operating the bar mr
well i erm er mr roger
actually i'll be operating between the village hall and the cross keys and mr roger has the pub for the last sixteen years or so
well our concern is does this gentleman understand the licensing laws
oh yes
definitely
i'll be going to the village hall but i might have to go back to the cross keys that's why i put roger perhaps i put the wrong thing on you see
i'll be in charge of the bar actually
so physically you will be exercising some degree of supervision during the evening will you
oh yes
will you be there er when it's time to close mr
i will yes
oh yes definitely that's right your worship yeah
then this application be granted

sixty four

that's right yes
is the outgoing licensee present
pardon
is the outgoing licensee present
no
why
i don't know
you don't know
well somebody's handed these documents
today
yeah
and the present licence holder is susan
that's right
but sir there is a letter simply saying er she UNK to the er application but there's no indication as to why she's not here
is that lady down there from UNK
yes
she doesn't work for the company at all
what's your role in UNK
supervisor
in this depot in UNK
that's right
are you there permanently
all
yeah
day
yes
premises are opening
yes
what er experience have you got in er the sale of UNK miss
well i've worked for the past two year really
where
i used to work at and then
and how long have you been in these particular premises
er about a month
mr
sir
well no it's just that she said
and er miss do you intend to apply for the transfer of this licence
yeah
has an application been submitted for that purpose
yes
transfer
oh
well i'm not so sure this applicant knows very much about what's going on here anyway your worships
it would appear to be most of this is UNK supermarket
for all practical purposes at this stage sir she may appear to you to be a fit and proper person i've no doubt the licensing committee will want to know a lot more about the situation sir
if i recall rightly i think that it's not that long ago that the licence was transferred to the present holder
you are aware miss that any persons working in that department have got to be of age
yes
and you undertake that will apply
yes
and you are aware of the restrictions on drink for young people
yeah
and the sort of concern about that aspect
yes
well we're going to grant this protection order which is temporary permission to keep your premises open but i must tell you that there will be a lot more investigation before the order is granted permanently and the transfer stands
and we're ordering that the other person if possible UNK
if she's not in the district that will be difficult but if it is possible if she's in the district we order that she UNK at transfer sessions the outgoing licensee
have you got the licence for miss
no
well that it will not be effective until er you produce that licence to this court
erm i assume if that this er if the licensee has left those premises w she's physically left has she now
yeah
er when did she go
she left the company then
mm
i see
well i would have expected those premises not to be selling UNK you've obviously not had a licence for a month
that will also be er considered by the licensing committee at the next hearing
you must produce that licence otherwise it's not effective er miss
see as the licensee you have responsibilities
it's all very well the company telling you as employee what to do but you you're the one who's going to be in difficulties if you don't comply with the licensing laws
the whole UNK not been very satisfactory
and the fact that the licence is not here puts you in difficulty
we are aware now that you're operating without a licence and it's up to you to get that licence here as quickly as possible
er she can go for now
to deal with application listed number forty four your worships please

worships please
excuse me a moment your worships while i write the out
case fifty seven please your worships robert james
he is in the cells your worships take an order for him to be brought up
there are apparently further charges to be put to him your worships
a charge of theft and a charge of handling stolen property
he's only charged with one offence of criminal UNK at the moment
mr
fifty five sir
fifty six
are you robert james
yes sir
and what is your home address mr
is your date of birth
that's correct
are you represented by a solicitor today
should be
is it mr
i haven't a clue
you have all the documents in front of you
well i think mr represented you on a previous occasion that's why i'm asking you now
i don't know sir
my solicitor's in birmingham
mr was duty solicitor on that day
ah
i think he's represented you on more than one occasion in fact hasn't he
but don't you know whether a solicitor's going to be here for the committal proceedings today
i haven't a clue what's happening
i don't know i've no
if you're the defendant one would have thought
as far as i know i have a committal today
that's right
and i would have thought that your solicitor was to be here to represent you
as far as i'm aware my solicitor has been in contact with prosecution to have the case transferred to birmingham crown court
well it hasn't even been committed for trial yet
do you know anything about this miss
i'm afraid to say that i have no knowledge
i haven't certainly myself spoken to anybody with regard to that
i would have thought the normal procedure would be for him to be committed to preston crown court and for the crown courts thereafter to sort out the final venue
i certainly have no knowledge of any contact with regard to the ultimate venue and nothing has been marked on my file
your worships legal aid was granted er on the thirteenth of september to a firm called of birmingham
looks as if they're not here your worships
all i can suggest sir is the case is adjourned just have to arrange for a solicitor to be here
do you have anything to say about that mr
i wish the committee to go along please sir
i've been stuck up in this part
in that case put it back to later in the day sir because the statements have to be read out in court
if he doesn't want to be represented is that what you're saying
what i'm saying sir is to save any inconvenience to the court is that if i can have my committal cos i don't wanna be stuck up in this part of the country
i have a crown court appearance in birmingham and as far as i'm aware my solicitors have been in contact with the prosecution in this part of the country to explain the procedure and as far as i'm aware the committal this morning was to be committed to birmingham crown court with other offences
well you've heard the senior UNK say that she knows
well i
she knows nothing about that
i don't sir
yeah
well in that case sir can i take my committal to preston crown court and when i go to birmingham
if you're committed for trial from this court you will be committed to preston
well i'll take it now then sir
if it is to be arranged
at another court
crown court that arranged that
well in that case sir can you give the committee the funds
as of now
as i say sir we need to put this matter back to later in the day
the defendant would not appear to be represented therefore the committal will have to be dealt with by the way of reading out all the statements
it can't be done
therefore we'll put this case back till later in the day
do you see that mr
because you're not represented
well i don't know what the situation is
well i'm telling that's what i'm trying to tell you
that because you're not represented the statements will have to be read out which will then take quite some time
and they will if you to court which is something you were concerned about
i don't know if you can help that man or not
i'll have a word with him terry
because mr had represented him
mr said before that he thought it was as duty solicitor
he has represented him at some stage as duty solicitor
but he is represented under a legal aid order this defendant by a firm of solicitors in birmingham and he's anxious to be committed for trial today
if you would represent him we could it section six two
otherwise
solicitor present today
not a clue but he doesn't know either
oh i see
he's given certain information to the court which isn't correct anyway
it might help everybody concerned if you could help him
i'll have a word with him sir
yes
would you deal with cases fifty five and fifty six your worships UNK david
mr will represent him
are you UNK david
yes
what's your date of birth mr
what is your address mr
you are charged with two offences the first of which is that at UNK on the twenty sixth of august nineteen eighty eight without UNK excuse you damaged two stained glass windows a picture frame glass and twelve drinking glasses of varying descriptions belonging to UNK intending to damage that property for being UNK as to whether that property would be damaged contrary to section one of the criminal damage act of nineteen seventy one
i understand miss the value has been mentioned on a previous occasion of being three hundred and ninety five pounds
indeed sir yes
right
to that charge UNK david do you plead guilty or not guilty
worships if i may interrupt that though there's some dispute about the damage which was allegedly caused
i have mentioned it to miss this morning and she has undertaken to make further enquiries
er briefly the situation is that it's alleged that he broke two stained glass door panels and mr denies that he broke the second of the two
the one at the front door he says was broken at some time earlier than the evening on which he was involved
unfortunately miss hasn't been able to conclude her enquiries er to UNK the damage and to take instructions as to the UNK of what i have just said
it is suggested er by both myself and er my colleague that the matter should be adjourned for one week
well it was adjourned last week but er instructions your worships
yes we agree to adjourn this case for one week enquiries can be made
sir he does answer on UNK bail today
well bail will be extended for one week
so you know what that means mr you were told this last week
you're surrender yourself to bail next tuesday at ten o'clock
hopefully the matter will proceed next week
can he go your worships
yes he can leave the court
case number one your worships please
peter john
are you peter john
that's right
what's your date of birth
what's your home address mr
you are charged with an offence which is contrary to section six of the road traffic act of nineteen seventy two that you at worley on the ninth of september drove a motor vehicle on the a six seven one worley by pass having UNK alcohol in such a quantity that the proportion of it in your breath exceeded the prescribed limit
do you understand
do you plead guilty or not guilty
guilty
have you got your driving licence with your mr
i haven't got it
why
because well i told the police at the time that er i've UNK it and er
what have you done about getting a replacement
well i haven't done anything at the moment because i didn't i didn't think it was worth it actually
well it says on the bottom of er your copy of the charge sheet production of driving licence you must produce it
failure to produce it will mean that it is automatically suspended and it also means you've committed yet another offence by not having a driving licence here to produce mr
well i wa i wasn't sure whether to whether it would come through in time for the case that's why i didn't
send off for it
i wasn't sure what the situation was
unless the UNK is in the fortunate position of having a computer UNK of your driving er record and your licence record the case won't be able to proceed today anyway
UNK there isn't a UNK of the driving licence
well the case can't go ahead today without your driving licence
sorry the case can't go ahead without your driving licence
how many weeks do you want er miss
your worships i would anticipate that it normally takes at least three weeks for a UNK from a computer to be obtained
this case is adjourned for three weeks in order get a UNK can be obtained
do that mean i don't have to apply for another licence
no what er y er i suggest you don't apply for another licence now you've left it so late
but er i would urge you to try to find your driving licence because
oh i don't think i will be able to but i'll have a look
right well you know you're going to be UNK eventually for this offence if you're convicted
yeah
what the offence er the drink driving offence
yes
yeah
i realize that
you pleaded guilty to the charge anyway mr
the point is that when you are UNK you're not just UNK from driving you are UNK from holding or obtaining any driving licence
so if you've got one at home you're committing an offence by being in possession of it
do you understand
do you understand that
yeah
right from now on you mean
yeah
when you're UNK
don't apply for a driving licence in the meantime
but er you'll be in a far safer position if you actually produce your licence on the twenty fifth of october
can i go sir
yes you can leave the court now
right mrs
er number twenty one sir
john graham
twenty one
yes sir
could you deal with that matter your worships
john graham please
twenty one now are you john graham
john geoffrey
john
geoffrey
UNK with a g
yes
what's your date of birth mr
and what's your home address
you're UNK for a number of offences the first of which is that on the twenty first of june nineteen eighty eight you on the public road namely UNK road worley used a UNK vehicle when there was no excise licence in force
that's an offence under the vehicles excise act of nineteen seventy one
do you understand
yes
do you plead guilty or not guilty
guilty
also that you being the driver of the motor car having been required to produce your driving licence for examination to a police officer failed to do so
to that do you plead guilty or not guilty
guilty
also that you used the vehicle without insurance being in force in respect of third party risks in UNK of section a hundred and forty three of the road traffic act
to that are you guilty or not guilty
not guilty
also that on the twenty first of june you used a motor vehicle at worley on UNK road when there was no test certificate in force
are you guilty or not guilty
not guilty
also that you failed to produce an insurance certificate on being required to do so
are you guilty or not guilty
guilty
and finally that you failed to produce a test certificate
are you guilty or not guilty
guilty
has he produced these documents to you miss
no sir
have you got the insurance with you
yes
and test certificate with you
i've given solicitor
what
i've given them to that solicitor that
well who's your solicitor
it was duty solicitor sir
oh
could you tell mr that he's wanted please wherever he is
i certainly have
would you like me to show them to the UNK solicitor
well if that will save time
nine present offences
please your worships i am satisfied that those documents do cover the defendant for the date in question and i would therefore offer no evidence in relation to the no insurance and no test certificate offences those
right
did you hear that sir
mr those three charges driving a motor car without insurance and a test certificate those two charges are dismissed
er now let's have the prosecution have the facts for the other offences then miss
may please your worships it was the twenty first of june in the morning when the police officer was on duty on the a six eight the UNK road to worley
he had occasion to stop the vehicle which was being driven by mr and he noted that the excise licence which was being displayed had in fact UNK at the end of march
mr was unable to produce his documents in relation to the vehicle which he indicated was his own and he was therefore given an h r t one to produce his documents
but you will appreciate that in the matters that he has pleaded guilty to this morning he in fact failed to produce his insurance driving licence and test certificate within the required period
your worships those are the brief facts
i would ask you to consider back duty of eight pounds thirty three pence that being for the month of may
this says june on here
i beg your pardon
it is in fact for the month of june
right
i'd also ask you to consider costs of ten pounds
you're able to help him now are you
yes your worships in fact i wonder if i may
just a minute before we start but er why are you the back duty for june when his licence finished at the end of march
sir i apologize
i was going by a brief statement made by the officer which indicated that it UNK on the thirty first of march
i think in fact that is a an error on the officer's part
it would appear from the licensing authorities in fact it UNK at the end of may
your worships er these offences arise out of er what was initially a road traffic accident which occurred on the twenty first of june er when er mr 's vehicle came into UNK with er a vehicle that was erm stationary in the centre of the road waiting to turn right
no er allegations of erm concerning the UNK of his driving er are made by the pr prosecution er as a result of the incident but er as a result of the officer's enquiries er it came to light that mr was er in breach of some of the er other regulations regarding road users and er so the UNK which you are to deal with this morning have er have been issued against him
erm and you will be aware that er two of three of the er UNK that are now left for you to de deal with that's three of the four er do in fact relate to failure to produce documents
er failure to produce his driving licence failure to produce a test certificate for the vehicle and failure to produce his insurance document
and what mr says in respect of er those three offences is that erm the officer he accepts did tell him that he was obliged to produce the documents to a police station but he says that he was suffering some shock as a result of the road accident and er he didn't appreciate what the officer was saying to him at the time and never having had to produce his documents at the police station before er he had never er known that was a procedure that had to be followed
and in the circumstances he didn't pay any attention to the print on the er h r t er one form that was issued to him and he didn't produce the documents
it was completely ignorance on his part in that respect
er your worships the one remaining UNK is the one relating to the fact that his vehicle er wasn't taxed at the time of the accident and i think er you will be aware his tax did run out at the end of may and this accident happened on the twenty first of june
i've asked him about that and what he said is that er he was saving up and he was going to tax the vehicle as soon as he was able to do so but he didn't have the funds er to do so at that time
erm he is obviously aware that er by not having the vehicle taxed it's going to cost him considerably more than if he had er taxed the vehicle at the right correct and proper time
your worships mr works for in worley and he works for them as an engineer
his vehicle was erm something that he did use for work but unfortunately as a result of the accident his has been written off and he hasn't yet been able to er replace it and so he's having to be erm er UNK by the company to do his er his work
erm he was using at that time an r registered ford UNK er which was er only insured third party fire and theft
he receives for his employment a take home pay of seventy three pounds per week
he lives with his parents and pays board of twenty pounds per week
he's fortunate in that his employer takes him to work in the mornings but he has to catch the bus home in the evening and a at lunchtime on saturdays which costs him seven pounds forty
he hasn't any other commitments and he would ask that erm he'd be allowed to pay the fine at a rate of twenty pounds per week
your worships those are the circumstances i would ask you to bear in mind that this man ha has four UNK against him purely as a result of really ignorance as far as production of documents is concerned
they were in order and erm he would have produced them had he realized what the officer was saying to him and er that he would have er realized had he not been suffering the shock that he was actually UNK suffering at the er at the time of the accident
i don't think
now mr er you pleaded guilty to these offences and we've listened to what the solicitor has said on your behalf
the main offence of having no excise licence you'll be fined seventy five pounds
you'll be ordered to pay eight pounds thirty three back duty and ten pounds costs
the offences of failing to produce you've been fined ten pounds for each of those three offences
we will order the UNK and costs to be paid at the rate of twenty pounds a week
so i make that a hundred and thirteen a hundred and twenty three pounds with the costs sir thirty three pence
no a hundred and twenty six thirty three
sorry you're right
one two three
eight
one two three sir
under do you understand that er mr
yes
you'll pay that at twenty pounds a week
the officer of the court is agreed the address will be given to you by the court official before you leave
it is your responsibility to make sure that money is paid each and every week
the first payment is due by next tuesday
erm i'm off sick at the moment from work so
so what
so i won't be able to pay the first payment cos you know i ain't got no money
don't you get any sick pay at all
well erm i've just come off holiday and so i won't be entitled to none for the first four days
i see
and when are you likely to be earning again
erm perhaps the middle of next week
give fourteen days for the first payment sir
yes
you'll have fourteen days for the first payment and twenty pounds a week thereafter
so by a fortnight today there's gotta be a payment in
yes
mr
right
thank you
miss apparently you represent mr i notice from the documents from the er UNK it was adjourned because erm their solicitor wrote to say that he would be pleading not guilty
yeah
is that the case
yeah your worships i understand that the er the prosecution have erm an application
i don't know if you wish to deal with this
so who's it for
is if it's not going to be a trial
well your worship
i'll do it now but if it
i wonder if i can assist
it is an a matter where miss has spoken to me about this particular case and it
forty five
case forty five your worship
it's the view of the prosecution that this is a matter that could be dealt with quite satisfactorily by the way of bind over if the court were minded to do that if the court would accept that course of action
i understand mr would be willing to be bound over
yes i confirm that that's correct
yes
well obviously miss the magistrates will need to be satisfied there are grounds why they should bind him over
they will also need to be satisfied that there is a fear for the future otherwise they will not bind him over
i appreciate that sir
you may feel at the end of the day that you need to hear from the officer of the case and he is still present obviously in case the court wishes to
i see
well in that case i will leave it till i'll deal with this a little bit later on
obviously it could take
possibly half an hour or so who else is present mrs
er number forty one sir UNK
could you deal with that your worships please
yes
forty one
are you UNK
yes
what is your date of birth please
pardon
what is your date of birth please
er
and what is your home address
thank you
your UNK that at worley on the twenty fifth of july nineteen eighty eight you being the driver or a motor car on king street and an accident occurred where injury was caused to you failed to stop in accordance with section twenty five of the road traffic act of nineteen seventy two
do you understand that
yes
do you plead guilty or not guilty
well i did stop because i tried to avoid him
well i'm sorry are you miss or mrs
pardon
are you miss or mrs
mrs
mrs the court cannot enquire into the circumstances at this stage
all the court wants to know is are you pleading guilty or not guilty
mr has handed me your driving licence
mr as duty solicitor have you seen this lady
yes i have seen her sir
have you been able to advise her
well i have advised her that erm er implications of the erm er of the offence
possibly i could just have another word with her
right it might help her
now i'll ask you again mrs to that offence of failing to stop in accordance with the requirements of the road traffic act do you plead guilty or not
erm can i also introduce you to the fact there erm UNK i will explain briefly about er UNK presence here
longmans the well known UNK are producing something called the spoken corpus which is er a record of the way in which english is used
erm which
yes erm the aim of the exercise is to record several millions of words of spoken english and they translate them into erm a work
i bet she's a friend of yours
and are translated into a work for academic and study for the purpose of general knowledge about the english language
erm i took the liberty of saying yes to UNK to come along and record the language debate
i must stop using my words so carefully
yes
and erm
shh
it is anonymous
it's merely recording the words we use are taken down on a scrap of paper context i don't but used
the there is nothing
and erm and erm i would really formally ask the board if there is any objection to our deliberations being recorded and taken down and used for another purpose
if there is anything that comes up and one feels sensitive about then we can ask for them to switch the machine off
UNK
okay
thank you
if i could just put it over here because it'll be i think i i'm a little bit far away over there
would that be okay
yes
erm i can possibly
yeah put it near roger he does most of the talking
well i did gather that
if i co if i could just put it there
right
it doesn't record does it
mm
it doesn't record UNK does it
no there's no camera
right
right
and if i sit here tape runs out i'll see it and click
right
it's running now
thank you
well we don't have to pay attention to it and er it's not necessary to record every word is it
you want a selection of things and
we'll just pull out
we don't have to speak at it or anything
no not at all
no
no
right
to the agenda
erm apologies for absence
erm er mrs jackie is not coming
er i think he's in london he said
or at the UNK centre i'm not sure which
somewhere down south anyway
anybody else
no
oh yes sent his apologies right
er minutes of the previous board meeting
the sixth of may
take them matters arising that aren't on the agenda
minute by minute
so if anybody has anything they wish to raise perhaps they could raise it as i mention the minute
ten ninety two eleven ninety two twelve ninety two well can i just say that the process of replacing er people on maternity leave is progressing
andrew has been appointed the temporary UNK
he came from the er amongst other things inland revenue and er very welcome addition to staff and er has quite a good grasp of many er sort of national bodies and institutions and so on and is very helpful and is settling in very well and well liked
erm the other posts interviews are progressing
we have made as we intended to do if you remember we er advertised widely in accordance with our equal opportunities policy er for that post but also i think in accordance with equal opportunity we wanted to give people the er chance to develop their range of skills internally for some of the er lower grade posts and therefore er initially the other posts er have been advertised internally and we filled the temporary er assistant administration erm post er internally
er that is deborah who is er works in reception
erm and we are now moving on to fill the senior customer services post
er we did erm er go through the selection procedure with internal candidates but were unable to appoint and so therefore are advertising that in the press in the normal way er although both candidates have been told that they may UNK
erm and then there's there will be obviously a knock on effect in erm depending on who's appointed
and that's proceeding according to plan
no more UNK to report
not as yet no
UNK quite enough
erm minute thirteen ninety two
twelve three actually
i just did twelve ninety two
i see
there weren't you want yes
that one
oh yes
right so twelve three er just to report that channel four have actually er renewed their sponsorship for the film festival yet again
er
still got to be there for it
well but they did say in their letter
that this will be the last year because er from next year well irrespective of whether they're UNK i hope our sponsorship money won't be UNK with it but
that's a good word to use
it is isn't it
yes
we use it a lot in these meetings don't we
er that irrespective of their se UNK and other UNK erm or UNK er they are going to sponsor us this year but not in future
and erm the only other outstanding sponsor from last year was northern rock and that has been a bit of a qu a problem because er it's we haven't had a closing gala event which might attract them but just recently erm paul who as you know performed last year with his band so er well er is had rang me and said that they are doing something in UNK and they could in fact take the boat to hull rather than to UNK and bring it here and i'm so i'm working on the assumption that we might have that
it's a film called seventh heaven which is about a love affair in the UNK in nineteen twenty seven
UNK of paris incidentally in nineteen twenty seven
oh that's alright then
and it's UNK and i think therefore may suit er the board and guests of northern rock er very well
er and hopefully i can attract them to that
we'll have to see if we can or not
i don't know
if not we'll try UNK water
yes
good idea
thank you
erm thirteen one
th there isn't a erm a note on this one
do you want to discuss this now or later
well we
under attendance report
well i yes
come to on that one
right
thirteen two fourteen one fourteen two which you're reporting on later
yes
fourteen three
yes i erm i would like to point out that we are looking er very closely at the sales and i've just had a report on my desk from the head of finance which is the beginning of the discussions in the management team on er the sales erm and relation of loss of sales to profit and so on and the now we the shop is in that position we've had time t we have more time to assess how things are working out
we shall be analyzing that and i shall be reporting back to you in due course
fifteen sixteen one will you be reporting on anything here
no
later on
erm
anything you want to
don't think so
erm yes there is one thing there
not later on i i'd like to do it now
estimates were sought to replace the UNK counter and erm indeed we went ahead with one of the estimates and the firm then went bankrupt in the meantime which erm i imagine is something colin that you're well used to
occupational hazard these days
er so there will be er a loss to us there of about three hundred pounds because erm we were asking for something to be made and therefore i think i would say quite rightly but in view of this experience perhaps never again er made some advance contribution you know to the cost or made some gave some money in advance blah
that erm it might be wise or UNK i'd be interested to hear your views colin and others perhaps even council procedures you know on how far you can go in checking out er because i mean you know you get something which tells you what was happening three weeks ago
and actually we've had a very full report from the auditors which makes extremely interesting and somewhat UNK reading
i suppose er thank goodness we didn't er invest any further money in their operation
but i mean really if the auditors don't put point out some of these things like the level of directors' salaries and the level of erm ongoing deficit and blah which now come to light i don't see really how we can ever hope to discover them
but it
well i mean it i mean it happened in circles in the
oh yes i wasn't er
in the civic centre there was wasn't there a case where leisure services bought er terribly
it's a UNK subject that
oh right
it was some such very similar situation but it involved a lot more money than you've lost
i hope
i er yes
in that connection i think perhaps what we could UNK say
just by way of comparison for rough guidance that there is a regulation or something like that which says if i remember rightly that erm er payments must not be made for either services or goods not supplied above a figure of two thousand pounds without er being taken to committee first
mhm
council discretion
so there is a check built in to the to the council procedures
which you
mm
you might like to think of
not the figure of two thousand i suspect
yes
but a figure appropriate amount
well we do have in front of us don't we the paper
mm
about the financial controls and erm
but erm
it's an UNK situation is it
presumably the materials that were bought not are still there
the UNK got to dispose of them at some stage
mm
did the assets all disappear
er without going back to the report i have no i can't remember the fine details
i mean you know
i'm just reporting to you er i mean i don't think it's worth
list of UNK
considerable discussion
we'll go on the list of UNK and if there happens to be any payment at the end of the day you will
that's right
get a proportion of it
yes
i doubt whether there'll be penny in the pound
there won't be secure UNK like banks and so on will get
the only thing i would say is never pay for anything in advance particularly construction
yes
mm
and especially in the current climate
mm
and if they ask you to it probably means they're in trouble anyway
yes
mm
yes i think that's wise advice
yes
well i mean you know
well the minutes perhaps you'll we will pop that on to our comments and others
erm just briefly erm the adjustments to the toilet for the disabled and the
yes they've all been done
however talking of UNK you know i mean this is er we could make it er something else then happened which is a lorry went into it
so er and ripped off some letters blah so that's ongoing you know it's going to be replaced and the er people who did it admitted liability and so forth
you will notice we are now the UNK
no joke
something or other
is that project now finished or does this retain the
yes it is apparently yes
and so therefore i think it would be appropriate er to deliver to you the report of UNK and partners for your information
yes thank you
we'll have that for the next meeting
yeah erm sixteen two we will be discussing that draft
sixteen three sixteen four
what did you decide
well i decided really or we decided i suppose to er link it to the festival
er and therefore erm i think we'd like to some degree wait and see a bit still because er i think that you know economic circumstances of this particular moment mean that we may just have to consider that further of seeing how things progress really between now and october
i certainly don't think with the sort of product we have at the moment that there will be any possibility of raising prices before then because i mean you know there just aren't any really films which are going to grab people
er but at the festival it is an appropriate moment
whether we would go to the full two fifty i think will have to be you know we'll have to wait till nearer the time
right
erm can i have the proposal that was a correct record of our deliberations please
thank you john
a seconder
thank you UNK
agreed report
i wonder if we could ask we could take the other reports first chair
er attendance
yes
report and the management accounts because there are a number of things which have since these minutes er completed and we'd like to bring up in the report but er i think that we'd be as well to look at the
i have no objection
and if we took the attendance report first in relation to that then we can look at the material presented in the way to which you're UNK
but in response and how UNK that er colin is with us today
in response to er particularly colin but other people's requests for ah
hello yes
er
i've just missed hearing my name taken in UNK
again
yes
will you be able to share papers because er erm and therefore those papers which we're about to discuss you had your admissions if you brought your papers with you yes
sorry i'm just can i just sort this out before i go any further
yes
admission reports you had in the papers sent to you
well roger
and what i'm saying is we're just UNK the we're going to do the attendance report financial report and then the chief UNK report because there are a number of issues which i'd like to raise within that
and in respect of the admissions report er as you will recall er colin and others thought that perhaps more information might be useful or would like er to see different ways in which the computer reports er on the er information
mhm
erm and yes sorry er
yes
and i'm therefore gonna hand round these UNK of alternative erm material
i've got one of those
you can see on the front what is on offer
they need to go right round
and i wonder john yes
right
that's right if you send it right round
a copy
right we're alright
you want some
there we are
UNK hasn't got one
i wonder john if you would just like to introduce er jenny to the board
well jenny is my colleague under the new department of published and UNK arts
joined on the first of june and is each other initially to and also as a general of what goes on
and then we are to allocate between us so responsibility
jenny you're very welcome
and we yes i'm not sure whether we're published or UNK i think we're probably UNK aren't we
never mind
well i hope fairly broad on these figures but er so what we have here er as i understand it is a broad series of options
yes
as to the information that can be produced by our computer
and really erm it's a question of what board members would find the most useful and erm and
that's right
on the front of those options which are numbered in red there is a break er there is an in you know explanation of what is there
clearly any or all of these are possible but erm er naturally you would understand that if you had them daily by film you would be having you know ninety pieces of paper er and clearly that may not be appropriate at times well times you know hundreds by the looks of it now but usually times ten at least
erm and any of these things could of course be brought to a meeting to be referred to
erm the thing which we keep daily is number six is it
number six which is the thing that we have to look at
er this is the end of the day report and that we keep in a file and they could be brought
and that would give you all the information erm on a daily basis which could be referred to erm performance by performance
what you have now is an extract if you like
in other words it's a new it's something which is not done directly from the computer but which is using information the computer provides
it then erm is made up into this chart by somebody
i would like if possible not to do that any more cos clearly that is just a UNK of material already elsewhere available
and if it were possible for you to decide that one of these options one to eight were to suit your regular and usual purposes at these meetings for general discussion then that obviously would be both a saving in erm time and labour and is one of the reasons why one UNK equipment so that you don't er then have to do it all UNK as well
obviously i would be very UNK to agree to have to now provide different information again other than that which is going to be readily er available through the computers
but of course could do so if you so wished
it doesn't tell us how tall individual
no
i was worried about that and er i think that's because it's a german system and everyone is assumed to be over six feet anyway or six feet wide or something
whether this stuff is available on UNK because it seems to me what really matters are the trends
er i don't think one would ever have the stomach to go through all the detail
and even looking at the figures we get now i mean others here will take a great deal of interest one's interested in knowing where you're going and what's you're looking at those figures yourself anyway
i would expect to get the broad picture and highlights and examples of
and that's what i would have thought was proper for the board to know about
i think beyond that you're getting to very detailed analysis which will take a lot of time either yours or ours
and i would i would i would erm give the minimum and preferably use your own references
i think if you were to use another sheet altogether it would be for me at least unnecessary work
i think first of all we have to satisfy ourselves don't we that we're erm fulfilling our cultural obligations cultural policy
erm given that is the case what is what is the next thing that we need to know
are we making the most of the films that we show
are people er responding to good films
er one of the things it won't tell you on here whether it's a UNK hot day whether there's snow on the ground or whether it's just pouring dull and people are coming along
so there's there are a number of variables which we will never know about
but i think colin your main concern wasn't it that perhaps we weren't hitting the right slots and
use of plant i think was one of the things you were concerned about
sorry
use of plant i think really wasn't it
one of the things
er it was where break even points were
and what level of attendance was required to actually break even on a performance
and i don't wish to know if we've failed to break even on one occasion or whatever but the thing is how often are we failing to break even
and looking at that in relation to cultural policy
now is there a connection or isn't there a connection
the other thing that concerned me was particular slots which don't seem to ever produce much in the way of attendance or revenue
and whether we had to keep running those slots
and i agree i don't want to UNK through everything but i think we need to lay down management information criteria and only receive information if it's necessary on those headings
i e do we need to know that the trend is changing or do we need to know the particular slots where we get non performance
and i appreciate and i mean i've discussed with you the UNK or you've got to keep open certain hours because you've got a catering facility and you've got certain members of staff and you've got to keep UNK occupied etcetera
but it did just my quick UNK every time we got these there always appeared to be a slot where it didn't seem to me to be worth being open and operating
mm
because it was such a disaster every time
and while you were while you were using a film which you had in anyway for the next day's performance and putting in that slot
mhm
it was still costing to stay open and operate
yes
er i mean they're the kinds of things i'm interested in knowing
i don't want to know the UNK de well sometimes i personally do i'm interested
but i wouldn't have thought everybody would want to UNK through it at all times
i i'd like er to personally take this away and have a think about it
mm
there's a lot of there's a lot to absorb here and er i wouldn't want to make an immediate reaction
yes i i've had these for a relatively short period of time
erm my i haven't had the time to really absorb what is in them and obviously the board would feel the same
erm perhaps if it might be useful if er members took it away
and thought about it
if they had the opportunity of er looking at it seeing what there is to be learned
er if there were holes in the information or whether really whatever board members feel and erm we can consider it at the next meeting
mm
yes
it's obviously not of er not of a great pressing not a very pressing matter
it's something which we can have the luxury of considering
just following what i raised earlier on chairman
is it possible supposing you decide you want to have a look and see how well the two o'clock showing if there is one as such
mhm
can that be UNK can you can it do bars back analysis
erm
from tapes or whatever it is you hold on
oh we do hold the information
i would need to check with the erm er computer manager you know which fields are UNK you know how i don't know if you know computer re how computer records are stored but every piece of information like erm the admission figure the title the UNK will be a field and i presume if er any information like the time is in a separate field then you would be able to have a report by fields
if you understand that
mm
erm so therefore i would say in er theory er my understanding would be that yes we could know whatever you wanted to know about particular fields like every two o'clock over a period of a year or whatever
erm i couldn't er you'd i'd need warning of that of course
well obviously if we take these away there might be questions
i mean it's exactly how you do it with television what changing patterns are there
wh what i mean to say is i couldn't in advance guess which field it was that you were going to want at any particular moment
oh no
do you see what i mean
because you would want one i hadn't got
erm but i you know if you said i think you see i think what UNK raising is a very interesting and important issue and i naturally you know as a senior manager i'm concerned about it
that's what you know running any business or organisation means
you are concerned to fulfil every requirement or factor in relation to erm er you know the principles which that particular body or particular requirement lays down
either those of the market place or of those of UNK or of your own cultural aims or equal opportunities or whatever it is
and so therefore at any one time we are working i mean that's what we do you know we are working at one particular area
it might be say at equal opportunities which we've worked at a very great deal over the last year
clearly you can't expect admissions of people with disabilities er for example taking one aspect of that er cultural and er that policy to be high if you know the building itself is physically UNK
so that has to be worked at and then you know would begin to look at whether that has any effect on your admissions and so on
and you know along with marketing and so on we are we're continually looking at all aspects of that
now my UNK my er erm thought would be that in reviewing the management accounts in general and the admissions in general you are keeping a UNK eye on that
and i you know should be and i hope am UNK you to areas where er you know we are falling short
or where we are concerned or putting in extra work and so on
erm the particular issue which colin raises is a very important one
erm and er it could be that we could look at that
i mean it would be interesting to do that
you know er given enough time and preparation and if we define clearly what it is that we want to analyze you know i can provide that information er in the form of a report or in a UNK state and we could discuss that
for example you know like erm is it worthwhile opening a cinema at four o'clock would be an interesting question
and at the end of the day quite considerable potential changes could arise from the results that you might UNK
for example you know currently you know our shift pattern with the UNK for example you know is generally when they're not on holiday that they're in at er ten o'clock and they work through till eleven
not the same people but you know that's the shift pattern
erm and therefore of course there's maintenance and preparation and all that sort of thing
and at the end of the day you would be into relating what people do in their job descriptions to whether you were getting value for money from those members of staff
and you'd be into time and motion and so on which i'm sure UNK you could erm appreciate and comment on as well
and yes it erm i mean and therefore we would be reviewing current practices which is that erm you know the film is in the building the cinema is open the staff are there and we therefore show a film at four o'clock because there's no extra charge for us doing so and we hope thereby to attract however many er UNK to see it
and of course we're offering a service of allowing people to choose to come at four rather than six and we are making ourselves accessible to single mothers who perhaps can't come out in the evening etcetera
so there's a whole range of things there which we're doing
and at the end of the day then you have to weigh up whether or not you decide that even though if you like in the UNK financial terms it is not profitable to open the cinema and to employ staff doing that although presumably they'd have to be employed doing something else unless you changed their UNK patterns nonetheless because of your the demands of funding bodies your own cultural aims and equal opportunities policies you've decided that you will do so even though it's going to be marginally a loss in financial terms
but of course that is a discussion which would be quite proper and er for us to have and for the board to take a view on and er for UNK to comment on and so on and so forth
er and it could be done
but what i would say is that we should perhaps er you know identify areas where we think we might erm where discussion would be UNK and then we could UNK the information if we if we wished to
i mean you know whatever it is that you would want i could do er in theory
given enough time to prepare it
and therefore any trends or any queries er which emerge from you know whoever erm can be examined and erm discussed
the only the only other thing i mean the other thing which occurs in my mind and you know as you know it isn't thought through and i want to look at what statistics are now available is i mean the question of increasing shortage of good product
mhm
which seems to me to impact on the same thing
if we're not gonna have such a good range of product and we've already got some what might be UNK slots
mhm
er and is that gonna become an increasing factor as we continue down the shortage of product
i mean it just seems to me an area which i think i would like to have a bit more information on
i'm not saying i'm not drawing any conclusions until i know but i'm saying i think it's an area that is perhaps worth investigation
mhm
and i would be interested just to know how many performances don't actually break even
and is there a regular pattern or is isn't there
you know is it completely variable
or are there certain slots are there certain times certain types of product
we did if you remember colin we did erm produce some figures about break UNK er which i gave to you and
yes
which are in the minutes
but of course to some degree you've got to decide what you mean by break even in the sense that er how do you actually i mean that
take the subsidy into account or not
yeah
and how do you proportion costs and so on
and we
yeah
i appreciate that
we came up with a number of figures
erm and clearly you know they are of some use
er and at the end of the day you have a figure which you then can offset against what you think your corporate aims and er your other commitments in policy terms
erm and i think that it is a very useful exercise to discover which things you know fall below that break even point and which things are therefore if you like internally subsidized or which we do for one reason or another
and you might well argue of course that if you are UNK films which have no cultural merit or whatever then why we are doing this and that would be a question to ask
but erm i feel perhaps we should do it at least over a period you know rather than
oh yes
you know er
er that's what i'm saying
if we if we decide what it is we want to look at and there is a consensus on that and then you look at it over a period of time and see and see what's revealed by it
and whether it varies or whether it's consistent
whether a particular UNK in there
er but i mean basically at the end of the day i mean you have to think about to what extent you can increase your sales
mhm
to what extent you can increase your subsidy
erm and sponsorship
and er to what extent your fixed costs are inevitably going to continue increasing
yes
and somewhere in there it may be that something's got to give perhaps
erm and i don't know whether that's the case either but i think all those factors are rolled in together in terms of future strategy
and er those are the terms i'm thinking
but i mean i'm just UNK here at the moment
yes
i mean i think i agree with you and er clearly these are management concerns
i mean these are the things which you know are our are our daily er exercising daily our minds and erm
i mean all we go back to is
UNK
is when i first raised my question on that with all those things at the back of my mind i wasn't finding that as we used to get it
no
particularly helpful
and so
no
we're obviously now in a position where we can do a great deal more in terms of analysis
mhm
which is i think where we finished up last time that when we've got the stuff on computer we can
yes
UNK
that's right
so we'll leave it at that we erm the chief executive will be happy to receive your comments reports feelings
i'm sure he'd welcome phone calls if there are things that er
yes i mean basically we need to first of all decide i think this is what we're deciding in the first instance which option for the provision of information you find the most helpful
that's the first question to be decided
we can't do anything beyond that at this stage cos we first of all need to have the information
so that's the first question for you to think about and reflect on
when we've reached that we could then think what way forward there is with this er more efficient a provision of information for analyzing it
but i don't think we can really er get to that stage beyond this first one
so i'd be very grateful therefore if er you could put your minds to the options and erm we could discuss that at the next board meeting
can i can i just say chairman finally for point of clarification in case there's any doubt about it i'm not looking to turn it into the into an absolutely like efficient business you know and everything UNK to that
what i am certain about is that there is a long term future for this cinema and that we're aware
yes
of what needs to be done to en ensure that while pursuing the cultural objectives
yes
yes
i agree entirely
i'm not looking for it to make a profit
no
be super efficient it's just that there is a chance of keeping going without too
yes
without having a crisis every other year or whatever
yes this is exactly one of the reasons we had a crisis last time was because erm we didn't know that the then director i'm sure didn't know what was happening
the information wasn't either wasn't available to him or was not understood by him and he wasn't able to interpret it for the board
and we didn't see the warning signs and then when we had this serious situation it er it nearly it nearly UNK us
mm
do we do we want to go all this in the minutes
i'm sure you would er sensibly produce minutes which don't UNK anyone
er may i also say and i'm sure you didn't mean to imply because i would certainly like to think we were super efficient
well pleased
i'd hate to think that wasn't an aim of management
i think it yes well let let's get that clear as well
i think you know that i think this cinema is well managed
yes but it was an aim which i'm sure i would alright
point taken
it's a good aim
i mean i support that aim
right well let's look at the accounts then
the financial report
erm first quarter april may and june have those
we haven't got any
has everybody got those
you've got them
erm has everyone got them
yes
has anyone got two
are they UNK in front of anyone
two different ones
one's
ah
one's called tyneside cinema account budget ninety two
yeah that was last meeting
sorry you've got the last
does that does that belong to the previous
yes
the previous minutes
minutes right
oh right yeah
the one we're looking at now is april may and june
do you have those UNK
no
you don't
no
has everyone got them
good
now erm april was a good month
and may was a good month
june was much less
at the box office this is
yeah
erm sorry i must say
given financial reports
i will finally change that to ticket sales
i'm sorry that this word box office keeps occurring
which is one of my pet UNK
erm sh should we we're entering a slow period traditionally
july and august
yes june nationally national figures of cinema attendances in june were down forty percent
forty percent
on june last year
on june last year
which is a lot
which is a lot
and er
ours held up
well they were down but were they down
yes they were down by six thousand seven hundred and eighty six pounds
er i'm sorry seven thousand five hundred and fifty five on budget but they were down
most certainly
and down on the previous year
the previous year by about er four and a half thousand
on twenty thousand
twenty thousand last year er budgeted on twenty two this year fourteen and a half
the weather the weather was very good wasn't it
the weather was superb yes
i think you'll find all retailers and UNK was were down
not as much as forty percent but er they were down yes
you see the british cinema summer is different to the american cinema summer
as you know american cinema installed air conditioning in the fifties and that re erm late fifties early sixties and that re UNK the american cinema er because people don't go abroad so much in america
they tend to er summer in america and go to the cinema whether they're on holiday or not
but the air conditioning did UNK the cinema industry and therefore the summer is geared to new released in america which is not the case erm in er
er this is not the case in britain which is traditionally a very slow period erm for releases
and erm we therefore er experience with our particular audience mix generally a low july a very low august
that's usually our lowest figure
erm the overall picture as you can see in june is that we revised the budget to show at this moment if this trend continues a deficit of two thousand pounds
i you know how conservative i am with figures and er with advising you as to what may occur i'm myself relatively confident that erm we shall meet our ticket sales target by the year end and that there will be no as there as there's been in previous years since er the UNK not to be noted er crisis
er but er this is the position as it is now and i i've taken the conservative position as always
just a matter of information erm on
floating incomes
no on the revised budget do you just take them on strength or do you do something a bit more sophisticated
erm we're doing something a little bit more sophisticated
which is that we discuss it and see that it would be reasonable to do that
right
er but not much more sophisticated than that
but we don't just simply press a button
right
we all these figures are discussed and we take into account the previous three years
and we take into account what we know about product up coming which isn't always a lot
erm and so forth
a question i would ask is that given the product which you had in june and the fact that presumably you have to take what goes presumably the fact that they don't send you the strongest stuff erm are you surprised that the figures were down in view of the quality of what you had or are you surprised it might not have been worse
i think i'm rather surprised they might not have been worse
erm if we actually look erm and i don't know if we did introduce to all members UNK who is my assistant and who works very largely on the programme with me and on the educational and events side and is acting minute secretary while UNK is on maternity leave
but i think UNK if you er also comment but the films that we had in june like UNK daughter erm and until the end of the world erm and erm some re runs
they weren't particularly UNK were they
no films like UNK daughter didn't have reviews
and cos they didn't have huge national publicity
they weren't very good films really
basically
yeah
yes
they had erm what was it
comedy
peter UNK dressed as UNK elizabeth the first
i mean they you know
and it was a film which really was ill conceived and quite frankly ridiculous
apart from my private UNK which er i thought that might have been
a re run then
yes
mm
er apart from that really there was nothing very strong at all
until the end of the world was dire
er
and was three hours longer
yes
well obviously the customers chairman are sensitive to what is actually being shown
they don't simply come through UNK habit do they
i mean they
well some do UNK
ah
well that's a different matter
that's a UNK issue
but i'm very interested to learn that on monday when er the UNK didn't
erm you know do come along and er see if it made er what difference it made no i'm being a bit UNK but erm there are some people who come anyway
there are some people who obviously come at the weekend more to see whatever it is we're showing
but clearly the majority of our audience is rather UNK and er is making decisions based on erm a whole range of factors to do with the information they receive through marketing and publicity
right
ticket sales
erm any other points that er a board member would like to raise or the chief
no
not at all
the chief executive would like to draw to our attention
anything er UNK in UNK trends in here
i don't think so
no
is that lost next door
er it's upstairs
i'm afraid i can't identify it
mm
oh it's ju yes
can i ask why the education income is
is that is that a sort of er is that an UNK er do you do you get what comes in through
it's the worst time of the year
most educational income comes between october and april
ah
so although the budget is two thousand that's what a cumulative budget or a share of the annual budget
which currently
er three thousand er three hundred is what er we had budgeted to make by this time
right
er this year we actually made three four seven but we're still thinking that we will make two thousand pounds
and in the income does hire refer to hire of this room
not only this room but the cinema itself
right
erm and again the key times for that is usually september to april
right
yes
thank you very much
erm your report
well if i may raise a number of issues under that report
i don't know when it is that you'd like to take this
whether this is an appropriate moment
yes i think
but since we've
let's get that sorted
the erm financial
er i just have a UNK thought oh that was sent out to you wasn't it
yes
the statement of financial procedure
good sorry just had a thought it wasn't
this is something we discussed and UNK out last time
yeah
and should be adopted now unless there are things further things you wish to discuss
or members who weren't here or but we did talk this through in some detail
we took advice from our UNK and er we looked through this er on a previous occasion
it is meant both to set out extraordinary expenditure which was how it arose but at the same time john pointed out that it might be a good thing if we also had an indication of the routine procedures and so therefore they are now set out in one document and are for your er final approval
i read them and they seem to be er a direct record of what we'd er agreed
there is actually one UNK which i put in er just to ex sort of er UNK still further
under emergency procedure i put in the words in the second line after having made every reasonable effort to consult with the chief executive
really to protect members of the management team who might have made a decision
if you remember the screen was UNK by a UNK
well not a UNK but by a UNK
well it wasn't i mean this is an example sorry
oh right
but if it were if it were to be UNK or erm you know and er on monday evening we would have to get a screen we would have to replace that screen immediately
if i were you know UNK in the south of france or elsewhere or wherever you know in dundee erm and not available
the south of france is more likely
ha
would that it were
would that it were
erm but i think that i what i felt was that i should have the right to be consulted and that every reasonable effort should be made to consult me
because as indeed er has happened er sometimes the real emergency is not that of equipment
there is a tendency i hope not of er this management team but there is a tendency of some people who might be employed in future to feel that solutions can be obtained by purchasing and i'm not always convinced that is the case
sometimes there's an under underlying reason of staffing difficulties or disciplinary or whatever which might mean that new equipment will not be the answer
well i there was a classic example of this during the UNK when the contractors had left the building UNK over
mm
over a weekend
and er the decision had to be taken to bring in erm security guards
security guards
only
you were there as it happens
mm
you were available but you later on won't be
mm
mm
and i think that would have been the classic situation where we would we've got a procedure now for dealing with it and i think this covers all and i unless somebody wants to further debate the matter i'll er i will propose that we adopt these the financial regulations for the er tyneside film theatre limited
could i have a seconder
thank you UNK
all in favour
great
could i ask a
yes
UNK question
and it doesn't affect the procedures but four refers to pay cheques
and i wonder whether we should UNK from that whether all staff or a number of staff get a pay cheque
mm
as distinct from salaries paid into
true
their bank account or building society accounts
ah yes
we don't do that
but some are paid in cash
er mm
pay cheques or slips
if they were slips they wouldn't
i don't think i'd
they would decide whether they want cheques which
i don't think that i'd
it's signing the UNK that is
er yes
it's to do with signing of cheques
the chief executive in two is UNK these are monitored by the so that some staff are indeed paid in cash
that those are the only two alternatives
either in cash weekly or by cheque monthly
there are no direct UNK or into building societies or anything of that sort
because we have a large amount of cash which it suits us to get rid of rather than take it to the bank er to be added up and charged for cash handling
so erm i mean i can understand that we have a specific need to er address the member of who signs what cheques but i think the matter of cash is covered by two the chief executive is UNK to a board for financial matters
these are monitored by the board's scrutiny of the monthly management accounts
i mean you must have a lot of cases whereby where you are actually perhaps er a taxi needs to be paid for to take
mm
somebody
well that's cash out
there must be lots of cases where you are actually paying the window cleaner cash in hand or something
i assume i mean obviously there are routine matters which are paid for and recorded erm in the normal way
is it does that
is that alright
still cover your point or not
not quite
the real question is why don't we pay staff er direct transfer into bank accounts
why
we don't wish to
you half explained anyway
you actually have the cash turning over
we don't wish to because it is not financially sensible for an organization which is cash rich to take all the money to the bank
to pay the bank daily to do things with it and then to start adding to those costs which a bank charges by using all these sophisticated methods when we can in fact do what most staff want which is to give them cash in a little brown envelope on a thursday
i mean i think it's i mean i have personally asked this question a number of times and pressed for everybody to be paid properly in inverted commas i e monthly but this is an assumption about a certain lifestyle and a certain way of budgeting which er i don't think we have necessarily the right or you know it's not necessarily our
oh it's got to be the choice of the er
and most staff actually prefer cash weekly
there's only two members of staff who are paid monthly by cheque and i'm one of them
that that's fine as long as cash handling to salaries does not give you an additional security or handling problem
i think you've covered that by indicating the nature of the cash handling for the whole organization
i mean i've learned something
mm
i don't think it does in that erm
how often do you handle it
i really don't know
three times a week perhaps
twice a week
i'm not sure
no i mean our bank handling charge is very significant
mm
yeah
i mean if you bank every day it costs you a fortune
mm
but i would have thought you could have got away with banking once a week
i don't think it's quite once a week cos the weekend which means you have quite a big build up on a monday which you want to get rid of
don't want in the building
well we only do it twice a week
i think it may be twice a week
i mean i
i mean you did a big you need a big safe
you know i'd need to check with UNK precisely
and it varies
i don't think er i mean you know there are certain s we're covered to have certain sums in the safe by insurance and we don't exceed those and so on
i mean you know i could find out if you'd like to know
yeah isn't you you're much more labour intensive than we are aren't you
well i would think our UNK are higher than the cinema
in general
no
and we get away with twice a week
but you possibly have security and so on
extra security
or you may use a firm even
well no
well the money's collected by a firm and taken to the bank
yes
and that's another reason we only do it twice a week
yes
well we don't do that
we do it ourselves
we did look into UNK but it's far too expensive
erm right
the next thing er which again er is er a detail of something which is already approved and it is merely than in our conditions of service during our discussions with the city er personnel department we noted or they noted as it had arisen that we indicated the route to erm sick pay over a certain period and before a certain period but not the detail of how you got there
and so we've merely spelt that out on the second page of our standard conditions of service
and erm er that is for your er for you to take note of and er to formally to approve if you would
you have these standard conditions of service of course
oh
already because they've been approved by the board
has everyone got one now
no
yes
one more
one more
these you have and these have been approved
i'm sorry it is getting rather hot in here
do we have the keys to that
i think it would be wise
yes
if you wouldn't mind
well if you want to just ring and ask someone to bring them
there won't be anyone there
there won't be anyone to ring
we are addressing which
er we are looking at page erm
hundred
er well it should be page two but in my er UNK i may have i notice mine is in the wrong order
but anyway you want the heading sickness
and we're just looking at the route to in the previous er conditions of service we merely mentioned the time for which you weren't entitled to sick pay and the time after which you were entitled to full sick pay which we defined we didn't define the route
i've now defined the route taking advice from the city personnel service
so you just need to look at that
yes
those length of service stroke related sickness pay
agreed
right
so these conditions of service then are those which apply to all current and future staff
and these conditions apply from the first of april of this year
all members of staff have standard conditions of service as set out here with the exception of temporary staff or staff who are er on a short time contract or maternity leave cover who may have a short term er notice er erm for erm a period of notice
and with the other exception of the chief executive who according to his er conditions of appointment has a three months notice period
everyone else sorry this is the er security blind
everyone else has a standard period of notice
and everyone else's contracts are therefore according to these conditions of service
okay
thank you
yes
but if you if you're in a UNK jenny or john say so
but it does help us to get some
i'm not in a UNK where i am i can assure you
get some air into the building
the other period erm the other thing i would like your advice on erm did you didn't note all this
oh i'll give you all that it's alright
er the other thing i'd like your advice on is that the coffee UNK franchise er is due for renewal in nineteen ninety three
and according to the erm agreement which i made with the UNK in june eighty nine erm his rent is also due for review er this august
now erm i e now
however the er holder came to me and said that they he would like to invest a considerable sum in new equipment UNK blah
and so therefore as we did in our case would like erm some indication o er of whether or not er he could and this was his suggestion er give up his current lease which runs out next year and take on a new lease with us for a period
erm and accepting that would mean er obviously an increase in rent and perhaps changes in that lease er in order that he would be able to er to invest that money
now this is clearly something which some of you have great erm knowledge and expertise in such as colin
and i'd be very grateful for your advice
for what it's worth my own advice would be that we i erm as you remember increased the UNK for the er coffee rooms from four thousand pounds when i er took over the post of chief executive and er to seven thousand five hundred in july eighty nine and we've increased that yearly to a sum of twenty one thousand one hundred and fifty pounds per annum er from the first of august nineteen ninety one
erm my advice to you would be that in the past before the coffee rooms was run by this particular person firm we had very great difficulty with them and i'm sure john will bear me out on this
and in fact the coffee rooms not only were not profitable but i think at one time were even subsidized by the directors' own pocket which just how UNK some people can be
erm that was in sheila 's day
but it never was profitable
indeed was er i think a UNK in the flesh to say the least
these people have hit on a formula which seems to work
erm er in my opinion they are a very good tenant and a very good person to work with and they certainly are very cooperative with the cinema
erm i could of course and will of course erm take advice as to whether the rent we're now charging them is reasonable
we do have to bear in mind that our rent has increased er our own rent to morgan estates and so on
and this you know is acknowledged
but my view would be that i would er you know investigate this fully and er come forward with a recommendation but that er my own er thought would be and i now take your thoughts that we should not get ourselves erm launched into a very big massive erm you know operation of advertising this franchise UNK and going through the whole procedure
erm particularly at this time
but that we should continue with this particular person
but i would say that we should obviously look at the financial aspect of the review erm dates which might be yearly
we should look at the length or the term of the new franchise which should perhaps be limited to three or five years
er whichever could be negotiated
and we should look also i think perhaps at some quality factors er which might be written into the lease since there are some things which i think we're all less than satisfied with er you know customer complaints and the way they're dealt with
the time it takes to be served and a number of things
and of course all that is a play off against you know keeping that UNK er involved and keeping them feeling that they can still make a profit
and that you know not tying them up with endless UNK regulations
but i think there are a number of things er which would need to be taken into account
what i would say overall sorry if i may just add one further point is that the coffee rooms makes a profit and pays its bills very promptly to us
it is not necessarily the always i think that the type of operation which a certain sector of our audience would necessarily want
i e it doesn't always serve the food which they would like
particularly you know it has to be said there is a particular age class background and so on and so forth
but that it does satisfy a need for a vast number of people who may be rather younger and poorer than er we who sit here
er and erm that is of course a large section of our audience also
so er i don't think we should attempt to shift the coffee rooms into you know a nice health food UNK restaurant which might suit us because it thereby wouldn't fulfil its function which from our point of view is to provide a service and
i think basically they're doing the job that the public want cos they're successful
they're always busy
i mean yeah if you come
yes
come in the middle of the day or whenever you know they'll be busy
it's amazing
well it is quite true that if you come to eat before you see a film you have to ask if they can do it in time
mhm
yeah and sometimes they've said no
i i've been here before and they've said ah sorry it's gonna take ages
i mean you know
i mean at least they're honest but er
i think if you're happy with them but there are some minor points there's it's going to be a new UNK is it
sorry
it's going to be a new UNK
they would give up this current one and we would
ah well it gives you the chance to get to increase the rent if you er but if you're happy with them as operators er you can boost your income for the year
er i wouldn't be as generous with them as our landlord was with us
no
certainly not
and if there are elements of the operation that you're not happy with er if there aren't any catering regulations in the UNK well you can introduce some
mm
mm
which will then gives you a chance to control their operation when you're not happy with it
so as long as you you're thinking that they're doing okay and meeting the market demand
er you could improve the terms
get er an increased rent earlier
get some regulations imposed on them
i think it's a good idea
i mean i think that my principle desire is that they pay their er they contribute to our income and pay their rent regularly and are able to do so
er together with if you could tie those two together providing a service to a section of our customers
they don't clearly provide a service to all our customers
erm and
they never will
that would be difficult
they never will
no
yeah
erm but they do provide a regular and safe income
well nobody ever does
yeah that's right
but there are particular areas like this you having to wait a long time and if you come into the building to go and see a film and you've left an hour to have some food you really shouldn't be missing the film because
yeah
i mean i would imagine that they can pr they can with your assistance create something whereby they can say there will be a meal and it will be
if you make that part of the UNK the
you can try without UNK them
er t to a degree which makes it not worth their while being in the business
i mean
yeah
but if they have a if they have a some sort of fast food provision in the menu with a limited choice
as long as
mm
and he could say right you want a UNK right
well UNK baked potatoes
my view is that this has to be negotiated with them and i would be very UNK for us to start imposing erm
yeah
i think what you've t what you've taken from us is the view
yes
that there is a concern about the ability to eat here immediately prior to seeing
they're may not be time
well one person raised that
yes
two
well just you know if they if they were sensitive to that sort of thing
i mean i'm i know to ask
yes
when i come in if i can have UNK eggs on UNK and see the film you know
the trouble is er
but strangers don't
there is no way there is no way
there is no way of ensuring that our
no
this requirement is ever met
yes
i know it
so this is the problem
if we start laying down so many things
i agree with you
yeah
and i think the quality and that is one of the quality of service quality of er route of complaints and so on
i would like to see those things built in
but even though they guaranteed to provide every customer who had allowed three quarters of an hour er for a meal you know you would have to lay down in very great deal wouldn't you
you may have a UNK egg but you not have a UNK egg with UNK
i'm not considering no
i'm i what i what i'm seeing
what i'm seeing with this is the opportunity of raising particular issues
yes
if we're going to enter into a new lease with them
yes
of course
by er failing even once to meet a reasonable demand for a for something to eat in a short period of time then there's a knock on effect to our business
and i think that's something which we have a right to raise with them
so erm
they might not be aware that er there is you know that there could be customers who
yes
who haven't been promptly served
the building
yeah exactly
they might they might not be a hundred percent sort of aware of these things
can i suggest that they probably simply do not know they work in a particular way a particular level
and i suspect that if we offered them counselling from cater good catering advice on how to UNK their market return they'll do it because i wouldn't hang about for a meal if i knew that they wouldn't give you a meal in fifteen minutes i'd go and eat somewhere else
you er
there's no shortage of fast food
if you allow if you allow an hour for a meal in the coffee rooms
well that's good for a isn't it
you might just catch the film
yeah
okay well er if the market you know you're live in a market world
if it gets a bad reputation people won't come and they will suffer
i think the interesting thing is the five card erm is the UNK you play or the UNK you play and how much to raise the UNK
yes
i mean the point is
he's doing alright isn't he
you
as i say it's all gotta be subject to you negotiate with him
yeah
but if he's not willing to pay a market rent
mm
well then you're gonna have to say UNK
mm
yes
i
don't they also have problems with the with the er the drinks
you know i mean
that's a licence question
how many people have walked out because they can't have a drink
well they can't
it's a licence
but with you know people with their meal or
mm
someone who doesn't want a meal but just wants a drink but all the rest of the people are having a meal
well they can't
i've seen loads of er
yes but they can't
and that
yeah
that's the law
yeah
we can't ask them to change the law
they could apply for a bar licence of course
that's another issue
there is a bar licence attached to this building
club bar licence UNK
club bar licence
yeah
but it might not be a bad idea to go down that route to see if we can we can see if it can be exploit it at this stage because we have discussed and i know this is getting off the UNK
yes
UNK but erm
i think
no but it's not
about giving them too much advice
i think
yes
what the fact is that the place is packed
they succeeded
the fact is that many majority of people know that it
yes
takes a long time
see a lot of the people that come are students who've got who have got time
fact is that
that sounds awful
but yeah they have got time available
the point is i think that the prime thing to remember is that the s the customers in the coffee rooms are not necessarily customers in the cinema
yeah
that is the fact of the matter
mm
and i'm afraid there is no way you can you if you try and force the UNK to be more a sort of UNK that people who come to the cinema will UNK then it will not make a profit in my view
it never did
if you actually allow it to be a UNK in your premises which hopefully will also satisfy some of our customers then apparently it will make a profit
but i'm very UNK to attempt to force it to be something other than that which it is
because that which it is profitable
but i'm also very anxious that we receive a full percentage UNK of those profits and as you can see i over the years i've been very UNK in ensuring that we do move towards that position
that that's er a straight rent is it
i don't understand that term
well it's a straight rent
what
except in
what i was going to suggest is that we should s seek to negotiate with them a turnover rent
you could
a base rent or turnover rent
could try that
yes
you could try that
what i don't want to get
so as they increase in sales
yeah of course
or as you increase the customer at the cinema which increases their sales you take a share of it
that is okay when things are going well of course
ah we have a base rent
yeah
yes
which you get anyway
mm
whatever happens
it would be a way to get faster service wouldn't it
yes i mean those things are possible
it encourages it encourages them to increase their business as well you see
yes
yeah
what happens if they were to say no though in a negotiating position and they just we'll go
you know we've actually got somewhere else and so on
i mean yes of course i know i know about negotiation but
but that but that's the whole thing i'm saying
er you want to keep them because you think they do alright and
yeah
pay you on time and all the rest of it
yes
so what you do is you open negotiations with them on a new lease
yeah
and you see what improvements you can get
yeah
and if they're not prepared to pl play the game or pay the going rate well then you review it and think how far do i push them on this
yeah
and how far do i not accept what i think i might get in order to remain on good terms
yes
i d i don't want this to be UNK but i think erm we are aware of susan
is this a UNK
no
it is a family organization
it's a UNK a UNK
yes
and erm we are we
is that good or bad
yeah it's very good
i mean we may not necessarily be talking about the reporting procedures on turnover which would enable us to assess a UNK rent in the
oh i see
mm
mm
mm
ah well you've got a computer system now which is UNK than anybody here
or you have
well i mean you know turnover rents can be run without a comp without a UNK till
you just insist you have access to the books at any time or you send your accountant in to check
i wondered if there was a
everything has to have a till receipt
you can check the till rolls which have to be kept
i mean there's plenty of ways of doing it
yes
erm i was wondering if introducing that might make a
yeah
be making them changing their way of operation which they might find UNK for reasons
yeah that's right
which
yes
perhaps we can go into
as they are a family operation
you don't need to minute that
anyway yes
well can i can i can we leave it perhaps that erm we that the chief executive has received the er good advice of the board and will negotiate on the basis of the surrender of the
yes
would you like me to report
old lease
to whom
i mean would you like me to do this or would you like me to report
i would prefer to a committee of people who have experience
yes
er because you know if we wait till the twenty eighth of october er that you know won't suit their purpose which is that they would like to get on with this so they can invest in plant renewal
i would prefer
well we could do
to take advice particularly from you colin and from anyone else
john
i don't know or anyone who feels
shall we do the f and g p route
right
er where we'd inter UNK er colin on to the f and g p for that so you get the opportunity thank you very much you get the opportunity of reporting to us what you've done
so we can say yes
or
can you let me have a copy of the lease as soon as you can
yes
thank you
erm right so the we agree to delegate to the f and g p the of the existing lease and the taking on of a new lease UNK for the coffee room tea room operators
thank you
erm
what would you like next to address
distribution report that's about it really
what
distribution report
er yes
erm roger's very keen on this
erm
oh yes
oh as i think i mentioned last time we have had a marketing er survey undertaken
particularly in relation to distribution and when
publicity material not of films
yes
no of our marketing and UNK print and so on
when that's settled you know through the various committees well various
through the management team and erm when marketing had a chance to reflect on that i i'll report back to you what our thoughts are
and indeed the report of course is available if anyone would like to read it
it's a very good report which was done by a graduate student from the university of UNK on placement and er involved a lot of field work
and i think it's a very fine piece of work for which he received a first class mark incidentally
good
er the university of UNK or newcastle
is that newcastle brackets carlisle campus
right yes i am keen on that because i think er one of the keys to growth in our business is to attract more people and to attract people you must tell them that we're here and what we're doing
i think that i think it's a good first step
erm equal UNK
er nothing to report on that
er i i've already reported on the maternity leave cover provisions
is that a standing item on the agenda
yes
it is
yes
erm so er
oh actually sorry if i could just add a little bit to that
no need to add anything further thank you
that's all
but i will nonetheless now you've
now you've UNK my memory
we are putting together a UNK er body of documentation which
foreign word
alright an appalling word
we are putting together the documents and er UNK er notes on recruitment selection procedure which will be followed in all cases in the cinema
it will be an ex expanded version of that which er we had further we had earlier approved in our equal opportunities policy
but much more detailed and as a result not only of about twelve days' training which we've undertaken in that area with the management team or various of them but also of our experience over the last eighteen months in operating it
and i we've been UNK on a number of occasions on that procedure erm by various public bodies
erm and we are now if you like putting it into a form which anyone can use irrespective of whether they have done the training
although of course we'll continue with training everyone who's likely to do it
but as in the case say of a temporary UNK coming in he'd be able to or she would be able to take up this file and use it
and it covers i hope most UNK
erm and i will bring it to you finally when it's in a form to be adopted as the procedure which this board will use erm either you know or delegate er the chief executive to use in the case of any appointments
thank you
and under any other business are we
well just
yes
erm er i'm
equal UNK
proceeding with erm investigating the er educational dimension of the cinema it's funding and staffing
erm we used at one time as you remember to have a full time education officer and er for a number of reasons er that er is no longer the case
we certainly have not ceased erm to undertake educational work and erm i do from time to time er do a number of reports on that work for er our funding bodies and er recently i've done a report requested by northern arts for the arts council i believe
erm a cultural diversity report which lists for example the events or and film erm which relate to erm that aspect of our policy
erm courses events day schools special UNK programmes er educational marketing back up and so forth are always are a central and crucial part of our work
but erm it is my design at the earliest opportunity to erm extend er that work through more specific and increased provision er with er current er staffing erm levels erm borne in mind
i'm at the moment negotiating with a previous sponsor an s k bearings europe limited who have a plant at UNK who are very interested in looking at erm supporting our educational provision
and there will be opportunities to apply for support from the british film institute and elsewhere erm in order that we can expand er what we're doing in that area and i just wanted to let the board know about that and to say that erm er this is the route that i'm currently taking and erm i will be reporting to them when there are specific developments and that i hope that you approve of er me attempting to expand our provision in this area
good
thank you
any questions
any other business
could i just remind members of the board of the next two meetings which are at the bottom of the er a agenda and were given to you previously of course
you should have them in your diaries but as we have such a full UNK this evening can i just draw those attention er to your attention
twenty eighth of october and the annual general meeting on the second of december
i would also actually briefly under any other business you have the days of the dates of the film festival
yes
the opening gala on the third of october saturday
and the closing gala on the eighteenth of october sunday
can i also draw your attention to another date which is the thursday the seventeenth of september which is the regional press launch for the fifteenth international tyneside film festival
some of you i know are working but some now roger are people of leisure and will therefore i hope er be able to find more space in their diaries to UNK the glass of er cheap wine and er raise it
indeed
beer
of expensive beer and to raise it in our er support
where's that held
that is here at this cinema and er usually consists of a film show and erm er presentation and then of a UNK lunch
and we really are very pleased to see you th at that erm
thursday the seventeenth of september
er it will be at ten
ten till two or something like that
it's also very good if board members can attend to er not merely to support the staff er and to celebrate the event but also if necessary to talk to the press or to er engage er with guests and so on and so forth
er it would be much appreciated if you were able to attend
any other business
what a brave person you are to let a board of trustees loose on the press
well we we'll have an army of people to stand by you and guide you and
UNK you should you say anything
notwithstanding there being thirteen people round the table i do not propose to wash any feet and i call the meeting to a close

how long has he lived in harlow
thirty two years
we came here on the ninth of june nineteen fifty
what did you why did you move to harlow
well my husband had a job here we moved from UNK in london because his firm moved from UNK in london to here and erm got so we had to move with my husband because of his job you see
and er but my husband was down here er a good year before we moved down here because there wasn't accommodation available for us to move with i him you see
so erm he travelled backwards and forwards for a year prior to us coming to live here permanently
what did you think of it when you first moved here
well it really was so different from a built up place but er um when but the day that we came in it was mm pouring with rain everywhere was UNK and er of course i there were only erm one part of this town this area rather that had been occupied because all the other parts were all fields
there was just the erm UNK erm UNK and that was the all the area that was built up when we came here
our children had to go to UNK to school
my daughter was of er grammar school erm UNK but we couldn't put her into anywhere here because there were no schools available UNK wouldn't take her neither would er bishop's stortford because they were the only two grammar schools available here and erm my UNK other daughter with many other children er well all the children of the UNK in UNK and the UNK had to travel to UNK every day to school
then the infant school the first class of the infants we had in a hut on UNK road and then we went they came from that hut there to the UNK quarters of mark hall
the o the mark hall only mark hall wasn't there because it had been previously burnt down
so that was our first se good school as you may say then and then within about four years they built UNK and erm we just you know we formed a quite a very good community here because we were all people from different areas we all had the same problems trying to re adjust in a new place and i think then we had more relationship with our neighbours than people are having today
because
yeah
yo you know if we had problems we'd each talk to them and we had of course we had we formed a resident association and we took our problems to the UNK association and we wo you know if we had problems which could be UNK out the man general manager of the development corporation mr would come and listen to our complaints and we seemed you know we got along very well really for such a small place with nothing because the only shopping facilities were in the old town or we had to go to UNK or bishop's stortford you see
mm
how did the people in the old town feel
they UNK us in the beginning but i think as the years have gone by and they have seen the facilities that a new town has brought to their advantage i think they're more acceptable now but they did resent us in the beginning
well i think everybody would that had their privacy UNK like they had been because they'd been a small community for well through the years you see and for strangers to come in i think it applies in every place that you go to new places you know that are built up after it just being a little country village people do resent you but i think now that they are really erm accepting us for the fact that we have brought things that they would never have had the new town not been er sta you know started here
so have you always lived in this house
yes
i came down when my husband was working on the factory site then as i say prior to us coming to live here this was hadn't been even built so we've seen it grow from the floor to what it is today you know
i it really was an UNK it was really was an UNK
what business was your husband in then
he was an engineer and erm he was he made co he worked on UNK and things and then he changed his occupation became a civil servant and he worked at the UNK down on UNK until it closed about ten years cos my husband has been retired about five years now
er
how do you feel about harlow now
i think it's a wonderful place
and i think the council are trying their UNK to make facilities for all ages
i mean when we came here as i say we had nothing our children if they wanted erm any entertainment we had to make our own entertainment which we did
my son started a youth club in one of the common rooms and we as residents we got together we really enjoyed ourselves in our way you know
but er i think people that have got so much now feel they haven't got enough
mm
they want more
but they've got to realise that rome wasn't built in a day
and i mean through the years which this town is about thirty four years old
that's including UNK if you had seen it as we saw it when we came here you would recognise how much work has gone into building the town because i was on the council then i was asked if i would stand for the council which was then only a parish council there was no urban district council that wasn't formed for four or five years afterwards and of course we had to fight for lights everything that er that we needed we had to fight for because there was no lighting on UNK road where our children were going to school and there were little ones
we had to fight for parks swimming UNK everything that we wanted we had to fight for
but people now are coming in and they're expecting everything to be here
they don't realise that it has taken many years to bring the town up to the standard it is now
and very hard working people have had to do the fighting for what we have got
did you have erm any special job on the council
well erm i had different kinds of positions
i was er chairman of public health and various UNK i was chairman of the road safety which i was very interested in i was very road safety conscious and we each were given a job which we tried to do the best we could with and then we well whatever we were asked to do we began to make a good town you know
this is what we were aiming for we were trying to make a town for the people
and for our children when they grow up cos i had three children nearly every one that had come into the town had little ones so you see we were trying to build a town for our children to benefit which i don't know whether you think that it's a town worth living in but i think that we have done very well and it's a town that is caring for such as the elderly they really do care
cos lots of towns and even good towns that yo you would of thought that are better off than harlow would have been would have been don't do half as much for the pensioners as harlow does
i think they are very caring
if o people would only appreciate the fact that you can't have everything you just can't have everything
i mean schools the only thing i was i'd been governor of a school for thirty years that was used to UNK me with the fact that we couldn't get for our schools the things that we needed because to me and to all the people in harlow who have children are concerned that we are being stopped so much money on education which is the most vital thing in our children's lives
without education what kind of a country are we going to have
it's so important
so important
so do you use the UNK
UNK was my very best friend
she came to me one day and asked me if i would stand for the council which i did
i have her book here
she ro did an UNK of a education and she was the most wonderful person that you would ever wish to meet
she fought for the working class she fought for education she fought for everything to benefit the community she was a wonderful person
she really was
do you think that erm any of the UNK been badly designed for the old people
well i don't se i don't think that it has been badly designed for the old people i think the object of building the town as it has been built is to integrate the erm the old people with the young perhaps the young people resent that but i think we have got to have a mixed community in as much as we have got to be aware that old people need attention in as much as they need UNK and if they are not integrated with the community they are going to be i really se just left out on their own which in lots of cases there are very many lonely people old people but if they are put within the community i think the community will look after them in as much as giving them UNK whether the people some people resent it or not i don't know but i do think that they should not be UNK
when you were a councillor was there anything so erm that you did definite to help the old people
well there weren't so many old people then when we came here we were classed as one of the oldest people because er they were all very young people and you were talking about UNK and she came to me one day and she said we're going to have a problem on the town because it's a very young town
she said what do you think of us starting a family planning clinic
because we had people coming into the town that had come out of rooms one and two rooms in UNK in wherever they came from to harlow and there were so many things that they required for their home that they couldn't afford to have big families and pay their way
so we opened a family planning clinic at UNK house with all volunteer workers nobody was paid
the doctors gave their services the nurses gave their services all the lay workers give their services and from one clinic we went to seven UNK in a week
and i was in charge of the UNK
mm
erm how did you get involved with the UNK then
well one day i had a knock at the door and it was a mr from UNK causeway that is the headquarters of UNK
erm i mean headquarters as from UNK the administrative erm part of it i don't know whether you saw the UNK this is your life lady
yeah i know
last night
mm
well UNK was a big home they also have one out at UNK they also had one at UNK but the UNK one were for disabled children
so this gentleman came and he was i said would i be prepared to run a UNK in aid of doctor UNK home
well at that particular time i was already on the council i was doing family planning which took up an awful lot of my time
so he said it wouldn't involve much but to run a UNK does involve a lot of work
mm
so we talked and i said well we would think about it and we would let him know so we collected all the friends that we thought would like to help which were many people were very good to help
and the following visit he made here he brought with him miss virginia she was one of the personnel at UNK causeway she was the miss virginia the UNK of the line and she came and she said that she would help in erm doing some organisation and giving us some insight as to what we had to do because we had never run a UNK in all our lives
so we got everyone together here the bank manager was mr then UNK bank we got two or three of the UNK all of the members that were prepared to help and we started from there
we wrote to oh i don't know how many stars for articles that they wish to give so that we could raise money by them
the catholic school which was the only school available then to us fo with the field that was we which we needed
the sister UNK who was the then the principal sister there she let us have the field so we got entertainment laid on we invited a UNK i think our first UNK was erm i think it was lord and lady and then each time we had a different one we had entertainment the whole time we started about half past two and then we had entertainment until six then we had an interval then we had entertainment till twelve o'clock i even took my piano down onto the field so that we could have music
we raised quite a good sum for the first time and that went to the UNK home
then the following one we had erm lord and lady they came as guests of ours
then we did another one and tommy cooper came
and we've each time we had someone of importance to bring in the people
now tommy cooper he never charged us one penny
all we had to do was to pay the expense of the helicopter that brought him in because at that time he was appearing at the prince of wales and it was a matter of him fitting his time in with his performances you see
which we did
we brought him here ou he changed his clothes from his own suit into the UNK piper and erm then we got him back to the prince of wales theatre
well the money that we raised from there and also from another one was about three thousand nearly four thousand three thousand something and we presented er tommy cooper with the cheque on the prince the stage of the prince of wales theatre but that cheque was to buy a special ambulance for the children of UNK which is the home of the disabled and this special coach had erm places where you could wheel the children into the coach in their chairs with the UNK and those children that could be taken out of their chairs and put on seats put and had their belts put around them and that was the only way that these children were able to get out
then on our next project we raised money for the swimming pool that they required
then for the following one we bought the first meals on wheels van so that with all the money that we've collected for harlow day we bought something out of the money
and we really had a wonderful time doing it
we took the children when we had the bus we took the children to southend that was the first time they had all been out together and the owner of the UNK and the person responsible on the council for the erm maintaining of southend such as the chairman they put the UNK at our disposal
and before the children left they were given a carrier bag with all sorts of things that you could think of and to see the UNK on those little children's faces
it was worth all the hard work that we had put into it because it got that we used to use the town park towards the latter part of UNK day and all the men that we had gathered together used to have to UNK every piece of fence to UNK like it is now the park is UNK now with fencing the men that were helping us did that all UNK
and mis the UNK here they UNK us different equipment and we worked from monday to friday getting the things ready we worked all day saturday doing the show and we worked all day sunday clearing the field
it was very hard work but it was worth it
when did UNK day become the town show
i can't remember erm they took i just can't remember when they took over from us
but erm i don't think that the town show perhaps i was i'm UNK to the fact that we'll be losing money rather than making it but it wasn't anything like we put on for entertainment
nothing at all
they put it on a bigger scale but the entertainment far below ours
i may be UNK but it er we had a wonderful day
we had the american band we had the horse guards from london we brought them all up on the train the horses and the guards and we had wonderful times
what other entertainment was there in harlow at the time
well not very much unless you made it yourself you know if you were the factories used to have their own erm dances and the UNK it used to be the UNK then that's the place in the stow they had UNK yes they had dancing there and they put on competitions for different things and my son with lots of others er did erm a rock and roll thing which needed thirty six hours
and we made our own entertainment that is the thing about it you know
there wasn't much laid on for you because er i think with new people you've gotta get them into the spirit of doing something otherwise you sit here all sitting down doing nothing
this is how we felt
and we had so many good people in the beginning as i say that really wanted to help for to make entertainment you know
erm do you take part in any of the UNK now
not now no
i resigned from the family planning about seven years ago when my husband retired as i say because he used to help me very much and when he retired and my children had all married i felt it was time that i should retire too
i'd done twenty years in the family planning and i'd done twelve years on the council and i'd done thirty years as school governor
so now i'm sitting back doing nothing
oh is looking back do you think that UNK been a successful project
i think so
oh
i think so
but you see the thing about it is we have got a take towns for what we make of them you see we could just all sit back people say they're bored
there's nothing to do
but if you look around there is so much to do
and there's so much voluntary work to be done if people have got spare time to go and help but i don't know whether it's the sign of the times that people only want to do jobs for monetary gain
that maybe the idea but there are so many things to be done by voluntary workers if people would only say well i've got half an hour an hour it could be so much of an advantage to whoever they're giving their services to because we're having to cut costs on this and costs on that an hour or two given voluntary would cover those jobs that we can't get the money to pay for
has your view of harlow changed over the years
my view of harlow
yeah
it hasn't changed no because we er haven't gone back we are going forward all the time
i mean we've had the facilities as we have now in the town centre i mean it has improved this town UNK
we're not only catering for harlow people we are catering for people outside which is bringing money into harlow helping the finance of harlow and i think we are just progressing with the times
we're not going back
if we had more money to spend i'm sure there would be far more things that the councils would like to do but without money you can't do it
and things are very expensive to do
when we say and we've often said it well we could do with this we could do with that like we used to say we wanted the swimming pool well that cost an awful lot of money
to do the town park that cost an awful lot of money
people think oh you can do this you can do that
we could do a lot of things but without the finance you just can't do it
don't think i've got any
aha
more can't think of any more questions
is there anything you'd like to tell us
well the only thing is that i hope that the next generation that is coming along now will appreciate what has been done for their generation because it took a long time for us to get what we wanted for our children and now with our grandchildren are coming along i hope the town will improve with their growth
as the town has grown with our children
and if people would appreciate it and keep it as it should be cos to me i think there's a lot of error in people UNK their places
which is detrimental to the town and we are trying to keep this town as we think it ought to be kept
do your children still live in harlow
yes not all of them
i have erm one daughter living here and a son living here but my eldest daughter is in the united states and my UNK is just finishing her last year of law
so what just i well my eldest daughter away and she's been away this month twenty six years
that's a long time innit
it is a long time
yeah
seems like a life time
have you ever been over to see her
yes we were there last year because my UNK got married
we go quite frequent my daughter's you know
mm
wants us to go over as often as we can and we try and often as we can
the only thing about it it's not very UNK to go there
it's not just like going on a bus and but erm my daughter's very generous and seeing that we get to her and we spend about three months with her
cos you can't go and say well i'm only going for a couple of weeks
yeah
stay for the weekend
yeah
we would like we would like to go every week you know
yeah
but erm she phones us and you know oh i had a car erm letter from her yesterday with er photographs and things like that
mm
and she was saying how well my UNK was getting along in the university
she has just this last year to go and er we hope for her sake everything goes well for her because she's brilliant and as you see i have to fly the flag for her because she's
yeah
she's so UNK you see
but erm we have to fly the flag
but as i say what do you feel as students do you feel that you have the facilities here that could be improved on or
well
are you satisfied with what you have
i think that wha what we've got
well
is very good
yeah
i just can't believe that just things that are ha going to be happening
yeah exactly
out of the sixth from the sixth form that you're
yeah that's right
going to yes we've UNK
the school have
we been trying to fight that but
yeah
the ones above us are stronger than we are as i say finance comes into it again you see
mm
and the thing about it is such as erm well not only UNK that biggest part of school is here the population has decreased so much in the last ten years that we having now to close schools
mm
where we were trying desperately to have schools because we had no schools when we first came here as i say
but now they are closing them we've got so many good teachers out of work where ten years ago we were fighting to get good teachers and smaller classes but now you see we've got smaller classes
yeah
but we haven't got the children to engage the teachers you see
mm
what do you think about the comprehensive schooling
well
i think it's good
yeah i think it's good
we've never known anything different you see
you haven't
no
you haven't known anything different
well as i say my daughter was a grammar school tea er pupil but erm my so UNK i have one now at he'll be twenty two this year went to burnt mill i have another UNK in burnt mill
yeah
i have a UNK now going up to burnt mill and i think myself they couldn't have done any better in the grammar school
yeah
yeah
well
yeah
i mean my sister's school they have right from the start and er they don't i don't think you get a wide enough circle of friends really
yeah
instead just
like stick to your own type
and your social assets just develop so much better at a comprehensive
too much UNK
yeah
yeah
at school
yes well this is this is what the intention of the comprehensive school was in the beginning was to ha let every child have the same opportunity which i'm sure they're getting in the comprehensive school
people do say that erm there are far too many pupils but if you've got the stuff and the accommodation which our school provide they're not UNK
if the if they're provided with the right kind of teacher then i think the pupil will be given that opportunity if it's the potential is there to bring it out but you some of the children don't want to learn well that's not the fault of the school
no
that's the child themselves you see
i mean if you don't think oh well i'd i don't want to be well it's not the teachers fault cos you don't get on
but the thing about it is the school gets the bad name
yeah
you see
it isn't the child they say oh
they're not doing this or that but in lots of cases and i've known of lots of cases where children just don't want to know
mm
you see
so you go are you going now from your sixth form into the college this time
no we'll have finished
no we'll have finished then
you're finishing
but
now
yeah well next
no
year after we've done our a levels

but er
excuse the long
page fifty seven please your worship robert james he is in the cells your worship sorry
so it will take a moment for him to be bought up
there are apparently further charges to be put to him your worship the charge of theft and we charge him with handling stolen property
he's only charged with one offence of criminal UNK at the moment
right
fifty five sir fifty six
are you robert james
yes sir
and what is your home address mr
is your date of birth the fourth of september nineteen fifty four
that's correct
are represented by a solicitor today
should be
was it mr
i have given the you have all the documents in front of you
well i think mr got represented on a previous occasion that's why i'm asking you that
well i don't know sir
my solicitor's in birmingham
my records sir that mr was the duty solicitor on that day
oh
i think he's represented you on more than one occasion
but don't he know that his solicitor's gotta be here for the today
i haven't a clue what's happening
i didn't know i mean i could of spoken to
well you're the defendant one would of thought yo know what'll happen to you
i haven't
as far as i know i have a committal today
that's right
but i would of thought that your solicitor was to be here to represent you
as far as i'm aware my solicitor has been in contact with UNK prosecution to have the case transferred to birmingham crown court
well he has been a bit
if you tried there
did you recognise the chap
i'm afraid sir i have no knowledge i haven't certainly myself spoken to anybody with regard to that i would of thought the normal procedure would be for him to be committed to preston crown court and for the crown courts thereafter to sort out the final venue
i certainly have no knowledge of any contact with regard to the ultimate venue and nothing has been marked on my file
your worships legal aid was granted er on the thirteenth of september to UNK of burglary
well obviously they're not here your worship
well all i can suggest is the case is adjourned for the week we'll just have to arrange a solicitor to be here
i wish for the committal to go along please sir
i've been stuck up in this place
in that case of the day sir because the statements have to read out in full
he doesn't want to be represented is that what you're saying
what i'm saying sir is to save the inconvenience to the court is that if i could have my committal cos i don't wanna be stuck up in this part of the country
i have a crown court appearance in birmingham and as far as i'm aware my solicitors have been in contact with the prosecution in this part of the country to explain the procedure and as far as i'm aware the committal this morning was to be committed to birmingham crown court with other UNK
well you've heard the senior UNK say that she knows nothing she
well i don't i wouldn't have said
i don't know sir
oh
i mean that case then can i take my committal to preston crown court and when i go to birmingham
if you're committed to trial in this court you will be committed to preston
well i'll take it
if
now then sir
if it is to be arranged and that you're dealt with at another court crown court will have to arrange that
well in that case sir can you get the committee then please
as of now
as i say sir we put this matter down till later in the day the defendant wi will not appear to be represented therefore the committal will have to be dealt with by re reading out all the statements
it can't be done simply
then we'll probably put this case back till later in the day
do you see that mr
because you're not represented
well i don't know what the situation is
well i'm te that's what i'm trying to tell you
you'll have to
but because you're not represented the statements will have to be read out
which will er take quite some time and er will
and certainly will if you're reading to the court which was something you were concerned about
i'm not
i don't know whether you can help that man with that
because mr has represented him mr said before that he thought it was as duty solicitor that he has represented him at some stage as duty solicitor but he is represented under legal aid though this defendant by a firm of solicitors in birmingham and he's anxious to be committed for trial today
if he was represented we could do it er on the section six two
otherwise
are there any solicitors present today
not at present but he doesn't know
oh i see
he's given certain information to the court which isn't correct anyway
have a word with him
it might help everybody concerned if you could have a word with
yes
we'll have a word with
could you deal with cases fifty five and fifty six your worship
UNK david mr represents him
are you UNK david
yes
what's your date of birth mr
twenty fourth of the seventh sixty seven
what is your address mr
well you're charged with two UNK the first of which is that at UNK on the twenty sixth of august nineteen eighty eight without UNK excuse you damaged two stained glass windows a picture frame glass and twelve glasses of varying descriptions belonging to UNK intending to damage that property and the being UNK as to whether that property would be damaged contrary to section one of the criminal damage act in nineteen seventy one
i understand this value has been mentioned on a previous occasion i think three hundred and ninety five pounds
yes it is
yeah
to that charge UNK david do you plead guilty or not guilty
worships if i may interrupt the this erm dispute about the damage which was allegedly caused i have mentioned it to miss this morning and she has undertaken to make further enquiries
erm briefly the situation is that it's alleged that he broke two stained glass door panels and mr denies that he broke the second of the two the one at the front door he says was broken at some time earlier on the evening on which he was involved
unfortunately miss hasn't been able to conclude her enquiries er to UNK the damage and to take instructions as to the residue of what i've just said
it is suggested er by both myself and er my colleague that the matter should be adjourned for one week
well it was adjourned last week for him to with instructions your worship
yes we we've adjourned this case for one week other enquiries can be made
so he doesn't have to on UNK bail today
well bail will be extended for one week
well you know what that means mr you were told this last week you will be to surrender yourself to bail next tuesday at er
hopefully the matter will proceed next week
can we go your worships
yes you can leave the court
case number one your worships please peter john
are you peter john
that's right
what's your date of birth
nineteen of the first sixty three
what's your home address mr
you are charged with an offence which is contrary to section six of the road traffic act in nineteen seventy two in UNK on the ninth of september drove a motor vehicle on the a six seven one UNK by pass having UNK alcohol in such a quantity that the proportion of it in your breath exceeded the prescribed limit
do you understand
do you plead guilty or not guilty
guilty
have you got your driving license with you mr
i haven't got it actually no
why
because well i told the police at the time that er i've UNK it and er my is
what are you doing about getting er a replacement
well i haven't done anything at the moment because i di i didn't think it was worth it actually
well it says on the bottom of the your copy of the charge sheet production of driving license you must produce it failure to produce it will mean that it is automatically suspended and it also means you've committed yet another offence by not having a driving licence here to produce mr
well i wa i wasn't sure whether to whether it would go through in time for the case and that's why i haven't
what's stopping you
send off for it
i wasn't sure what the situation was
unless the UNK is in the fortunate position of having a computer UNK of your driving er le holding your licence record the case won't be able to proceed today anyway
and your worship UNK there is no UNK of the driving licence
well the case can't go ahead today without your driving licence
sorry
the case cannot go ahead without your driving licence
how many weeks do you want to
your worship i would anticipate that it normally takes at least three weeks for a UNK for the computer to be able to
and this case is adjourned for three weeks in order that a computer UNK will can be obtained
does that mean i don't have to apply for another licence
no but er ee i suggest you don't apply for the licence now
no you've left it too late
but er i would urge you to try to find your driving licence because
no i don't think i'll be able to because
right well you know you're going to be UNK eventually for this offence if you're convicted
yes
what the offence the drink driving offence
yes
yeah
do you understand
i realise that
you've pleaded guilty to the charge anyhow it's a fair UNK
the point is that when you are UNK you're not just UNK from driving you are UNK from holding or obtaining any driving licence
so if you've got one at home you're committing an offence by being in possession of it
do you understand
do you understand that
yeah
right
do i
no when you're UNK
but don't apply for a driving licence in the meantime
yeah okay alright
but er you'll be in a far safer position if you actually produce your licence on the twenty fifth of october
right
can i go sir
yes you can leave the court room
er so yours is better mrs
er number twenty one sir the january
sorry twenty one

yes
what's your date of birth mr

what's your home address
you're stood up for a number of UNK the first of which is that on the twenty first of june nineteen eighty eight you on the public road way in UNK road worley used the mechanics of the vehicle when there was an excise licence in force it's an offence of the vehicles excise act in nineteen seventy one
do you understand
yes
do you plead guilty or not guilty
guilty
also that you be the driver of the motor car having been required to produce your driving licence for examination to the police officer failed to do so
to that do you plead guilty or not guilty
guilty
also that you used the vehicle without insurance being in force in respect of third party risks a UNK of section a hundred and forty three of the road traffic act to that are you guilty or not guilty
not guilty
also that on the twenty first of june you've used the motor vehicle at worley on UNK road when there was no test certificate in force
are you guilty or not guilty
not guilty
also that you failed to produce an insurance certificate on being required to do so
are you guilty or not guilty
guilty
and finally that you failed to produce a test certificate
are you guilty or not guilty
guilty
has he produced these documents to you miss
no sir
have you got the insurance with you
yes
the test certificate with you
everything my solicitor was outside
what
i give them to that solicitor that i were talking to
which duty solicitor
his duty solicitor's
oh
mr
likely to receive UNK sentences
in this instance
i can't see any harm
would you like me to show the UNK solicitor
well perhaps it'll save time
mm
knowing business effects it
no take them off
yes may please your worships i am satisfied that those documents to cover the defendant for the date in question and will therefore offer no evidence in relation to the protest to these premises but to dismiss them
could i ask sir
yes stand up mr we listening to those three charges and maybe you'll no test certificate in those two
er
now unless there's a prosecution we have the facts for the other UNK i understand
yeah so please your worships it was the twenty first of june in the morning when the police officer was on duty on the UNK at worley he had occasion to stop the vehicle which was being driven by mr and he noticed that the excise licence which was being displayed had in fact UNK at the end of march
mr was unable to produce his documents in relation to the vehicle which he indicated was his own and he was therefore given an h r t one to produce those documents but you will appreciate from the matters that he's pleaded guilty to this morning he in fact failed to produce his insurance driving licence and test certificate within the required period
your worships those are the brief facts i would ask you consider back duty of eight pounds thirty three pence at being called a month of may
i think you'll find
he says
i would like them both to go back from the month of june
i know
i'd also ask you to consider costs of ten pounds
he could have the li you can have your licence back UNK to endorse it with
yeah and er
you're able to help him anyway
yes
i wonder if i may
can i just say before we start but er why that he doesn't call june and his licence for seven months
sir i apologise i was going by this figure made by which indicated that it UNK on the thirty first of march i think and in fact that is a an error on the officer's part it would appear from the licensing authorities in fact it UNK at the end of may
yeah
yeah
your worships er these UNK arrived out of er what was initially a road traffic accident which occurred on the twenty first of june er when er mr 's vehicle came into UNK with er a vehicle that was erm stationary in the centre of the road waiting to turn right
no er allegations of erm concerning the correct his driving er are made by the pro prosecution er as a result of the incident but er as a result of the officer's enquiries er it came to light that mr was er in breach of some of the er other regulations regarding road uses and so the UNK which are to deal with this morning have er have been issued against him
erm and you will be aware that at two of er three of the er UNK that are now left here to de deal with that's three of the four er do in fact relate to clearly produce the documents
er failure to produce his driving licence failure to produce a test certificate for the vehicle and failure to produce his insurance documents and what mr says in respect of er those three UNK is that er the officer he accepts did tell him that he was obliged to produce the documents to a police station but he says that he was suffering some shock as a result of the road accident and er he didn't appreciate what the officer was saying to him at the time and never having had to produce his documents at the police station before er he had never er no known that was a procedure that had to be followed and in the circumstances he didn't pay any attention to the print on the h r t er one form that was issued to him and he didn't produce the documents
it was completely ignorance on his part in that respect
er your worships the one remaining UNK the one relating to the fact that his vehicle er wasn't taxed at the time of the accident and i think er he will be aware his tax er did run out at the end of may and this accident happened on the twenty first of june
i've asked him about that and what he said is that er he was saving up and he was going tax the vehicle as soon he was able to do so but he didn't have the funds and er to do so at that time
erm he is obviously aware that er by not having the vehicle taxed it's going to cost him considerably more than if he had er taxed the vehicle at the right correct and proper time
your worships mr works for UNK in worley and he works for them as an engineer his vehicle was erm something that he did use for work but unfortunately as a result of the accident his has been written off and he hasn't yet been able to er replace it and so he's having to be erm er UNK by the company to do his er his work
erm he was using at that time an r registered ford UNK er which was er only insured third party fire and theft
he receives for his employment a take home pay of seventy three pounds per week he lives with his parents and pays a board of twenty pounds per week he's fortunate in that his employer takes him to work in the mornings but he has to catch the bus home in the evening and at lunchtime on saturdays which costs him seven pounds forty
he hasn't any other commitments and he would ask that erm he be allowed to pay the fine at the rate of twenty pounds per week
your worships those are the circumstances i would ask you to bear in mind that this man a ha has four UNK against him purely as a result of really ignorance as far as purchasing documents is concerned they were in order and erm he would of produced them had he realised what the officer was saying to him and er that he would of realised had he not been suffering the shock but he was actually UNK suffering at the er at the time of the accident
i don't think your worships
well mr er pleading guilty to these UNK and we've listened to what the solicitor has said on your behalf the main offence of having no excise licence you'll be fined seventy five pounds and be willing to pay eighty pounds thirty three back duty and ten pounds costs and for the UNK of failing to produce you'll be fined ten pounds for each of those three UNK
we will order the UNK and costs to be paid at a rate of twenty pounds a week
so i make that a hundred and thirteen a hundred and twenty three pounds and the costs are thirty three pence
erm a hundred twenty six thirty three
sorry you're right
one two three
a
sa
hundred and eight
one two three sir
so do you understand that er mr
yes
you pay out twenty pounds a week the officer of the court is agreed and the address will be given to you by the court UNK before you leave it is your responsibility to make sure that money is paid each and every week the first payment is due by next tuesday
erm i'm off sick at the moment from work so
so i won't be able to pay the first payment cos you know ain't got no money
don't you get any sick payment or
well erm i've just come up and the accident so i'm only entitled to money for the first four days
i see
and when you are likely to be earning again
erm perhaps anywhere next week
well i do think give fourteen days for the first payment sir
yes
you have you fourteen days the first payment will be twenty pounds a week thereafter
so by a fortnight today there's gotta be a payment in
yes
alright
may we go sir
yes you can leave the court now
thank you
back to case thirty one
miss apparently you represent mr er well i notice from the documents with the er UNK it was adjourned because erm their solicitor wrote to say that he will be claiming not guilty
oh yes
is that the case
yeah your worships i understand that the prosecution are making application i don't that you should go on with this
so is it
if it's not going to trial
when they were
we'll do it now we'll take it now
i wonder if i can insist it isn't a matter where and they have spoken to me about this particular case and
go to forty five your worship
sorry i forgot the
the view of the prosecution that this is matter could be dealt with quite satisfactorily by the way of in the court were minded to do that if the court would accept that course of action
i understand that mr would be willing to be bound over
does that compare with that
well obviously miss the magistrates will need to be satisfied there are grounds why they should bind him over they will also need to be satisfied that there is a fear for the future otherwise they will not bind him over
i appreciate that sir but you may feel at the end of the day that you need to hear UNK from the case and if he is still present obviously whatever the court wishes to do
i see well in that case then i will leave it alone i'll deal with this a little bit later on obviously it could take
as you want
possibly
who else is present mrs
er number forty one sir
do deal with that your worships please
forty one
are you UNK
yes
what is your date of birth please
ha
what is your date of birth please
er twenty ninth
and
do you plead guilty or not guilty
yeah er guilty
right
and you're also UNK that on that same occasion you not having given your name and address to any person requiring it at the time you failed to report the accident at a police station or to a constable as soon as reasonably UNK and in any case within twenty four hours of it happening again that's an offence under section twenty five of the road traffic act to that effect do you plead guilty or not guilty
yeah
you're pleading guilty
yeah
and finally that at worley on the twenty fifth of july nineteen eighty you being the driver of a motor car you failed to afford UNK to a foot passenger on the carriageway within the limits of UNK zebra crossing on king street that's an offence under the pedestrian crossing regulations and the road traffic regulation act of ninety eighty four to that do you plead guilty or not
yes
guilty
yes guilty
right now listen carefully to the prosecution
do you have difficulty hearing
yes i'm aware
that be needed
alright well perhaps UNK turn that way listen to lady speaking here
just stand as close to her as you like as long as you can hear what's she's saying that's the important thing
your worships mrs appears before the court today as a result of an accident which occurred on the twenty fifth of july at about four thirty in the afternoon it was on king street at worley and there was only her vehicle involved and a young girl who was using the pedestrian crossing
apparently at this particular time there was a considerable amount of traffic on the road in question and traffic from one direction had UNK in order to allow that the young girl and her friend to cross the road they began to cross on the zebra crossing but as she reached the centre of the road mrs was driving her vehicle in the opposite direction and she failed to stop the young girl in her teens was unable to take avoiding UNK action and she was knocked down as she crossed the road
apparently she then picked herself up and in fact ran from the scene but mrs didn't stop and didn't make enquiries as to who the girl was and neither was the matter reported by her to the police in due course
however the whole incident was witnessed by another driver who took a note of the car number and in turn of course reported it to the police and eventually mrs was interviewed on the eleventh of august of this year she agreed that she was the driver at the time and she replied it's okay but if the little had stopped after the accident i would of sorted things out i couldn't do anything after she ran off
and that it says the brief facts i would ask to consider cost of ten pound
alright then yeah
you heard
ya you did alright
mr was going to speak for you now
yes your worships i wonder if i may assist the court o on behalf of er m mrs erm mrs er has told me that she thought at the time of the incident again was in fact nearer to five o'clock than four thirty and she was driving from UNK towards UNK she had come through the traffic lights at the bottom of UNK road in worley and she was proceeding along king street in worley er towards UNK and sh she has told me that at the time there was a considerable amount of traffic on the road and yo i in fact had that confirmed to you by er my friend er the traffic was sufficiently heavy that in fact the traffic travelling in the direction of blackburn er was UNK was backed up to the traffic lights as far as the zebra crossing and beyond it and so as mrs erm was travelling towards UNK her view of the children on the footpath at the opposite side of the road was UNK by the cars that were er travelling towards blackburn
and so erm it wasn't as though these children ran across an open zebra crossing and she could see the children travelling er walking or running all the way across the er the pedestrian crossing the two children one was estimated by her to be about six years old and the one who was actually knocked down was estimated by her to be about er nine years old and she wasn't travelling at any significant speed at all she was travelling slowly because of the amount of traffic and she says that er the first she saw them was erm appearing from the behind a car and UNK across the front of her car and in fact it was only the one who ran first the older of the two children that she actually hit she hit her with the near side front of er of her vehicle
she hit her and at the same time as she hit her she virtually came to a er a stop because of the fact she wa she started to brake as soon as she saw the children appear er but ne never the less contact was made but UNK for her and for the child the contact was a at no significant speed the child was just knocked off her feet and she got up and UNK to mrs and said i'm alright and she ran off and she was away before mrs had time even to undo her safety belt to get out of the car
she accepts that she then was confused she didn't know what to do erm she didn't think there was any point in getting out of the car which is what sh she should of done she should of tried to make some enquiries about the child er but she er she looked around UNK her shoulders and then carried on her journey because she didn't think there was anything else she could do about it
and then again ignorance er at what she should subsequently have done er then took over because she didn't realise that by having had er made contact with an individual erm it was necessary for her to report the matter to the police and she just didn't realise that was something that she should have done
your worships er there's nothing at all more UNK in the failure to stop and failure to report than that i th that is a true record of the er of the incident as far as mrs was concerned erm and it is something which erm comes about an accident which came about probably through the UNK of the children er running across the pedestrian crossing thinking that they have priority erm and not having regard to other road users er and mrs was travelling at slow speed but it was she was put in a difficult position by the way in which the children ran across the road
erm your worships as far as the personal circumstances are concerned she is fifty nine years old she hasn't worked for the last three years she's in receipt of invalidity benefit similarly her husband who hasn't worked for the last ten or eleven years er is on invalidity benefit
erm she would ask that and fine that impose today er could be paid by her at the rate of five pounds per week erm she er runs a car her invalidity income amounts to forty six pounds fifteen pence per week and she also receives a super UNK payment from her former employers UNK hospital at the rate of a hundred and three pounds per month but she and her husband do have to er to run the home and er and run the house er run the car and she would ask that she'll be allowed to pay at the rate of five pound per week
yep
sit down and watch mrs
oh thank you
sit down there
well mrs you're pleading guilty for these UNK and we've listened to what mr has said on your behalf and we're going to be as UNK as we can in the circumstances
for the offence of failing to stop you'll be fined fifty pounds you're licence will be endorsed with five penalty points
for failing to report you'll be fined twenty pounds and your licence will be endorsed and for failing afford UNK on the pedestrian on a zebra crossing you'll be fined ten pounds
you will also be required to pay ten pounds costs
that's ninety pounds and we will order it be paid at a rate of five pounds a week
so mrs the court will endorse your licence that means that the fact that you have these UNK er against your record now will be entered onto on your driving licence by the court the court will then send your driving licence to the driving licence centre at UNK so that they can er also record on your driving record
you'll get your licence back in about three weeks time from the driving licence centre
you must start paying five pounds a week by next tuesday the court UNK will give you the address of the court but you must make you send that money every week
yes
alright
right
you can go now mrs

right now then
so this is a very special project now okay
really special and you are going to do your bit and you know p c well enough to do your bit
okay
mm
right UNK come here and he's gonna tape recorder everything that's says that is said your voice my voice so we want it all nice and properly done because er they're all gonna make a special project out of it reference to spoken word and the written word so you must ask your questions nice and clearly yeah
yeah
you've all got questions yeah
yeah
because we've got twenty five minutes but twenty five minutes can either drag or can fly by
let's see if we can make the twenty five minutes fly by yes
oh these are a UNK lot aren't you
eh
good
alright then
ready to start
yeah
right let's go
first question
how do you train a police dog
how do you train a police dog
right
before you can become a police er dog UNK
yeah
you have to do two years in the police force anyway you then have to show some kind of application towards it
you are then go on a course and you are selected
if you are selected to go on another course you are introduced to your dog
that's down in er kent somewhere i've forgotten where it is but it's down in kent
while you're there you have thirteen weeks down there which is like three months with th with the dog
if you pass the course down there with your dog yeah
you are then sent back to your force which is a which will be the essex police because i'm a member of the essex police
alright
you then work with your dog the whole time and all the time you're working with your dog naturally enough it's a young dog so you're being tested and UNK the whole time so your training continues
but initially you have to show a skill or some kind of application to be a dog trainer
you go away for thirteen weeks on a course with the dog you're introduced to the dog you're gonna work with yeah
yeah
and if you pass that test you go back to your police force and you are UNK and having tests all the time
well that's how they train them they train them in er what they call public order work in the case of chasing people and all that they also have tracking and all kinds of things okay
mm
is that i does that answer your question
yeah
alright
how many of you have seen policemen wor
shh
have you seen policemen working with dogs
yeah
would you
what do you think
what do you tell p c that you've seen
what did you see
i've seen what did you see nigel
i suppose erm i went to this club went to this club with erm dogs showing erm tracking down er
tracking people down
yeah tracking people
UNK
UNK yeah
was you was er everyone in this class here when a gentleman by the name of erm steve brought his dog here
yeah
oh that's when we saw
do you remember
yeah
yeah well what class are you in now
mr
now what how long how many years have you been here this class
er three years
five
five
five years
yeah
you may have been in they may been in the infants when
ooh think
who can remember that police dog coming here
yeah
well he's still working but cos that UNK a lot older and a lot more UNK
they can't take the dog to the schools any more
he's not so he doesn't like it coming to schools any more
he's a he's a bit like an old man now slightly bit UNK
well i hope i've answered that question
next question
how do you become a policeman
how do you become a policeman right
i can only pass comment on when i went through my training because it's all changed
right what happened was i sent away a letter to the essex police force
they sent me a reply back and i sat an exam
the exam had basic maths basic english in which i passed
i then was sent a letter telling me that i'd passed this exam i then had what's known as a medical to check that i was okay there was no i had no UNK or injuries or health problems
i then did a physical which they made me run a mile and a half did press ups sit ups which i passed
i then had to go and have an interview which i passed
after the UNK
i'm sorry
interview
thank you the in after the interview i went back to chelmsford where is the headquarters of the essex police force and had to do a course for two weeks
after i did the course for two weeks i went down to a place in UNK and i was in UNK for twelve weeks came back to chelmsford did another two weeks and then i was released as what's known as UNK constable a UNK constable
at that time you had to stay with your tutor constable who looked after you for twelve weeks
you went out and about for twelve weeks with your tutor constable if you like they call it puppy walking he was the highly trained policeman and i was the new policeman i was with him for twelve weeks
after twelve weeks they decided i was okay you're allowed to go out and work on your own
and that was how i was trained and that way i was trained seven and a half years ago it has now all changed again
i don't know the full system but you are being UNK and tested the whole time
but the testing period the testing period is two years
within that two years any time within that two years you can basically be given the sack for not coming up to the grade or not coming up to scratch or sometimes they UNK your pr probation for another six months so instead of being a UNK constable for two years you're a UNK constable for two and a half years
yeah
yeah thank you
understand that
but within that probation period you can sort of like get dismissed for any time quite easily
does that answer your question
yeah
hope it does
yes
what is it like being a policeman
what's it like being a policeman
great fun
great fun i really enjoy it
do you know why i enjoy it
because it's not boring
every day is different
like teaching
like teaching
every day is different that's what makes it interesting
because from the age of seventeen to twenty nine i worked on building sites and that got boring so i changed and i changed and became a policeman and i ca became a policeman when i was twenty nine and a half and it's i've enjoyed it ever since cos every day is interesting every day is different every day is unusual
right
does that answer your question
right
what is it like in court
what is it like in court
right there are two kinds of courts that policemen well there's several kinds of court but the main courts that policemen go to are a UNK court where there is what's known as they are magistrates or UNK justice of the peace and they sit there and you have to give evidence
that's quite scary
but the really scary place is what's known as a crown court where you have to give evidence at crown court
have you seen the judge with his wig on
yeah
and the twelve jury
and they're all UNK at you and when you're in the docks giving evidence it is very frightening
i've done it now about four times and i am still scared when i do it
when i've gone to crown court i am still UNK that is really scary cos everyone in the room is hanging on your every word and if you make a mistake you start to sweat your hands go UNK not very nice
does that answer your question
what made you want to be a policeman
what made i wanted to be a policeman
right what made we want to be i wanted to be a policeman when i was very young but never had the courage to do it
so when i got older and UNK i thought i'll give that a go and i've enjoyed it ever since
and now i look back on the years i wasted on the building sites and i should've become a policeman ea a lot earlier cos it's great fun
but perhaps you can perhaps you can kno knock up jobs around the house for your wife and perhaps you can build houses
i'm not that good i'm no d i y UNK even now
yes your question
erm what kind of erm equipment do you use when erm you've been reported a robbery
alright what kind of equipment does a policeman wear right
i didn't bring any of it with me but everyone's seen the tall hat haven't they
yes
that's what's known as the UNK hat that's one that's one
shh
yeah
there's the flat cap that i use in the car yeah
you've all seen that
you've seen the UNK you've seen the yellow UNK jacket the UNK jacket
that's another piece of equipment
my UNK
my radio the radio i carry with me and the radio that's in the car
boots trousers signs as well
who's seen who's seen police signs out the back of police cars that says slow down danger
yes c or another sign that they put up by the side of the road is was you passing this spot this time last week did you see anything
that's in case there'd been a nasty accident say there was an accident outside the school today yes
tomorrow they'll try and put up a sign to ask anyone who was passing if they saw the accident yeah
we carry all kinds of equipment our radio
we carry a little small radio that's the local one so anyone in harlow carrying a radio would be able to talk to harlow police station yeah
but there's also a radio in the police cars that you can talk all the way over in chelmsford which is twenty two twenty three miles away so you can t talk to someone in what the essex police call their information room that's another piece of equipment
another piece of equipment we've got is a pocket UNK we write down everything we do
when i go back to the police station i'll write today that i've been at UNK school all day doing a school visit and a school talk to different classes
that's my pocket UNK and i keep it up to date that's another piece of equipment i use
another piece of equipment i use is my boots my shoes my trousers my clever UNK pocket it's a long thin pocket which i can put the UNK in and it UNK away
i didn't bring it here cos i'm not allowed to hurt my knee yeah
all bits other bits of equipment as well you've got sometimes in the back of police cars you've got UNK and UNK to clear the mess up off the road yeah have you seen a policeman clearing up the road saving people
yeah
driving over it and getting glass in their tyres
yeah
all kinds of equipment
different every day cos everything is different all the time it keeps changing
does that answer your question
great
at the back young man
er what was your first idea of what you was gonna be when you grow up in the first place
what was my first idea when i was little
yeah
i wanted to join the army would you believe but i thought
i want to join the army
i wanted to
i want to but i might change
you might change exactly like i did
my brother's joined the army
oh
i might join the ar i wanted to join the army first yeah and then i changed my mind
well i think i changed
do you wanna be a policeman oliver
do you
my brother's a policeman
yeah a lot of people a lot of people wanna be policemen
i do too
but they change their minds they change they become good at something else
lot of a lot of er lot of people always will change their
like a road worker
like a road worker anything couldn't they
yes i know i'm joining the army
you wanna join the army do you
good for you
cos
beg your pardon
got it down on a piece of paper
oh have you
what's your question
erm why do you have to be strong to be a policeman
you don't have to be strong to be a policeman
you don't have to that's er that's not totally true
you've just gotta have your UNK about you that's all
gotta be erm not clever not UNK i think you've got to have common sense
the greatest a UNK to be a policeman is to have common sense
what's common sense you lot
think about it what's common sense
think
er like if you're really dumb common sense get er
no see
no you could be very clever very clever and have absolutely no common sense you might be still be a very clever person be brilliant at maths but have absolutely no common sense
you might not ha know how
when someone says to you er thirty five pence please for a newspaper you might not have the common sense to realize
you haven't got it
you haven't got it exactly
you must have common sense that's most important
next question
what is it like in the police station
what's it like in the police station right
has does anyone watch the bill
yeah
my dad does
right well
shh have you s watched the bill do you watch them when they're inside the police station
it's all
yeah
it's all UNK and UNK isn't it
and then someone has a conversation with someone else and then someone else has a conversation with someone else and if a man was to walk right the way through the police station he has about five or six conversations and by the time he gets to the other end of the police station he's forgotten the first conversation
it's like miss when she walks from the staff office to here she could have four conversations and when she gets here she thinks what was the first conversation about again
it's like that it's a little bit like it's a little bit like the bill because there's about four or five different conversations
alright
next question
yes young man
what was it like when you had your police dog
i have never had a police dog
i've never had never been on er the special course
a lot of people like it because basically th er when you look after a police dog it becomes your pet as well you take it home with you and you take it to work with you and the u you'll have a police dog for sort of like its working life of seven to eight years so basically you're gonna have him for seven to eight years and he becomes a fa like a family pet
i've never been on the course so i've never had a police dog
yes
why do you want to be a policeman
why did i want to be a policeman
i don't know really
i always i always when i first wanted er when i was at school i always wanted to join the army and then i changed my mind and then i wanted to join the police force
and then i forgot about the idea and i just UNK into something else
then it then i saw an advert in the local paper and i thought yeah i'll do that i'll try and become a policeman
i sent away and passed the exams and i became a policeman but i always wanted to become a policeman when i from about eighteen or nineteen it's just that i UNK the wrong way
yes
what is it like in jail
what's it like in jail
i've never been in jail and i never wanna find out what it's like in jail but if you actually ever go to the police station harlow police station they sometimes let people up there and do tours no one likes being left in the cell cos when the door closes it's very small and it's very UNK and it's not very nice
so if i wouldn't my answer to that is never go to jail cos it's you're losing your freedom aren't you
you can't go down to the shops you can't go round your UNK you can't go to your UNK you're losing your freedom
and even in just the police station in the small holding cells they have it's not very nice
i personally would not like to be held in a c in a prison
i'm not that way inclined i like to go for a walk and have the fresh air on me and everything
yes
where do you er keep all your all the erm equipment that you take with you
right
i we've all got UNK you know like you've got a UNK here for your books and everything
yeah
we've all got a big long UNK where we put all our different coats in and our boots and all our other equipment like a long thing
i've seen it on the bill
that's it yes like the UNK they use on the bill yes that's very similar to that that's where and you and what it's what's known as erm the UNK room or the cha
yeah that's right yes
your question
well do you run after people
have i run after people
yes i do
at the moment i couldn't cos i've got a bad knee but i have run after people and caught people yes
because i'm getting a bit old i have a tendency to get out of breath
but i have run after people yes
yes young man
why do policemen why do policemen need dogs
why do they need dogs because their dogs
their smell
they track down drugs
the class has an answered it for you the class has answered it
they can track people down they're very good
they're not supposed to bite you see they're supposed to chase and bark at someone and hold them there by UNK and hope right that the police will turn up
that's the idea
shh
no you ma don't make it free for all
and because they smell along the floor
that's right the their nose is very
shh
their nose is very sensitive and i if someone wa if someone walks across grass yeah
where the shoe UNK the grass it UNK the grass and releases UNK and UNK from the grass
me and you can't smell it but the dog
can
can the dog can
cos he's got something in his nose so he can smell anything
he's got very he's very sensitive cells in his nose because cos a dog used to be a hunting dog and goes back to being a UNK they used to track their UNK to eat so they've still got that ability and we haven't but a dog has it can smell
next question at the back
erm do you erm drive after people and stop them from driving fast
i certainly do yes but the ma the majority of that is done by traffic police by traffic police
we do we the ordinary shift does that but usually that's traffic police who do it
how many people have you caught
how many people have i caught i couldn't tell you cos i've never kept a record
i've got one friend who has written down in a diary every person he's ever re arrested i don't do that i just i can't be bothered to write it all down
too long waste too much time
yes
do you have to be there for a certain amount of time
that's all down if you're talking about jail prison that's all down to the m remember i went talking to you about the court
that's all down to the UNK
court
to the courts to the magistrates remember that man the judge it's all down to him and the jury it's not down to the police
it's wh that's everyone goes to court because it's down to the er ju what they call the UNK system to work it out what it is
my mother used to be in
did she
good for her
well done
yes
have you any ev have you ever put anyone in jail before
have i ever put anyone in jail right when you mean jail do you mean the police station or prison
prison
prison
prison right
to actually get someone to prison is exceptionally hard
to get what they call big word UNK sentence to actually give someone a UNK sentence is exceptionally hard
i personally in all the cases i've dealt with which is seven and a half years have only ever really gone to magistrates court but i've got two cases going to crown court soon but it's exceptionally hard and to answer your question i actually have never UNK never got anyone to go to prison yet
alright
yes
do you er like are you one of those people like if you hear about a death
mhm
are you one of those people who go to the house of erm if a member of the family's dead
you mean like if say terrible thing to say if someone in the family dies do you mean if i'm the person who goes and tells the relatives the mum and dad or anything like yeah
yeah
i've done that and that isn't very nice
i went i had to tell a lady that her husband had died er about two UNK ago two days before christmas
her husband died in a car accident and i had to go and tell his wife
it must have been before after my birthday then
oh probably then
just before christmas then
yes
if erm a lady if erm a wife is on fire and it was just a wife living in the house
mm
erm would erm if you'd known about it would erm you go and tell the firemen or would the firemen just find out
of course
theirselves
of course i er sometimes people phone up the fire brigade and the fire brigade get to the fire
first
fire first sometimes the police if it's a really serious fire get there first but the real professionals when it comes to a fire are the fire brigade
so if the lady was on fire you'd leave it basically to the fire brigade obviously if you could help the lady get a ladder up to the window to get her out of the room or something like that you would do that you would help in any way you can but the real experts are the fire brigade so we leave all the er real technical stuff to the fire brigade
my br erm my step brother erm lived in a flat and the flat got on fire and they had to climb out the window and jump out
not very nice
not very nice
and the lady UNK him
yeah
it's not very nice because everyone thinks a fire is flames but the really dangerous thing is smoke and you literally can't breathe in the smoke
i've been to a fire where there was a huge black cloud coming out of a flat
that's what happened to me
and it was and you couldn't get near it because the heat of the fire was so strong and the smell of the of the smoke was UNK you literally couldn't get near it and everyone had to come away
yes
well how do you know that someone's UNK something
how do you know that someone's UNK something
sometimes they phone you up
sometimes yes
but you're talking about people who actually do it are you
yeah
right
sometimes they leave their fingerprints there so they get what's known as the scenes of crime officer or what they call like all po well like all forces
but what if they've got gloves on
difficult
there might be a there might be a security camera there that catches them coming in
there might be a witness next door
there might be UNK
there might be UNK there could be anything several things and the all those type of things is what helps the police to try and catch the people
now what i was thinking was erm you know what i wondered was shall we do er a circular game and get yourselves into a circle quickly
shh come on quick now
because we always do a lo we always UNK words in our classes
oh yeah
we're good at collected words
police words
shh
right so that's what i thought we could s collect some police words now alright
and we've gotta go around and you have to think of one word to do with police until we stop until we run out of them
oh i know one
police
right
okay
right i'll just see who's looking smart to start
so i hope you've all thought of one word right if somebody else has said it before you you've gotta think quick and think of something else

what do i know about UNK

right okay then we'll talk about
oh
actually saying that sorry we did start talking about the f b i
the f b i right the f b i who er the f b i who knows what the f b i stands for
what d
wanna say goodbye
what does the f b i stand for
federal bureau of investigations
federal bureau of investigation right where is or where do the f b i work
think about it and no shouting out
where do the f b i work
what country
think about it
i know
america
good lad america
who knows where their headquarters is
where's their headquarters
new york
new york is it
shh who's calling out
wanna say goodbye
fast
becoming a pain
you can join him outside if you want
go
washington c washington d c
close enough
do you know the actual name of the town where the headquarters is
i know
police station
no police station
er
no
hands it's a place called UNK
UNK
UNK okay
erm ou the man who runs harlow police station chief superintendent mick went there about eight weeks ago to the headquarters of the f b i
the f b i was set up to fight criminals in america
what is the famous boss or the old famous boss of the f b i
he's
i know
he's he died a little while ago
john f kennedy
john f kennedy
no
the famous boss of the f b i was let's all say it j UNK
j UNK
and he was set up to fight crime federal crime in america right
so let's work out where the federal crime comes in
at the bottom there's america and america is divided up into states the states of america right
and within the states each state there are towns areas whatever and
villages
UNK anything at all certain areas and they are divided up into small police forces within a state yeah
the small police forces are covered by what's known as the state police so you've got the town police or the county police then you've got the state police and you've also got what's known as the highway police the state highway police yeah
and above them you've got the f b i which means the f b i could come to your state and they would control all the police work but they could go to another state whereas all the state police could only work within one state
have i explained that
mhm
have i explained that properly
mm
have i explained that properly one and all
yes
right
so there's the top police the f b i the state police and the local county police yeah
you've missed the highway
and the highway police are up there with the state police they can go anywhere within the state yeah
mm
f b i state police and at the bottom county police yeah understand that
yeah
which are you
which am i
i'm another one here down at the bottom i'm a county police
county police
because england hasn't got an f b i
it doesn't need one there's not many crimes
america has got pardon
not many crimes in harlow in er england
there isn't many crimes in england
not as much as america
wake up
right there's no f b i no f b i there isn't a f b i in england right
there isn't an f b i in england because there isn't a state police
france have got a state police and i've forgotten what they're called c r s they are what's known as the c r s and they are ri riot police and they go anywhere in the country
england hasn't got it england hasn't got what they would call a national police force
we have got all the little ones the county police forces
if anyone was to take on the role of the state police it would be the metropolitan police force who have got experts and if say something happened in manchester like an i r a UNK left some bombs in manchester experts from the metropolitan police would go to manchester to help out they're what's known as the anti terrorist squad
oh yeah
but they are still metropolitan police officers
make sense
mhm
understand that

they're not UNK they're a radio
we've got two kinds of radio we have one radio we carry ourselves
yeah
which is for local and one in the car which is county wide which can cover the whole of essex yeah
not on them little boxes
not on them little ones no you have to have special UNK to make those little ones go everywhere
yes
hold on a second
shh
if you if you arrest someone for murder would you say suspicion of first degree murder
no
right that's you see you're getting
the american stuff but when you're arrested you are always arrested on suspicion because in this country you are innocent until a cou a court proves you're i er guilty yeah
i can't arrest you and say guilty cos you have to go to court so you would always be arrested on suspicion of murder
cos if you went to court and you was innocent and you got off that's it
the police only enforce the law they can't make the law work the people who make the law work are the UNK
i said did i say that right
UNK yeah big word of the day UNK
you are always arrested on suspicion a suspicion of something yeah
and someone will say i'm UNK you on suspicion of murder
erm if you see the murder happen can you say erm that you are guilty
no
i can give evidence that i s right for say we'll go back to his er idea suspicion of murder i can say i saw him take a hammer and UNK him split his head open he dropped down dead
i could give evidence on that yeah
but i still can't make him guilty
only a judge and a jury can make him guilty
that's why police officers have to go to UNK courts and crown courts to give evidence
but it is the magistrate or a er a crown court judge and jury who make him guilty
i can only give evidence and if they don't believe my evidence he's innocent
if they believe mine evidence he's guilty
yeah
what
erm in america i think it is erm they carry them black th they're black erm things
UNK
they carry around w they carry around with them
UNK
like a UNK
yeah
right they're called a UNK
they're like a long stick with a handle on them aren't they
yeah
there is an i there is an idea UNK to bring them to this country to let policemen cos the UNK is only short use them someone has to be close but these UNK can be a offensive weapon and a defensive weapon
yeah
but that's gonna take about five or six years to come to UNK because all the er chief constables are talking about it and if anything works slowly it's chief constables
they're called a UNK and you can sort of like use them to strike and to defend yourself with them yeah
are you allowed to use UNK jackets
are you allowed to use UNK jackets yes
i wouldn't use a UNK well in certain circumstances i might but i'm not trained to carry a firearm so i wouldn't use a i hopefully i won't get selected to go into a house where i need to wear a UNK uniform
you have to go on special courses to carry guns
what the army
in this no it's a special it's a different UNK
in the army they fire UNK and they have their big powerful UNK and the idea is that the bullet comes through her travels across goes through her and goes into him so there's
one two three casualties so it will take four people to carry her four people to carry her four people to carry him that is sixteen that is altogether twelve plus three fifteen people we've taken out of the battle yeah
whereas a police UNK they wanna hit her and stay in here
because what's the point of hitting her coming through her travelling half a mile
you might hit another
and kill a innocent person
and we don't want that to happen and we have different kinds of UNK that hit her and stay there
oh like them er put out ones what like the UNK
totally different
totally different
we just want it to stay there different UNK different power and different altogether
we don't we just want
the guilty person shot we don't want the guilty person shot come out hit the innocent person
yeah
cos we would be in trouble
yeah
agree
have they just got UNK
well you're watching the americans again
you've been watching the americans they cos the americans why do american police officers carry guns
self defence
no
self defence but there is something important that allows american police officers to carry their guns
it's not crime it's got nothing to do with crime it's got nothing to do with UNK and indians
it's got nothing to do with self defence
cos you can cos er other people can buy guns in america
he has his moments
yeah
he has his moments doesn't he
yes there is something ticking away in there
right
under the c under the constitution of america big word constitution of america it is written into the constitution of america all i think it goes all UNK men UNK men and men can bear arms for their country which basically reads they can defend their country they can have a gun in their house to defend their country
but what it meant is it got read written into the constitution it meant that everyone can buy a gun
so if everyone's got a gun
what even a ten year old kid
well we've think about it common sense
the UNK gotta carry the gun because if everyone else in the country has a gun the policeman needs a gun
yeah
makes sense
because it's written into the constitution that all men can bear arms to defend the country
so everyone goes out buys a gun and when a policeman says why have you got that gun
er if there's a war i'm gonna defend my country with that gun
it's a load of rubbish but everyone does it everyone carries a gun
but there was but each state
has different legislation yeah
each state has in some states you can be eighteen and carry a gun but in another state you've gotta be twenty one they make all different laws
