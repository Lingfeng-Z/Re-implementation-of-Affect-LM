that's why it's very hard to get rid of the guns in america cos there's so many about
yeah
do they just carry hand guns
they can carry hand guns they can carry rifles they can
machine guns
machine guns cos
think about it
be use common sense you're not er you're not that daft to say UNK
yeah
and who has seen certain films where someone just walks into it shows his driving licence and he buys a gun yeah
no i've seen UNK he does
i knew he was gonna say i knew you was gonna get UNK in the UNK he said it out there didn't he
sooner or later he's gonna get UNK in the conversation
yeah
shh
shh
yes okay then use a bad use a bad example yes did you see UNK when arnold UNK walks into the shop yeah
did you see him
bullet out and k kills a man
yeah he
it was literally b literally like going up to the shop and buying a newspaper
all he has to do is show he's over a certain age can prove who he is you can buy a gun
it is that easy
you just buy a machine gun
that is the reason that is why the reason why all police officers in america carry guns
it's not that they need them it's because they know everyone else has got them
yeah
they need
and here's hold on a minute here's something else here's a statistic in america in america when a policeman every time a policeman fires his gun and i'm not talking about one or two i'm talking everyone it's a statistic you all know what statistics is i hope
statistics
every time a policeman in america every four times a policeman in america that could be a policeman in new york a policeman in UNK a policeman in boston and a policeman in UNK yeah
or UNK
within well whatever yeah
right
shh
of those four usually shoots the person they er the person they shoot yeah
the person they're after shooting
the other
punch him
you say that you say that but can i punch you
yeah
hold on a second here's one can i punch you
think about it com are you with us
UNK
are you with can i punch you can i punch you
no
can i punch miss
yeah
yeah
i can punch miss can i
shh think about it
hold on no calm down
think about it
need to get through me first
eh
can i do it
think about it it's a game we're playing think about it
yeah
can i go up and punch miss
yeah
no
yes
yes
no
who says yes
who says yes
who says no
you're both right and you're both wrong
because she's done nothing
shh
keep going keep going you're a his moments doesn't he
he does have moments
shh
she's done nothing she's done nothing to hurt you
keep going
some reason
keep shh keep going
she's not guilty
you're on the right lines you're on the right lines
she has done
nothing
nothing wrong
yeah
right if she's done nothing wrong if er if she's done nothing
shh
can you answer this question
oh right
right
if she's done nothing wrong right
and i walk up and punch her what have i done think about it what have i done
think about it
assault
think about it
without shouting out you're right i've assaulted her
was that assault on her justified
she's done she's
though
shh she's done nothing she's done nothing wrong and i've assaulted her was the assault justified
she's done nothing wrong
no
she
is it justified
no
right
fair enough
i when i UNK when a policeman UNK someone it has got to be justified
yes right then same thing
miss comes at me with a knife and she attempts to stab me and she means it she wants to stab me and she means it
so you can
shh
i then defend myself and assault miss i assault miss yeah
she's trying her hardest to stab me and i assault her
is the assault justified
yes
who agrees with him
yes
me
you're right yeah it has to be justified
if i just walk across you're sitting there and just kick someone is it justified
no
i've got no right to do it i break the law like anyone else
yeah
i break the law like anyone else
you can be put in jail
i can be put in jail yeah
exactly the same
when i assault someone it has to be justified
yeah
pardon
right
let's go one UNK round again we've had enough words we'll go the other way good police word go

UNK
UNK is the proper word for the word i want one of you to come up with
shh
it starts with m
murder
murder
the proper word is UNK
alright
where were we
we've got to do this
we've finished
we've got to do this
law enforcement
law enforcement what a good way to end the conversation
right if i can get the video there is a video somewhere in the police station that shows a lot of different police forces but it's finding it
it may be too old it's i think it's about twenty years old
and we may not be able to show it to you
but if i can find it
i've got a video that's over twenty years old
i'll bring it back but otherwise good word
so right the one thing without calling out if i assault someone and that is punch them UNK kick them hit them do anything
murder them
shh
there's about five people you can get really to dislike in this class isn't there
right
if i assault someone and it is not justified not justified can i be arrested
yes
oh i'm impressed
you've actually learnt something hands down hands down
it's three o'clock
yeah well we're gonna stay here cos we've got quarter of an hour and if you want to listen to this that's fine but if you wanna carry on
yes alright

right we're going to pick people then who are sitting up nice
which won't be all those people that UNK in front of me
hazel you may go and
oh that
what it actually was the initial of the person sitting next to you
oh
each
if i can find it
pages forty six and forty seven please
and you'll er you'll need a piece of paper
pages forty six and forty seven and you'll need a piece of paper to do the work on
sir someone's got my book so i'm having this one if it's alright
good
would you please bring your chairs and that table over here so that we're all together round this table thank you
it might be an idea actually if we moved out just a little bit tracey
what
let everybody else in
right your title should be UNK by UNK
copy it from the top of page forty six and we are then ready to proceed
you will also need to manage to perform this er task accurately a piece of UNK paper
so while you're finishing heading your bits and pieces up would you like to pass some of them round
and i will find a little more from UNK places for you
this'll do there
right
another four here
how many people still need UNK paper
the intelligent amongst us have already been looking at the questions on page forty seven and realizing that despite the UNK of the sound of this music there are some quite direct things that can be asked
there's a s a definite explanation of terms that you see in the music written at the top of page forty seven would you look at them please
because UNK being french the instructions here aren't written in the usual language which you come across which is italian
yes
sir may i take a keyboard
provided it is returned at the end yes please
or even in german which is the second language of music we're looking at instructions in french
so UNK is and as the explanation gives you at a very moderate speed
that means quite a slow speed in practice
where you look please at the word UNK which is figure two it means UNK a bit slower
number three un UNK means a little faster but very little
so it only moves a bit faster there
UNK that's in bar fifteen number four means slower
UNK means not in strict time
that's a standard italian word and it's been mixed in amongst all the french UNK
you've got UNK movement UNK which means in french at the original speed very moderate again of course okay
en UNK a la UNK number seven there getting slower right up to the end very obviously
you've got UNK underneath which means UNK give a little push at the beginning of the note if you have to
don't forget this is a wind player playing a UNK
so if you're marking the sound you've got to give a little more air to it more wind
UNK near the end there getting much slower
okay as opposed to just the UNK which means a little slower
and finally UNK de UNK which is not french but is again italian UNK de UNK means dying away
UNK de UNK means quite literally getting lost
so if you want to get rid of somebody you can go and tell them to UNK de UNK which means getting lost
okay i know we moved on to the next piece last week we will start again on that tomorrow
i want to complete our previous work first
so there are twelve questions here
you are going to hear the music several times
look with me now at the twelve questions
some of these you can answer directly because we've already the music
for instance for question one you could all answer it now
the answer would be
i can't
UNK
UNK thank you darren
look carefully at the music of the first two bars then write the music of bar three
ah that means you've got to listen carefully to what happens
do please remember that UNK are used UNK of things are used
it may be that some of it is a repeat
it asks you to draw five empty bars to represent the music for bars four to eight
do not copy the notes but underneath the UNK write marks to show where the music gets louder UNK marks and UNK marks
now you can do this if you wish of course on ordinary plain paper because all you need to do to create your five empty bars i would suggest is we'll assume that's your thing there
one two three four five
okay and if say it UNK in bar two you would go like that say it UNK in bar four you would do that
oh yeah
so you don't even need to use music paper for this
you can just draw your bars
question four is a very simple one what actually happens to the music at bar nine
question five asks you to fill in the rhythm of the music in bar ten
look at bar ten it's at the end of that statement un UNK you'll see you've got the note heads given
you have to fill in the rhythm
you will need to copy those note heads onto UNK paper and put em in
you don't have to complete bar nine even though bar nine is empty because that's the subject of question four what happens there
so you have to describe that in words
you have to listen carefully oh sorry yes fill in the rhythm adding the phrase and dynamic parts for bar five for question five
question six asks you to listen carefully to the music of bars fourteen to nineteen
i will find those and play them several times
where in the music does the player take a breath
now then how are you gonna say where in the music the player takes a breath
where there's like a little comma
well that could be the answer
you are gonna have to say though
you're gonna have to complete the music for bar fifteen
you can see there's a gap there under the word UNK
so i suggest you actually copy the first three notes of bar fifteen and then put the rest in correctly
in bar sixteen you have to name the intervals
have we talked about naming intervals before
no
in that case we will attempt to do this now and we'll talk about interval naming afterwards those of you who can please attempt it there will be questions here that some of us can't
question nine is a listen
listen to the music in the bars twenty three and twenty four
what do you thing the word UNK in english means
okay describe briefly how the music ends
which of these words do not describe the character of the music
and there they are UNK and
we will now be listening to the music would you please write what you need to would you complete as many of the questions as you can
if like one or two of us who are thinking about it you've already been thinking about it you've got two or three of these complete already
here is the music for the first time today
okay
so we can all answer question one UNK
yeah UNK
the answer to question one please
UNK
UNK thank you oh dear oh dear
i put a pipe
i put pipe
you put what
pipe
a pipe
well i suppose it is basically but no UNK that's what we were looking for
erm you were asked to look carefully at the music of the first two bars then write the music of bar three
who has done this so far
well let's think about it once more i know you've done the correct thing cos i've just looked
okay
mm
mm thanks
thank you
listen please to the first four bars of this music
four or five bars and tell me what you notice about bar three
follow bars one and two particularly carefully
what did you notice about bar three by comparison with bar one
it's it is it is the same
is it
so what you should have copied down is bar one again
okay
if you haven't done that yet do it now because the practice of writing it of actually copying it down is important
why though
because the more you actually write the music notes carl the better you will be able to do it when you eventually come to have to write them in exam
practice is what it's all about
so at this UNK you should be making a copy of bar one and calling it bar three
what have we done with mark today
we've killed him
he's not in school
who else have we got missing
paul
sounds utterly brilliant thank you very much for that news darren
were you there
he was laying on the ground for about half an hour
well i expect he was hurt poor lad
when you've completed copying this which you should be now i think
no i don't think so
please don't take all day over it it's important that you don't
i'm never writing it again
mm
why not
ah i think you've got a bit of a mental block against it myself
i do
i don't care i hate it
i hate writing music
right how did you do
you've got to put the clef at the beginning of it you really ought to
okay and er you know you weren't you weren't actually high enough up there were you
i mean think about it
yeah
that bit that was the bar
okay you got that bit right you certainly needed the UNK you certainly needed those two
okay it's very important that the whole things done accurately
those two aren't high enough see that really need to be up there doesn't it
and you need more so really you needed to have done it on this line
so that you could do it like that
okay
the accent over the top and all the rest of it
yeah let's have a look over your shoulder
oh beautiful
you've done what's UNK what's wrong with it
you've done an accurate copy haven't except for this
and you'd actually spotted it already which i thought was brilliant except we do need to have the
i've got two i've got one it's
yes you've got two but there are three
oh okay then yeah
as there are three there
i've got three there i've got one two three
oh i see well you've got 'em you've that's why you put em UNK you see so that they really do show up against the
oh yes everything's got to be there all the phrase marks the UNK have got to be it
you know these things
is this right sir
oh totally accurate well done i'm talking to
sir the end of your UNK gone UNK
pen i mean
thank you where
it's vitally important that when you're doing it i'll do it up here that you have the dots you have the UNK you have the correct number of lines underneath you have the UNK you have the accents you have the phrase mark and so on
oh we're getting the piece actually UNK here well done
and so on yeah
now compare that with what you've written underneath
well it doesn't actually sort of bear witness does it
it's coming but you still need to have the accent over the top you need to have the dot there you need to have the two UNK there that's yes that's got what it needs dot there the accent there you need to have the two UNK there don't you
yeah and you need to have the flat in front of this one
yeah
right ladies and gentlemen
it's important that if you are going to copy accurately you do copy accurately
question three asked you to draw five empty bars to represent the music of bars four to eight
there are five bars between four and eight think about it
will you please on your piece of paper your blank piece of ordinary paper s create those five bars now and would you please put in the appropriate signs either UNK or UNK
well we can't hear it at the moment i'm just about to run it again for you
i'm sorry you've lost me there
okay
here comes the music what you've gotta decide from between bar four to bar eight
twenty minutes
what
is that how long it takes
what's twenty minutes got to do with bar four and bar eight carl
or are you hungry already
i see
aren't we all
too many lessons in the morning i'm sorry
if the music gets louder you put the UNK mark in
what that mean
if the music gets UNK you put the UNK mark in
okay here's the piece
this is part one
this is bar two of course
here is bar three
now here's bar four at which point we start putting UNK in if we need to
and that was the end of bar eight
would you like to hear that little bit again see if you can recall it
here's bar three
there's bar four
right can i have suggestions them
anybody got anything in bar four
yeah
one no i've got it in five whoops
bar four and bar five
bar four and bar five what should happen
UNK
it goes UNK the like that it goes
UNK
that's it
bars four and five
i'm going to UNK and look this up in the instructions
ah
would you oh i see
right ten nine eight here we are
here we are yes
it says and this is the books official ones
there is a UNK at the end of bar and another during bar seven and a UNK in bar eight
nothing in bar four
UNK in bar five a UNK in bar seven and another one a UNK in bar eight
although i personally find that a very difficult thing to hear
yeah
what happens to the music what sorry what happens in the music at bar nine
okay
all brains in gear we're listening from the beginning
and we're listening from the beginning
yes what happens in the music at bar nine
this is bar one
there's that UNK they talked about
here's the UNK
that's bar eight
now what happens in this bar nine
what goes lower
the noise
you're right UNK it goes lower
the tune goes lower which tune
the first tune from the beginning bar one is repeated how much lower
can anybody tell me
about an UNK
it's exactly an UNK
oh thank you
bar nine is bar one an UNK lower
here's the bit that's important this is bar nine an UNK lower
okay now then will you please copy precisely what is there at bar ten
the music you need one bar of music line with those UNK which are the note heads in exactly the right places
just copy what's in the book
copy what
bar ten
bar ten
copy what's in the book at bar ten
then all you've got to do is add the rhythm
carl you haven't even started yet
what we doing
exactly
gotta copy out bar ten
copy bar ten precisely as it's given in the book
where's bar ten
where's bar ten
after bar nine and before bar eleven
if in doubt count from the beginning
one two three four five six seven
five six seven eight nine ten
eight nine
no you're counting lines carl
i know i was
you weren't counting bars
you'll find there are bar numbers given at the beginning of each line
bar four starts the second line bar eight starts the third line
so it out to be easy enough to work out where ten is since bar eleven starts the fourth line
when you have copied precisely bar ten would you please now finish bar ten by putting the tails in the right places
the what
the tails of the notes
that means the rhythm of the notes you may need to put dots in
you may need to you may need to put dots in you may need to put UNK or even UNK in
this is bar nine followed by bar ten
write in the rhythm pattern
UNK i'm sure that was of no help whatsoever to your ability to write this down
it's becoming rather obvious that our concentration span is virtually finished
now will you settle down please
would you like to hear bars nine and ten again
there's got to be a reason why i'm playing you bar nine as well as bar ten
may i suggest you think about that
here's bar nine
here's bar ten
why was the why what was going on
between bar nine and bar ten
it was the same rhythm pattern thank you very much
so which rhythm pattern are you going to put on those notes in bar ten
same as bar nine which is blank but it's the same as bar one
but that's the point
and here you've had another example of the way normally these questions work
carl
i'm not surprised you never know
sorry
thank you
if there is to be a fairly detailed piece of note writing it very often is a fairly near or an exact copy of something that's already gone before
of course you can't put the tails hanging down on bar ten can you
you have to put them up because the notes are on or below the middle line
think
so you'll have to reverse the tails
other than that
now we go on oh we're still writing are we
thought it had gone quiet for a s have you put your tails on there yet
they're the same tails as this lot except they're up the other way
right
well music is above the middle line the tails hang down
when music is below the middle line the tails stick up
that'll do well done UNK
question six asked you to listen carefully to the music of bars fourteen to nineteen and say where the player takes a breath
here we start at bar eleven
i'll tell you when we start on bar fourteen
you can think very hard where the player takes a breath
twelve thirteen
here's where you now have to start thinking
so where did the player take a breath
all of them
was it at the end of every bar
was it at the end of every two
it did in bar fourteen the player took a breath after the UNK
it the player then took a breath at the end of bar fifteen just before you start the UNK bit
the player then took a breath where the comma is at the end of the line
that is a breath mark
then took a breath at the end of bar eighteen
listen to it again make sure you get it
here it is
this is bar fourteen breath after the UNK
breath on the bar line
breath there
here's the comma
now you were asked to complete the music of bar fifteen
what do you think you would have written
look at bar fourteen and fifteen
here they are again
i'll run them again for you
right i'm just about to start bar fourteen
sh
follow fourteen then think about fifteen and then see what you think you'd have written
here it is fourteen
that's the end of fifteen
well thank you for that darren nice of you to comment on it
mm
what would you have written
the same as what's in bar fourteen
the same as what's in bar fourteen
who agrees with that
it is wrong but it's close
the middle
no there isn't a UNK you see
your first your first little group in bar fifteen which is the same as the first little group in bar fourteen you would repeat
and then you've got to introduce a new little group which is halfway between that and what starts bar sixteen
it's in fact the most difficult question of the group
a very difficult question yeah
there are several other questions i'd like to think about
the word UNK what do you think it meant
well it's like erm an it's like it make it fancy and it goes
you do a UNK yes it the correct thing is a rapid UNK between the written note and the note above or between the two written notes
so UNK is a rapid UNK between the two notes given okay
you were confusing it i think with UNK which is the word meaning high
okay
question ten is a very involved question that i think we won't look at now
the music of course at the end just dies away to nothing
which of these words do not describe the character of the music
would you please say yes or no depending on whether you think it describes the character or not
first word UNK
no
yes
no
i do think you've made a mistake carl
ah you're good at this aren't you carl
no
thank you
second word UNK
yeah
yes
third word UNK
no
fourth word UNK
yes
yeah
fifth word angry
no
let's listen to the complete piece once more
at which point you can complete any other bits of the work that you feel you need to
yes i was very UNK of that thank you
miss said somebody did that for me who didn't want to do their ordinary work
while you're listening you could quietly and i mean quietly put your things away
should you not wish to keep any of the papers that you've got there you can put them very carefully in the box
that box
i don't know whether i'm allowed to say now thank heavens for that
right now listen folks
sh
can i remind you please if you're answering a question can you please put your hand up so i can select
some of you know now way back a couple of weeks ago when we were doing the group seven the one that's spelt f c l b r i a t
hands up who can remember what any of those stand for without looking on er
you forgot the first rule put your hand up
right UNK is the actual element UNK is the stuff that's in
UNK
UNK very good
you never put your hand up
right c l
please sir is chloride
chloride is the is when it's joined up with something chlorine is the element
and what do we get chlorine in
swimming baths
swimming baths to
to take away all the nasty
to kill the UNK
well it doesn't exactly kill them kill the it's got it's own smell which sort of tends to mask the smell but it's also basically to kill the UNK
b r
UNK
UNK very good
and i
UNK
very good excellent
s so what i want you to show you this morning is how we can actually make the chlorine
so the people at the front yeah if you come up a little bit closer
now sh
please now i've got erm a bottle which is actually contains some chlorine here but it's not called chlorine liquid
i'll scratch this
hydro
UNK
UNK
UNK acid and it also says c o n c
UNK what is UNK short for
it's short for a word yes
it starts with c o n c
anybody
UNK is short for
nose
no UNK er it's the beginning part of a word
if you use the word UNK you're just meaning your nose
UNK
ah now we're getting a bit more scientific
UNK if it was UNK it would be c o n i UNK
but it's UNK
now can you think of a wo c think of a word that describes the state of this liquid
and i'm going to hold the top while i show you
it's rather UNK and it's quite a dense liquid
is it dangerous
it is dangerous yes
i'm gonna get some UNK on in a minute
what do you call liquid ah i'll give you a clue
what do you call a liquid that's very strong
concentrated liquid
thank you concentrated
now i UNK on time folks
now in this particular case i'm using a tap UNK tap UNK just as it's erm the concentrated acid you don't just sort of pour it in and run away and leave it to it
let it in a little bit at a time
just slow slowly let the acid in
then turn it off
right now so the tap is to control the speed at which the acid goes in and if there is any gas that's in there it can't escape out of that pipe again it's got to go down the other pipe
so it's a safe it's a safety feature and it helps control the experiment
so we control the speed at which the acid goes in
and once it's in there it prevents the gas from UNK
now at the moment the black chemical that's in there is not doing a great deal
the black UNK just sort of gone to a UNK
the UNK just gone it's dissolved a little bit but it's not really doing much on its own
so in order to speed it up a little bit we might need to heat it up
who said that
me
well done
now who's going to go next door to get the gas switched on
what
right listen again sh
done it
sh now in order to help this black powder to split up the acid
we're going to have to heat it up a little bit
now again i'm treating it carefully i'm not just sticking the UNK underneath and UNK away at it
i've got the graham wanted to well unfortunately graham this one's a bit dangerous so i'm having to do it so if anything goes wrong it's me that gets it and not you
well because i've got all the dirty chemicals sh
please
erm how will we know how will we know if there's any gas UNK
what
what's this paper
p h paper
p h paper
so i'm going to UNK it
because of the gas that's drifting around in here what
the gas can you can you set fire to it
no it's not a UNK gas
but it is poisonous so if i start UNK it i'm going have to switch the cupboard on to suck the fumes away
UNK
now this p h test i've only had it a few seconds and already look what it's done to the paper
where i've wet it what's it done to it
turned it yellow
it's turned it yellow and where it was dry it's now going what colour
red
red
red means it's
an acid
an acid
and because this takes what do you call something what do you call something that takes the colour away
UNK
those are old pieces of paper
come on somebody what do you call a chemical a what
not a UNK
andrew
we call a chemical that takes that takes
now you'll see it
what UNK the gas
green
right it's a green gas and it's also what it does it to this paper turns it acid to start with and then takes the colour away it is a UNK
UNK gas
now because it was UNK up i've turned the UNK off to control the reaction it's slowing down again now
and you can see the colour
what UNK on that list
black
black
what UNK on that list
black
blue
not it's not blue
purple
and they're all poisonous and they will UNK this the be this is probably the best UNK
this is highest the highest up the list that we can do
we can do reactions from f too dangerous
now sh
now this one i'm going to show you this one this time
UNK
mm
why do we use the tap UNK again
cos we've got a tap UNK
so if there's any gas
yeah right it can't get out it has to go down the pipe
sir
stop UNK
sh
can anybody oh i bet you'll never guess this one
why have i got a UNK instead of a round UNK
here's the answer
the round UNK is broken
erm i've go some purple UNK believe it or not
now this one's a bit more powerful this purple chemical
shouldn't need heating up
if i put this white if i put the white paper behind the UNK can you see the gas that's in there
yes a UNK gas
UNK gas right and
sir
yes
is that UNK
it's not UNK it's poisonous it's acid and it UNK
it could yes in the in the first world war er they used it would
but how long would it take
it depends how much you got into whether you had asthma or not
you might you might have after you've s had some of this
now can i explain this part over here look at this
sh
er right i've got this UNK upside down leading into a UNK of water
can anybody guess why
there's something else that this gas does in water
if you'd got enough gas it would make UNK
but we've only got a small supply remember
it may do
what do what do things normally do in water
sometimes they move yeah
anything else if you just put some right they sink or float
what else do they do after they've either sunk or UNK
rust
they might rust yeah
or turn to a well what do you call it when they turn to a liquid
what's the word
they what
they UNK
UNK
they UNK but you can UNK things by heating them up that would UNK them but in this particular case you just mix them with some water what's the process called
to turn it into it's called what
if you UNK some sugar into water
dissolves
it dissolves okay
if this gas if this gas dissolves too quickly it'll suck the water back up the tube and into this UNK
it could be dangerous because if you're UNK water into acid you could have problems
so UNK i've got this upside down UNK and that prevents the water from being UNK up
how do i know i've got some chlorine in the water
well look what's happening to these test papers
they're not acid any longer what's happened to them
mark what's happened to that test the p h paper there
it's all gone white
it's gone white what's the pr what's the pr what do we call it it's been
UNK
UNK
so i've got some UNK yeah smell you can smell that UNK
i've got some UNK chemical
wave it past your nose you don't UNK don't just i'll just wave it past your nose
you don't want to much cos remember it is er poisonous
anybody else want no
you want a smell
right
so sh let's just sum up
what was the liquid we started with
what was the liquid we started with
erm oh that UNK
concentrated hydrochloric acid
it's got chlorine in it
we used a black chemical to start with but in order to that to help that we needed some heat
and this one works on its own this purple chemical is more powerful and works on its own
adam can you go and turn the gas off
right now i don't know mr 's trying to book some
what
erm science trips
where to
somewhere in
the science museum in london
no erm somewhere in yorkshire
somewhere where
somewhere in yorkshire
er yes a gas fired power station
right can you go back to your places
right now
sir have s have you seen pride and prejudice and the telly
can you look after those folks
well did anything happen when i put the acid in
did any of you three see what anything that happened in the first one
so we had to put some a bit of heat in
nothing happened acid on its own
now we got
let's right excuse me
too small
erm does anybody know what this m n o two business is
have a look on your UNK table and see if you can work out what m n o two
you should know what o stands for
m n o two anybody
nitric oxide
something oxide yeah
part way there come on m n have a look on your page one of this module
work look up what m n stands for
anybody worked it out come on m n o two
magnesium
very close but not quite right
not magnesium
have a look very close it's not UNK it's no oh that's capital n this is a little n m n
that's it right
m n
UNK
go on read it what is it
magnesium
no have you looked closer
UNK
UNK oxide
please
there you go
UNK oxide erm the back row decided
UNK oxide
erm
excuse me sir thanks sir
universal liquid
or a piece of universal paper or
what does k m n o four stand for
what does k stand for anybody work that one out on your UNK table
k for anybody remember cos we've done this group
what's this paper called
p h
yeah that's p h
yes it is
no not UNK
anybody what's k
potassium
well done
yes i know because it's come from an old an old word an old
er k potassium yes
erm then we've got a UNK k m n o four
it's got two metals
how which one's got most which one's got most oxygen in it the k m n o four or the or the m n o two
m n o two
why
that's a guess
well look at the numbers
m n o two k m n o four
oh i thought k m n o four
yeah why
cos it's got number four
it's got four oxygen atoms and that's only got two oxygen atoms
well done michael
so k m n o UNK got more oxygen
erm what does this word property mean in number four
property
now you're gonna tell me a property is something that you can
yes something that's good about it very good
so what's what are what's chlorine got that say no other gas has
it's a UNK yeah anything else
er
how would know it if i brought a jar full into the room
smell it
smell it
right erm what else
how would we know a jar was full compared with an empty jar
just to look at if the lid was on
you can see it
why
you can smell it
no we've the UNK on this time
sir it was UNK and you can see it
no that was some drops of acid that you could see we're trying to work out what the properties of this gas if you're not listening you won't be able to do number four
it's UNK it's
yes it's poisonous yes that's a property good
another one
mm that's a use not a property
what colour it's UNK green yes
how we doing folks
good
sir i've finished
right UNK you know that erm acid thing you were doing this one be finishing that off
i dunno i can't remember
you marked it
and have you done a key
yes
well a key should have a little bit at the bottom to say what what's it stands for
oh you've done that red ones yellow ones where's your yellow ones your key doesn't match your chart
you've put green ones and they're the metals
your green ones are the alkali earth metals
you've got this all wrong
tell you what i'll get you another one
how are we doing ladies okay
number five oh can anybody tell er on number five why we got the upside down UNK
no
now come on this is a check of who was listening
why have i why have we got that upside down UNK
sh
sh er no
what does the gas do to the water
mark
it does but it might also do the gas might do something else as well
turn the water green
how could it turn the water green what would it have to do in the water
UNK
come on we're going back to this shove it in water business again
oh it dissolves
dissolves stop it from UNK the liquid back again
dissolves to the stop the liquid from being UNK back into
the gas dissolves
the gas starts to come off when i just put the acid in
yeah so you've got to heat it up
paper some p h erm
darren sit down please
that UNK right now how did we control the speed at which the acid went in
with a tap
and then once all the acid was in if you left the tape open what would happen to the gas
it would just escape so we sh close the top and the gas has got to
down the tube and into
yeah down the other tube and into the what's the UNK
what do you call it that tall cylinder thing
UNK
you'll never guess it's for collecting UNK so we call it a
gas
gas jar
not far off
oh
now come on
speed it u yeah cos the black powder wasn't powerful enough
can anybody tell me why the black UNK not powerful enough
look at the shorthand for it m n o two it's not got so much
oxygen
very good it's not got so much oxygen
so you've got to give it some heat to help the oxygen to work
now if anybody's finished and is wondering what to do check through and make sure everything is up to date
and then i've got some work here for those who thing everything's up to date
so don't start this work until everything else is up to date
it's on the end of this
and if anybody's been away and has got or has got missing sheets i've got spare sheets down here
question sheets don't forget your acid posters by the way
or you getting another one
it's right i would
the only problem is i haven't got many colours
you'd do better to use your own colours if you've got
how are you doing okay dean
oh right well you need oh not again
right who can tell yes go on michael
to let the acid in
to let not out to let what in slowly
the acid in slowly right
it lets the acid in slowly and once the acids in what does it stop next
carbon dioxide
so whatever's in there can't get out up there it's got to go through another pipe it's got to go through the other pipe
two reasons
to stop the gas from UNK and to let the acid in bit by bit
sir
yeah
er you could put p h or universal or any UNK indicator
sir
properties who can tell me a property of this gas
look at it in through the in the UNK cupboard i can see one from here
green
it's green right good
it it's a bit UNK alright fair enough that's a property
anything else
if it can fall down out of that pipe into the jar it must be
very good be heavy
if it erm UNK the water up if you're not careful it must
how can it suck the water up by
it hasn't actually done cos i put that UNK on the end to stop it from doing it
yeah it would cause a UNK as it dissolves
so it dissolves obviously
have you got the smell one have you put the smell one down
UNK of
swimming baths or UNK or you can put some universal indicator or erm p h paper or
to stop it from UNK because it dissolves too well it's like you in there drinking er coke out of a straw if you suck enough it'll all end up in your mouth
if you just put a pipe straight in the end of the liquid it would suck the liquid up
right darren if you've finished the qu
to s stop from UNK up
now who's finished
number three you could on the filter paper i've out some of those p h test papers
you could put universal p h UNK anything
oh yeah probably we don't stop just cos you're not
are there any i've got the index out here if you want one
i'll thank 'em all very much then
oh fine you want to thank them now
can i thank you all very much for being cooperative
to do
to build up a dictionary to see how words are used
because you see erm say if you look at business letters erm people say i should be very grateful if
people don't talk like that they say i'd be grateful
they don't talk so the language changes all the time and each time they bring out a new d dictionary they try to say erm this is the way people talk and bring it up to date so that we're not all talking in the past
and new words as they come in and new meanings of words like people might say erm oh i'm well pleased
or something or they'll say you know is it any good they'll say oh it's really wicked
and you think oh what does this mean and you look it up in a dictionary wicked and you think oh
yeah
that doesn't sound too good
but there's a so there's another meaning comes into it and they update the dictionary like this and they listen to the tapes and find out how people use it and how language changes
that's all it's about
now what were we looking at last time
big nasty
oh that exam that i thought was probably
yeah
erm
i done it
a bit difficult
i done it i'm just trying to find it
and you did very well on the geometry didn't you
yeah
i got to that erm question you know you said couldn't do any the geometry do the rest
yeah
so i got up to that one but
you've been doing UNK diagrams as well
yeah
is that is that recent or is that the old stuff the UNK diagrams
what do you mean by recent
have you done it in the last sort of few weeks
oh yeah it's the last few weeks
good
no problem with that
no
no
been learning that in school
we did one didn't we a lot long time ago did we do one on football
erm who's supporting liverpool and UNK
no we didn't never gone over the UNK diagrams
okay
well if you're happy with UNK diagrams fine leave it
erm i suppose got here a bit later you would have had more time to sort this lot out
i can't find it anywhere
okay
i did do it
it's a i mean no it's up to you if you say you've done it that's fine by me
erm do you think you got it all sorted out no problem with it
yeah
great
apart from one question i think it was question nine
right let's
but
have a look at that
i'll try and get the paper
hang on
oh that was that was it wasn't it because they had erm the UNK joined up
is that your answer to it
no it was different one that's
no that one that's a different
that's a project is it
no this is this is just a maths paper
we've got a big erm like cupboard in the school and they've got loads of paper threes paper twos
so i
so you
helped myself to a load of paper threes and i seem to have done them all
i wiped the school clean of paper threes
that's great
so whatever sort of question comes up you will have seen something like it wouldn't you
yeah
well UNK really great
ah is this it
that's it
that's it
and this is
your answer
my answers
i think
ah
is it
okay
hang on
could be
i i'll have a look at the question
no that's for that one unfortunately
ah that be
that's one two three
right okay
number nine UNK
UNK and UNK and UNK
is that the one that you had the problem with
yeah
okay
hang on
hang on
yeah that one and number ten these parts here
okay
using a graph
er where should we start
start with number ten i think
because graphs particularly distance and time graphs i mean both of these are very likely to come up you'll get a translation of some sort and you'll get a distance time graph but the graphs or distance against time er are useful in other problems as well
erm yeah we'll look at that
okay don't worry about the ones you did if you're if you're happy with them
yeah
erm it might be an id if you can find them for next time
yeah i will yeah
so i can just have a quick check and make sure they are okay but i'm pretty sure if you think they're right
yeah
they'll be right
so what did you make of this number ten then
i think first part to it but then er it seemed to go downhill so to speak
so you had a formula you had a formula for calculating the value
i haven't read the question i saw v equals and i thought it was velocity
it's the value of a car
number of miles it's travelled
okay erm can you tell me in words what that formula means really
erm if the car has done a lot of mileage will you get a lot of money for it or will you get less money
you get more money
let's say the car's done no mileage at all how much would you get for it
nothing
you get that
you'll get nine thousand five hundred okay
if it's done a thousand miles you'd get nine thousand five hundred and then cos of the mileage they'd take off a thousand divided by ten so they'd take a hundred pounds off that
you only get nine thousand four hundred
okay
are you happy with that
yeah
right so i won't draw a graph but we'll see if we can work out a sketch of a graph roughly what it's like
erm what's the value going to be doing
this is this is the mileage going along there that's the number of miles that the car has done and that's its value
as the miles get more and more and more is the value going to get bigger or get smaller
smaller
right so it's going to be something like i mean this isn't anything like to scale but it's going to be something like this perhaps
okay
it starts off at some value here and it goes down until eventually when it's done a certain number of miles the car's worth nothing
yeah
so if we can find out where those these are the important points where it cuts that axis and where it cuts that one
so this point is where it's done no miles
how much is it worth when it's done no miles well they give you that one anyway
it'll be nine thousand five hundred take off n times zero over a hundred
well don't take anything off
so it's still worth the nine thousand five hundred
got nine thousand five hundred up there
now complete so what do they want us to do
complete that table plot a straight line graph and use your graph to find these values
okay
we've got v is equal to nine thousand five hundred that's how much it's worth and then take away n over ten
take away a tenth of a pound for every mile
yeah
so when will it be worth nothing
when will it have gone right down to nothing
in other words when is when is v equal to zero
oh we've got a an equation for v
so wherever we've got v put zero
zero equals nine thousand five hundred minus one tenth of n
are you happy with that
this expression here v nine thousand five hundred minus a tenth of n that always tells us what v is worth anywhere along here it'll give us the value of the car
now what if what happens as n gets bigger and bigger as it's done more and more
the value
miles
the value goes lower
right every time n gets bigger it means we're taking more and more of this nine thousand five hundred
so if it's done ten thousand miles we'd take a tenth of ten thousand we'd take a thousand pounds off this
if it had done nine thousand five hundred miles how much would we take off hey
ninety five
nine fifty yeah
okay nine hundred and fifty divided by ten
oh that would still leave us with something left over
so the value is getting less and less and less
the value is always equal to at any point it's always equal to nine thousand five hundred take away a tenth of the number of miles it's done
so when does the value come down to zero well it comes down to zero when the bit we're taking away is equal to that
yeah
so we'll just use this equation
just say v is equal to this but we want to find out when nought is equal to it
nine five o minus would it help if we used x instead of n
no
no
okay
minus one tenth of n so you've got an equation there and we want to find n
but we've got a fraction in it so what would you what would you do
what would be the first what would be the first thing you'd want to do
get rid of
the fraction
the fraction
how could you do that
you have a go and see what would you multiply by to get rid of the UNK fraction
or maybe that isn't the first thing you want to do if you want to do it a different way do it whichever makes more sense to you
i wouldn't know how to go about starting you know trying to get rid of this fraction
okay if we got if let's leave the fraction there for a moment then
just write the equation out again and let's get the we'll write it as n over ten shall we
let's get the n over ten onto this side
so what would we need to do to make that disappear
add it to both sides
add n over ten to that side and add n over ten to that side okay if you want to tidy it up and see what it comes to
what's that going to come to
n ten
n over ten on the left yeah
and ninety five
and nine thousand five hundred
ninety five hundred yeah
okay
now how could you get rid of
mm multiply ten by both sides
exactly multiply both sides by ten
so how do you multiply by ten
the what's the quick trick for multiplying by ten
add another nought
that's it just add another nought on
ninety five thou
so it's ninety five thousand
so when the car's done ninety five thousand it's worth nothing
so we've found the other bit on our graph now
we know that up there it goes to nine thousand five hundred and along here it gets to ninety five thousand
now where it goes negative a negative value i don't think we'd be interested in that means that the car's got to the point where you have to pay someone to take it away
and the more miles it's done the more you pay them to
so it doesn't make a lot of sense after that point the graph
so now we know what's going on here what the what the UNK going to look like
we've got some others to fill in
it tells us this isn't doing exactly what it said here right
what it says here is zero n is zero the value is nine thousand five hundred
when n is two thousand what's the value
four thousand six thousand eight thousand okay
and you plot the graph
erm we'll use those points as well
now this techniques we've been using here is for you can use that for any straight line graph
what happens when the one that's going along there the x normally in this case the number of miles
what happens when that's zero
well that's the value
and then the other one is well what value of x would make y zero
what number of miles would make the value zero
then we'll get those two points and that'll give us our straight line
and when we calculate these other points they should fit on it as well
are you happy with that
erm
yeah i understand it li like when you're teaching me but i don't think i understood you know how you were doing it
okay
that's that problem
let's do a different one
it's like the graphs you know
right
i'm not too sure on graphs
you know like
okay
this is
when they stop and the time goes on what's the time between this that they go
right
what's the speed he's travelling at
yeah this is the
this comes in quite a lot
UNK distance time graphs and speed so let's have a look at er
do you want to use
a different i'll just i'll just sketch them on here then you can when we get one sorted out you can draw one on there
let's have a look
so here's a graph and we'll say the distance let's see the distance is equal to erm a constant speed let's say he's doing sixty miles an hour
well we won't write s we'll write distance
the distance he's travelled is equal to sixty miles per hour times the number of hours he's been travelling for okay
so he's driving along the motorway at steady sixty
erm how far would he go in one hour
steady sixty miles
s sixty miles
how far would he go in erm half an hour
thirty miles
and in two hours
a hundred and twenty miles
okay
so we want to draw a picture that's all a graph is a picture so it's UNK so we can get a good idea of what's happening and we can also read off at any time
so we'll have up here how many miles he's going
erm fancy breaking the speed limit
so shall we change it make it a hundred miles an hour
okay he's doing a hundred miles an hour
along the bottom time if time is one of the things you're working with it just about always goes along the bottom
yeah
so this is this is the time in hours
up here is how far he's travelled in hundreds of miles say
one hundred two hundred okay
and five hundred six hundred
now what happens when he's just starting off from home
well the distance is equal to a hundred miles an hour times how many hours has been travelling for
none
we've only just started off
so when time is at none zero we haven't started yet how far is he he's zero he hasn't moved anywhere
mm
so there's one point
how far has he got after two mile after two hours
distance equals one hundred times the time
so
two hundred miles
he's gone two hundred
so after two he's gone two hundred
erm how UNK he gone after six UNK after six hours
six hundred miles
right so after six three four five six he's gone six hundred
okay now if we join those up i've got one here it's okay
if we join we've got three points now once we know it's a straight line three points is enough
two is enough really but just to be on the safe side use three and if they don't all lie in the same straight line then one of them's wrong
you don't know which one you'd have to check all of them again
so we've drawn the graph and now we don't have to keep UNK i mean this is easy UNK probably easier to work it out in your head then to especially with these figures
but say the figure had been erm fo he's travelling at forty eight point three miles an hour and you want to know how far he's gone after twenty seven minutes or something it's a bit more awkward then so it'd be easier to look it up on a graph
once we drew this picture
up there is how far away from home he is in miles along there is the time he's been travelling for
that's travelling time
so without working it out but using the graph now how far would he be after three and a half hours
three and a half is about there
look up there what do we get
actually it comes out to four hundred cos i haven't drawn these properly come up come out to three fifty
let's draw those in properly
one two and so on like that
erm that was an easy one that was a nice simple one
well now i'd like you to do one
er
do the hard i do the easy one you do the hard one
this time it's the distance he's travelled is given by erm what speed shall we let him go at
twenty five miles an hour say
twenty let's make it twenty miles an hour
this time he's a UNK he's a racing UNK and he's keeping up a steady twenty
so it's twenty miles an hour times the number of so the distance which is in miles is equal to twenty miles an hour times hours
okay could you draw a graph of that
and use you're not going it's not going to be negative is it
no
so use all your all your paper go down quite a bit
just leave yourself a little bit to write underneath it
you're going to need some sort of scale well
miles per hour
so how many squares have we got up here
roughly
twenty or so
mm thirty
about thirty okay
let's say let's make it erm one square going up there is ten miles
okay so you could mark that off in ten in ten mile steps
and we want to know let's say we're interested in a time of about ten hours or something
okay that's fine
so along there if we have two squares is equal to one hour
now we've got a formula so we build up a little table
there okay something like this
a good one to start with is so if we put time along the top here
yeah
erm t and underneath we'll have distance
a good one to start with is what happens when the time is equal to zero
if he's been travelling for zero hours how far has he gone
no miles
no miles okay
erm if he's another easy one is if he's been travelling for one hour how far has he gone
twenty miles
twenty miles okay
and if he's been travelling for ten hours how UNK he gone
two hundred miles
right okay
now we've got three points there it's probably they give you four here so we'll do another one erm when he's been travelling for five hours how UNK he gone
so it will be for that one it'll be
one hundred
that's it yeah
great so it's twenty miles an hour
times five hours equals one hundred miles
so now we've got a table and you've got four values in which is plenty
so if you'd like to plot those
okay now check they all lie on a straight line
if they don't then one of them's wrong
they do
yeah
that's a very good indication that you got everything correct
it might not be cos you might have got the formula wrong and you've got every one of them wrong but it's usually a good sign
so just join those up
and now you can ask i can sort of ask you questions on it like if he's been travelling for let's say if he's if he's covered sixty miles how long has he been riding for
so you think you can use that set square actually which helps
he's travelled sixty miles come down that way
three hours
he's been going for three hours
okay erm if he's done two hundred miles how long has he been riding for
ten hours
okay now looking at it the other way you see we had those points but we don't know what happens over here
if he'd been cycling for fourteen hours let's say fifteen hours
if he'd been cycling for fifteen hours you have a look and tell me how far he would have gone
three hundred miles
okay now any problems with that
no
i think you understand that
yeah
very well don't you that's all there is to it
it's use your equation to make a little table
what happens nought is a good one to go for
now what happens when he hasn't done any time at all and time is just starting off
where is he
well usually not always but just about always he's at home he hasn't gone anywhere so how far away is he zero as well so you get zero goes through the origin
and then you just put the numbers in for different hours into the equation into the formula that tells you how far he's gone work it out
so let's try another one and i'll give you some of the details and the questions that i'm going to ask on it later
now with this one the one we've just done you don't really know how far to go i mean i might have been going to ask erm how long has he been travelling if he's been riding for a thousand hours
and you're your graph paper few metres long or you'd have to UNK this scale up quite a bit bring it closer together
so we'll do something similar if erm the train shall i make it very awkward
yes
yes
the train leaves this is an express it leaves UNK at some time we don't know when at some time
okay and it doesn't stop anywhere it's going all the way up to scotland before it stops
and it does a steady what shall we have
sixty miles an hour eighty
eighty miles per hour
right
hello i'm sorry to mess up your tea and everything
i was explaining i got
oh no it's alright
so many changes in lessons and everything today
yeah
had something else that i was just doing and i thought oh i should be at UNK for five o'clock
i didn't look at my timetable which i've got with me
yeah
and i got here early
it's alright he'd practically finished anyway it was alright
hello
oh yes UNK
come on
late and i was early
you alright
mm
you're a UNK little thing aren't you
come on UNK
out you come
cheerio UNK
out
see you later
out
that way
out
go on UNK
thanks for the coffee thanks
okay
it goes a steady eighty miles an hour right
now when it's been travelling for three hours it goes through manchester
okay and when it's been travelling for five hours it goes through erm what's another station up there let's say carlisle something like that
and when it's been travelling for seven hours it gets into glasgow
okay
it goes it goes through manchester and it goes through carlisle it doesn't stop
doesn't stop from UNK it doesn't stop till it gets into glasgow
now what we want to do is try and draw some sort of picture for that
any ideas
what's happening there
what we're going to try and find out erm so instead of having these three hours and things we'll say at three o'clock it goes through manchester and at five o'clock it goes through carlisle
at seven o'clock it goes through it gets into glasgow
right now we want to find out what time it les it left UNK
and we want to know how far is it between carlisle and glasgow between manchester and glasgow and between UNK and glasgow
pretty impossible task eh
and we're going to do it with a graph
any ideas what could you look at that sort of question and you think this is impossible
yeah
no chance of working any of this lot out
but they say draw a graph
that's all UNK told you
a steady eighty miles an hour and where it was at these times
so we know the graph is going to look something like this
there's time and there's distance
and time seven o'clock okay
seven o'clock when it gets into glasgow and five o'clock when it gets into carlisle and three o'clock when it goes through three o'clock when it goes through manchester
mm we don't know what could we put in
could we put part of the graph in do you think
how far apart are manchester and carlisle going to be
hundred and sixty miles
right it takes two hours it's going at a steady sixty great so we know that's a hundred and sixty
and what about the other two carlisle and glasgow
a hundred and sixty
that's a hundred and sixty okay
erm and we need some more information there but let's say we know that UNK to manchester is a hundred and sixty as well okay
let's say that's erm UNK to manchester is a hundred and sixty miles so where would UNK be on this
it'd be there
okay so that would be at one o'clock and there's another hundred and sixty
so those UNK go up here
now if we start up here somewhere
let's draw the line in first
can decide what this is
erm from there to there let's make it er okay that's a hundred and sixty that's a hundred and sixty that's a hundred and sixty that's seven o'clock and that's five o'clock three o'clock and that's one o'clock
so that's what the graphs going to look like
now you wouldn't get one as hard as that in an exam
but i think you could do that sort erm provided you didn't sort of panic no chance of doing this okay
what do you think of it now
that sort of question
you still think it's
what i've you know when you're like given a plain axis and i have to decide what to put on the sides i i'm sometimes a bit
so is it which one goes top and which goes along
is that okay to work that out or not sure about that
i'm not sure
okay
well there's an easy way to divide that
if they give you an equation like this let's say the weight you're making up a load for a lorry and you're putting erm UNK on with car engines in and the car engine UNK erm i dunno say it UNK a hundred UNK
erm what will the equation you get will be something like this the weight is equal to a hundred times n okay where n is the number of engines that you've got on
okay so you could work that out for well how much would it weigh if we put five engines on
yeah
or how much would it weigh if we put ten engines on
now when you see the equation like that the one that's on the left hand side
the weight equals the one on the left hand side that equals something that you have to calculate
the weight is the one that goes up there in the y direction
and the one that's part of the calculation goes along the x axis okay
so this one you'd mark off one two three and this they would actually use this erm if they were loading lorries they could use this sort of thing
er so one two three could you dr could you draw that one then
i'll cover that up again
just draw a graph of that
weight is equal to a hundred times the number of engines
the weight in UNK is a hundred times the number of engines we've got
erm whatever units will fit the paper
so do it on your graph paper okay
turn that over
and let's say the maximum number of engines we can ever have will be up to about twenty five
so use a bit more
take you can take it right long to the end
you don't need to go actually to the end with your numbers but you can take your line right along there cos you might find at the last minute there's an extra one you want to put on
so i'll just give you the equation you can write the equation ion the on the graph paper
w equals a hundred times n
where n is the number of engines and it's the weight in UNK
now good that's a really brilliant point on any graph to put the units in because they give marks for that when they see your graph they want to see you've put the units on
and along there would be number of engines n
now the maximum number of engines you you're going to have we know is going to be twenty five
so how long have you got along there roughly
fifty
about fifty
have you got fifty cos you had thirty last time didn't you
yeah that one
okay and we can get about fifty there can we
erm three squares to the centimetre and we've got twenty five yeah so we'll get erm we'll get fifty on fifty squares so twenty five engines to fit along that space of fifty
one every centimetre
mm
one every centimetre okay that'll make it one every three squares
three squares is a bit awkward to deal with
that's good that's the best scale for getting it very accurate that's great
erm it might be better to go for two squares is one engine and they'll fit on okay
so if you mark off that every two squares is probably one engine
so you've put your marks every two squares but you don't need to write all the numbers in you could just write say erm two four six eight or you could just write five ten fifteen twenty five
and that would probably be a good enough start just put five ten
so put those in
oh hang on hang on hang on
yeah these are ones okay that's one two three four five
oh i see what you mean i thought
okay no sorry i didn't make that clear erm mark every fifth put the number on every fifth one
five six seven eight nine okay
to get so you've worked out your scale for this one that goes along the x axis
what's the biggest weight you're going to get if it was twenty five of them what would it come to
twenty five hundred
twenty five hundred
and how far how many have you got along there roughly
okay sixteen times three you've got almost you can almost get fifty up there wouldn't you
if you'd have brought your scale down a bit you would
yeah
have got it on
but okay maybe we won't go to twenty five
so use the same up there
mark every second square and each one's a each one is a hundred UNK
every second square
like
yeah
that's a hundred two hundred
yeah
okay
and the sec yeah be very careful when you're marking each second one because that one
oh ooh
right it is very easy to do you just get into a nice little UNK along
yeah
and you're not thinking and the next minute you do that and your graph goes all out then
that's it
so you might think why don't i make it easy and make it one square
because they're not one of them will be two squares and one of them bill we be one and so you need to get used to working with them like that
okay now you need to work out a table
ah you've got w equals a hundred times n
so we do a little thing like this
and we put n on the top right
n and w
so what values are you going to try
i mean they will normally give you them but erm what would be an obvious one to go for
UNK nought
right okay when n is nought when there's no engines what's the weight
nothing
right
so there's a there's a good point i mean very often you'll get this point in the origin not always though so you have to watch that
and how about when erm you've got ten engines what would that weigh
one thousand
okay
and when you've got twenty engines
the squares
yeah
yeah
when you've twenty engines what will that be
two thousand
okay
if you use a ruler or some sort of straight edge it really does help because it's very
yeah
easy when you go right across from one end of the page to the other to be a square up or a square down
and then you can't work out why your graph seems to have a UNK in it
okay
are they in a straight line
mm
no
so something's gone wrong
okay
one of those points isn't right so let's have a look check them again zero that's alright
yeah
what's the next one
ten when it's ten when we've got ten engines the weight should be one thousand
so there's ten and if you use your set square like that go along the ten and to the one thousand
that's okay
right twenty ah not quite on the twenty
two thousand yeah it is it is
right twenty two thousand
so the points seem okay what's wrong they're not in a straight line
they should be cos it's a straight line equation
what's going wrong
what else could be wrong
the erm size
right so this you made here when you suddenly went up one instead of going up by two so check the scale now
er let's check the bottom one
let's see how that's going
so each one of these is one engine
one so maybe you can write them all on now go along and write them on
one okay so that looks fine
now what's happening up here we're going up in hundreds
so do they go up did they all go along two squares at a time
yeah okay
do these all go up two squares at a time
one two three four yeah now what's gone wrong here
ah right
down
go on have you spotted anything yet
down here it's one two three four five six
right
and then seven
and then suddenly
nine and then it goes
suddenly
two hundred
right you started so you're going up in hundreds it's two squares at a time but only one hundred for each two squares
so you're quite happy with that one hundred two hundred three hundred four hundred five hundred six hundred oh i can do this standing on my head right and you s you stop concentrating so much and you've gone up to so that should be a seven hundred
seven
okay
so if you'd like to correct the UNK now
sixteen hundred
right now this one this one's going to be off our scale anyway so let's pick fifteen n is fifteen
so go through and check them again now
nought
no engines no weight that's okay let's put a just leave that and put a tick on it
now the next one ten and one thousand
ten engines
yeah
yeah okay so we can just sort of scrub that out or something
fifteen hundred
okay put that one in
right now we'll scrub that one out that UNK rubbish now
now try them see if it's a straight line
right
yeah
okay
so the first time you did it you were pretty happy with it weren't you
yeah
that's okay that's got that
you'd done the hard part correctly calculating what the weight would be for so many engines
working out your table your table was correct nothing wrong with that
but because the scale was this funny thing of well two of them means one hundred you're going along two at a time and it happens so often
i don't even know why i done that
you don't nobody knows why i've done it myself
nobody knows why they do it but you do
you're going up two squares at a time and you're going one two three and it's usually when you get to around where i tend to do it is erm sort of eight and ten
i go one two three four five six seven eight ten twelve fourteen sixteen and i'll think this UNK rubbish oh i've got the scales wrong
it's so easy to do
so
yeah
check it when you've done your scale
i mean you've done it you think well i know it's right there's no point checking it i've just done it
i wouldn't do it deliberately wrong but it's so
it was just i was just looking at there them down there
yeah okay
and i was thinking oh what's going on
but i wanted i mean i'm glad you made the mistake because i wanted you to do it because i wanted you to do it because as i you know you might you might get it right all the time and then do that in the exam
mhm
erm much better to get it wrong now and you can see
why
no one knows why you do it i mean you know you know what you should be doing and it's not difficult it's just so boring
it's so UNK marking your scale and people just lose concentration and i can do this you know and the next minute you you've gone up in twos instead of ones
happens a lot
so you've got your graph now and then they'd have a question on it and they might say erm what would be the weight with five engines
it now again we're picking okay
right now i'd like you to do this one on your own
it's a similar question
this time the weight of the lorry it's the weight of the lorry we're interested it's a say it's a small van
erm and the weight of the lorry is equal to eight hundred plus a hundred n
yeah
and yeah leave it like that eight hundred plus a hundred n
it's sh shall we make shall we i'm just trying to think of making it a no i won't make it any more awkward
we'll leave it like that
erm if you could draw a graph and use this table n zero weight whatever it comes to erm four six eight ten
okay
so if you can draw that one
the weight of the lorry see the lorry UNK something itself so its total weight when it's got its load on is eight hundred plus a hundred times the number of engines on it
so you've got to do your table
calculator
erm no
right you can do that can't you
yeah
you can do the hundreds
what you can do here if you like is put w there
here we could have a hundred n right and then we'd add eight hundred on to each one couldn't we
i mean you can use a calculator if you like but have a go without
okay
okay and tell me what you're thinking as you're doing it
ah what it is i want to find w so i can find that axis as well what
okay
that's gonna go have to go up to
good
you know so i'll do the table before i
right
do the graph
okay good
cos i might do a like
a big graph like and i only need a little tiny
and you'll little tiny bit
or you've done a tiny bit and you need something that's not
yeah
on your graph yeah
so
four times a hundred four hundred plus eight hundred is twelve hundred
so write it in there what a hundred n is four hundred
four hundred
and what about this one erm nought
nought times erm is nothing
yeah
plus eight hundred is eight hundred
right
yeah that's six hundred
right
erm eight hundred is fourteen hundred
right
eight hundred that looked like a one then
yeah
erm add eight hundred sixteen hundred thousand
okay and the question is now you could do it just by working it out with the formula
but they say draw the graph and then read off what would the weight the total weight be what is w when n equals fifteen and when n equal nine
okay
do you want me to do it by doing the graph or
just say let's say they also want you to do i want you to do the graph er they wanted this one where it was twenty as well okay
twenty times a hundred what would that be
two thousand
right okay good
there was a i ju i just looked there
yeah
i was being a bit lazy with myself then erm i just i just looked there and i was gonna double that
mm
and i found i'd just put a hundred there instead and that's why i put two hundred
it's so easy
there
right
it's so
i just
easy when you're working with figures that are going up in regular steps and they all go up in regular steps and they all go up in regular steps and the next one doesn't
and you just wow this is easy this add another two hundred on or
yeah
yeah
so watch that in an exam
cos you can you could do yeah you know you could you could this question on graphs and you come out the exam thinking wow great full marks on that
and you say well what did you get
oh i didn't get that
oh dear er ooh
and you find that you just slipped up on the scale or even on the calculating your table because you just oh this is easy this is easy
and you're not really concentrating
yeah
okay twenty eight hundred
two thousand eight hundred right so
yeah
w on the y axis
that's it
so it's got to go up to two thousand eight hundred
awkward
yeah
two square to get erm to go up in hundreds for two squares you'd want erm fifty squares wouldn't you
yeah
well just use one square makes it easier
one square each
yeah
is twenty eight squares
it's not going to be as accurate and not going to be as easy to read it off but
yeah
if you can't fit it on your paper
erm now is there any thing any other way you could do it
if you wanted it more accurate than that
what you can do is you could turn the graph that way up
you still have your w going up this way and you have your n going along that way
yeah
okay
it might work out better that way
could you get you say this is about fifty
could you get fifty six along there
probably yeah
okay so erm lo lose that little bit there sixteen and thirteen
twenty
twenty nine
twenty nine
okay
and we're getting three squares to the centimetre so we go up there two centimetres and we get the so if we go up every two squares
that three squares every centimetre
it's quite
sorry two
two
two you're right how did i
how did i get how did i come out with three last time
two squares every centimetre okay so we've got twenty nine so it will just fit on nicely
yeah
and we sort of get the
very little
yeah again it's not brilliant to do it this way but it will just fit on
so take that one along there
right and then as we go along what have we got going along
that goes up to about sixteen ooh we'll just fit twenty on
and we don't need to outside this at all cos the ones they're asking us are inside
so you'd get that one there
there's ten okay
mm
and there's another ten and we'll just about fit it on if we go right up to the edge of the paper sort of leave one square
and you might think well where are we going to put the scale
well we'll put it just put it the other side of the line
it's only to how us where it is
okay so that's nought along here going up in twos i'll let you do that for hundreds
yeah we're going to go up to two thousand eight hundred aren't we so we're going up in
two hundreds
each two is equal to one hundred is that right
yeah
so there's two squares there one hundred
okay
stop there a minute i know that's the way i started off
er how are you doing on just going up in hundreds and not two hundreds
have you checked
yeah
about here i was i just had the urge you know
yeah
at twelve
especially somewhere
to go
round the ten every happens to everyone they work you know ten twelve is the obvious one to go for the go eight nine ten twelve fourteen and then once you do it you don't realize you've done it and you don't stop
yeah
erm
but
a good a good way is to mark these twos out first yeah and get them all marked
i know it's a little bit longer but then when you're going up later
you don't
you're not see you're not thinking in twos you're not thinking i'll go up one and up two squares and okay
so you could carry on along there
now what's going to happen along the right hand axis we go up to twenty and so we can go along there in twos and it'll just fit on
okay so then if you'd like to mark that out in twos
another way of doing it of course is that as you're
hang on
going up in twos every two
you j right two sorry two squares erm is one engine
yeah
i should have been a bit a bit clearer about that
now as we've got nought one with a bit more room to fit in it works a lot better
we can just look at them sort of measure them off right there's two three four five okay
so you're using the ruler to go along
so if you want to just go along there and mark them off
any way that you can think of that will help to get these axes right because most of the time it's going to be this sort of thing i mean you said do you want me to work it you know use the graph or just work it out from this
it would be easier to work it out from this wouldn't it
yeah
the so the equations they give you your ability to handle equations means really it would be easier for you to do it without a graph half the time
but they want you to use the graph and that's what they're giving the marks for
the twenty okay
mark
so zero yeah zero is where
eight hundred
okay
so
right
and four is at
twelve hundred
six is at
yeah hold on
okay looking okay so far aren't they
yeah
erm so
should i go on
yeah carry on with those
fourteen
okay
so
yeah
ten
er did we do six
oh no we've got
six at fourteen
eight
hang on eight at eight at what
eight at
yeah
sixteen hundred
ten
ten eighteen
and twenty
twenty at two thousand eight hundred
okay and they should all be in a straight line
looks like it
yeah
i'll just and check them
well that's lovely isn't it one beautiful straight line
you expect it to go a little bit just a tiny bit off
yeah
about half a square or so off
erm a long ruler is a help
so when n is fifteen what's the weight
twenty three hundred
okay
and when n is nine what's the weight
seventeen
okay
now what i'd like you to do i didn't realize it'd got that late actually
what i'd like you to do is do this question again now okay
and erm draw the graph for that work it all out yourself and another one
it's similar to that but it's very different
this is the this is the question then w equals eight hundred minus a hundred n
there's a lorry loaded up with a lot of engines and it goes off dropping them off and as it as you take an engine so n is the number of engines taken off
now it's not eight hundred minus a hundred n because it starts of with erm twenty engines on already right
let's say it starts of with just to make it a bit easier for you so it doesn't come like this let's say it starts with fifteen engines on and what's its weight with fifteen engines on
two thousand three hundred
is that right
fifteen times a hundred plus the eight hundred yeah two thousand three hundred
okay
so it's weight is two thousand three hundred minus a hundred n
yeah i'd like you to draw a graph of that n is the number of engines taken off
erm you might have you might st start thinking i don't know what he's getting on i don't know what this is all about
what's he mean by it what am i supposed to do
just have a go at producing that graph and from it find out what is w when four have been taken off er when ten have been taken off and when fifteen have been taken off
okay
you couldn't give me a few more equations just
equations i certainly could i certainly could
oh now erm you're not at school next week do you
no
want a lesson next week
i'm very happy you do one
yeah
if you want
you do
okay erm tuesday wednesday right
what
i try to keep it the same time
what do you suggest i start to learn
any thing i'm not sure n sure of cos i've r i've really ran the school out of paper threes
i think you're doing very well actually erm
is there a book i could buy or
book
i wouldn't recommend this one it's just this is good for me because it's got sort of
yeah
examples in it
erm distance and speed we haven't done distance and speed erm
i've got that UNK text book
you have you
yeah
got that handy
yeah i've got it here
okay let's have a look at that i'll tell what we'll do i'll suggest a couple of exercises in that for you to work through
he here could just
yeah there it is
right
i don't know where that one was that erm sheet hang on stop
no
leave tho leave those in cos they're marking your place there i won't disturb those and let's have a little look at this useful ones for you to do
i got that one you remember the geometry one
yeah
i did get that one
you're really brilliant at ge really brilliant at geometry i think it's great
and you're really enjoying maths now aren't you
yeah
yeah the graphs it's just a question of doing a few and getting the feel of it and then we'll
so i'll give you some on erm on graphs
you're okay on trig ratios aren't you
yeah
here you are drawing graphs
straight line
erm you know what gradient is right
so if you do this formula in equations UNK equations erm put in standard form
exercises
yeah under question things and they give you the answers in blue
yeah i was looking for somewhere he doesn't
no they always give you the
okay
solving problems
if you read through in this about equations okay
simple linear equations you don't need to do the erm the brackets
so if you start about page fifty nine
two point three o and check through that and just make sure that you're very happy with the stuff that they're doing
and each time you come to the exercise each time they says they say here you are solve read through it with a bit of paper over it
yeah
so you're not looking at the answer
don't look at the answer
no
look at the question and then just close the book and say right i'm going to try and solve this equation
if you get stuck UNK one line just to see how they're starting
don't look at the whole answer and then cover it up again and think right okay that's a start and then try and do all i mean you're not going to have the book to help you in the exam
so
yeah
try and do all of it on your own if you can
erm if you can't check through the answers there
so you've got lots of stuff on equations all graduated and work through there some with brackets then with fractions
formulae and equations yeah
and problems on them UNK them and then through to these to the graphs
now i'm not sure whether you do non linear graphs erm don't forget to cover that side up when you're reading it
but if you go through there to all the way through to two point three
and then in two point three just do the linear just li linear just means it gives you a straight line
you can skip i mean you can go back to them if you finish this and you want more to do skip the non linear or the not linear they call them right
skip the not linear
has that got anything to do with physics
not cos like in physics we're doing these not or nor gates like
erm
you know as in
not really
really
not really no it's i mean not
it's just that they say if you're doing physics sometimes you know this might help you
oh it does help a lot
you know
it does help a lot
they do say that sometimes
it really is true
erm and then if you go onto drawing graphs from equations okay so skip that bit and just have a look at page sixty eight
okay
linear equations again solving equations sixty eight sixty nine seventy
have you done inequalities
less greater then and less that
yeah but i'm not i'm like that i'll have
okay
i have a look at it
ok oh okay erm i was going to say stop at two thirty five
but erm so you work through this lot
yeah
well i'd rather have more to do than have less to cos
you're really getting through a terrific amount of stuff and you keep asking for more it's great
really good okay
erm so read through inequalities which is two point three five
right now you may understand those you may think oh i can't really get the hang of this
doesn't matter and also two point three six work through that
pythagoras you won't have any problem on that
no
and your trig two point three seven
yeah
they sort of they tie together and you'll be using some equations and next time we'll give you som we'll have a look at graphs again just a quick
yeah
sort of i think you've got it now actually
yeah
it's just a question of you practise some
i think there was one question i'll root it out for next time erm and i was really UNK on it i might be okay on it now
right have a look at that again then
yeah
because there's going to be some question on graphs
yeah
there's always something on graphs
erm what have i got here oh i know what i've got mustn't pinch our book must i
what's the date
is it the first
erm the first no it's the thirty first today
thirty first leave a blank cos i forgot to ask him to sign it
now if you like you can sign all it says is erm it just it's just telling you what it is and saying that you don't mind them typing up the words form this
oh
they take out anything that can identify you or me erm if you know if i said sort of george or gave an address or a phone number they that would be chopped out
the tapes are UNK afterwards what they do is somebody types it all up and erm then they build it all up on a computer
yeah
how people use this and they put it in the dictionary
so if you're happy for them to use the tape okay
you just sign there and that's cos they can't use the tapes without your permission even though they're destroyed
erm yeah that's it
right i'm in the middle of painting at the moment as well s i thought it'll be UNK cos everyone's breaking up and UNK be saying forget and everyone's saying oh yes i do want a lesson
and i said in the holiday oh yes i do
so i just hadn't allowed for it and er m my wife was saying i've got some finishing off as well quite a students finishing off and erm my wife said put an advert in the paper
i said oh don't bother i always i always get people ringing up saying so and so's mother or father says or someone says you've been teaching them and can you take me or can you take my son or daughter and it always works like that
so my said ooh you know what if it doesn't you know you'd have none for next term sort of thing i said well i've got quite a few for next term still
she said put an advert in
i'd just phoned it through and people started ringing up saying you know somebody's mother tells me and can you come and do our son because he wants to do this and yes sure
that's my luck
don't forget the tape recorder that would be silly
yeah
how are we doing
that looks just about finished that okay
i'm not going to have time to get two i'll have a look through this before erm you've got the UNK it's a good one this
well it's my sister's you know
yeah
she passed maths first time
good
does she does she
help you UNK with it
do you talk to her
yeah she she's i hardly ever see her but when i do
how old is she
twenty
mhm okay
so i don't really
no when you other things to talk to
yeah
other things to talk about rather
yeah she'd get so she starts running when she UNK you otherwise wouldn't she
yeah
right erm i think that stuff that you're doing there will be fine but particularly at this idea of a gradient think in terms of the slope of a hill which is effectively what it's measuring
you know you say how steep is that hill well for every hundred you go along you'd go up fifteen
oh okay i've got some idea
erm or they might tell you the angle
just think about that and just use that graph there if you wanted to work out the angle there the tan of the angle would be that over that but only when the scale is the same on both axes
so you can use this the UNK of the angle use your calculator
what's the measurement for UNK
i isn't there one is it just a number
it's just it's just a number be because it's one length divided by another
yeah
so it you went along erm
so if you had like metres on one side and centimetres on the other
right then your gradient
is that is that what it's
your gradient would be would come out sort of all wrong then
mm
yeah
so if you're saying if say it was a railway where the UNK are very not very steep at all
and they said it goes up erm ten centimetres every UNK
virtually level
you'd think oh this is a big gradient
if you drew it on your graph it would be quite steep and it would look as if you were going up ten centimetres for every centimetre you went along which is almost vertical
you know so make sure the units are the same and the scale is the same so you're using the same number of squares for each one
if you want to just measure the angle and use the tan
now usually in the exams they work it so you can't do that cos they give you a graph already drawn and they'll have sort of erm two squares is equal to one unit along the bottom but only one square equals one unit
yeah
sort of going up
so if you do just measure the angle they say find the gradient and erm find the angle
and you can't just measure it
so you'll have to do that
erm i think you're doing really brilliantly
yeah
i think you're doing very well
you can tell yourself now that you you're really
yeah
getting a feel for it what you're doing
so if you work through those UNK erm
yeah
and then go back over stuff that you've done earlier that you haven't been able to understand where you've felt ooh i don't know what's going on here
erm and now see if you can make sense of it
look at what you've written and think oh i was just UNK about here i didn't know where i was going
and write it out again the way is should have been
how it should have been there and
it's a nice thing to know if you ever get tense er decide that this is it i'll throw things er well i do when i want to throw things at the kitchen and go away and you use UNK
and it's really nice
it's nice for both men and women
and so the men can try it just as much as the girls can as well
cos what possibly
so
we should tell you is that everybody here has suffered from mental health problems
yes
yes
so i find
so that might be might be our cure
yeah
i do find that i have been around everywhere
i mean i used to go to
park and all and all this
mm
er well before actually
so i've done er community work for a long time
so i do know the different things that do make people feel either a little bit better or might just help them
and the one thing that i over all these years i have found and i've come more and more into is UNK because it's not
i'm so worried about
drug like it's doesn't make you tired
unless you get too relaxed and you're er tired
erm it doesn't give you a headache it helps to maybe cure a headache and it's just nice UNK and i think if you were just to even with your partners or with friends even just massage somebody's hands or massage somebody's feet if you don't make them scream while you're doing it
it's really nice
so er body shop do have a ran they've bought a new range of UNK out so i can talk about body UNK it's easier when i've got it with me here
so i'm going to tell you what each one does and i'm gonna pass them round
now do any have any of you tried UNK
do you know what it is
mm
have you tried it
mm
tried UNK
UNK is the sense of smell
you all smell things don't you i mean you know when something UNK horrible and you know when something UNK nice
and so our sense of smell is very strong
so it soon tells you whether you like it or not
when you breathe something it goes up into your brain here what they call the UNK bulb up here and this is right near the memory
and how many of you have UNK things and you think it turns you back either to when you were a child maybe new bread a certain flower
UNK
UNK yeah
you see you see chocolate ooh i haven't got a chocolate UNK one here
er oh yes i have
no i haven't got the UNK
erm yes chocolate has UNK body else think of anything that
oh grass UNK
grass UNK
grass UNK send your memory
mm
straight back won't it
mm
to sometimes happier times
mm
fresh laundry
yes
yes
mm
mm
the smell of the sort of the w
clean sheets
yes
mm
the washing and that
erm but it does bring you back with things
i always think of er as i say new bread always brings me back a lot of memories
so smell is very important erm s and this is why it's called UNK
it tries to make you feel better by the sense of smell
you can massage them on your hands on your UNK or you can use it as a what they call steam UNK
put it in a bowl of water a few bowl of hot water a few drops like you do if you got a cold and just breathe in
so these are that's how you use UNK
and it help it doesn't say it'll definitely cure you of anything but it will help maybe to UNK some problems
you have to have an open mind i always think with these things
right
now you can see body UNK here i've got them in a nice box now
they look better they all used to be one colour before but we've now extended the range and so they've put them in different colour bottles
now the red range at the top here is all the oils to make you relax
and all the oils at the bottom the blue ones are to make you UNK happy UNK we hope
so if you ever go in and you want to have a oil that UNK you look at all the red ones
again you must have one that you like the smell of
also with essential oils they come from plants leaves UNK roots er parts of flowers and plants
if you were to use essential oil neat that's the little drops of oil it's too strong and it will h well it won't harm you but it won't it might set up UNK
you must always mix it with an oil
and if you went say to 's where they sell essential oils theirs are pure oils
you must always buy what they call a carrier oil to help mix the oils
now ours we've helped you by already mixing it so ours have got three percent of essential oil to a carrier oil which in our case happens to be UNK erm UNK oil which is a very light carrier oil
so i'll start with the first one and i'll pass it round and just put either the relaxing on one hand and the UNK on the other and you'll have one hand relaxed the other one doing this
so and see just get to like the smell
see which one you like the smell of as i pass them round
now the first one is UNK
have any of you ever been on a UNK lawn
tea
mm
or UNK tea yes
yes
yeah
yeah
very relaxing
well this i think's well it UNK better than UNK tea
i always think it UNK a bit weak doesn't it
this one the UNK is very good for the we call it the children's one because it's good for everything for children really
if they get a bit UNK and they're crying a lot maybe cos they're UNK you could just massage a little bit on their UNK
if they're UNK just on their jaw line
you never take them internally it's always UNK you use these
or if you've got a headache you can massage it on your UNK
if you suffer from UNK any dry skin complaint UNK is quite a UNK for that
if you get UNK patches do any of you ever get UNK patches
mm
mm
mm
mm
i find sometimes i get UNK
mm
patches and you don't know why maybe you've been in the garden or something UNK you you'll find that UNK will c UNK and calm that down
so gonna pass it round and just if you do this
it'll drop eventually like that
if you shake it doesn't seem to drop
but just drop a bit on that's it a drop
yeah i don't want to take too much though
that's it
right
just massage it on your hand
i'll leave some UNK around so that if you don't like it or you want to rub it off you can always use a tissue
there
there
your UNK wonder where you've been mike
yes
yes
ooh yeah
no
no you don't like that one
no right
no
right
there
can smell that from here
yeah
i think it'd give me a headache not take it away
right
so you'd say to yourself right
no
you don't like UNK that's not gonna do you any good
the next one which is similar to UNK and which i find a lot of people like better is lavender
everybody thinks of grandma with lavender
lavender in the cupboards and lavender everywhere
lavender again is good for headaches and it's good if you can't sleep or you suffer a bit from UNK
no i s i don't suffer from that
no like me the opposite direction
erm but if you can't sleep you could put a little bit on a UNK on your UNK or rub a little bit on your chest and it'll help to erm make you sleep
lavender is also one that's quite good for things like UNK
if you suffer from UNK at all
cos UNK can often be s UNK by stress
erm UNK is good it's also good for burns
what do you do with UNK then
do you
well you would just massage it on your face
mhm
over your face
you can put it with a moisturizer
mhm
or you could just erm
put on your hands and just gently go over your face
mhm
make sure you washed your hands first before you do it
and it's supposed to help erm calm the skin down
cos it's often UNK is caused by the UNK of the UNK
and what it does the s erm UNK is very poisonous
if it can't get out from the surface of the skin then it goes underneath and gets these great lumps which are very poisonous
mm
i mean often UNK runs in families as well
it you know everybody
mm
can be UNK to it
but you can help by sort of relaxing the UNK so that the oil can come out
but it is the UNK of the UNK that
mm
sends more oil through
so lavender can help calm it
it's also good for UNK and if you burn yourself
if you get very sun
really
yeah it's very calming
apparently during the first world war some professor erm was using a UNK and he burned himself quite badly and by him he just UNK he just happened to have some lavender oil essential and for the nearest thing he put his hand in there and apparently it was supposed to have UNK it down and it UNK very quickly
so during the first world war and in the second for severe burn cases they use er used lavender mm if they didn't have any drugs of any kind
is that like a dock leaf when you
yes that's the same sort of thing
the plants have
yeah
a certain chemical
yeah
and if you UNK yourself you go and get a dock leaf
you
dock leaf yeah
don't know why but the dock leaf takes the UNK out
it's a similar sort of thing
so the lavender is good for headaches it's good
mm
for UNK
where's that one put it er somewhere else
just put it somewhere
i'm gonna run out of space here you know
roll your UNK up
roll your UNK up yeah
that's it
is this still a is
yeah
this a r these are r the relaxing
ones we're on
these are all the relaxing ones now so also if you've got them on breathe deeply
now just breathing deeply with it will help you relax
not with the UNK one it won't
no
no not with the UNK one maybe that's
i'm not keen on that one
not keen on that
not so good
you've got to like the smell
oh yeah
otherwise it just will not do you any good
right
well that's better
do you like that the lavender better
well yeah i got in a lavender bush when i was small so
oh did you
you'll like the lavender one
my brothers er i mean you know this lavender bush and get in there
bet you UNK lovely when you came out
UNK heap
yeah
all right
another one which is very relaxing and this one you'll find much stronger that the it's a different smell
those two that we've had are UNK are flowers
the UNK is a flower but it's a tropical flower and it's this is called can be called the oil of UNK
so this g very good for things like shock like when my husband gets a telephone bill
to my son you have been on the phone again
or if you're frightened or if you're very anxious if you're gonna do something important and you've not done it before and you get a bit anxious you can use the UNK which is the oil of UNK
it's very calming
or the next committee meeting
yes
yes
you'd better use that
couldn't you leave me a drop
yeah so UNK is it's very good it's a good sort of all round one
mm
but this has a much different smell to the others
mm
eh
you might like that one it's sort of more
right
erm it's not sort of UNK
lovely
it's gorgeous
yeah i they're not UNK are they
no
they're delicate
mm
no
i found we used to have them mixed with sweet UNK oil and UNK oil which i find this one brings out their UNK much more the UNK oil
it's supposed to be erm a lighter oil
and of course with body shop it's more environmentally easy to get
yes
we always have to have things that you know are easier to do or are not s such a hassle with the environment
so did you like that one at all
yeah
it's not bad
you're thinking about that one
well i think i need i think i need something a bit stronger that all these three
oh do you
a mixture of all three
the next one we've got is rose
oh yeah
now rose is one of the oldest essential oils
and rose and UNK are our sort of UNK ones now
before when we had our other range they were all the same price which was wrong really because it's a lot easier to get lavender than it is to get rose
mm
and if you went and bought the essential oil you could buy
don't you like it
lavender for about three pound a bottle whereas UNK and rose are eighty six pound a bottle
so now we've alter varied the prices
lavender is one ninety five and rose and UNK are four ninety five so it does make a you know a difference
now rose i don't know how many of you when you were little used to collect rose UNK and put them in the jam UNK did you
yeah
ooh yeah
yes
and tried to get
and all you got was a UNK mess
it is very difficult to get essential oil from the rose it has to be done by what they call UNK
they put it on a UNK or a fat in layers and let the oil UNK through and so it takes a lot longer and is more difficult to get
erm the rose i has been used through the centuries
again the UNK used to use rose
it's a sort of slight relaxing and an UNK and it's supposed to help your headaches
does everybody know what an UNK is
oh yes an UNK
do you know what it is
is it er something to make you go h high
y yes sort of
UNK s sort of something like a it makes you go it makes you go l loose and nice and feeling good inside
that's it
sort a er you know you you're happy but you're full of go at the same time
yeah
you're not so th relaxed that you want to do this but you're relaxed and yet you're happy with life as well
mm
so this is what rose is supposed to be
it's more
mm
of a sort of they call one of the women's essential oils er cos i suppose they think rose was a woman really don't they
so it's good again for headaches
it's good for people with dry skins
the dry mature skin as they say
mm
er so you can mix it with your moisturizer
all these you could use as a face UNK in a face cream
so again this is good for headaches dry UNK skin
it's good just to make you feel good
some people use it as a UNK
no i think i know what a rose UNK like
you yes
he's gonna he's gonna bypass that one
not macho
no
enough
no i just i know they ta i know what they smell like you know
yeah
everybody's asleep in a minute everybody's
i've got the UNK ones next you're all right
are you okay in the corner karen enjoying the UNK
nearly asleep
haven't been so relaxed for ages have we
in the with the UNK with have in our mother and baby range UNK range and i usually go to mother and baby u UNK and m massage the babies with it
you know and they seem to love it yeah
oh how lovely
yeah
and usually the one i massage at the end is way out asleep you know
mm
i'm getting very popular at these mother and baby things
right the last one on the UNK
l the relaxing one is one called UNK which is my favourite
now UNK is made from the UNK of the bitter orange tree
you get three essential oils from the orange tree
you get UNK from the UNK er UNK and orange which erm or UNK whi people might call it from the fruits and from the leaves and the UNK and the bark you get er an oil called UNK
so it's very useful is the orange tree
erm UNK is very good for sensitive skins for people who have er you know veins on the surface
mm
men don't usually suffer
mm
from that it's
mm
yes
it's sort of the ladies who get
mm
the veins on the s red UNK
yeah
yeah
and a red nose
it's also good for erm depressed if you're depressed UNK is very good for depression
it's also very good again if you're going on your committee meeting or you're going for an interview to rub on what they call the UNK just here
yeah
it helps to when you get you know when you get the your tummy
UNK
UNK yeah
and to rub on there and it helps to calm it down
they do say that essential oils will often work quicker than a tablet
i mean i've never timed them
cos it depends how you feel
but that's what they do say that it sometimes works quicker
so if you're going or when my daughter had a driving test i was UNK all over her in the hope that she would calm down
did she pass
well only the third time
she just went UNK as soon as she saw the UNK
it wouldn't be so bad er she's not a nervous type normally and it's the only person that's sort of made her go completely nervous
so UNK again is good for the skin
you ma when you smell
it is lovely isn't it
yeah it is relaxing
when you smell this one
everybody's so relaxed
we are not normally like this
when you smell this one you may re there's the l the girls particularly may recognize it from face cream
a l UNK is a lot in face UNK cos it is good for the skin
go on smell that one cos it's a nice one
i'm going to get him to like one
i can't smell anything now
do you like UNK
i like the lavender best
mm
it's probably a knock on effect
lavender must
mm
be nice sort of in the bath at night
yes
so which one is the best sort of
lavender is
we have a erm a bath oil here
oh well i've got the massage one which w we might massage our hands or massage somebody's hands in a minute
this relaxing massage oil has got lavender in and UNK and UNK
and UNK so it's nice for men as well cos they're supposed to like UNK and UNK
and this is nice if you just use a UNK in a drawn bath
and so if you were to use that at night and then put a bit of lavender on it is really nice
mm
really relaxing
erm the massage oil which this one is i use a lot of this for UNK and but people find it very relaxing
er
if you have a bath in the morning what
well if you have a bath in the morning we have we have we have if i've got it here i haven't got one here but we do have a UNK shower gel
mhm
and that's got lemon and lemon grass and er bay in that one i think
so that's you can use that in the bath as well but they call it a shower gel because a shower oil because they think people usually have a shower in the morning and a bath at night
mm
but if you haven't got a shower you can use it anyway
but that one is quite erm oh i thought i had some in here
obviously not
oh i'm not keen on that one
oh that do you do you remember those
you don't like UNK yes it's
little erm you used be able to get i don't know if you still can little UNK in little UNK and they UNK of this
yes
mm
little face UNK
UNK
we do that with the UNK ones again
mm
it's in my other box
oh i like those
we've got
i quite like it
mm
right ladies and gentlemen we will no will now continue
erm mr
sir i don't know whether this would be a convenient moment but i have taken instructions on the
oh yes quite
the which er was raised er
yes
and also raised by your colleague erm with regard to the decisions of the parish council
yes
sir reference to my appendix number five makes it clear that there was some lack of knowledge er by those in the village er round about june nineteen ninety two as to what was going on in ryedale with regard to the site north of skelton
and you will see there as appendix five
yes
a copy of a letter from the chief planning officer of ryedale to
yes
mr who is on my right and who was previously the chairman of the southern area planning committee of ryedale district council but not at that time which explains that erm a change was in hand
yes
and the parish council was UNK to this fact and held a meeting on the seventeenth of july nineteen ninety two the relevant part of the minute of which reads as follows
it is minute number fifteen
yes
the council oppose proposed changes relating to amendment of the greenbelt plan by excluding two fields on the UNK edge of the village from the greenbelt
the council felt the proposed inset boundary of the village should remain as published in the original consultation and proposals documents and that in itself indicates sir a minor degree of confusion sir
the parish council even at that stage was not fully aware of the situation
they were referring to the deposit copy
should remain as published in the original documents and were surprised at the proposed changes raised at the eleventh hour prior to a public enquiry in september nineteen ninety two
the original proposed boundary of the greenbelt was tightly drawn against properties in the village and the proposed changes are inconsistent with this
also the proposed changes would UNK upon the skelton conservation area
that sir is the end of that minute
yes right
thank you
could we have copies of the minute do you think
er w you wish to have a copy of the whole document sir
no
right
well not necessarily but if copies could be made of that page
yes
yes
thank you very much
i'm still a little bit in the dark
i'd like to read the minute
yes
right
erm perhaps we can leave it till i have read it then and
yes
right
then if there's anything
more to be said i'll say it then
yes right thank you very much
right thank you
mr do you have any questions
sir i adopt the cross examination
right thank you very much
right well we'll move on then please
mr ward
thank you very much sir
i'll call mrs then to present
yes thank you
the county's evidence
thank you very much
erm
yes
yes please
mrs i'll ask you if you would please to read the summary of your proof of evidence from document n y two three seven
objections to the deposit plan have been received concerning two adjoining sites at the northern end of skelton topic area d thirty nine which is a paddock and topic area d forty which is a small field between the paddock and the a nineteen
in respect of d thirty nine the objection is that the paddock should be included within the greenbelt
the objections to d forty are that the field should be excluded from the greenbelt
could i say at this stage i is anybody having difficulty hearing at the back
c could i suggest firstly you move forward to the front row er on both sides because th there's little point in er asking mrs to speak louder if
thank you
move closer to the public rather than further away from them
in april nineteen ninety two the county council UNK the greenbelt boundary around skelton and resolved to propose a change to exclude topic area d forty from the greenbelt
two objections have been received to the proposed change
UNK objection site d thirty nine UNK to some one point two five hectares and is UNK on three sides by UNK trees and tracks and on the south side by the boundary with existing property
objection site d forty is an area of UNK that is that is split in two by a post and rail fence
it UNK to some one point four hectares
hedges and trees mark three of the boundaries with the southern boundary being a post and rail fence along church lane in the UNK of
the county council considers that the two sites do not fulfil any greenbelt purpose
in the county council's opinion the northern boundary of the site which comprises UNK a line of trees hedge and track effectively acts as a screen between the site and the open agricultural land to the north and can adequately prevent any UNK of the village or UNK onto the open agricultural land and will not therefore prejudice the special character of york
none of the other greenbelt purposes are relevant to these sites
the deposit plan greenbelt boundary and amended is a well defined UNK boundary and is therefore an appropriate boundary
the county council has noted that noted the representation that the greenbelt boundary around skelton should follow the edge of the built up area for its entirety
however the county council takes the view that the objection sites do not fulfil any greenbelt purposes and should not therefore be included in the greenbelt whereas elsewhere around skelton any relaxation of the boundary would result in UNK into the open countryside to the UNK of the greenbelt
the objectors have raised various development control issues concerning the site
while the county council has noted these points it does not consider that they are relevant to the definition of greenbelt boundaries
for the reasons outlined above the county council remains of the opinion that the two sites to the north of skelton should be excluded from the greenbelt and included within the skelton village inset
thank you mrs
thank you very much
mr
mrs you attach considerable importance to the physical characteristics of boundaries don't you
drawing of greenbelt boundaries attention should be paid to ensure that the greenbelt boundaries are UNK
to that extent they should follow physical features on the ground
and when you have looked at skelton as a whole you have concluded apparently from your paragraph seven point seven that any relaxation of the greenbelt boundary elsewhere around skelton would result in an UNK extension of the built up area contrary to the objectives of the york greenbelt
for what reason do you believe that a relaxation as you put it of the greenbelt boundary from the deposit copy to the line you now propose north of this important village would not do so
in as much that er in the county council's opinion these two s these two paddock fields whatever you call them to the north of skelton are visually more related to the village whereas the other land around skelton is clearly open agricultural land and therefore forms part of the open countryside around skelton
am i to believe from that you regard the characteristics of the open countryside around skelton as being more important for greenbelt purposes and the contribution to york than the land within the boundary you now propose
but the purpose of the of the greenbelt is to prevent UNK into the open countryside
as i have just said we UNK the county council does not consider that these two fields form part of the open countryside around skelton
are you not by adopting that view mrs UNK the concept of the importance of the character of skelton in relation to the setting of historic york
not at all
i expect that the paddock in particular UNK to the character of skelton and inclusion in the conservation area
however these two sites are more part of the character of skelton and their inclusion or exclusion from the er inclusion in the greenbelt wouldn't add any further to the character of skelton and this part of the area
development of this land would UNK from the character of skelton wouldn't it
that may be
what then is your primary reason for reducing the safeguard against development which greenbelt protection UNK bearing in mind that skelton is a village of considerable character
well the purpose of the county council is to draw up a greenbelt local plan and therefore it is a question of whether or not the sites fulfil or do not fulfil a greenbelt purpose
the county council is not concerned with the future uses of the land
how do you square that view with the view of your colleague that the whole of the village of flaxton performed a greenbelt purpose
sorry i'm not aware of flaxton
i mean UNK beyond the six mile limit for the greenbelt
i'm not quite sure what you're talking about
could you keep your voice up please mrs
i i'm having difficulties and i'm sure those at the back are
sorry it's cos i'm turning this
well if you aim for the microphone
not because of if i any importance it has but simply because in that way the centre of the room
mrs the primary purpose of the york greenbelt is to have an effect on the character of historic york is it not
it is to protect the historic character of york
and
that's one of the purposes yes
and it has and it has it not been admitted in at least one of your background documents that the character of the settlements round york have a part to play in that
yes in our document n y two which sets out the objectives of the york greenbelt in more detail
erm it is the character of the s setting of the villages UNK er within their rural UNK which is part of the character that UNK to the character of york
and therefore it's not just a question of protecting the open countryside round the village
it is the protecting the character or the setting of the village within its rural UNK
is that setting greatly affected by the incidence of hedges and fields
part of the character obviously is going to be the land use er the land the land use and the features within the land
any land
the question surely is whether land is open country not whether that open country is UNK by a boundary a good hedge or a good line of trees which would undoubtedly be a suitable greenbelt boundary
surely the question is whether the land on each side of it has the same greenbelt function or different greenbelt functions
well i've er as i've previously said in the county council's opinion these two fields do not perform a greenbelt function they are visually and physically separate from the open agricultural land both to the north and to the west of the sites
visually and physically
i will therefore put to you a hypothetical question
would the contribution which they make relative to each other be altered were the characteristics of the boundary between them less marked no trees no substantial hedge
the character you by that you mean the character the boundary
the contribution
that links the two
yes
would the contribution made by this land on either side of this boundary you now propose be altered were there in fact no marked physical boundary between them
in terms of their greenbelt function the boundary between them has no effect on the greenbelt purposes
it is the boundaries to the north alongside the a nineteen
it follows therefore does it not that one has to look at the characteristics of the land you now propose to take out of the greenbelt in the same way as the land immediately to the north which you propose should remain
in as much to decide whether or not these sites have a greenbelt function
it's not the boundary that is important to look at it's whether the land is open land isn't it
it's whether the land UNK a greenbelt function
open land doesn't necessarily mean that it should be in the greenbelt
that does not necessarily follow
and the land to the north does form a greenbelt perform a greenbelt function is that
yes
so
yes
the land that you're now proposing to take out does not
that is correct
despite the fact that both are open land
well as i've just said open land does not necessarily mean that it serves a greenbelt purpose
nonetheless you draw this distinction despite the fact that the characteristic of both those areas is the characteristic of UNK
yes but th in the county council's opinion these two sites are more visually related to the character or of skelton village where the land quite clearly agricultural land and UNK to these three fields
when you answered the question a moment ago about the importance of the boundary the size of it and so on you indicated that it was not
i indicated that the boundary between the two sites was not important in determining whether or not or in the county council's opinion had no effect for the determination of whether or not these sites played a greenbelt function
you know that i do not necessarily go along with your concept of visual character in the way that you use it but would the visual character be altered in a way that would cause a coincidence of greenbelt function were that important hedge not in existence on the north side of d thirty nine
if there were no hedge let us say on the north side of d thirty nine would the visual character to which you have just made reference be altered
well it's very difficult to say what the because presumably the character of the paddock would have changed and the character of the conservation area likewise and it may well be that the use of that site wouldn't be a paddock
it's difficult to be to comment on a hypothetical situation
it may the removal of that UNK may not just may have other knock on effects
i'm not entirely clear about your answer
let me put it another way
is it your view that the area known as d thirty nine UNK to be part of the open country just because a UNK and some trees UNK the view from it across more open country
that is one the boundary to the north of these two sites is a very firm distinct feature and very
it effectively cuts off the land the open agricultural land from these two fields and therefore visually it makes the paddock more part of skelton village
you are you not
if you took it away i it would be difficult to say quite how it would affect
you are therefore UNK the importance of this hedge and er trees very greatly are you not
you are giving them higher importance than the character of the ancient part of skelton
but the trees are there
tha a they add to that they are part of the character of that area
and because they are there the risk of development taking place in this conservation area at some future date should willy UNK be allowed to be increased
which it would not if the trees and the hedge were not there
is that your case
well as i've said it's difficult to comment different situation the physical features are different
because it may well be that land wouldn't be considered being part of the conservation area
but trees and UNK are part of the open country they are an essential feature of the english countryside as we have in the known it are they not
yes they are part of the features of the o open countryside but in this particular case the UNK of skelton village to that boundary and the UNK of the of the of the houses around that area and the er other features make this paddock part and the adjoining part of the more visually part of the village
mr
sorry
i was just going to say i think mrs 's really a answered the question as far as she's able to do
yes
there is one further concept sir which er mrs has obviously developed er which is a new concept and it is contained in her paragraph eight point four
mrs you state that open land does not necessarily mean open countryside
this is very interesting
would you please elaborate
well it means exactly what it says
you don't wish to elaborate for us
you could have you could have open land within a village it doesn't necessarily mean it's open countryside
are you referring for instance mrs to the football ground which i notice is in the village
mm
i was commenting in response to the UNK proof in this particular case
i was just taking that as a working example of the concept which you're putting forward
yes i mean i'm saying that there's obviously open land within built up areas
that doesn't necessarily follow that it is open countryside
for example the land at skelton hall could be regarded as open land but no one is suggesting that should be part of the greenbelt
but your council does admit that d thirty nine and d forty are open in character
in as much as there are no buildings on them yes
they're open in yes
they're open in character because they are not part of the built up area of skelton
they're open in character because they're not built upon
yes exactly
you mentioned that permission has been refused erm in connection with development on d thirty nine on four occasions by ryedale
is your council in full agreement with the attitude behind those UNK
the county council as i'm aware was not actually consulted on these particular applications and therefore i'm not really in a position to be able to comment as what the county council's position
thank you mrs
no thank you very much sir
well i think can i just clarify mrs the position as far as the council is concerned
if i understand it correctly the inset for skelton is made not because of any question of policy e ten but to recognize the existence of a substantial built up area which in the county council's opinion er does not cannot perform a greenbelt function
is that correct
that's correct yes
and therefore in the county council's erm opinion the test which i need to adopt when i go to the site again is to look at it and er simply make a decision as to whether or not in my opinion the land is more properly a part of this built up area which cannot perform a greenbelt function or is a part of the general extent of greenbelt around there and therefore by definition performs a greenbelt function
that's right
well you've set me a relatively straightforward test if that is the test
thank you
mrs just er a point
going along the road er on the a nineteen from the north towards er the village er if one assumed that there were to be some development on site d forty would you be able to see it from the road
well as you approach the site from d er from north on the a nineteen you can catch UNK of and also of the houses to the south of church lane
and therefore any further development on that site would be seen against the existing UNK of
by the UNK
that's right
yes
does it make does it matter that the land is UNK above the road above the a nineteen
this site is UNK above the road
it may just mean that you might see er i mean is UNK above the a nineteen and indeed you can catch UNK of it
but the site itself
there i there is a gentle
yes
slope
yes
level
that's right
yeah
but the screening along the a nineteen is particularly dense
right thank you very much mrs
sir while mr
yes
is taking his seat i'm causing to be handed out this plan
it's merely a larger er larger plan showing how the settlement sits er within the surrounding field network and field pattern
right thank you
thank you
thank you very much
a as it is simply er an UNK sheet i assume there's no need to give it er a document number
i do i don't believe so sir
thank you
right thank you very much
yes mr would you read your summary please
the objection sites are located on the northern side of skelton village
they consist of a horse paddock and rough UNK three point four hectares point five one acres and are UNK generally by trees UNK and rear gardens of residential properties
the objectors object on the grounds that the village of skelton should be washed over by the greenbelt that the site should be identified as greenbelt and therefore it should be excluded from the built inset and that the development of the site would have an adverse impact on the surrounding area
the district council have not addressed the issue of washing over the village of skelton within the greenbelt as this is a new issue not raised by
the district council considers that the objection sites do not perform any of the greenbelt functions
the district council also considers that the northern western boundaries of the sites which UNK a line of trees hedge and track are appropriate well defined and UNK greenbelt boundaries which separate the site from the open countryside beyond it
the district council considers that the UNK of the sites in the greenbelt is because they do not perform a greenbelt function and not an indication that the sites are suitable for development particularly as sufficient housing land has been identified in local plan
the district council considers that the sites may have a role to play in the long term strategic land reserve although at this stage as no calculations have been carried out as to the requirements it is difficult to assess what role they might play
furthermore the amount of white land identified in the local plan is a measure of whether land performs a greenbelt function and not simply a long term strategic land reserve
the district council considers that many of the object remaining objections are not greenbelt issues although they have taken the opportunity as follows
that any future development of the sites would not be subject to normal planning controls cause UNK to the conservation area local listed buildings or the archaeology and natural history of the sites
the traffic impact of any development could be accommodated without serious UNK to the surrounding area but although the above constraints are not seen as UNK they may well act as a deterrent to development
the UNK of the sites in the greenbelt does not UNK policy of southern ryedale the greenbelt and that the views of those who have not contributed previously should not be addressed
for the above reasons the district council UNK that the two sites north of church lane skelton should be excluded from the greenbelt and i included in the inset
yes
remain there remain there please
thank you mr please
mr in these shifting grounds that we perceive around us as a result of the deliberations of your authority and north yorkshire county council it is difficult is it not always to be sure of the reasons which have caused the changes in view
you say that the district council believes that the two sites to the north of church lane skelton should be excluded from the greenbelt and included in the inset for the village
the case for the objectors is that they would wish the boundary proposed by your own authority at an earlier stage to be the boundary
now the words that the two sites should be within the greenbelt mr a UNK change
well i think it's inevitable that er during the local plan process that erm that changes do occur
the reason for local plan consultation is such that erm it gives the opportunity for objectors to make comments and otherwise and that district council and the county council erm should consider er objections and it's i it happens that erm the local authorities you know can change their mind as the process goes along
and they take account of comments do they
that's true
it was at the very next stage wasn't it that you had this switch from a boundary which we could accept to one which we UNK could not accept
was that as the result of comments
er as far as i'm aware it was yes
could you explain the reason then behind your council's change of view
well in the in the final analysis of the of the er the er considerations of these two sites the er area of UNK skelton in general erm it was considered that they that they did not perform a greenbelt function
did you search around for any other reasons such as the mention of a possible strategic reserve
i think that er i think the question of a strategic reserve erm falls er as secondary to the to the fact that the land or the sites do not perform a greenbelt function
i've said in evidence that er in my evidence that erm that the sites may have a role to play
but
that wasn't the reason for f identifying the sites as white land
it was principally because they didn't perform a greenbelt function
whereas previously you thought they did
that was presumably the district council's view at that time yes
what was your own view
well it's difficult for me to say because i wasn't involved with the at that time
most convenient for you
how can you be sure that any future development of these sites would not have a UNK effect on the conservation area the listed buildings the archaeology and the natural history
well it's not impossible that er that developments er can take place erm without erm without having some effects but what i'm basically saying is that erm it er it wouldn't be a serious effect acceptable in normal planning terms
and you have great shortage of
i'm sorry o one moment
i think there was an extra wasn't there a negative in that sentence which UNK in unnecessarily
could you just say it again mr
i you said it's not impossible
i don't think you meant that did you
can you just sa just say it again
and let me see if i've got it i've got it right
yes
erm i personally sir did not detect any double negative there
erm i think
maybe
mr er i as so far as i got not impossible for development to occur with these constraints
it's not impossible for development to take place even with these constraints
yes
yes
that's what you
yes
i don't know whether that's precisely
what you said but that's what the intention was
yes
i suggest that
that is the meaning i got mr
it is a matter of degree isn't it mr
there is a possibility then
you think that there's equally a possibility that damage might be UNK
yes
how great is your need for additional building land at skelton
as i said in m in my proof er sufficient land has been identified in the in the local plan period
it is not we're not proposing that these sites should be allocated for development
has your council determined any policy with regard to the period after two thousand and six in relation to the current plan
in terms of
in terms of building development
we haven't no we haven't we as i said no calculations have been carried out
do sites exist elsewhere in your area mr that are not so UNK about by ancient history natural history conservation areas which might equally form a strategic reserve for your UNK post two thousand and six requirement
there may be
then why do you UNK for one which has these UNK
to look at it from that point of view
well as i've s as i've said earlier erm what we're basically saying is that because these erm sites do not perform a greenbelt function and er they then fall into a white land situation that white land is a is an area of land that becomes er at the end of the plan period in two thousand and six er they are areas which could be considered development
but you're looking at this from an inset point of view aren't you
you have gone along with the county council they want to move what they UNK to be an inset boundary
i dispute that
it's an inset problem and therefore one is looking inevitably at the reasons for which you can moved an inset boundary supposing that one already exists which it doesn't but let us suppose it does
the reasons for moving are relevant
well the question as far as inset er is concerned we've already touched on this morning and i believe it was discussed yesterday
erm the decision to inset the village of skelton erm has ha h has been taken by the authority the er the consideration and assessment of where the boundaries of the inset should lie erm is what we're considering today
yes and the move is proposed to include land which is not at present built on
that's true yeah
and the reason permitted reason under policy e ten the oldest statutory policy governing the movement of boundaries of UNK is the existence of a need for that
well i think i think you're getting into the into the wrong argument
however you do recognize that policy e ten and its requirement for proof of need is important in regard to the boundaries of UNK
well i
have you pushed out a boundary from the point of view of strategic requirements after two thousand and six anywhere else in your area
not that i'm aware of no
so skelton is UNK favoured looked at from your point of view
it's a other sites erm w would come into consideration at that at that time erm in the long term
it's not been the principle er reason for excluding sites from the greenbelt
you say mr that the constraints to which i've already referred may well act as a deterrent er to potential developers
that's true
do you think it would be a good idea to UNK planning control in the sense of letting it be up to developers to choose whether they should go ahead or not on the basis of what they UNK to be constraints or that should be within the entire realm of the local planning authority
i was simply making a comment at your suggestions about the likelihood of development of the site
er
mr i have many matter to consider in my report so i let's not widen it even further into this rather wider philosophical matter
certainly sir
there is however one er overriding point here mr
that is you recognize do you not that greenbelt protection includes the concept of the initial negative presumption that is not contained in any other area of planning
thank you very much
yes can i just be clear er mr
you say as i understand it that er the possible er use of this land as a strategic reserve is not the main reason er for excluding it from the greenbelt
is it a reason
did it form any part of the council's
i would think not
well i need to be sure on this
er are you saying that it is any part of the council's case that this land th it it's it is er a possibility that having this land as a strategic reserve er can er is of assistance or are you saying that it is simply er having included it in it might form part of a strategic reserve
er two rather different approaches
yes
i asked mrs a question about the appropriate approach that i should make to this site in her opinion
i don't know if you i hope you remember that question it was rather a long one
i hope you remember even more her answer to it because the question is do you agree with it
i think you'll have to re have to repeat the question
oh dear
right let me see if i can get it the same
i do recall something of it now but i can't details
well the point was as i recollect it er that my understanding as far as the county council's case was concerned was that er the village was not inset for e ten purposes it was inset to recognize what the county perceived as the physical reality of this being a substantial built up area which fulfilled no greenbelt functions
and the question before them and therefore before me in r considering the objections is whether or not these sites are part of the general extent of greenbelt around the village or are a part of this village er which does not as a whole perform a greenbelt function and that's what i'm looking at when i make my site visit
yes
i'm sure that wasn't the same wording
but i hope it was the UNK of it and i'm sure someone will correct me if i've got it wrong
er i er now do you agree with mrs 's answer
yes i do
good
right i've got no questions for you mr thank you very much
case for the district sir
thank you very much
currently sir erm i do propose mrs
yes
sir firstly because there is a slight UNK on matters of approach and secondly sir to deal with the factual matters
right
what i propose not to do is to ask mrs to read her summary
right
c can i just be clear though er mr
if er mr or i wish to ask questions on the original proof or about what the witness is telling you
mrs first of all can i invite you to look at your appendix number five
er sir these are matters which arise out of the questions you last asked
mrs what the local authority excluding d thirty nine and d forty of course is a matter for them
can you assist us on the approach which you have adopted in terms not only of greenbelt function but of the need for a strategic reserve
yes
er the basis of the erm objection er
and erm justify long term development needs not just in total but by recognizing making a major contribution to total land use but also
erm that was the written basis of the objection
erm it's also clear from correspondence i had meetings with officers of both councils following those objections erm at which we talked specifically about the greenbelt functions of this
so both items were certainly er lodged
yes
both aspects were lodged
i can't say you know where the balance erm council authority
er and can we in fact see your views as to the strategic reserve set out fully on page two of that particular
yes
yes in that they're ex expanding
thank you
the second matter i wi wish to raise with you a arises out of mr 's appendix two and in particular paragraph twelve
right
could you just give us a moment to find that
of course yes
thank you
appendix two paragraph twelve
it's the inspector's letter of september nineteen ninety
yes right
thank you
we know from the UNK that you were present at that enquiry
i did
if we then look at paragraph five that's the first page of appendix two we see here the appeal site has a long planning history
it lies within an area designated as planning permission since nineteen sixty four
yes
i don't know whether it would be helpful sir if mrs could indicate on the plan recently handed in to you
yes
where that nineteen sixty four planning permission
right
lies
erm
that would be helpful
UNK perhaps if i the appeal site wedge with the erm intending to build a road through it
the nineteen sixty four application
er let me just say that UNK
haven't got the plan in what has just been pointed out to me is that the er smaller site that is the one with UNK on it which i'm sure is familiar to er anybody present that's just opposite skelton manor and court and the larger site was the land to the east of UNK incorporating this much larger pond w with what appears to be an island in it er running right up to the boundary of the conservation area i think
yes
yes
yes
now bearing those facts in mind can we look at what paragraph twelve tells us
several local objections state that the planning applications for the dwelling at the northern end of the site and the council implied that they would they would UNK applications which site
just UNK there for a moment can you point out to mr inspector where that er building was to be developed mrs
yes the erm a as i've just explained the appeal site on that occasion was the smaller UNK
yes
erm now including UNK
the council at before the enquiry and during the enquiry erm suggested that a better site for the development would be within erm the larger earlier site erm specifically at the UNK the northern corner or UNK corner where i erm where i've marked
er just be just below the track
yes
er is that it
yes
yes
yes
right in right in the top corner erm the UNK possible point away from the village
and paragraph twelve erm towards the middle erm you can see the sentence in paragraph twelve to my mind these sites which were in that top corner lie well beyond the present i'm so sorry
c before we just sorry interrupt
just so that we can get the erm that sentence in context
that was what was being put forward by the planning authority then in the next sentence we have most of the suggested sites are included in the conservation area in the village and are separated from the built up part of the village
that's sites in the plural
yes
again where were they
er along the northern boundary
er in the in the vicinity of the corner that i've marked with a star
a and then we have the sentence which you were just reading
can you read it out again
yes
to my mind these sites lie well beyond the present built up limits of skelton and land to the east north and west has a strongly rural character
er in i in the light of your understanding of where those particular sites the objection sites were how do you interpret that sentence
well th i i'm quite clear in my mind that the areas that the inspector was considering then were areas beyond the track to the north of the outside even the greenbelt boundary presently proposed by the two councils
i i'm not clear still
he says he mentions three directions east north and west
west would appear to suggest d thirty nine
i see
it's the usual problem whe when the site is not UNK with the points of the UNK
that's right sir
it's a problem everyone writing decision letters finds and erm it does seem to be a problem
well first can i can i say this
the erm a great deal of time at that enquiry was taken up with the alternative sites proposed by the council erm and their UNK in relation to the
and we were looking at how this top corner of the map related to the surrounding that those erm reference points east north and west do relate to the open land outside of that
thank you
thank you very much
mr please
mrs would you be so kind as to
yes
so that was indeed an location
it was suggested by the erm chairman of the then southern area planning committee
he wasn't giving evidence was he
he erm he wasn't giving evidence at the enquiry but erm it was at his suggestion that i was asked to meet with the chief planning officer prior to the to talk about alternative sites
and certainly mrs d thirty nine is west of that site
and the inspector did mention west didn't he
it's west of that site yes
it's a good a good long way west of the site which i've marked by a star
yes
what importance do you attach mrs to the observation of the district council in relation to their erm district development plan which has for many years been used for development control of the following text which you quote in your paragraph three point six
in the case of skelton
o one moment please
yes
paragraph three point six of mrs 's proof
in the case of skelton it has in the past ten years experienced significant residential development
it is not considered appropriate that skelton should expand any further and therefore it is included within the greenbelt
now forgetting for a moment that last sentence which we're not concerned with just at this stage would you agree with that conclusion of ryedale district council
it is it is it's a statement of fact that in the ten years UNK the time er when that comment was written which was in the er mid UNK mid eighties erm that had been the case that's absolutely true
erm whether and the district council as you say clearly considered it appropriate that it should not expand any further at that time
it's not a view that i particularly share but erm it was their view at the time
would you have shared that view with them at that time
that it is not considered appropriate that skelton should expand any further
i can't answer that because erm there's certainly nothing in the text of the plan to suggest why it was not considered appropriate erm and i don't know erm i can't instantly think what factors erm might have gone into that consideration
so i don't i don't know what my answer would have been
erm i it's a it's a very it's a very vague statement isn't it is not considered appropriate skelton should expand
er you deal with cases all round the york area
you would presumably have been aware that skelton had UNK a tremendous expansion on its south side
it it's certainly er yes it's certainly experienced
so let us look at the present day and to take this wording do you consider that it is now appropriate that skelton should expand any further
i don't think i can answer the question in that form
is it appropriate that it should expand
i think there is certainly capacity erm for skelton to expand or i wouldn't be sitting here supporting erm the people i represent
erm i think the two objection sites d thirty nine and d forty are suitable to a greater or lesser extent physically suitable for development
whether skelton needs to expand at the present moment is not for me to say
we're not saying as you well know from my representations we're not saying that these sites should be allocated for development now either in total or in part unless the inspector feels that there is a shortage of housing land that he needs to be looking for additional sites
what we're are saying is there are the sites they don't have the development constraints that i would to the extent erm that you believe erm they have and skelton and the two objection sites are very well located a whole range of service facilities and employment opportunities and development on those sites would fit UNK within local plan policy
but i return to the point i make here mr we're not saying that these sites should be allocated for development now unless the inspector
two very comprehensive answers
do you think that any other sites on the UNK of skelton would allow for the requirement however distant it may be that you UNK as well as or better than d thirty nine and d forty
no
and yet other sites round skelton might not have the same characteristics with regard to environmental functions in relation to the historic centre of skelton that these two have mightn't they
that's possibly true
erm UNK to areas of character isn't in itself a constraint to development
but in considering any possibility if development would you agree mrs that one must have regard to the UNK of one site versus another site in relation to damage which might be caused
well i refer you to the answer i've just given you
you're making an assumption that damage would be caused erm by the development of certain sites and that it wouldn't be caused by the development of other sites
i don't accept that damage is inevitable
would you be prepared to answer the question were it not related to skelton
and if i were to put it if you have an opportunity of two sites and the development of one is capable of causing damage to existing characteristics and the other is not would you go for the one which would not cause damage rather than the one which would or would you willy UNK for either
well o well of course er one would go for the site which would erm to follow your hypothetical question not cause damage
the other sites erm or other site on the UNK of skelton erm to which you drew my attention would have the potential if developed of causing a different sort of damage
any development has the potential to
i don't accept that is it necessary or even likely that it would that it would er the damage which could occur by developing skelton or expanding skelton erm to the east or to the south would be damage to different aspects
erm planning issues planning considerations
erm so we do not erm immediately
do you agree with the policy of the planning authorities that in general villages around york should not be expanded
that's a very sweeping statement
yes it is
er one has to exclude er for example UNK where tremendous development is proposed
but as a general statement it has been made by the authorities
do you agree with it
i don't i don't agree with the erm general proposition that erm the character of every village within six miles of york erm is an important element or component of the character of the city
i think that's far too sweeping a statement
but you know perfectly well that i support the new settlement strategy and therefore in consequence i do support erm general limitations on the growth of settlements and expansion of settlements within the greenbelt
that's not to say that i believe that the villages er some of the villages are incapable of
thank you i am pleased to hear of your support for the principle of settlements which no doubt you'll agree with me would tend to safeguard settlements within the greenbelt
that's the very reason the new settlements strategy was accepted by the county council after the county council's initial opposition to it and their initial erm policy in favour of the substantial expansion of villages close to york
indeed so mrs
now in your paragraph six point three you say it is not one of the functions of the york greenbelt to protect skelton
it is however a function of skelton to enhance the setting of york isn't it
i i'm afraid i don't understand the question
do you agree that the characteristics of skelton as we have considered them this morning make a contribution to the setting of the historic city of york
very slightly
s i won't go into any attempt to quantify it thank you
have you any view mrs as to the contribution which the road layout the layout of the lanes and the characteristics associated with those roads and lanes make to the medieval centre of skelton
do i have any have any view
view as to the nature of the contribution made by the road layout to the characteristics of the centre of skelton
the road network in the centre of the village erm is of historic origins
and the road network has dictated the pattern of development a around the roads and that in turn has helped to form the character of the village
so i don't distinguish between the buildings and the roads and say o one's important to the character and the other isn't
nevertheless you do say do you not that it is reasonable for this enquiry to consider access to the site to d thirty nine and d forty in general terms
in UNK indeed i do because if the if i say to the inspector that erm if he feels there is a need to identify additional areas for residential development near to york in the short term then i need to tell him that there are no overriding constraints to the development of these sites
i put it to you that any alteration of church lane at any point between the a nineteen and the centre of the village would be seriously detrimental to the existing character of that area
i don't agree with you
erm the point that you put to me i think two or three questions ago wa was related as i understood it to the UNK and the network of the lanes
erm i accept that part of the character UNK from the wide UNK because that's reflect reflecting their physical appearance
erm but in
their what
in large measure the character of the lanes erm or the importance of the lanes is in their pattern their UNK and the impact that has had on the distribution of buildings and spaces along them
and i don't see a limited widening of church lane to any access into either of these two sites were that to be required by the highway authority a as having any significant impact on the character of the village
erm so at least you agree that some widening of church lane at least as far as spring hill lane if not further would be necessary
no
nothing like as far as spring hill lane
erm i think at the at the very erm most it would be necessary to widen erm church lane as far as the western boundary of spring hill farm
and as i've said in my evidence erm we have had engineering drawings erm produced erm to demonstrate
you mean you'd bring that access in on that western boundary
yes
yes
it it's an o it's an option
yes ye yes i realize these are options
it's an option that would work
no i understand all that yes
i d i
erm i me that would have erm i believe very limited erm a very limited impact on the village
yes
and no impact at all on the central
mr has ve
very vigorously explained his view that er you can only inset for the purposes of e ten
wou would you go that far
if i think what i what i would like to say what i think is that e ten erm it's very difficult to make this point since it's an approved policy in an approved structure plan but i think e UNK got it wrong
there've been several attempts to get e ten right since nineteen eighty
mm
but they've still got it wrong
well i think that i think that's got to be right because e ten refers to where the need for development has been established a UNK a need for UNK been established
erm given that we're looking at a long term greenbelt proposal and a comparatively relatively short term southern ryedale local plan erm i think it's very difficult to for anybody to establish a need now i in the terms of implied under e ten which is going to perhaps erm not show itself erm for twenty or twenty five years in terms of o of land allocation la land requirement
erm and i just think th the wording of policy e ten is it doesn't square with er national guidance for erm which requires areas to be left out of the greenbelt to provide for long term development opportunities or development potential long term development
erm i've said previously in this enquiry that i don't agree with the county council's erm notes on e ten but really i think that
thank you
if anybody had any opportunity of getting e ten right it should be the department which the secretary of state to insert e ten because he is the highest authority in this
you're not asking me to and there therefore
merely to agree that the secretary of state is always right
right
er i i'm sure he is but may not
er sir i just have er one further point here
eight point one four point four
erm i'm much taken mrs er by your reference to there being lots of UNK and UNK where limited built development might go without causing harm to the character and setting of york
mrs finally is this one of your UNK and UNK
no
thank you
sorry
i'll let you finish
that comment was made specifically in relation to the edge of the urban area of the city a as i've
mr
i've no sir
oh yes right
er you say in your proof er mrs that the site comprises two distinct parcels of land
er are you referring there to the character of the land
yes
erm
there appears
yes
all of those
yes
and from the land beyond
er site UNK simply UNK
yes
land
yes
yes
more and more
yes
right
thank you
erm as you travel up and down the a nineteen coming from the south er i er skelton appears very well developed
yes
quite close to the road
coming from the north er the appearance of the village is rather different i think because it is UNK to an extent by the existing UNK
that that's right
but the
yes
er you made the point erm earlier that the erm i think you said the objection site is higher than the
yes
site forty is higher than the road which is which is perfectly true
yes
but in fact parts of the village are higher than the road and
yes of course
it's always possible to see
yes of course yes
no i'm just trying to understand the implications of what might happen supposing at some stage this land were developed
right
so the site stands above the level of the road and
yes
see whatever is on the site
this is correct
yes
i thi i think mrs mentioned the erm the density of the existing UNK along the a nineteen
yes
UNK
yes
erm it's particularly dense as well along
yes
the northern boundary of d forty
yes
erm
mm
but the corner as you travel along the a nineteen the corner the UNK corner of d forty
yes
and is very heavily
yes
yes
and
obviously we'll be having a look at
and included within the site within the joint site is the belt of trees included UNK trees
yes
and also have a
yes
those UNK trees that actually occur on the boundary between d thirty nine and d forty
that's right yes
it but it's not just a row of UNK trees it's quite a wide er mix
yes i see yes
yes
right
yes i'm not sure that i i'm going to at some stage
by a black line
oh yeah
er yes sorry
sorry yes
right thank you very much
no more questions mrs thank you
i have only one point i would like to raise mrs and this is whether or not er you are in a position to give me any comments er in relation to the er UNK of great UNK in this pond
or is the only evidence before me that which er was given by mr
erm i did this morning but i've handed it back to the district council access to their UNK report which was referred to a couple of days ago
erm i could perhaps get
if there's anything more which is going to UNK er UNK er assist me in understanding it er i w would certainly find that helpful
i in particular bearing in mind the point that er mr i is making that er UNK seem to be as it were very UNK in where they er go bearing in mind the existence of at least three other ponds in skelton i would like to know whe how er why it is or whether it is that UNK are only found in this pond and whether or not er the survey has shown anything in either of er in any of the other ponds
but that is perhaps a matter which is best looked at er over lunch
can i before i adjourn the enquiry er for lunch can i just raise one other matter which i would be grateful er for
i will raise it after consideration of er the skelton issue er because it doesn't concern this in any way but er i would like those concerned to consider the point
this concerns the question of written representations er which i will be taking into account
as i'm sure er you are aware many objections are being considered solely on written representation grounds
er i asked before the enquiry at the pre enquiry meeting that i should have such er any additional representations before the start of the enquiry
inevitably er that has not been entirely UNK to and indeed to some extent er i can hardly be surprised as events move on during the course of the enquiry
however it had been my intention and still will be my intention unless i am persuaded very strongly to the contrary that when i close the enquiry which i hope will be next wednesday i will have in my hands all of the representations that is to say both any additional re representations by objectors and the UNK replies before i close the enquiry
the effect of that would be that i would receive no further written representations after that time
if either council receive anything additional it will be a matter for them to take them into account along with my report
my report will not take er th these into account
now bearing in mind the very short space of time between now and the close of the enquiry i want to be sure that as far as objectors and the council are concerned that this is a course of action which is both acceptable and practical as far as they are concerned
i don't want you to give me your answers now i am as it were giving you the opportunity now over lunch to consider this matter
it concerns you i think mrs i believe you have a number of sites where you are acting for objectors where you wish to make er additional rep representations
if the course of action that i am suggesting and UNK which is indeed consistent with the course of action i have been suggesting throughout this enquiry is to work then i need i would suggest tomorrow is probably the absolute latest for me to get anything from you and to give the councils any opportunity whatsoever to make any reply to them
certainly it would be most unsatisfactory if i was to get your comments on wednesday so that the councils couldn't reply to them
that would plainly simply not work
i think i've suggested the problem now and now i'm going to leave the parties to think about would be a need for expansion involves built UNK think i'll under the circumstances i'll give you er the normal time and i will adjourn now until two fifteen to have a chance to think about that
the UNK adjourned until two fifteen
it is now two fifteen i propose to continue
er sir you raised a point about erm ponds a bit earlier and i have obtained some
that's right yes
information
that's right
er thanks to mrs er during the er UNK
er would you wish to hear that information
good idea mr
i was expecting that mrs was going to tell us about it
you have the information then
er you you're thinking about ponds are you mr n rather than UNK are you
er i think that er UNK and ponds er in our present consideration go together sir
right yes
yes
fine thank you
and we must remember that we are not talking about any UNK we're talking about very special UNK
yes
the great UNK
yes
a protected species
yes
yes
and a moment ago i had in front of me the relevant paper
it's escaped me
the erm the UNK of it sir is that english nature er carried out er last year a survey of ponds in this area though we are not certain that they were able UNK to the UNK er created by the attitudes of certain UNK er to erm investigate every pond in the area
i can however say that their conclusion with regard to the two other ponds at skelton which are mentioned in ryedale policy e n v eleven that is to say the ponds near UNK and er that near the UNK development are apparently not found erm suitable er by the great UNK and are UNK largely by UNK
erm i have already referred sir to the investigations which are proceeding with regard to the ability to erm as it were encourage er this er UNK to go to other ponds and i would again call your attention to the state of the knowledge we have at the present time which is that is not possible
mr does mrs have anything to add
well i if we i think mrs can er can assist
could i just
right
recall her
yes certainly yes
it's alright you can sit there mrs thank you
i knew of the existence of this of this report went to the enquiry on this tuesday by mistake but i two
you've read it
you've read it
two minutes ago
right
erm and that's why i thought i'd be more familiar with it
well i didn't know i'd got it
well er no it's all right we we've got it here now so let's see what it has to say about it mrs
erm map one is a map of pond ponds UNK in connection with the production of this report
erm i don't know whether i haven't the erm
er just tell us what it says please
er i otherwise
we're gonna have to go through the exercise you've been through of identifying the right ponds
it shows one two three four five six ponds er UNK er in the area of skelton
erm two of the erm and it then in a table identifies
page twenty six
yes page twenty six
it lists two ponds erm in skelton with erm a total estimated UNK population of eighty
which two ponds are they
erm one at the coach house and one at church view
er the coach house one the one which we're talking about
yes
yes
yes
and the other one sorry was church view
church view
that that's somewhat towards the centre of the village
we
the report also erm interestingly erm said that two thirds of the ponds in the parish of skelton were visited
erm that's thirty one ponds
virtually all of the rest remain UNK due to lack of permission
so erm if thirty one is two thirds another fifteen or so ponds
there are some more ponds in erm
yes that's fine
in skelton
er not all of them still existed erm and three of the ponds eleven o of the eleven ponds erm referred to in the erm three of them were in gardens
these are ponds which contain UNK you say
the three ponds
two of the garden ponds great UNK
and then there's a third pond where the report notes that close access to UNK farm was extremely difficult due to
so erm yes there are ponds in skelton and erm two of them are
yes fine thank you
yes thanks very much for that information
yes mr
sir i have found the note
yes
there is just one further small item of information relating to the findings of english nature
that i understand is that the lake at skelton hall is too deep to be found suitable by the great UNK
right thank you very much
the only other question perhaps o on that one
er mrs does the pond within d thirty nine lie within er land owned by one of your various clients
ye yes it does and i think i made this point in erm in my evidence that it lies at the extreme erm UNK corner of the paddock erm and if this is making an assumption
on the assumption that UNK spread out equally in all directions from the pond erm part of their territory would be
yes
the question i have is quite a simple one and that is i would like to actually see this pond slightly closer quarters than i've been able to
i've been round the whole UNK of d thirty nine er other than the southern side
er is it possible for me to get closer
yes
i so i just go in to the paddock
just go into the paddock yes
wh where is the entrance to
that is that the entrance near the coach house or
yes
ah
thank you
swimming
we've been issued with UNK i should say
investigations so it will be quite thorough
i can't i can't speak for th for the for the temper of the horses
oh i see oh well in that case w we will view it
from the coach house end i think
it s it sounds safer
thank you
thank you very much
right i think we move on then please
mr do you
yes sir
excuse me very briefly
thank you
sir it's our submission and the evidence of what you have heard and what you will see that the two sites proposed to be excluded from the greenbelt are UNK part of the village and distinct from the land the open agricultural land to the north and are visually a part of the village UNK to the open countryside to the north
put another way sir we say this
that when one approaches the village in particular along the a nineteen which is the only public approach from the north the objection sites read as part of the village and not part of the countryside
and there is a firm boundary between the objection sites and the countryside in particular the farm track to the north of d thirty nine
it follows sir in our submission that neither of these sites performs a greenbelt function and therefore fall to be excluded from the greenbelt
to that extent sir the submissions which we make are i anticipate common with those which will be made by both of the promoting authorities
sir if you do come to the view however that one or both of these sites may have some as it were residual greenbelt functions then we ask you to bear in mind the matters raised in particular mrs 's appendix nine about the need in the longer term that is beyond two thousand and six in particular for a strategic reserve
and that is a matter sir which we invite you to weigh if but only if you come to the conclusion that these sites may have some greenbelt function
sir to that extent er my case is additional to that of the promoting
sir the other matters which have been raised by mr are essentially issues of development control UNK to the issues of greenbelt function
they sir will be considered or may be considered by the authority but if they are sir it will be in the context of concrete proposals and in the context of a forum which is appropriate to their discussion
and sir a local plan enquiry particularly where there is no specific allocation made is not an appropriate forum to apply development control policies to a wholly UNK proposal
sir the mistake which UNK that part of mr 's submission is a very common one and it is the assumption that greenbelt is as it were the residual category to prevent development which one might for non greenbelt reasons not wish to see
for all those reasons sir we invite you to report that these two fields should not remain in the greenbelt
sir those are my submissions
may i add er a UNK in the true sense of the word
sir this is the last day as i understand it of the greenbelt enquiry
y er the last day at which the county will be formally represented yes
er sir to that extent it is the last day of the enquiry
it certainly is sir the last day on which i shall be appearing at either of these enquiries
sir may i in particular you sir thank you for the UNK good humour with which you have conducted this enquiry
a and also sir the courtesy which you have always shown to
and i can also say sir i think without fear of contradiction that of the hundreds of enquiries that i have done this is the only enquiry sir which will have la left a lasting impression
thank you mr
thank you mr
mr please
sir i don't propose to add anything
you you've heard that er the case between ourselves and er my learned friend on the left mr are identical save in the one additional matter which he noted and it's and i adopt his closing submission
thank you very much
mr please
i've nothing further to add thank you very much
thank you very much
mr then please
sir as has been known in other cases before you there have been many
but what remains is the most important aspect of the whole namely your visit to skelton
because it is on that occasion that you will already have and will on your final visit have made up your mind as to the nature of the northern part of the village of skelton the nature of the land immediately surrounding it whether it be a paddock or a small field whether it be more associated in the minds of some with the open country or in the minds of others with the village
an area which is at present not built on which is open which has had greenbelt protection since nineteen eighty which it is now proposed should no longer have it
which it is recognized will thereby lose the benefit of the initial negative presumption unique in planning
whereby the task of the local planning authority and the onus is on them without the initial negative presumption the task before the local planning authority in refusing permission is made that much more difficult
and why should this task be laid on them
two reasons have been suggested to you sir
went so far as to almost in writing as part of the reasoning for the proposed change by ryedale
and that is a UNK strategic reserve
no mention in the greater york study no mention in any plan before us of what this reserve might be required for or where it might be located
only here has
let's call it that
sir i invite you attach no importance at all to that ridiculous concept in relation to this highly important piece of land
and sir the other strand which we've heard a good deal about has been the nature of the UNK screen which occurs between d thirty nine and d forty on the one hand and land to the north of it on the other
sir it would be a sad day if we determined matters of er greenbelt boundaries on the basis of relative screening
hedges and trees are a normal part of the countryside
i need say no more
there is no dispute that boundary is capable of being a suitable greenbelt boundary
but i believe from the written evidence that there is equally no dispute that the boundary which has existed for ten years the tight boundary is also capable of being a suitable greenbelt boundary if indeed there is to be an inset
when i say existed for ten years er i did make a slight mistake in that for ten years erm the village
however the reference has been made to the characteristics of that boundary and although the authorities would prefer the characteristics of the one which they now propose they do not say that the characteristics of the tight boundary are ones which are unacceptable
and therefore we come back to the nature of the land in relation to the contribution it makes to the character of skelton
and to the consideration which you have had in other cases regarding the character of villages and the acceptance that they preserve the special character of historic york
there must be no doubt as to that conclusion
very recently we have regard to the UNK
reference has been made to the
sir the pond in d thirty nine has been shown to be a breeding place for the great UNK but it is also known that it UNK to other ponds several others but does not necessarily breed there but chooses at skelton
sir i believe that you should not UNK the view of the inspector relating to the planning application within the grounds of skelton hall when he made reference to land west of the site concerned
i have no doubt myself that in the expansion of land to the west er d thirty nine and possibly d forty would and i think that his comment that development should not extend so far north is relevant
if indeed therefore this land performs a significant function with regard to the character of skelton one should have regard to what the effect on that character would be if development were development of any kind
and i have already given you my opinion
it would be UNK
mention has been made as to the UNK of an allocation for housing and as to the UNK of this forum for consideration of the effect which would take place of development with or without the existing allocation
sir i see no difference
one can make one's assumptions about the effect of development on a particular piece of land on the basis of the best information available to one at one time
one does not necessarily need an outline or a full planning application in order to do so
i'm quite clear that i do not need either an outline or a planning application in order to arrive at my conclusion that the effect of any development on these sites would be UNK to the historic character of skelton
sir i commend to you the expert evidence relating to the historic character and i hope sir when you visit this site although it may look very different at this moment from the way it would have done had you been able to visit it after the originally scheduled date of this enquiry when the UNK were out
i did visit it that day
i'm so pleased
i'm so pleased
i believe that in all seasons of the year one would find that it had a most delightful character
thank you very much mr
well that concludes consideration of the skelton topics
i would like to turn before UNK the enquiry today to the question of the treatment of the remaining written representations
mr
erm sir yes
i mean we certainly have views on this er and er you have er encouraged us to express them
sir er you UNK that er if there are to be further written representations you'd be looking to directing a UNK date and you UNK at i think tomorrow as being one possibility sir so that you could leave this enquiry on wednesday with all the papers you need and receive nothing more by way of written representation evidence or any other documentation whatsoever
i put the suggestion
sir we certainly would welcome a UNK date tomorrow
we're not sure whether any further written representation or representations or evidence of any kind are going to arrive which might concern us but we can't discount that possibility
but sir we do have some doubts as to whether we would be able to respond to any that should arrive at let us say five o'clock tomorrow afternoon by let us say close of play on wednesday
sir that provides a very tight timetable and up to now the ordinary timetable has been we had two weeks to respond to objections
sir we would er my suggestion would be that if tomorrow were the UNK date that we be given the ordinary two weeks in which to respond
and what we would do in those circumstances sir is if the late objections er the objections or representations that were to arrive er up to let us say five o'clock tomorrow we would er deal with and then send on to you with copies to the UNK of course
th there's there are two other points i i'd like to raise
that's my suggestion i in that case
sir should any additional representations be sent directly to you after the close of the enquiry i for one don't know whether this would happen or not but what are the administrative arrangements for dealing with that
er you mean er from objectors
from objectors
well they will not
they er they should not be received by me
any which are sent to er which of course would be the only way in which i could be contacted
yes
er would be returned to the appropriate council
er
i would receive nothing
then they would be returned to us sir and then if appropriate they would be dealt with in the context er of your report and the of the report
it would be a matter for the council concerned to decide in er itself what it wanted to do with them
i'm very grateful for that information sir
thank you
mr
yes sir
all i can say is this
we would urge you very strongly to er put a deadline er on receipt of er further objections by tomorrow sir but some of these UNK have been missing all of the discussion and they are literally months past their original UNK date
if any are received erm by the UNK date then it has to be my submission that we have to have a reasonable time to respond
you don't need reminding sir that er ryedale tuesday and wednesday and wednesday is a very busy last day
my officers just cannot deal with these late UNK in days
erm sir what i can tell you is this
in relation to every matter in respect of which there is an outstanding written we have just about now prepared a general proof
it's not a UNK although one tries to anticipate what objectors will say
and you will have all of those documents before you leave on wednesday
but i cannot and i don't think you'd be right to expect my officers to prepare detailed UNK
goodness knows what will be in these late UNK they appear to be taking months to prepare
er we have to have a reasonable time to respond
two weeks would seem reasonable
now i don't know of course who else may be er wishing to comment
it may well as far as i know it's it is only mrs er who has said i i'm sorry to er to say this mrs you are the only person who has said that you wish to produce additional representations
it could be others are keeping quiet about this i don't know
they may they're likely to miss the date altogether
er what is the situation as far as you are concerned
yes erm they're not they're not add additional representations they're not additional to anything that i've said we've heard during the enquiry
er they are outstanding matters which are to be dealt with
erm i hear exactly what mr says
erm in my experience it's quite normal for erm a period after the close of the enquiry to be erm given to erm the planning authority or authorities to on other matters which are outstanding at the close of the enquiry whether it's two weeks whether it's whether it's very common it's reasonable that the authority should have that opportunity to
erm for my own part i don't know
er i would certainly find it very difficult to get my remaining written submissions to erm by five o'clock tomorrow
what you are suggesting then is that the time should be extended from five o'clock friday to five o'clock monday er but that er there should be a period of two weeks after that er to for whichever council or councils are going to respond for them to make
i UNK making a general point
i'm not necessarily in connection with anything i might it's very common practice in my experience which seems to me very reasonable
erm again in my experience the a any additional material usually runs from the close of the enquiry and i'm well aware of the turning up at the end of the enquiry
can i put to you mrs my problems as an inspector on this and perhaps then you'll understand you know why it is that i am trying to get this er all written material before the end of the enquiry
and that is quite simply that i of course need to read all of these documents
that's is obvious
but having read them it is first of all possible that i may have some queries on them
it is possible that there may be for instance some appalling UNK er has UNK in to something so that something makes a nonsense
i am not in a position to query that once i adjourn the enquiry
er something else may be a query because i don't understand the reasoning that is put forward
this can apply either to objectors or to the council
er i it is something which can always happen
the other possibility er is that having read it the site visit that i will have made in any event either already or at some time during the latter part of next week i may discover there is something which one of the parties points out which i haven't looked at because i didn't realize that it was relevant
and this causes me difficulties in that i have to either imagine what it was or come back again to see whatever the er item in question is
and you'll appreciate in all of these cases there are administrative er difficulties involved
yes i do indeed and this has been a long enquiry
but it isn't the longest enquiry in this part of the world in living memory
erm yes it it's
i have myself been involved in a considerably longer local planning enquiry mrs and er i certainly wish to learn from experiences there and elsewhere where problems over late documents have occurred
er i agree it i it is something that er is hard to avoid
i'm anxious to avoid it if i can
it seems to me perhaps under the circumstances the UNK the best that i can do is to set off er up a er UNK date for objectors of the end of this coming monday
that at the very least gives me the opportunity er to at very least glance through i don't know how long they're going to be of course but at very least glance through them to see what i need to see to see if there's any which is self evidently requiring further comment or further site visit and er i can then give the councils a further two weeks in which to respond to that
and er other than those responses er other than whatever comes in er next UNK by next monday i will not consider
i will simply arrange for that to be sent to the councils for them to take into account alongside but not part of my report
w would you be content with that
yes i a i accept that i fully accept that anything which is received from anybody after the responses after the end of the enquiry
er i have your notice mr er agreed
it seems to me that nothing really turns on the difference
er if i'm going to give two weeks after anyway for the councils i don't really think it makes a great deal of difference whether it be friday er afternoon or monday afternoon
er are y are you content with that
yes sir i wouldn't seek to UNK you from that sir
thank you
mr
are you also happy with that arrangement
happy might be the wrong word but i
er no
know when i'm beaten sir
i'm grateful
well tha that deals with er that point
now this is not the end of the enquiry
i still have at least two days i hope it will be only two days longer next week before the enquiry as a whole is closed
it is however the final formal appearance of the team who have been representing north yorkshire county council and i wouldn't want this opportunity to slip without thanking them all mr mrs and all of the others in their team who have spoken on behalf of the council
you have thank you have helped mr and myself very considerably er in this enquiry
you have been patient and you have worked hard and i fear on many occasions late into the night i'm sure you have proved UNK and er you have been good UNK
may i thank you very much for your assistance to us both during the course of this enquiry
i would also like to thank you mr er for your attendance at various times and mrs likewise as neither of you again will be returning
the enquiry
er sir before you do close the enquiry today sir while we're in the UNK mode
well i don't
want to go through er there is no need
no i there are two things that i would like to say on behalf of the county council
er one is er on behalf of the county council i would like to thank the two programme officers ian and
they have been extremely efficient and effective in carrying out their UNK tasks and they've been of enormous assistance in ensuring the smooth running of this enquiry and indeed it has run UNK
and sir both of you both you sir mr and you sir mr er i would like to thank you for the way in the way you have conducted this enquiry
you've extended courtesy patience and fair UNK to all so that you've been a tribute to the enquiry process if i may say so
it's enabled us all to work and to conduct our cases in as an UNK atmosphere as the UNK system allows and we are grateful for that
we look forward to reading your report in due course
thank you mr
i will be adding my comments as far as the programme officers are concerned at the close of the enquiry
the enquiry itself is now adjourned until tuesday the twenty seventh of this month at ten o'clock
thank you
excellent
right
presents
erm presents
present one is for derek
erm
UNK
you have to fill in the rest of that and give it back to me
erm
erm sure no problem
i've no idea whether you made a note of your UNK to leeds and back but please make something up
no but i know how many miles i know how many miles it is to leeds and back
right
that's not a problem
well please make something up and fill it in
erm and er i'll take that away
okay
with me today
okay i shall fill
erm
that in now
and then you'll see it again when i finally pay you
but not before
and i
right
won't be paying you until i've got some money
well
i'm afraid
leeds is well it's actually not leeds it's UNK and then it's leeds and it's back
erm
i don't know
that's twenty five
fifty
call it fifty miles
whatever
write down some appropriate UNK and that's super
erm my next UNK is sort of more of the same actually
i've got some expenses claim forms cos i thought it would be a good idea to be able to claim expenses
yep
on a form
you know
well whatever
erm we nearly knocked over simon on our way here
i was driving along t you know t telling david that all the time that people are on the roads practising how to drive and becoming better drivers there are people like that UNK there crossing the UNK oh it's simon
oops
excellent
i'll tell him about that later
i should have just put my foot down and knocked him over
UNK served him right for being such a UNK out UNK
yes
but erm there you go
do you want to grab a couple of those
okay
and then those are for the derek and clare UNK
right
erm
thank you
erm new version of the spoken cor corpus consent form that has a little space for tape numbers
it's not desperately important but
what's a reasonable amount to claim per mile by the way
christ knows
i've got to phone the inland revenue tomorrow and ask them what the maximum
yeah
that they'll allow us to claim
they have set amounts
oh
right
what's what er c c's your car
er thirteen hundred
thirteen hundred
UNK ho
cos it i gather there's sort of two or
yes
three bands
there must be
makes sense
okay
so actually could you make a note on there somewhere erm sort of underneath the at per mile or something that's it's er
it's very exciting i can fill one of these in
excellent
UNK
i hope you have the receipt
i do have the receipt yes
otherwise as it says
on the top
remember to attach all receipts and note all UNK
this claim will not be paid in the absence of the relevant documentation
that do
so there
yes
brilliant
UNK out v w UNK
i don't think they care how UNK out it is actually
erm david have some of those
it's not UNK out
it's lovely
it's done one thousand miles
you guys can have those
thank you
right
thank you
ooh excellent
some real paper
erm and then we can have one of these each
ooh
which are erm this is actually me being bored this afternoon
it might be an idea to just make a note of
UNK
what the counties are that we're covering
yeah
and about how many words we want from each one
it basically winds down to about ninety thousand words from each county
erm
mm
but i haven't because they haven't broken down scotland northern ireland and wales into separate counties
yeah
mhm
erm if you add all that up it comes to about three million words
great
three million
yeah
yeah
okay
which is probably the most realistic estimate of what we're collecting
okay
erm although we may be collecting more than that and we may be collecting less than that
i think three million is a fairly reasonable amount
mm
to assume
erm
right
don't want to be sort of too enthusiastic about the number of words just in case it turns out that they can't
oh erm not tyneside or northumberland except for businesses
yeah
ah
right
that's because UNK erm
yeah
has collected in those areas fairly extensively
right
er what you had down
and is going to carry on collecting in those areas
what you had down on the previous one was er schools and UNK schools businesses and something else i think that she'd collected
no
from
she she's collected
certainly schools and
from schools erm the university
right
erm i mean sh she ended up her description of
mm
what she'd collected by saying that she hasn't really gone to any
it's just that
businesses so
er
i was thinking of asking UNK if she could record something from the model car club and
yeah
their club meetings
oh that'd be okay i think
is that UNK
yes
erm she's UNK already asked her dad but
right
but they don't have meetings
they meetings take
place during the evening er as very sort of at the
right
okay
it wouldn't work
and we've
right
missed the a g m
okay
it was earlier this year
fair enough
erm anyway i mean that's just a guideline really
erm i'm going to or i've started every time a recording comes in making a note of where it's from and what type of recording it is
yeah
and once i've got
okay
i've got the word count from each one i'll be able to sort of UNK up and tell you when to stop collecting from that area
well we're gonna have north yorkshire UNK up pretty soon
we are
erm which is good
mm
erm
then we can start with the rest of yorkshire
i l i gave eddie a load of the UNK
excellent
and told him to go away with it and think about what he could do and er mentioned money to him and he liked the idea
erm
yes
eddie has a er a very large bank balance but unfortunately it's not his money
not his
erm
yes and it's guaranteed by his parents isn't it
mhm
yeah
so er eddie has a vested interest in getting some money from somewhere
yes
erm
candidate
the map that's in the back of what they gave us looks as though it might blown up
i've given up on that idea actually
erm i think writing it UNK probably just as reasonable
oh no
i mean it doesn't actually
oh
need to be very big we just need some coloured pins
oh my UNK gone UNK
bugger
here borrow that
i want my pen
there it is i've found it
okay
erm
no UNK some people is there
well i no i thought i'd better find it cos otherwise i'd walk off without it and then you'd get my pen and i
bought this as a company pen
oh right
i've got a receipt and everything
this is a company UNK
it's true
well we'd return it to the company then wouldn't we
mm
it just might be a bit short of ink when we do
yes
well the ink belongs to the company too
well we'll use it on company business
erm where were we
i've completely lost track now and it's all
right
your fault
i'm sorry
so you've given a breakdown of th roughly how much
yes
word count we need from each area
yeah
i mean it it's
which is very helpful
it goes further south than i thought it did
yeah
erm the
er cos i wouldn't have in i when i was making the analysis i w wasn't including UNK and UNK and i wasn't
mm
including UNK
well what they've done basically is they've drawn erm this list contains all the counties bar erm the sort of tyneside area
mm
in their UNK regions erm north
right
and midland
mm
yeah
and the midland actually goes down to sort of the top of erm UNK
oh right
and then slightly south
right
and west of there
right
okay
down to the south the south tip of wales pretty much
i mean it's two thirds of the country
yeah
UNK
it's not two thirds of the population but it's two thirds of the
richard
UNK in UNK
yes
UNK
isn't sam in UNK
er sam is in UNK yes
yes
i'm going to get an address for sam anyway cos i want to get in touch with him
yes
about god
yes
is the captain still there or is he somewhere else
the captain is in coventry
right
er
i have to ask now that you've said that
it's a i it's a game design project
okay
it stands for UNK own design
fine
it's creating a game background in six days
six days
yes
okay
what do you do on the seventh day
rest
rest
not game UNK
no
no
no
it was suggested that everybody relax a lot
after staying awake for a hundred and forty four hours
yeah
in whatever way they felt appropriate
yes
and i'm not going to expand on that cos the UNK running
good
good
actually erm just to UNK in t here
who was it
UNK i think was saying yesterday that it would be a good idea to get at least one tape of some erm UNK people
right
because people use
language differently when they're
mm
under the UNK
UNK
indeed
it it's very true
well we know who to talk to don't we
yes
we'll get you a
what
a tape of somebody under the UNK
that's the one yes
after having hear his UNK on the wonders of UNK brain chips and the UNK landscape just above the ceiling border in thirty road i think he would probably be quite a good candidate
you'll ask him then
yes
yeah
i
right
i had other people in mind as well actually
but er
well i mean i was thinking you know er it's probably a good idea for erm well i've heard it proposed by people who do these things
that it's a good idea for when people are intending to get UNK in a heavy way to have a baby UNK so there's no reason why the baby UNK couldn't sit there with a tape recorder
it's true
yes
nobody else in the room is going to stop them
yeah
but the erm the best thing would then be for the when the these people came round again to listen to the tape
and have power of UNK over it
as always
oh yes
yeah i think they'd probably have to listen
ah
yes it's a point
to what they've said because
point they can't be under the UNK when they sign the consent form or
mm
yeah
erm
no you are not captain james t kirk of the UNK enterprise
does he do that too
i don't think he does but i can think of people who would
erm well i mean that would be erm
yeah
the other thing my father said when i was
interesting for want of a
speaking to him was that erm the place he where he's recording in scotland erm tends to have an unusual vocabulary
yeah
occasionally swear words are UNK with functional words like it's and mine but i it tends to be very heavily orientated towards the less nice side of the language up there
that's alright
so i said to him it was fine
yeah
because you know the kind of material we're recording bad language isn't gonna get an appropriate representation and he's not to worry about it on that
yeah
account
but i mean that's entirely reasonable
mm
mm
erm as long as we don't mind UNK them and i for one don't
no
i mean i have met people who really objected strongly to UNK
erm
it wouldn't worry me
but i don't
well yeah
well we're all young enough not to be bothered by it
yes
i mean it's the obviously it's the
that's true
older generation that were brought up in under different UNK
mm
UNK or whatever that would object to it
and since i swear like a UNK anyway
it would be UNK to object really
erm
well i've sort of got a note to say who did what this week so i could tell you what i've done this week and then you could tell me what you've done this week
that would be good
then everybody will know
yeah
erm i've got lots of people collecting tapes on my behalf
the careers service came up with two tapes which was nice
mike came up with a tape which was nice
