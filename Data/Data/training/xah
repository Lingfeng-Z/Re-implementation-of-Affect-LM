erm he claims the battery ran out before he got to his presentation on the course but i don't necessarily believe him
the battery was flat but i don't think it was a tape and half flat
i think it was
this has been switched on all afternoon and left flat
erm
mm
but
my dad in nottinghamshire has nottinghamshire fairly UNK up
which is nice
that's good
that's great
erm he's wandering around collecting
quite happily and enjoying himself thoroughly and not going to school which i think are three excellent things
erm and my father in common law in liverpool is also running around UNK recording but he's getting a limited variety of recordings mainly educational
erm have you made contact with your human in liverpool
i haven't
i'm hoping he will ring me this afternoon
i this evening
i've left another phone message for him
right
so it's very much a case whether he actually gets in contact with me
good oh
right
erm
according to the last reference i looked up erm merseyside erm is about as big this is an old reference
mm
but erm a tenth of that no sorry three tenths of that is on the UNK
mm
which erm
so that means we need thirty thousand words from the UNK
my parents live in the UNK
and they're taking a tape away on saturday
a machine away on saturday
right
excellent
do you want more tapes for them to take away
i've got ten
i've haven't used any of them
right
erm i mean i can i actually i haven't got all that many left which i think is
sorry
wonderful
okay
er but i mean tell them if they need to buy anything to get the receipts
yeah
then you can claim
right
okay
for it
but i i've got to in fact i'll make myself a note here and now i've got to talk to and i'll get them to send some more tapes
right
we can never have too many
no
ho
erm
well we could but if we get too many we can go into business selling them or something
well i think we have to give them back actually
they've got british national corpus written on them
yeah
we should probably give them back when we've finished with them
if you do end up with er an extra box of ten or something erm could you label them up for me
yeah
no problem
it's no problem
erm
and start the sequence as well
i decided it was a good idea to write things down rather than depending on the tape because erm i'm not actually going to get round to UNK the tape quickly enough to use it as minutes
mm
erm yes well i've got lots of people recording everywhere which is nice
fine
great
erm david i wrote to margaret at the employment training unit
right
so i hope to hear from her this week
okay
still nothing from the conference office
but i'm not gonna worry about that until halfway through the week and then i'll write to them
do you have an address for them
er it'll be er university of york conference office er UNK hall
right
y york UNK york
university road
y o one five d
yeah
er
erm i know all that actually so
yes
is there a human
no
not that i know about
you don't know a name
no
they're all UNK
i went in
i went in and spoke to one of the secretaries who said she would er she would do it and send us material
right
okey doke
erm
there wasn't a contact no
okay
erm
this week in fact tomorrow i'm going to UNK out an unbelievable amount of money and buy a transcription machine
this transcription machine is going to be lent to be derek and clare who can argue about who has it where and when
erm it'll come with a set of UNK and a little UNK for er
mhm
turning the output into UNK because at the moment it's stereo and it'll only come through one UNK
erm cos most of the
oh
actually most these tapes are recorded in stereo aren't they
yes
yes
that's okay then
erm i most of the tapes that i've had in the past have been recorded UNK erm and i've needed a little UNK to turn the erm output into UNK as well cos it's awfully off putting spending seven and a half hours with the stuff coming in through one ear only
UNK deprivation
UNK being the technical term for this is it
yes and i've no idea how to spell it actually
i'm gonna have real trouble with that
erm you can UNK this one
d double o
d double o
d double o
c k e y
yeah
you sure
how do you spell UNK then
d o b e r y
UNK
i'm not i'm not erm i don't know
i think it's
no i wouldn't agree with that
it's b r e y
but certainly erm or no
UNK is d double o is it
yes
d double o h i c
good oh
k e y
okay
i've come across that one before
you sure it wasn't me that wrote it
i'll tell you what sin since i'll be going along to boston UNK we'll check in the dictionary
they've got in on the shelves there
i think we need UNK for these meetings
at some point it'll be at the university
the oxford english
but it won't be arriving there until they get this well they have the c d UNK they just haven't got it up and running
erm well they haven't got it UNK yet but they have the c d UNK players there already
yeah
but they ha i went
up and talked to the guy sitting in front of them and he said yes we've got it but we haven't got it on those yet
so they have the c d UNK they just haven't managed to yet
or something
right
do i take that to mean there's gonna be a online dictionary
yeah
dictionary
there'll be an online computer based dictionary
how will you be able to get at it
through an ordinary UNK account
no
no
no
you've got to go
into the library and go up and sit at the c d UNK terminal
right
i don't think you need a UNK for it
erm
you don't
ah
and er
so a bit li it will be a bit like the
and you don't need a ticket to get into the library
no you don't
i've got a ticket anyway
i've got a graduate
ah
thing
it would be a bit like the UNK erm index facility
mm
interesting
so
i hope it'll crash less often than the index
i doubt it
er
erm
right
that'll be useful resource actually
so
yes
erm
derek and i will organize ourselves about the transcription machine and
mm
okay
fine
that's excellent
erm i'll also be buying erm your keyboard some tapes and a couple of UNK
er keyboard five
not tapes
tapes
disks
five disks and one UNK
yes please
and a UNK
yeah
keyboard five disks and one UNK
i already made a note of that actually but
yeah
five disks
one UNK
okay
i checked and it is forty nine ninety five
brilliant
for the keyboard
so i reckon i reckon the total of that will be just over sixty quid
yeah
should be
should be
and i'll check about discounts
right
and possibly buy some stuff myself if that's what necessary to get it over a discount price
i also need some disks
i've done various things on my computer today and i can successfully make UNK files
good
UNK reasonable sized UNK files
good
so i reckon i could d do an entire transcription on UNK t
right
convert the whole thing into an UNK and just pass you the disk
yeah
if you find yourself with a file that's big enough to UNK but too big to turn into an UNK file cos it does use a lot of
yeah
its processing to turn make a file into an UNK file don't worry just give me the original
okay
erm because i've got erm a seven hundred and twenty
yeah
k drive
so it should be able to sort it out
as well as the two hundred and seventy two k stupid little three inch disks
erm
yeah
which i don't approve of in the slightest
erm
but i'd prefer to get UNK files
yeah
because then i don't have to do anything to them
yeah
i'll bear that in mind because that will save me start splitting documents up
mm
and transferring each part of the document into UNK files
yeah
erm yeah
whatever's easiest for you
right
erm is probably also going to be easier for me
erm we've done mileage and expenses claim forms and given you the bits and pieces
mhm
david doesn't need any packaging any more so i don't have to remind myself to
well we've got all that packaging over there
get it
if you do need it
right
they sent us nearly a box full of it
that was why i had a note for myself but it's not necessary any more cos his parents are coming up
okay
erm somebody on my behalf please erm preferably clare actually who has a computer
yeah
an amstrad f for which i can give you my UNK and UNK and you can then write letters for me
good
i like it
i can yes
need somebody to talk to the d t i since this was a d t i funded project why don't we get them to let us record i a meeting or two
erm parish council
the what's on page in the local paper
public talks and things
aha
and the clerk of the court in york and in other towns
those are the things that occurred to me
okay
they could all be contacted
parish a couple of parish councils in nottinghamshire have been very happy to let my dad record their open meetings
and i don't see any reason why other parish councils shouldn't either
well there's erm a UNK parish erm er council news sheet keeps turning up here
mm
anyway and everybody just takes one look at it and after everybody in the house has taken one look at it gets thrown in the bin if it lasts that long
yes
so i'll grab the next one and go along and contact them
right
yes we get er an UNK one
erm
right
right
things everybody else has done i suppose
erm you know just about everything that i've done
i've erm
yes
UNK the conference office monday
er ran into tony who's going to talk to his church people about religious meetings there
er did the seminar
eventually
eventually
okay
how were we to know there were gonna be two UNK hotels in leeds
there's only one in the bloody phone book
there's j i looked in the phone book there is only
yeah
one
you sent the recorder off to your father as well
sent the r yes sent the recorder off up to
great
scotland and as i say er said before they got er some taped seminars taped UNK which they can send down
right
erm that's the most obvious things
something that occurred to me this week
erm apparently one of the services that gets offered at UNK travel agents
mm
is that er you can go in and you can sit and you can talk to them about what you want for a holiday
yeah
and they'll talk back to you about what your best options are and do a s a sort of interview
yes
so rather than sit at the counter and do it they have rooms which you can go to and erm get interviewed
mm
and talk about all their holiday options and how to UNK a holiday for them
mm
erm it might be worth contacting them as being a professional consultation
right
do it
right
okay
or somebody do it
it's just erm i'm
i w i was just wondering if you wanted to write them a letter first
okay clare can write a letter
i'll be
if you've got
yeah
the time
have you the time erm to write letters
i do have the time
if you can bring me a er i don't know a disk with your
i'll bring you all the disk with all the UNK and whatever on it
yeah
and if you tell me who to write to i sh i shall get to it and do it
i'd like you to write letters for me at least this week cos i'm going to be
yes
UNK busy all week this week
th that's no problem at all
that'll be nice
yeah
okay
yeah
erm what i'll do actually seeing as i'm i get easy access to the town centre is i will go in there and see if they will agree to it and if they won't
right
i will say well can i send you some information a letter and that sort of thing
yeah
i'll do it that way round
yeah
okay
okay
right
have you got erm paper
or i'd better provide you with some paper
if you could provide me with some paper
all the bits and pieces
yeah
i'll do that
okay
er stationery
with an e
cos you haven't stopped
pardon
because you haven't stopped
what
you're not stationary
i'm lost actually
don't bother
it's
erm
i was in bed until what i thought was midday today and turned out to be one o'clock
and it was one o'clock
and i haven't really recovered from the shock
erm this week i've got a positive answer from b r about
yes
recording there and that's good
very excited about it
yes
it's brilliant
yeah
i was very pleased about
and i'm meeting with appropriate people in b r on monday to decide when they will let me record
mm
and then it's just a case of providing them with tapes and tape UNK and they will wander off an and do the tapes for us
excellent
so that's good news
erm my father received the recorder and tapes and is enthusiastic about getting recordings for us and that's all set up for whilst he's in scotland next week
how UNK that going to be
erm he's in scotland for about the next month but i've asked him to do the recordings in the next week
right
then what's gonna happen to the recorder
he'll send it back to me
okay
and i will probably
unless i hear from my contact in liverpool send it out to manchester
right
next
okey doke
super
erm did i say this last week
i may have done i may not have done
when you send them send them parcel class but insure them for the top amount
right
which er it costs one pound something for the insurance
erm it's about three quid to send them parcel post
yeah
that seems to be the most reasonable way of doing it rather than sending it registered
yes
which doesn't actually do anything except tell you that it got there
that's right
yeah
er it does seem crazy to send them all round the country without UNK them
yeah
so i'll see to that
ah
it is one of us
hello
telephone for mr
excuse me
yes
okay
a popular guy
cos i'm hoping cos i've got a in manchester get me some recordings from the public library
right
their meetings hopefully
mm
and their talks
mhm
so that will be some stuff from manchester as well
great
good
super
right
right
erm
that was my achievements for the week
well i think that's the b r thing certainly is a big achievement
erm right
derek and i went to the UNK
yes
erm and derek was UNK successful erm and got a vague sort of agreement from the deputy returning officer
right
about erm information about the UNK candidates for the council elections
mm
erm and the receptionist was not at all useful
in giving me information about the weddings
erm she wasn't entirely with it
so erm i didn't find out anything about the weddings
right
erm so erm i'm going to ask my mother where one gets a marriage license
don't do that david she'll
go white overnight
i will start from scratch on them
don't you just don't you go the UNK office
i really don't know
i think there's just a UNK office isn't there
i have no idea
i've never done it so i don't
no
know
and i don't intend to either
erm yeah i imagine if you just look under UNK office in the phone
mm
book there'll be something
yes
mm
the thing i did fail
to do this week was i did actually see my landlord and meant to ask him about recording some tutorials
mm
for us
but unfortunately i did remember afterwards having erm UNK myself for this that he is actually based in london at the
ah
moment and so is out of our catchment area
right
but i di one of the people that's moving back into my house is a supply teacher in the york area so i will probably talk to him
right
about whether he can get any classroom situations
mm
s
do we still need stuff from schools in
yes
the york area
yeah
that's good
UNK erm current school sue 's current school have made positive but need to be paid for it noises so i'm going to telephone their headmaster
that's the first
time we've come back with a need to be paid isn't it
good heavens
erm actually it's not
the careers service wanted erm to be paid as well
they the careers services actually asked me who if anyone was going to make money out of it and i said well yes me
mm
erm
and they said well in that case could we make some money out of it
so i just gave them the statutory amount per tape
right
erm and they put it in their christmas fund or something
excellent
erm but i wasn't actually that surprised that the school er at a school asking to be paid for the tapes because erm they've got to get their money from somewhere
that's right
and they ain't getting it off the government at the moment
they deserve it to a certain extent
yeah
yeah
erm so i've got to telephone him tomorrow and sort of make happy and erm UNK noises about money
right
erm and he may then let sue record a couple of lessons
erm
right
i'm ge starting to get a bit upset about not getting letters back from people
i know i shouldn't really cos i shouldn't expect them to come back at all but it UNK me when
you know three weeks ago i wrote to scarborough college and the buggers haven't written back even to acknowledge my letter
it's a it's a bit UNK
it's not nice
the one thing i wanted to erm bring up in this meeting
yeah
which you you've obviously had a mind to because you've done the breakdown about the various other regions
mm
is what we're going to do about start collecting in other regions because we're getting to the stage where we've almost got north yorkshire
yeah
wrapped up
i've been hoping to leave it erm and see what happens
and what seems to be happening is that we're gradually remembering people we know in other regions and
yes
starting with them as a basis
yeah
erm probably the most fair way to do this erm i mean fair to our friends and relatives in other r parts of the country is to ask them if they could either send us their local papers or
mm
a copy of their local phone book
for which i'll pay
right
erm because those i mean the l a local yellow pages or a local UNK actually those are nice and narrow
UNK are better
yeah
erm and have UNK in erm are very good ways of getting in touch with local organizations
yeah
erm
yeah
i mean i mean i've written a letter to my cousins in south wales asking them if they can point me at any places that might record but i'll actually make the contacts
you've done south wales have you
well i haven't i wouldn't say i've done it i've just asked them to make
you've made a contact in south wales
asked them to make a contact
i mean but by all means
okay
make more contacts
yep
i can do
i don't think we have a problem we're not gonna not gonna have a problem with places getting asked twice
mm
erm i don't
right
think that's going to be a problem at all
i will try and get something like that brought up from north wales
right
at the beginning of next term because i know somebody in north wales at the moment
right
i've written to a friend in anglesey
mm
as well erm but i mean if those come to anything at all they'll only come t gonna come to something fairly local aren't they
yeah
on anglesey and in UNK
right
UNK
so you know wales is a big cou big well it's not a big country at all but it's big compared to a county so
yeah
that was a positive response by the way from scotland
good
and that my parents have the thing it arrived thursday morning
good
and er they're making recordings
they've got in touch with the three people that they've got at
yes
schools and they'll they probably won't manage anything in the next week because the schools are going on holiday at
yeah
the end of the week
yeah
but they will be quite happy to make recordings er and so that's three different schools in the west of scotland
excellent
when's the first consignment of scottish tapes
erm don't know
don't know when they're coming
but
right
anyway erm there will be tapes on the way and they're consulting with other people too so
right
when actually i should probably mention this
when tapes come into me i have a listen to the beginning and end of them all to sort of see what sort of quality they are
right
erm and also to try and work out which speakers are which
so that i can check that against the form and get the form
right
back to people if i have a problem with it
erm where i find i can't understand the regional accent i'm going to give them back to the person who recorded them
and say here you UNK this
so i've got a feeling you're going to end up UNK a lot of the north of the border stuff
i don't think so
but anyway
well
no problem
i can do that
erm
it's only four hundred thousand words
the younger the people get i find that not wanting to be erm whatever UNK or anything like that
but i find that or UNK but the younger people get the more problem i have with their accents
yes
erm and the further west in scotland and the younger they get the more problem i have with their accents
right
i don't know why this should be
okay
erm but it's true
i mean one of getting round that is erm for derek and i to UNK them because then it's fairly easy for me to turn round and say listen to this
what did he say
yes
yes
so that'll be
yeah
one way of working that
right
erm i mean that sounds seems quite reasonable to me
erm it also means that in the case of tapes that have come from your parents you're more likely to know one or two of the speakers and therefore have a less difficult time sorting out which one of these twelve
actually
speakers is this
i
person on the list
i can think of a i can think of a few th of them who are going to be completely UNK to you
good
you can have all of those
and welcome
we don't mind at all
erm yeah
i mean er i'll still need them to come to me for er entering
yeah
into the books and everything
yeah
no problem
but then you can have them back
erm i don't know if i gave you and if i didn't i need to the things that i've called recordings logs that are different than meeting logs
yes
you
can you get people to fill or f do yourself fill those in rather than the meeting logs
right
i was i was
because
filling up my supply of each
yeah
erm
erm unless it's actually a meeting that you're recording use the other things cos they're just they've got bigger spaces for writing down what people's first words were and stuff like that
right
erm and i just find them easier to cope with
i'm gonna check with whether we actually need to fill in a meeting log for every recording situation
mm
or whether some kind of statement about who's there and what they're doing is enough
mhm
cos i think these meeting logs are a pain in the neck cos they've got the you know the boxes are about this big and you need to be a UNK to write in them
and a small one at that
erm and th the bit for notes isn't
and we wouldn't want any UNK around would we
big enough
no we wouldn't want any UNK around
erm
moving UNK along
that's UNK that is
pardon
UNK
yes
UNK
UNK
you're UNK
yes
against them on the grounds that they're UNK
little things
that they're th no th i'm not i'm UNK o against them on the grounds that they have legs that do that
that's what i i've thought about it for a long
time and that's what i find UNK about UNK all most UNK in fact
erm yellow UNK erm
and if anybody comes up behind me and does that i scream and elbow
it's true
UNK tested
just ask UNK
erm
all those present have been warned
right
yes
so don't bother
erm
i seemed to have worked my way down to the bottom of my list
erm
congratulations
thank you
it wasn't a very full list cos erm er it didn't occur to me until about seven o'clock this evening that i had to go out quite soon and then i just ran around UNK doing things
you thought it was still six didn't you
w erm no really
well it was still light so it hadn't di i didn't really realize how late it was getting
er i was still UNK around in my dressing UNK and you know yesterday's clothes and so i thought i'd better get up and do stuff
erm yeah
so i'm a bit UNK but that's everything i think that i have to say
right
can we go through unless anybody else has anything to say
no
right
can we go through erm what we're going to do this week so i can make a note of it so i'll know this week rather than last week when i didn't so i didn't
now does anybody know
shorthand
not that anybody else but myself could read back
er i don't know shorthand but i thought y somebody who did know shorthand would probably have a less hard time than i do writing down notes
erm but it probably wouldn't make much difference
erm
i i've learnt the UNK school but to a basic level and a long time ago and a lot of it is now forgotten
fine
not a problem
erm okay
what are we gonna do this week
i'll write it down your names
underneath them i'll write down what to do
oh
you don't need one for me
another point
don't i
oh
no you're off limits this week aren't you
another point about erm what we did this week we went down to the UNK
i mentioned that
yes
yeah
david was saying
mhm
right
this week
erm after my meeting on monday i shall hopefully start recording at b r
and i will continue to pursue trying to get a contact with UNK in liverpool and probably have the tape recorder and tapes returned from my father
right
which i will then turn around and put to good use most probably in manchester
if you can let me know who you want me to write to or give me a source book to start
yes
writing letters from i will also start on the letter writing for you
okay
and i will go into the travel agents in town
thomas UNK
thomas cook
that's the these people who apparently do con consultations on
where are they
individual holidays
are they the ones that are
they're right se behind beside the royal bank on the corner
the royal bank
yeah
thought so
and i will see if i can get erm a UNK interview holiday consultation taped from them
right
okay
do they have with an e or not
cook
er no without
er no cook
there's no e there
okay
it looks wrong somehow
doesn't matter
i don't care
that's the way they do it
how they spell their name
er
what are you going to do this week
transcription work
we hope
erm we hope yes
probably not till towards the end of the week
erm
whatever
erm i've still got
make suggestions for people i can go out and hassle in the first couple of days of the week
because i
yeah
until the conference office say UNK or nay there's nothing i can do literally there
mm
until any of the other ones bear fruit because the UNK i can't get anything on the elections till april the sixth erm i can't get anything from the scottish tapes until they start arriving erm whatever
so all my sources are in progress but
right
nothing's about to turn up
so suggest something and i can go some how about getting some tapes not in north yorkshire perhaps
yeah
driving over to leeds or something if we if there's anybody we can contact over there
erm it's making the initial contacts that's the problem
erm i'm in two minds as to whether it's best to always write first or to phone first whenever possible
i think it's probably best er probably good to phone first but i'm erm worried about phone bills
right
and how to deal them
phone calls made from non local phone calls in fact local c phone calls as well made from my house can be made directly onto my business mercury account
erm i've got a mercury account at home and i've got it set up so that after the mercury number you type in a user code and one of my user codes is for the business
mm
so
i'm quite UNK to people coming over and using my phone for making business related phone calls
erm particularly
alright then
if those people also supply me with never ending cups of tea and coffee while they're there
cos that's what i live on during the day is never ending supplies of tea and coffee
well i don't have any problem with going out
how about i could i could go down and just go to some places in hull on spec
mm
go into the university and see if there're there are any conferences there that i can ask
because that's not something we want to go through their conference office for if we only want to do a meeting
mm
something we'd just ask the people who are organizing the conference
erm i could go out to harrogate and see if there's anything on the conference centre there
mm
or phone the conference centre
the thing is yeah i mean anything rather than travelling telephone because you have to run up an awful lot of telephone calls before it's worth driving over and doing it
yeah
in person
and the time involved in driving over and then wandering around the city is
yes but if i'm doing nothing else monday
erm
you know
yeah but if you could be doing other things like phoning
yeah
fair enough
f forty places
yeah
rather than or phoning twenty places
yeah
rather than visiting three
okay
erm i was suggesting to clare and david that wherever we do know people who don't live in this region we could get those people to at my expense send us a copy of their local UNK directory which is an excellent resource for getting in touch with local businesses and other organizations
but i mean it's a UNK of the things that appear in yellow pages and also contains all the UNK we're ever going to need to use
okay
so anyone that anybody knows who lives anywhere
get them to send their local UNK
erm and i'll refund the cost
i mean i d i dunno actually
is it possible to phone i imagine it's possible to phone b t and get them to send
erm
directories
yes
it is possible
who does UNK
is it b t
erm no
no
i think UNK is
UNK
but
oh
yes UNK are separate
there'll be a UNK
yes
erm you can there's a list at the back of the yellow pages on yellow pages and phone books
for f yellow pages
yeah
erm they're all up in the library
i don't know if the UNK are in the library
mm
they might be
but it it's UNK to go to the library write down lots of addresses and then come away again
i'd like to actually have them on hand
erm you can't afford them
i can't afford yellow UNK or phone books but UNK might be a different matter
they might be cheaper cos
yes
they're smaller
erm but there's more of them
also well here's another thing
anybody we know can we get them to send last year's yellow pages and UNK which won't
yeah
cost them anything except for UNK and won't therefore cost us anything but UNK
yeah
that's
that's a good idea actually
let's do that
yeah
yeah
erm
right
we don't really need to UNK on who we're asking because i i'm i don't think
if we get UNK last year's yellow pages it's going to be such a problem
i mean we'll have a spare one yes
oh yeah
i mean what a hassle
we'll have to take them down the recycling
right
okay
you know
whoa
erm
in that case i can spend monday h er making phone calls
yeah
er around probably west yorkshire
i'll take down numbers i'll go to the library and take down num phone numbers and call places in the afternoon
and i
right
can hassle anybody who still around for phone directories and so on
mm
do you have a touch tone phone here
yeah
beep
it it's actually UNK beep
in that case i can give you my mercury my business mercury number and you can make phone calls on the company from here
but only if i really trust you
us
yeah
who you m buy a used car from this man
i do get a fully UNK bill
yeah
and i've i'm i have no UNK
yeah
s as UNK knows about phoning places that i where i don't recognize the number and asking them who the UNK they are and when he called them
well the only one that you have to worry about with me is if it it's a twenty five minute
o eight nine eight
er twenty five minute call to the states or something
UNK yeah
just don't do it on my account
erm
oh it's alright they don't cost too much
would that apply to me as well
what
because there's
have you got a touch tone phone
no but i was thinking of using this one here
yeah
because there's a few sort of non local calls i could make to get
yeah
phone directories sent
business calls do it on the mercury account
i mean yeah i'll give you the er no i don't think mercury account
that's probably more sensible than having people come round to use my phone as well
erm it doesn't depend on me being in
erm i did and try and use
i don't know it
i'll have to
ah
right
go home and find it out
erm did try and erm use it when i first rang margaret
yes
er but i couldn't get it to work
it was a local call
aha
you need to put the s t d code in for a local call
oh right
that would explain it
you press the mercury button wait for it to finish then o nine o four UNK boom
yes
it'll mercury are only supposed to be for non local calls
ah
right
but in fact it doesn't cost any more to
erm dial the local s t d code and then use that call d do the call on the s t d code
right
and then it appears on the mercury bill
ah
as if by magic
so as if by magic
UNK
there it is
yes
you wouldn't believe the things that turn up on our bill
you really wouldn't
erm
i didn't when i first saw it
UNK didn't UNK didn't know why it wouldn't work
erm right well that's why
right
fair enough
yes
right
since i've got to write to captain andrew anyway i will get hold of addresses of people er like sam in UNK
right
a useful contact
where is captain andrew
war er c coventry
coventry
he also will therefore be a useful contact
yes
erm if you've lost your
you want his voice on tape
not necessarily
but he knows people i'm sure
also he's in the process of setting up a business
he is in fact
he is
any part of that is a legitimate erm
recording scenario
you know anything
yeah
where he talks to people about setting up his business is a legitimate thing to record
and since he's the one UNK the meetings all we have to do is get his consent to erm the her his s signature and the other people's sort of
mm
and his verb
okay
erm
alright
some time has passed for the benefit of the tape
thank you
erm er so far my list of what we're going to do this week includes for derek erm fi tracking down non local copies of yellow pages by phoning people and UNK people who are about to go home
right
erm i shall phone the harrogate conference centre since they have a big and er quite famous conference centre
if i can get hold of the erm the name if i can remember the name
there is a conference centre somewhere out in the UNK of nowhere in derbyshire which i drove past coming back from UNK
if you phone in t erm the talking yellow pages and say i need a conference centre in derbyshire they'll probably tell you that one
talking yellow pages
yeah it's erm it's not one nine two it's something different
erm you can phone them up and ask them for a yellow pages listing and they and they'll give at random a listing from the yellow pages in whatever area you ask for
you can't ask for a specific taxi company or
ah right okay
anything like that but you can say can you just tell me the name of two UNK the number of two taxi companies in this area and they will
or you or you could ask for the number of all the conference centres in
i want a i want a remote conference centre in derbyshire please
right
one that's not in a town
talking i shall try the talking yellow pages
it really was it was the middle of nowhere and we drove by it and it's a conference c conference centre
er and but that would be conference material from derbyshire if we could
yeah
could get that
and since we don't seem to have any recordings yet from derbyshire
no
is erm where's UNK
what county is UNK in
UNK south yorkshire
is it
right
okay
i have a friend in UNK
but erm yeah i don't know anybody in derbyshire
nobody lives there do they
er lots of people live in the peak district
b r have
yeah but nobody we know
UNK
the section of b r that i work for
dave
most directly and
and
i'm sorry say again
the particular section of b r
yes
that i work for erm being the q s has its main headquarters in derbyshire so it's just possible i may be able to get some business contacts in derbyshire
that would be good
i'll see what i can do
that would be very good
i can hassle for business contacts in these areas at conferences as soon as i get to a conference
yeah
basically any conference lets us gets get lots more business contacts
right
i think i'll not wait for er if nothing comes in the post tomorrow i won't wait for the conference centre to get in touch with me i'll write to them tomorrow and drop it in
how about UNK how about phoning them
oh you'll UNK if you write to i if you write to them and drop it in that's fine then
mm
yeah
cos if
i since you've already contacted them in person erm phoning them's not going to you know reassure them that we're a UNK company
yeah
erm in quite the way that sending them a letter on headed UNK is
okay
plus the fact you don't have a n er contact name so it's going to be more difficult to get connected to anyone
yes
yes i'll just end up talking to a secretary whereas something
mm
will be UNK on somebody's
well
desk at some point if i write
if you end up going to the office and it's the same layout as it was and the same people there
aha
it was the secretary on there was only the one secretary in the office when i went in but there are two UNK one on the left and one on the right and it's the one at the one on the right
right
that was who was dealing with when i
okay
went in there
okey doke
erm
i shall also write to the captain for addresses and businesses and if he can help us and so forth
right
are you going to erm telephone the hull conference centre as well
erm i don't know if there's a conference centre but there's a university
i'll phone hull UNK then
i used to have a friend at hull university but we're doing this a year too late
he's graduated
ah
my ex head of department's wife used to teach at hull university
we're not getting into UNK connections here but
no i mean well okay
er she's also somebody in my department so
right
used to teach there and she'd probably know the right person to write to
or to telephone
i'll ask her and then get back to one of you two to actually do the letter contact
erm UNK mother erm is in the psychology department at nottingham
little nick
yes
nick
i've never heard his surname he's just little nick as far as i'm concerned
okay
little nick
erm
i'll have to phone nick tonight to see if the captain has a phone number now rather than just an address cos if i can phone him it'll be a lot easier
have you spoken to UNK about the
yes
is it this week or next week
i s it's next week cos he's home this week
yes
erm if the message got passed
yes
on erm
i mentioned it to him last week er last night actually
yes
erm he does re remember as far as i can tell
mm
but er basically the message didn't get passed on to him when i left it er the last time and he then did the tour monday not knowing that we could have been recording it because
ah
UNK told him and then when i got in touch with him erm he said no nobody had told him about it
so and he's doing one er not tomorrow but in a week's time and will be perfectly happy to record it
good
good
so
erm
i'll go along and be well actually i'll get him to do that and instead of being bored about the for forty five minutes or whatever i
you can be bored about it when you type the tape
yeah
but i that way i only have to hear it once
yeah
er and i can i can go and er i can
wendy
i can go round
i just spent three hours last night talking to him and i've had enough for the week that's all
i can't do it now i've already done the tour
i'm sorry i took the UNK option last night
instead of being UNK up to UNK room with you and erm other people
last night i said derek let's go home
well it was okay cos UNK was there but UNK and UNK had a bit of a er an argument at one point
oh
and it was a pain cos
when doesn't UNK have an argument
what were
well
they arguing about this time
well they were being UNK was being unpleasant about UNK which is calls made from non local phone calls in fact local c phone calls as UNK t to you know to make comments
yes
about his appearance or whatever
but it was because UNK said a UNK comment about somebody in one of UNK photos who turned out to be one of UNK very good friends
and er well so what
she does look strange cos she's got bright white hair and purple UNK on
oh right
sorry but it's true
erm yeah
that's getting off the subject a bit but never mind
okay
anyway yes UNK going to us at some stage and i will wander round town while he's doing his talk and then UNK it
right
so i only have to once
can erm one of you look in this week's advertiser and any sort of talks and things that are on this week if they've got a phone number to contact give them a buzz and see if they mind us recording it
derek
there are some talks happening this week
is it it's the advertiser that have the what's on section
that was it
erm
unfortunately that's last week's
i'll check our this week's ones cos they'll be lying around
right
okey doke
erm
excuse me while i find our papers
it's
meanwhile
no good for me because i'm working in the evening but minster f m has a list of what's on that night every night
mm
erm i don't know when they play it about quarter past er no about quarter to seven
mm
and then they i think they play it earlier than that as well
that's
erm
it's best to find them ahead of time because that gives us a chance to contact them beforehand
yes
yes
i think it's unfair to anybody to show up with a tape recorder and ask them on the spot cos it puts them on the spot
yes
erm i don't like putting people on the spot if i can possibly
no
avoid it cos you know you lose UNK that way
erm
erm but
but the advertiser does have quite a lot of what's UNK
what's UNK
what the UNK a what's UNK
erm
sorry
just for the record
yes
is that i e s or i s
i have not the UNK idea david
i'm so sorry
it's probably e s actually cos it was it was me trying to find a plural for
ah
what's on
i th i thought i thought it was i s actually from the way you said it the first time but that was just a guess
no comment
not a guess it's
well how do you say erm the plural of bus
buses
buses yeah
sounds like an i s
UNK
UNK
UNK yes
it's the correct plural of UNK
eddie found it out one time
it thought it was UNK
you just went past it
i did
yeah
yes
you just did it again
it's on a left hand page as you're looking at it
minster f m
saturday t v
sponsored by
no you
what's on

interesting

none of none of none of those have phone numbers but all of them have some sort of address
salvation army home league UNK
what's one of those

UNK harmony UNK practice night go on

high impact UNK
it's
no it's
it's a different name for UNK
it's UNK for fat people

right
high tech history a r c saint UNK

so tuesday UNK gonna be busy
young businesses and things like that so
oh no problem then
he he'd probably be quite
yeah
happy about it
york c v s training workshops
erm stop smoking group clifton health centre
if they agreed that would probably be good
ted heath music appreciation society
i worried about that when i read it
UNK oh wow
i wonder what this one's gonna be
balance and harmony UNK street centre
that's all it says
UNK
it's probably
two hours of going UNK
it's not going to be interesting
be a UNK group
yeah
quite easy to UNK
which wouldn't be easy to though remember y it it's three os and two UNK because it's UNK
UNK
UNK
because the UNK
or in the case of some UNK
i'm not that
you didn't join in the harmony
erm from dark crystal
yes
where they come up and UNK in harmony
yes
and it's quite UNK silly
yes
i know
er it's ac it occurred to me that what you were about to say cos UNK
UNK
spent a long time showing me his dark crystal
UNK
book last night
er vale of york conservation volunteers
but that's going to be UNK
erm er
and we wouldn't want to get the tape UNK wet would we
no boys and girls
cos it's summertime now
UNK
so it's gonna UNK it down any minute right
it's now b s t
the UNK month in york is april
well UNK
yeah we're about due for another flood
i like it when wh it floods in town and you can go down and watch UNK standing looking at the roofs of their cars floating down the UNK and you think yeah
you're cruel sometimes
i was very
yeah i just like UNK in on other people's misery
oh
ooh
wednesday
UNK
a desert country by the sea
a talk by doctor tom for british heart foundation
sounds good
folk hall new UNK
well look i mean why don't i leave it to you to get in contact with
okay
the people in the advertiser whether by having to go there or by
phoning them up
i imagine most of these pl most of these places if they're organizations they'll have a phone number in the book
yeah
yes
they do
we've got
erm but definitely try
oh
and get the one at
centre for housing policy seminar social research unit seminar room UNK foundation building
yeah
yeah
erm
i mean we could get all of our UNK you know all of our sort of public educational informative talks this week if all of those pan out couldn't we
mm
mm
for th for the york area
i wonder about these two
what
york twenties and thirties social and activity club weekly meeting and
no you're not going
and new
york eighteen plus group
no you're not going
oh dear
oh dear
now why's that one opened up
is that because UNK a UNK week only comes round once a year
people are getting desperate at this time of year
could be
i wonder sometimes
oh dear
right
those two are
well i'll leave that to you erm and if they need letters written or need to
yeah
phone me i'm in tomorrow and tuesday all day
yeah
there aren't
probably it may be easier if i actually do those letters if they want letters
yeah
because derek will be able to say to me look do a letter to here
right
yeah
well i i'll phone them up
when are you going to be about
erm are you going to be at home at all tomorrow or here at all tomorrow
erm i'm usually here first thing in the morning and
what's first thing
you know before nine o'clock
that kind of first thing
yeah i usually find myself having just deposited UNK at the station at about a quarter past nine and then i'm in town and er able to do things in town
but erm cos
mm
i'll get my a disk to you and some
right
UNK and stuff
right
actually erm
but i should probably do that when i can come and see you and show you where it
yeah
needs to sit in the printer and things like that erm so you don't you know
right
end up UNK with for hours on end to work out
okay
i will be home erm i'll be home at my house as opposed to here erm tomorrow afternoon as from about four o'clock i would imagine
right
you're on road
lane
lane
lane
i live literally on the corner as you go out
that's very convenient isn't it
it it's the house right on the left hand corner just there are you go out
what's i can't picture it so what's the address
it's thirty eight lane
thirty eight lane
well why don't i pop round tomorrow
sure thing
at the end of if i w wait until the end of the business day so
mm
around five or so
er
yeah
between four and five you will definitely find me UNK and i will be at home
right
okay
well if i say i'll come at five cos that gives me a chance to do all the sort of phoning
yeah
of businesses
great
right
erm okey doke
and if you can remember to bring me some headed UNK as well so
th er i haven't actually yeah i'll bring you some headed UNK but you shouldn't actually need it except if people want this person is doing this on behalf of
right
erm all the other stuff i've just got a little header set up in the file on
right
on a UNK
yeah
the you know the little header
mm
i'm going to have some headed UNK as soon as i can get the laser printer printing out things that i tell it to rather than printing out UNK ten
i'm having a bit of trouble with UNK laser printer at work cos it's not a real it says it's a UNK two plus but it ain't
oh
mm
so it's actually a UNK something and i haven't got the printer driver for it
okay
and i can't phone up wordperfect UNK and say
mm
can i buy a printer driver for this because they'll say what's your registration number
they'll say what's your registration number
and i'll say i haven't got one yet because i can't afford to buy er a non UNK copy of wordperfect until next month
sorry
mm
but er anyone who feels like making a headed UNK and getting it laser printed is welcome so to do
alright
well erm
well when we've got a company logo we should do that
i've got a company logo
it looks like this
there is a company UNK go
it's dead pretty
UNK
here we go
company UNK
UNK yeah
let's get one of those
sometimes i feel i could do with one
yes
aha
mm
oh it
lovely
it's just that it's the
it looks sort of
erm what we really need er
erm
but there there's no
the problem is we can't use the can't use the UNK one
er you could you could print one off
erm
we'd only need one
for a start erm the UNK we wanted
it looks something like that
the type face we wanted isn't on the whatsit laser printer
i'd also like it in shadow
if at all possible
oh yeah
er the other thing is
so i it's a standard you know UNK little thing like y you us you use you know the with their little UNK thing and er the you saw the
oh no
UNK with their little red triangle and dots thing
no i think i think the word is quite adequate actually
yeah
that's great
y
fine
the fancy letters the m and the t really need a powerful pack like UNK
yeah
which
eddie
eddie
erm
who doesn't have a laser printer
yes
no but
but he can do the
but does have UNK
he does have UNK and erm UNK would use p UNK erm which we can import onto the p cs and dump onto the self service laser printer
erm
and a UNK in a UNK tree
i assume you understand what all that means
at the university
i know what it means
erm
erm
well you've got
but it does require me going to see eddie
erm i'd like to see eddie cos i didn't get to see him this time or last time
well we could we could arrange to drive over
well UNK going to be
and see eddie
yeah eddie is going to be busy the whole time
aha
because he's working for his course
he has
mm
er course work to do the whole time
but erm i can phone him er have you got his number as well
mm
right okay
well you could phone him if you
mm
wanted
erm and we could say we need a company logo done
cos i if we said we needed it in order to get some of this money
yeah
that he's going to get some of then erm that might more of an incentive for him to
well he might for instance let us come over and play with UNK for an hour in one evening or something like that
how long do you think it would take you to do that on UNK
erm
our resident UNK expert
i could i could do that in an hour
i could d i could do a complete UNK and just that just that logo as an e p s f that you could stick into wordperfect
mm
ooh
erm
right
ooh
ooh
er
then all i need to do is to find a printer driver for UNK laser printer at work
erm well er if it was e p s f you almost certainly could use
that's true
which that isn't
but
but the university have wor wordperfect don't they
online
yes
the university have wordperfect
yes
on the machines
yes
so
this could work couldn't it
could work
yes
okay
it's a UNK plan
it is actually
i have a UNK plan my lord
let's get let's just get it on though
erm okay let's get eddie
erm i reckon i reckon i could do it in an hour
erm
the thing is if we can get that erm and we can al we could also put it on business cards is another thing
mm
i can go and get a run of business cards done at some point
mm
ooh that's something
erm
else i have to do is find a somebody that'll do cheap photocopying
get like an account with somebody
u w
erm i mean it really requires a p c and a copy of UNK
erm however
i've got a p c
you have a p c
erm but i'd
er however
i'm running low on memory now
yes
erm
and i can't yet afford a p c
erm
mm
i can't afford a new copy of UNK
however i might be able to get erm the copy that i UNK copy isn't entirely legal erm and i got it for him
i might be able to get another copy of it
how big is it
i mean is it a massive program
i imagine it'd be quite huge
erm it was compressed onto six disks
but that includes three i think three disks were full of erm
sample stuff isn't it
clip art
which we don't need
mm
erm
yeah
we don't need any clip art
erm
which means it's on three disks
can it run off the disks
can it run off
no
it can't
be because it's compressed
because it's compressed
erm
i mean how big
but you don't need to keep it
well how big will that UNK into
erm
well the total amount on three disks is what two UNK
if i have it i'd wanna keep it
you know what i'm like
i haven't got two UNK of memory
i've got about a UNK and a half
and that fills up my hard disk
well that
aha
so that
right
you couldn't use it
it fills it up
yeah
too much to be used
right
erm
and that's including my on disk UNK thing that erm
oh dear
oh
UNK around with
dear
all sort of crap
right
erm
well that actually that's on my disk cos we did have two the disk UNK and it's my half of it that's got a UNK and a half left
i don't know what UNK got left
but er probably not very much
knowing UNK not much
knowing UNK it's probably not much
however
okay
i'll speak to simon
i'll speak to simon erm about borrowing his p c at work
doug has a p c
right
okay
doug has a p c
i will
go get doug see what he's yeah
just see how much space he's got
erm
and tell him it's temporary
yeah
and i'll see if i can get a copy of UNK
because it will be a lot easier than going over to bradford
erm
yeah
although it would be nice to go over to bradford
yes
and it means that we could make changes if we needed to
that's true
yes
er
er now the source was at university which means that he's gone home
he's at court he might not have gone home
not court erm house
might not have gone home
i thought they were planning to er make term time only
no idea
i don't know
erm i'll see erm i know that richard has a copy of that and eddie has a copy
mm
i'll see what i can do
right
erm i will buy a copy of it when i have access to a p c
erm
how much is it
the new one is about two hundred and sixty pounds
for the big one
er a hundred and ninety five for the smaller version which doesn't have a
it's a bit excessive
but it's the best package in existence
mm
they've got it at the law college and i've spent some UNK with it and thinking i want
i want
i want
it's very easy to do pretty things with it
mm
did you did wasn't it UNK that you guys used to make the erm badge for our UNK two thousand game
erm yes
eddie did that yes
mm
yes i've still got that somewhere
erm
in fact i may even have them be in here
no they're not
they were really good
UNK p c isn't suitable because the UNK crap
UNK
p c would possibly get it
in what sense is the monitor crap
er it won't do colour erm
it doesn't need to
it's a black and white logo
it it's also got a erm er it's got no mouse for the computer
it's anyway UNK might get it running
okay
er but there're some really UNK ones in the chemistry department which cou doug could borrow for an hour and a half of an evening
so
i'm not a fr free in the evening
no
we need it
yeah
er when derek when
but
david's free
but weekend
maybe yeah
yeah
cos er an hour and a half on a saturday evening
we could manage it
mm
erm
we can get a p c
if we can do this ourselves i'd really like to
yes
erm cos
er
i definitely don't wanna pay you know somebody
yeah
like sixty quid just to make a logo that we can do ourselves
yeah
yeah
th there is no w er problem whatsoever about getting a p c which is of suitable capability
right
and we just need doug to be around t
well
if erm
or if simon can bring one home from work
UNK machine has reasonably high graphics doesn't it
it's not c g a
er no UNK machine is crap
UNK is quite good as far as i can tell
er erm
i've got a v g a
bloody space
i dunno i could i could back up and remove wordperfect which UNK about another UNK and a half of memory
erm well it was on it was compressed onto three disks so i guess it's probably going to be about four UNK
mm
well
UNK machine has four and a half UNK free
it doesn't need a mouse and it will run on a c g a
erm
well i think it might work then
but i can't guarantee it
suck it and see as my grandmother used to say to me
indeed
okay
pardon
i'll chase that up this week cos it won't take
what did she use to say
suck it and see
don't tell that to UNK
bless him
erm
moving quickly on
erm okay i've got a list of what UNK gonna do i've got a list of what UNK gonna do
erm i'm gonna come round tomorrow and bring
yeah
some letter writing stuff
and david's gonna UNK
david's gonna UNK
david's gonna UNK
yes
erm it'll be alright i'm sure
i know
you'll be fine
don't worry
erm yes and i'll chase up chase up erm a copy of UNK
right
and i'm going to get some tapes to clare and the letter writing stuff find out about a photocopying account talk to about more tapes transcription notes erm meeting log forms demographic transcription and editing of transcription that we do
yeah
gonna write to the university conference office erm and talk to the head of UNK school or write to the head of UNK school
erm
that sounds reasonable
you're going to give us your m mercury account number
mercury account number
oh yes i've got a further list down here
mercury account number talk to UNK erm who used to be at hull
and i'll leave the talking to eddie about UNK for
yeah
for other people to do
right
should i phone him up then
no
not yet
not
wait until david's erm UNK getting a computer in york
cos it would be UNK it's a lot easier to do it here
cos i it takes it would take an entire
yeah
evening to go out to UNK
erm
er in fact it would take an entire evening to go out to UNK
it's a bloody long way
whereas it's
yeah
it's a lot more convenient
could come round here
mm
mm
erm i mean it'll take a while to install
mm
waiting for the program to install
right
well i'll leave that with you to see what comes out
but i mean in the meantime we're quite happy quite happy carrying with the silly little UNK that i've got cos it says
yeah
who we are
it's just i'd like something printed
what about the p cs in the p c room in UNK
erm
all you UNK a UNK account
yeah but they don't have very much memory in them
they don't have enough memory in them to load up very much
and you can't put it on c you can't put it
if you if you network them you've got hardly any and even er UNK i think they've only got two UNK
but you can't do something clever like dump it all onto my scratch quota for example
no
erm
okay
ah well
no you can run they're big enough to run a UNK of game but not something that takes more than one disk
erm er
okay
right
are we done
i think we are
right
shall we go away then
mhm
erm
okay
okay

er we won two games and lost the other two

right
well not smashing that you lost two right
can we just get the prayer out and start by saying the prayer together please
you haven't got it
use
right okay
pour out your spirit upon your people and grant us a new vision of your glory a new experience of your power a new UNK to your word a new UNK to your service that your love may grow among us and your kingdom come
through christ our lord
amen
right
now last week and on sunday we talked about again about the seven gifts of the holy spirit
can you remember any of them
did you do the work on saint stephen by the way
er
the first UNK
no i don't think s no
have you got it from last wee the week before
yeah i think so
you were supposed to read through it and have a look
if you want to it's at the very back i can see it
oh no
no i haven't done that
right
well i that was to sort of try and make you focus on the gifts of the holy spirit that we're going to receive that we receive through or that you have UNK through confirmation rather than receiving because they're already there
they have to be already there or it doesn't er really work
right erm can you think can you remember any of the gifts that we talked about
er
i know it's a week and a half ago but
see what you can try
is it like an UNK an erm UNK
no the gifts that you receive or
erm no
do you want to get out the sheet then with the gifts on that we lo you looked at
i keep saying we looked at cos i looked at it on sunday and
this one
yes that's
yeah
right
right they're the sort of they're the go they're good titles
wisdom understanding right judgement courage knowledge UNK and wonder and UNK
they're sort of things to focus on points of focus within when you're receiving confirmation of the ways in which through confirmation you can enhance the gifts which you already have and focus in on the power of the holy spirit through those gifts
right
erm if you have a look at the stephen we'll go over i think the stephen first UNK because without that really i think that'd be quite a good focus of er for the talking about the gifts
right
have you read the story
do you know the story of stephen
erm i'm not sure
mm
do you want to just quickly read it through
there's no point in me reading it out is there
just want to read it don't bother writing it we'll just read
mm
it and talk about it and you can write it in some other time
mm
read it
yeah
read it
right
now that says stephen was a man filled with the holy spirit
his death an life and death showed the power of the holy spirit working in him
he showed the gifts of the holy spirit
he UNK showed the gift of what when he spoke out UNK
erm
what would you say
look at the
courage
that's right
or that's a good
the stephen they're not all i mean i'm saying that's right but that some of them there are more than one answer to
but erm sometimes that was pretty UNK that's an obvious one i should say
she stephen showed the gift of something when he UNK the truth about god and the message of jesus
what would you say
right judgement
right judgement
yeah
right and the next one then
stephen faced the difficult choice between life and the love of god showed the gift of
UNK
mm
yeah it is UNK to be UNK yes
power to love god and each other as we should
yeah
but
right
it it's a difficult choice between life and love of god
had to choose
what would you do if you're choosing
don't you think that's more right judgement
yeah
because that's you know he's making the right choice making the right UNK judgement
yeah
right
stephen showed the gift of what when he UNK his UNK
even then he still loved them
it might not be there are other ones
they're just useful headings but if you can think of something else what would you say
con you think of anything else
understanding
understanding yeah
mercy really isn't it
he showed mercy i mean he
yeah
showed mercy on them even though they did not show mercy on him
right the rest of them i don't really want to go through it too much because that's that was just to show you an example
can you think of any more modern day people that you think could UNK you and can show the gifts of the holy spirit in their lives
i mean stephen is a heck of a long time ago he's the very first UNK and we although we celebrate his UNK day still on december the twenty sixth because he is the first UNK he's quite a long way away
although a lot of his story is still relevant to us cos you can see it in today's life when people stand up for themselves or stand up for their faith or what they believe in and you look around you can see violence and being done to them
but can you think of anybody for yourself who you could think of who over the recently or over the in the past few centuries or closer to home have shown the gifts of the holy spirit in their lives
well the prime minister right judgement and wisdom
most of the time
no i mean er yeah okay fair enough
but can you think of anyone who stands out as being somebody who really does their bit and yet does it possibly with UNK or erm i'm thinking of rather than saying sort of a general terminology of sort of prime ministers or what have you erm i'm thinking if you can think of a particular person
father chris
oh i'm sure
he'd be very pleased to hear that
yeah
smashing
anybody a bit more famous
i'm sure father chris would be pleased to hear that and would be very UNK to hear that as well but erm he's erm i'm sure he does try to live by those rules because er obviously that's one of the bases of his life but erm i was thinking more in terms of somebody who stood up for UNK stood up for what they believe in a situation where it was difficult
cos with the best will in the world father chris really doesn't face an awful lot of opposition does he
yeah
you know where he lives in england we're very quite a generally quite a UNK or comparatively quite a UNK society
or somebody has stood up and done their best for their particular community or somebody's stood up and done their best to or has moved to somewhere
any ideas
any suggestions
no
mother theresa
yeah
mm
yeah
yeah
you know about mother theresa do you
yeah
right
her whole point in life is that people criticize her because she does erm she can only actually look after a very small percentage of the people in UNK who need help and they all sort of say well she does that bit but what about the rest of them
and she says that she does what she can in her own way she tries her best to do what she can to help
right
erm obviously it's not just those who are famous who show the power of the spirit in their lives you know everybody does
there are different ways of doing it with different people erm who do share it
there's a few examples here mother theresa was one that UNK to my mind when i was thinking it through
erm can you show can you tell me any ways in which you i presume you know about mother theresa you know quite a bit about her life do you
i just like know she helps people in UNK and helps the poor in
yeah
she does she goes out and she also goes round and she fund raises for her own for her own er work as well
not so much now because of ill health but she used to
she speaks out she lets people know what's happening
so can you tell me looking at those seven could you tell me which you would say immediately comes to mind with mother theresa
understanding
yeah
mm
definitely why
how
cos she understands that she's got to help god i mean people around her that are suffering
yeah
any others
courage to stand up for er erm what she believes in
yeah
any others
right judgement
how
well she's erm j erm she's made a right judgement about erm to help people and not just to sit there watching telly or something
yeah
so she's doing something er it is in a difficult situation and she knows what to do
yeah
any others any other gifts that you think she's shown that aren't on there
love for the people around her
that's right
and through her love also she shows great respect because the people that she's dealing with are considered in indian society to be the UNK of UNK
indian er in india still has a very class UNK society and er you know from the top UNK do not even associate with the lower UNK and there is a terrific there's still a terrific sense of that
i was talking to a friend of mine actually on monday who is erm UNK partially indian and come from india and from UNK and she is high UNK but she's a catholic as well so she's her UNK different she's lived in england most of her life but she can't get over the attitude of some of her relatives in india to the poor because they're lower UNK
it's still there
right
i want to just have a look at this
it's a two part thing
erm it's erm this is people or stories but a based again i'm sure when y as you read through you'll probably find quite a lot of the erm little things that they're giving you here you could relate to in your own life either for yourself or for other people that you know
erm if you have a look through them and then have a quick write down of what gifts you think the different ones that are mentioned in this are using
okay
should i write down
yeah write on it and see what you think
mm
sorry you can't work in pairs which is what they did on sunday
i suppose you could you could work with me but er i don't think that's quite the idea
unless you want to just discuss it and mark it down as we're going through
try to think not just of those although they can u you can use those as guidelines
try and think of any others that er
re be respect
cos er
yes
that's a good one
anything else
understanding cos
mm
she understands
any others
not on there really
friendship
yeah
courage to like
mm
yeah i agree with you because it is sometimes quite difficult for somebody who's handicapped to find the courage to go out
mm
if they go into town together yeah
that's a good one
actually i don't think that one UNK up last week on sunday
i don't think anybody said courage for her
i think they said friendship and respect and understanding but i don't think anybody said courage
what else is UNK using there
friendship
friendship yeah obviously yeah
it's a shame actually they don't say how with UNK it can be a mild handicap or a major handicap
i mean it can be aware you can be aware of somebody with UNK having UNK and you can also be totally unaware that they have it
yeah i agree with you
right the second one do you want to have a look at the second one
right judgement
yeah i would s i would guess so or i would think so as well
i'm not really doing that right because i mean i shouldn't agree i what you say is right whether i agree with it or not
i said oh yes that's right yeah but it's not right
it is right but it's not that's not the whole point of this exercise
the point is for you to think decide what you think
right
did their form teacher use any gifts
how could the form teacher have approached this
could have said no it'll cost a lot of money or something
yeah
what did he actually do
did she did something about it and
so what did the form teacher do
they came up with the idea what did the form teacher do
put it into action
i don't think he actually d or she whichever it is the form teacher actually did that did they
it was the two boys who s who set up put it into action
so what did the form teacher actually do
gave them permission to erm
so yeah
i mean he didn't really give he was only you know just like erm just used his authority just to say yeah
so what's yeah but he could have turned round and said no so what's he actually done
understand standing
understanding and
erm
encouragement isn't it
i mean he's actually encouraged them he's said yes okay fine go ahead let's sort it out let's do something about it
joined possibly joined in with them although it doesn't actually say
mm
it says they talked to their form teacher about this and have formed a tree planting group in school
i presume it means john and andy have formed a tree planting group in school not the teacher
but he did use the gift of encouragement didn't he
yeah
and UNK er what did you say
er
one you said
understanding mm
understanding yeah
what about the rest of the class
did they did they join the tree
well presumably if they started a tr a group haven't they
so what were they doing
erm helping
that's right
helping
they were encouraging again
mm
weren't they and erm supporting helping them and supporting them weren't they
because they could have turned round er they wouldn't have got as much done if there'd just been the two boys together
yeah
mm
any others
right okay
read it through
what would you say what gifts is mr UNK using
courage to
courage yeah
to
yeah that's a good one that i don't think that one came up either last time
that's really good so courage yeah what else
he's telling stories probably about the past what is he showing
and what will she be should we be ready to see in older people
what about wisdom
what do you think
that's one that struck me
yeah
yeah do you agree with me or not
if you don't agree with me please say i won't be offended at all if you disagree
because often i mean wisdom to help us to judge no not really judging is he
he is using wisdom and er his wisdom of life or knowledge of like perhaps rather than wisdom
i meant wisdom in the other meaning
knowledge of life cos he's talking to his UNK
telling stories
erm
right if you don't agree don't er do say please do say because if you don't agree i'd rather hear your views
yeah
okay
right what gifts is mike using
love
yeah
because so he can just like pop in every day
mm
good
anything else
understanding
yeah i think that's very important that one because he understands he sees the loneliness that his UNK feeling
he's sufficiently aware to know that er he can't get out much he's on his own he's lonely especially if he's not in very good health
so he can't do ou he can't go out and about
anything else
right judgement cos
mm
what else they usually have a good laugh
friendship
mm yeah
they're friends aren't they
mm
they usually have a good laugh sense of humour any of those
right don't need to write all those down let's have a look at the next one then
right gifts is using
understanding she understands
what else do she do
how would you feel about standing up in front of a group of people and telling them something about i mean in her situation telling her class or even the whole what you were doing
i think scared
so what's she showing there if she's
courage
yeah i think so
and
some people some people it wouldn't bother but erm as she's not trained to be a speaker she's a voluntary worker
i mean we don't whether she sort of it doesn't say whether she volunteered to go and talk to the people in the school but even so it's quite it takes quite a lot of doing to stand up in front of a group of people you don't know and talk about the work
what gifts is the young man using
determination to do erm
good yeah
that's a smashing one that didn't come up on sunday either determination yeah
what else
anything else
what about hope
mm
yeah
yeah
there's one thing that struck me right
what gifts are UNK and peter doing
UNK
using
no go away i'm teaching go away
no
go on then yes be back for seven o'clock
what gifts are UNK and peter using
helping
helping yeah great helping others
and supporting
supporting him yeah great
what gifts are their friends using
helping again
yeah
understanding and
yeah
they understand that erm he needs somebody to
yeah
and they see the purpose for what UNK and peter's doing aren't they and they're
mm
helping
yeah
smashing
right and we'll leave the other sheet for now so's you can have a look at that yourself if you would at some stage and just erm go through it
and at this UNK point on sunday we did a break and UNK but you can forget about that cos i'm gonna carry straight on
okay is that alright
yeah
right okay
now erm all the gifts that you give at confirmation the whole idea of confirmation in well one of the main ideas of confirmation is taking on board for yourself what your parents promised for you in baptism
yeah
and erm the we are given or they h one of the reasons or the purposes behind confirmation is to give us the strength to use the gifts which god's al has already given us
and it's like the story of the erm i think it was the servant parable of the servant with the UNK
do you know the story i mean the parable i mean
no
well the servants three servants are given one talent and their master tells them to erm do with it what they could in a certain space of time and he would reward them
and one of the servants takes his one talent and he uses it and he works very hard with it and he buys erm raw goods and he makes things and he a makes his one talent up into ten
and the second servant doesn't do quite as well he erm but he manages to make five UNK out of his one talent
and the third servant says well no if i if i go out and buy something might go wrong and i'll lose the talent and so he UNK it away in the UNK
so when the master comes back and says to then what have you done with your UNK one the first servant UNK here are ten for your one here are five for your one and he's very cross with the third servant because he said what's the purpose of giving me giving you this money if all you're going to do is hide it in the UNK
and it's the same idea in confirmation that the gifts which you are given are not given just for yourself they're given to be used and there's no point in keeping them to yourself you know
they are to be used and shared with other people and that's how one of the ways in which we live a christian life
we might do it amongst our family we can do it er by you know helping within the family you can do it by helping in the community all sorts of different ways
you might be called to do it some other way as you get older
that's up to depends on what happens really
right confirmation is a call from god
right
you understand that idea
we call that a UNK
that word is called a UNK
i'm sure you've heard or have you heard about UNK when say a priest has a UNK a call from god
when they renew their erm mm
erm no
er what what's it what's it called when they renew their erm their promise to god being a priest
well that's just no that's i think that's just a renewal of UNK
mm
but a UNK is a call from god
erm that's what the word means the word means a call from god
and erm the work that you're asked to do the prop the word for it i mean we use wh really what i'm t teaching you now is the vocabulary that is used and which will actually be used during the service
the call from god is a UNK and the work that you're asked to do is your mission
erm in actual fact i don't w i work in a non catholic school
and one of the things that erm they're talking about at the moment is making their mission statement
and that's the equivalent of our r e syllabus in a catholic school
but er it's a mission statement it's the mission is the work that you're asked to do
and there's a bit of fun for you
so if we just go through these and then you can find them in the word search if you like
a call from god is a
UNK
UNK
god's call is a call to
mission yeah
mission
mission
it doesn't make sense that does it
yeah it's called to a miss er to mission
that's the wor that's wor that's what the word is
the work we're asked to do
right so the word is mission for there
right
receive god's call come on go through these first and then we'll do them af i'll let you do the word search
we call it the sacrament
UNK
of baptism
yeah
yeah
yeah
and holy and spirit are two separate words in the word search
how many
seven
right
only it's not written like that in there
yeah
it's written in you can do the word search yeah i don't do you want to do the word search now
no i'll do it
okay right
fine
erm now kay actually had a big er you know the stand she usually does
mm
and erm i meant to er well she said she'd bring it back to me and then i said well no don't bother i'll sort something out myself and then i forgot all about it
so what i'll explain to you what was on there
there were pictures of bosnia ireland erm there was a picture of a little girl crying with er a friend stood next to her
there was a picture of some people being UNK in a lorry in bosnia
and there was a picture who had fallen off one of the lorries in bosnia erm one of the UNK lorries and was running along trying to catch up with her parents
erm there was a picture of a starving person in UNK and on top of all those there were UNK the opposite words love joy peace forgiveness happiness
have a look at the prayer of saint UNK now do you know the prayer of saint UNK probably do
you might not think you do but you do
right
can you uh just read it through
i'll read it UNK because it does make it i think it makes it stick in your mind more
lord make me an instrument of your peace
where there is UNK let me UNK love
where there is injury let me UNK pardon
where there is doubt let me UNK faith
where there is despair let me give hope
where there is darkness let me give light and where there is sadness let me give joy
and obviously each word there each negative word was UNK by a positive the opposite right
so can you choose one of those lines now think about it for a minute and then have a look on at this
erm and see if you can actually fill in the ideas which are on there
or the answer the questions which are on there
don't worry about it
presentation yeah but we're not doing that
sorry i've your stopped your train of thought the haven't i
right
fair enough right
which line did you look at
erm where there's despair let me give hope
right and the negative word is
despair
yeah
you couldn't think of anything
fair enough
that's nice actually
i mean it is nice that you don't know anybody who you feel might be UNK
yeah
mm
so you never felt i mean presumably you never felt that yourself and therefore and also perhaps if you've never come across fair enough
right what about in our country
the people sleeping rough in the streets
yeah
good one
and in the world going abroad
erm UNK starving
yeah
right
positive word is
hope
yep
and how can you bring this positive word into the examples you gave as answers to question three
how could you bring hope in
hoping that they'll have a home
mm
and giving aid to the people in UNK
yeah
true
so how
how would which one
both of them
by helping
how
how can you actually how could you help people who are homeless you
could speak to them and say erm give them some encouragement to go and have a look and see if there's any UNK or something
mm
giving information yeah that's a good one
i mean you yourself if you found out if you found some homeless people you could possibly find out where they could go
mm
so
erm i could erm ask the school to collect some money for them
mm
that could be for both really
yeah
couldn't it going doing taking an active part in charity work within the school or within the community
yeah great that's smashing
right
now this last one here is called living the prayer and it's like the other quite a few of the others erm but it's for you it's not for not for us it's not to be shared
but it is just to try and ask you to think ways in which you could help in this particular way in whichever way there is
so today i brought and there's an example here today i brought joy where there was sadness by UNK up a friend who was fed up
very simple thing to do and something you possibly would do without even thinking about it
and now we're asking you to focus in on ways in which you could live the prayer of saint UNK
right
for a week
now if y i mean if you do it you do it and that's it's up to you but because nobody else will look at it
but to be honest it is a good way of focusing in on what you what we've been talking about tonight and if you can i think it would be worthwhile doing as part of your preparation to help you to think
cos it i it shouldn't just be your preparation should not just be a one off hour and a half what have you on the sundays when you come along
because if you if you if that's all it is then you're just going through the motions you're not actually going ahead and receiving the sacrament of confirmation
i don't feel that it is with any of you
but erm you know that's up to you er you're the only person who knows that
right can we actually have a look now the last bit is sort of more the UNK before we go on to this
next sunday is the at the ten thirty mass is the celebration of election
right
between now and sunday it's down to you to decide that you definitely want to go ahead and be confirmed
at the celebration of UNK you said right yes well i'm prepared to take part in the preparation programme
now this next sunday you're preparing and saying yes i definitely want to go ahead and be confirmed
and it should be your decision
erm i know it's easier said than done sometimes but er it has to be your decision because even if you went ahead and were confirmed we were UNK talking about the idea of sometimes parents bring pressure on them on you to go ahead and do it and be confirmed erm when perhaps you're not don't feel ready for it and it takes a lot of courage to stand up and say no i'm not ready
but if you feel ready fine if you don't feel ready then even if you go ahead it won't be valid
it won't be worth anything because it won't have meant anything to you
unless it means something to you it's not really much point
erm that's the negative side
the positive side is obviously if you go ahead with the celebration of election smashing
what happens in the celebration is of election is that the erm it happens at the end of mass i think or round the end of mass
i think it's after communion
the priest asks the UNK or one of the UNK to represent the four of us erm to decide whether we feel you're ready for confirmation which we all have no hesitation in saying yes to with all this particular group
erm then he asks the candidates er do you sincerely want to receive the sacrament of confirmation and you stand when he calls out your name hell call out you names yeah
kay did this bit on sunday and i'm not too sure about it yeah
the UNK will read out in the same way as we did for the celebration of UNK erm whichever UNK is doing will say i present to you and call out a name and you stand up in your seat with your parents
now are you are you erm on the UNK on sunday
no i was going to stay down
right
well you just stand up in your row by your parents and you don't go don't come out onto the front or anything just stand up when your name's called and then he addresses you and says do you sincerely want to receive the sacrament of confirmation and you say i do
do you understand that through this sacrament god is calling you to become witnesses to christ
i do
difficult aren't they
do you want to follow lord jesus by living lives of loving service to god and to all god's people and you say i do
and the he says let us bless the lord
and you answer thanks be to god
then he asks the community because although they might not all have seemed to have been involved there's been a lot of people praying for you and
mm
you are part of the community
and then he will address you again
but knowing father er chris and then apart from the we everybody says the answers there it's all thanks be to god and amen i think we're actually gonna have some copies i don't know ready for you
so that's next sunday
erm you've got your letter about the following sunday didn't you
yeah
right
any queries questions or what have you about that
erm do you kn how much erm UNK erm
well that's up to you and your parents
mm
that's really up to your parents
erm if it's if you want some kind of a guideline i think last year i can't remember but i think we i think last year we actually had to ask because the parish couldn't support it totally
erm this year the parish has said they'll pay for it and any contributions will be UNK received and i think it was three pound last year
but i can't remember
mm
so that just gives you some idea and it's up to your parents if they want to
but don't feel UNK to contribute you know cos it's something right er don't think there's anything else
you've got the letter you've got all that
right so next sunday is the ten thirty mass for everybody
yeah
okay
okay
right can we just we'll finish off with a prayer
do you want to say the prayer of saint UNK
okay
when we get round to it
i'll tell you when
talk started some many years ago
it says legal aspects as you can imagine the chances of dealing with all the possibilities of legal aspects in retirement is UNK
so in fact i've always concentrated and what people have wanted is some specific direction namely wills dying and what happens if you haven't done something about it
now that was said many years ago
oh well the last thing anyone wants to do when they're going on a retirement course is to talk about dying
but as you may discover at the end of your course you'll have a questionnaire to say how found it how it's gone on and of course in the past people have filled in questionnaires saying what they want to know about the legal aspect is all about wills
so wills is what you're going to get mostly
now we've got a good long a session and hour and a quarter and tea afterwards
so er i don't mind at all being UNK if anyone has questions as we go along please shout them out it gives me a little UNK with me voice and gives a chance to deal with things in the right place if need be
if you can't hear me at the back because my voice drops from time to time then shout away because i'm not always aware of how well it carries
er and er we'll see how we go
now you are actually going to be UNK pig for me because i've been doing these for about ten years and i've decided for ten years is getting perhaps a little UNK
i've heard myself say it an awful lot of the time so one of my colleagues who's done one i've nicked his er
i'm gonna give his lecture or his talk which probably means i shall get my tongue in a twist an and not quite see where i'm going
so if i sort of UNK and start now and again you'll get an idea of what the problem is
so wills
firstly what's a will we all think we know what a will is
in practice it's a piece of paper that's been written out by you or at your direction to say what is to happen to all your goods and UNK and property when you die
of course although we're talking about dying and nobody wants to think about dying let's remind ourselves it's the only certainty in this life
we're all going to go off one day and there's nothing better than planning for it
and making will is planning for your UNK
now the good reasons for making a will
first one is to avoid the intestacy rules
as you can imagine if you don't what's going to happen to what you've got somebody else is going to say for you
in this case the somebody else is the law the law provides what is to happen
the problem is that the law makes its intelligent decision as to what it thinks should happen which may accord with your wishes
but if you haven't said so we don't know what your wishes are and the law will come along
and the law does things a little bit differently to what some people imagine
how many of you can i just ask hands up think if you die everything you go everything you have goes to your spouse
husband or wife
sorry you're wrong
erm it's a common mistake and people think don't need to make a will it'll all go to me wife
it's not true and of course wife might not survive
who gets what depends on who you leave and how much you leave
and we've got a little chart here which i shall go through
i know you may not all be able to see it but reasonably clear
first of all who you leave
whether or not you leave the surviving spouse makes a different
whether or not you leave children makes a difference
if you've got a spouse and children then the spouse is going to get household goods and personal effects the ordinary everyday things in the house and the first seventy five thousand pounds
and a life interest in half the residue
the half of the residue is going to go to those issue children grand children whatever
and when your surviving spouse has finally run his or her course and the life interest comes to an end then the remaining half will go to the children as well
now as you can imagine it depends what you leave and where you leave it as to how effective that is going to be on how er UNK that's going to be
there's been an article in the paper very recently saying they're going to bring out some proposals to change those intestacy rules shortly after easter they haven't come out yet
as it says in the article you own house and live in UNK your surviving spouse is not going to get a great deal of the house
if you live in grimsby then okay cos the house isn't going to be worth seventy five thousand pounds
so that's a critical point
what's the house worth
i'm dealing with two estates where no will has been made and the house was in the name of husband alone who died without a will and the net result is that on law on intestacy neither of the those surviving UNK is of right entitled to the house and in both cases there are children and as you can imagine there is a certain amount of UNK about it
if you haven't got any issue but parents or fore brother or sister or the issue of that say it's your UNK or UNK and you've still got a spouse of course she still isn't get she or he is still not going to get the whole lot
she gets a bit more a hundred and twenty five thousand pounds now and an absolute interest in half the residue
and it's only if there is no spouse that matters go rather more as might expect namely firstly always the children or the issue if they aren't any of those to your parents brothers an UNK er issue of parents therefore brothers sisters UNK and UNK
none of those back as far as grandparents and issue of grandparents so UNK and UNK cousins
that's as far as it goes
excuse me
none of those and the chancellor of the exchequer is rubbing his hands and saying UNK th there's money for my UNK cos he is the one who is going to step in and take it all so the people will argue the obvious ones are firstly somebody you live with but are not married to
secondly the child of perhaps a second husband or wife so your UNK if you have any
you may treat them as your children since they were two years old but if they're not a blood relative of yours they won't be UNK anything anyway however close they may be
and the third o category that come into mind are your husband or wife's UNK and UNK
the people because you don't have children who are very close to you because they're your UNK and UNK but they're not your UNK and your UNK
and i've had some instances where those entirely
there's your intestacy rules that's what the law's going to say about it all and that's what will happen if you don't make a will
pause to check notes
done the intestacy bit
erm there is to give you a little bit of an idea of UNK those rules would apply and who comes into it a well known family tree for you just to look at
and see how wide it can be and also in some respects how remote it can be
these are the sort of people who come in the UNK family tree
move that up a bit so a little better
those are the people who would have benefited or taken in to account should the queen have died without a will
and you get quite remote as you can see people you hardly know you know er fairly distant cousins er but you also get fairly close people who don't get consideration at all
just an indication for you there
now we've all seen the intestacy there's another little bit i like to deal with at this point er which is to do with inheritance tax
or taxes generally
the reason i throw that in is because it doesn't UNK come under wills anywhere but it's relevant to you
you've seen you've seen figures for intestacy
inheritance tax has different figures
and UNK and allowances
and there's a little table telling us about inheritance tax
now that usually UNK every year
the intestacy rules and the figures don't
the last time they were altered was i think about nineteen seventy nine or nineteen eighty one
tax UNK reductions everything to your spouse is exempt
gifts to charity are exempt
reductions they've actually altered those in the last b budget er which has UNK particularly the business property element
but essentially with agriculture UNK works of art and so on you have re reduced values to put in your estate
once you've taken those into account there's a nasty figure at the bottom
forty percent
which is not as nasty as it was ten or fifteen years ago but it's still a lot of money if you come into this bracket
forty percent above a hundred and fifty thousand pounds
now the chancellor's being very nasty this year he's not increased that limit at all
it was a hundred and fifty thousand pounds last year a hundred fifty po thousand this year and whether he will put the breaks on it next year cos he needs the money i don't know
reaction of most people is to say what a lot of money we don't get anywhere near that
why am i bothered about inheritance tax
answer sit down and work out what you're worth not alive not what you can spend
which is what we like to know about but what you're worth when you're gone
and of course if it's a husband and wife the two of you together should be thinking of this sort of information because you can do something about it in your will
you got your house it'll be paid for won't it by now
or hopefully
you've got those insurance policies they're coming good soon you're going to spend them on your world UNK i know but you might not quite make the world UNK
and then there's things that come in like superannuation may be pension payments if you're in a scheme lump sum UNK the sort of things that you can't spend but if you're not here they may be going into the pot
so before you decide that you're not worth a hundred and fifty thousand pound do actually sit down and work it out
there are few people i think who've been rather surprised at the amount concerned
again i'll mention the two cases i'm dealing with where there've been no wills and surviving UNK who are not getting anything
in one of those two cases we've had inheritance tax to pay
so it was over a hundred and fifty thousand pounds in total
and that again was a bit of a shock to the family concerned
they really didn't understand or realize that they were worth so much
so think of your tax because when you make a will you can something about that tax
you can make use of UNK and just a charity
husband and wife again particularly to plan a will so that it all ends up with the children if that is eventually what you want with no tax payable or a reduced amount of tax
now this comes into sort of preparing what you ought to have ready when you're about to make your will
now i hope you're going to see a solicitor to make a will
i shan't force you to but erm it's an important document and the biggest problem about wills is that when anybody gets to look at it you're not around to say what you meant
and if you haven't made it clear what you meant erm either the court will have to decide or somebody else will decide that it's different to what you intended
so it's a document well worth taking professional advice about
so if you're going to that have a clear picture in your own mind as to what you want
you can tell the solicitor and he will say or she will say to you good i understand that or have you thought of this or no you can't do that as the case may be
and you may not have realized this but these many UNK can be sorted out while you're still here to agree 'em
you need to know what you've got not precisely the solicitor doesn't want to know that you've a house and three UNK and two bank accounts and a building society
he wants you to know that you've got those and you've got a fair idea of how much you're leaving
and who of course you're leaving it to
how large is it
your estate that is of course your estate in this context is everything you own
your house your land your property your money everything is going to come in to be dealt with via your will
if you and your wife or husband between you are worth more than a hundred and fifty thousand pounds this is where a bit of estate planning can come into effect in your will
now you may want to leave everything to your surviving spouse and then on to the children that's natural
if it's worth more than a hundred and fifty thousand pounds between you at the moment and you leave it all to your surviving spouse then when he or she dies in due course and if those figures haven't altered they'll be inheritance tax to pay
say it's a hundred and sixty thousand pounds
ten thousand pounds over the limit not on your death but on your UNK death remember
tax at forty percent four thousand pounds to the chancellor of the exchequer he'll be delighted your kids will be wishing that they didn't have to pay it
they not really paying it themselves but they get four thousand less than they would
now let's presume that you've got a couple of children and on the death of the first of you leave ten thousand pounds between those two children and the rest to your surviving spouse
now that spouse is only worth a hundred and fifty thousand pounds when he or she dies not a hundred and sixty thousand pounds
amount of duty none
hundred and fifty thousand pounds is the exempt limit so there's no inheritance tax to pay on the death of the survivor
tax to pay on your death none because you yourself are worth a h less than a hundred and fifty thousand pounds and your will have ten thousand pounds free of tax
and it's as simple as that all you have to concern yourself is does the surviving spouse have enough left to live on
and well most people manage with a hundred and fifty thousand pounds one way another
there's pensions coming in any event
so that a little bit of simple planning is a way round inheritance for the benefit of the children and it's usually the children that people in the end want to benefit
may i ask a question
of course please do
is there a limit to the amount you can leave to the children at that point
erm you're effect erm limited to well no you could leave anything you like
but your own death if your the death of the first of you and your spouse have its own exception a er its own limit of a hundred and fifty thousand pounds
so if for instance you're quite well off and you have two hundred thousand pounds in your own estate that you want to leave if you make it all to the children there would be an exemption of the first hundred and fifty thousand pounds and there would be tax payable on the fifty thousand
if you left hundred and fifty thousand to the children and fifty thousand to your spouse there would be exemption gifts to spouse no tax on that exemption first hundred and fifty thousand pounds to the children no tax on that so on your death no tax
your spouse would have her own estate plus the fifty thousand pounds that you left her
so if she's still worth under a hundred and fifty thousand pounds there'd still be no tax on her death either
if she made her estate more than a hundred and fifty thousand pounds there'd be some tax payable so it's a question of how much you've got and both estates have got that exemption of a hundred and fifty thousand pounds
would the receipt of that money as a beneficiary affect my children's tax position
erm th in certain ways
if it's inherited from an estate that of itself er attracts no tax so there tax position would only be the income that they received from it would be subject to income tax and it would be added to their own assets so that when they die in due course then they've inheritance payable there
but there's no other tax er effects there's no capital gains tax for instance on that transfer
were you to transfer it during your life than there are certain possible tax er consequences depending on how long you live but it's fairly rare for people to transfer substantial amounts during their life
isn't it seven years
up to seven years in practice
there are reductions up to four years but again it would depend on how much your size of your estate is at the end of the day when you do finally go as well
three years
am i right in giving three thousand per year
you can give 'em three thousand a year to er in total to anybody you've got all the UNK like two hundred and fifty pound in any one gift erm and you've got things like five thousand pounds on marriage of a child that you can give and all these add up little cumulative bits here there and everywhere which helps you to dispose of an estate
also if it's within your own normal income you can give anything in other words if you don't reduce your capital
and you happen to live UNK but have a good income you can give the spare income away without subject to any tax
so there are plenty of ways of UNK of little amounts every bit you dispose of from your capital every hundred pounds saves forty pounds in tax if you're at that sort of level
could you tell me if you and your spouse are both killed at the same time
yep
and your UNK worth a hundred and sixty thousand
mhm
pounds and you've UNK it to go to your children after your spouse
mhm
i presume they would have to pay tax
yes because in practice what the will would say is that the spouse would have to survive for twenty eight days th the usual phraseology
if not erm then if your spouse died the day after you for instance you had a road accident or something like that and you've left it all to her she'll take it all and then it'll add it would be added to her estate it as well and make the inheritance tax bill bigger
but if you've made a twenty eight day clause then yes it'll go to the children a hundred sixty thousand pounds and there'd be tax payable on ten thousand pounds
but that's the same as if you UNK spouse had died before you for instance and you were the second of two to die and she hadn't or she might have everything to the children and you still got a hundred and sixty thousand pounds you can't avoid the inheritance tax in those circumstances
at UNK he was killed in a car crash with his wife both killed instantly
right
any sort of implications there
oh yes oh yes
he had retired he'd retired about ten years
depends what and how this is where we get husband and wife UNK
what happens depends on whether or not you made a will to start with
so if you don't know who's died first and there's intestacy i e no will made neither UNK the other
the husbands property will go to his side of the family the wife's property will go to her side of the family which doesn't matter if there are children cos obviously the children are both
it matters much more if you haven't got children you're talking about brothers and sisters and all their children
if you've got a will however the elder dies first which is why we have these twenty eight day clauses you know the man is sixty the wife is fifty five and they're both killed together
there's a will and the man left everything to his wife she will get it all if we haven't put in this clause which technically says leave it all to my wife if she UNK for twenty eight days
it's to cover just these circumstances where there can be something like a car crash
but does it matter as when you think that she may not have made a will because then everything will go to her er next of UNK as one says intestacy rules
and if it's for instance a second marriage husband's side of the family could be missing out all together
even if it's a first marriage the husband's side of the family would miss out altogether
but then you've got that bit at the bottom
property owned as joint tenants goes to the younger
now joint tenants is a legal term sensible place to describe it as it's come up which is what husband and wife often own property as
buying a house husband and wife will usually
as a joint UNK it should be explained to you
the alternative way of holding property is as tenants in common
the best of describing it is if you are joint tenants say it's a house and there's of you both own all the property
one of you dies the remaining one still owns all the property cos he or she always has done so and therefore it belongs to that person
if you're tenants in common you will each own half the property or such UNK as been agreed
one of dies the other one still only owns half the property and therefore the half of the one who's died can be left by will or go under an intestacy
if it's something like a bank account the indication is who can draw it out
you have a bank account where either of you can sign one dies the other can still sign and therefore it belongs entirely to that survivor
if it's a bank account where you've both got to sign before you can draw the money one dies the other can't draw it out because you can't have two signatures so it's tenants in common and it would be split in accordance with whatever the agreed UNK were
so there's a UNK in that
easier to have wills
just going back to the intestacy thing you started with
mhm
if it's the joint ownership of the first type you described there
joint tenants yes
yeah and also joint bank accounts
yes
does the seventy five thousand only operate on stuff beyond that
yes if you have well it's the same whether it's an intestacy or a will
if it's jointly owned property as joint tenants it will pass to the survivor
therefore y it does not matter whether there is will or not because it passes to the survivor independently of what a will may say
whether it's a will whether it's an intestacy the survivor takes because the survivor can deal with it in the way that i've described
and therefore it doesn't matter what the will may have said erm i mean it doesn't matter what the intestacy may be er that survivor takes it and it goes to the survivor outside of the will and you do not deal with it
the er i shall pull back slightly on that comment in that if it's jointly owned property it's outside the will you therefore don't have to prove the will to deal with that property but if it is a large estate and you are dealing with other assets when you do your inland revenue account you also have to refer to property you may have had the power of dealing while you were alive and that would include jointly owned property
so if you're doing an inland revenue account for the tax man in other words inheritance tax and you've got the bank account in joint names with thirty thousand in it
he'll want to know about half that bank account fifteen thousand pounds
but if you don't have to contact the inland revenue because you don't need to prove the will because the estate is too small then you don't have to tell him about the jointly owned property
it's erm an area where two elements of the law don't quite meet UNK and for instance if you worth four hundred thousand pounds big figure and you had a hundred thousand of it in your own name and three hundred thousand jointly with your wife die er you die your estate for UNK purposes is a hundred thousand pounds
that's what you've got to prove a will for the three hundred thousand pounds has gone to your surviving spouse as a jointly owned property
hundred thousand pounds you do not have to submit an inland revenue account therefore you don't need to tell them about the three hundred thousand pounds and therefore you won't pay inheritance tax
but if your figure was above hundred and twenty five thousand pounds you'd have to fill int an inland revenue account
you'd put your hundred and twenty five thousand pounds down you'd also put down half of the jointly owned property because you could have dealt with that while you were alive and you'll end up paying large amounts of inheritance tax
and th it's a it's a it's a strange situation but if you've got a smaller estate you'll get away with it and if you've a larger one you've got to tell them about it
and there's absolutely no provision for erm UNK that
it's just a fact
right we preparing
how does the inland revenue police the system whereby if your estate is to
mm
small to need to go to them
yeah
who decides it's too small
there are specific l levels
when you apply for a grant be it by way of proving a will or of administration which is when there is an intestacy part of the er documentation is an UNK where you swear as to the size of the estate
you have to swear usually that it's under a hundred and twenty five thousand pounds
if that is the case you don't have to complete and inland revenue account
if it's above a hundred and twenty five thousand pounds you do have to complete that account and you won't get the grant from the UNK until you have done that
on top of that they have a random check system whereby a number of estates are UNK
essentially they will send a form out saying you've recently got a grant estate you've said it's worth say twenty five thousand pounds we're checking up please let us have a list of assets and UNK
so it's a sort of spot check to see how things go
who UNK the UNK
the executor or UNK
if it's a will it's the executor or the one executor of the number of them who are proving it
if it's an administration i e there's no will it's the er next of UNK which in this context is the person next entitled to the estate so surviving spouse or surviving children if there isn't a spouse
and if the solicitor got it wrong it's the executor who takes the blame
it depends what it is that's wrong
erm it's the UNK job to administer the will but if it's known that there's a mistake of course the executor on behalf of the estate can sue the solicitor
mistake is obvious like one estate i'm dealing with which is a half home made will i e it wasn't made by a solicitor i suspect it was made by a barrister i suspect it was a barrister who was born abroad
and it left three halves of the residual estate
since we can't find out who did actually make it we can't sue anybody for all the costs that involved in trying put it right
but if a solicitor had made it and put three halves we could take an action against that solicitor or the executor could to erm for the costs of going to court to find out what on earth the will meant
national curriculum key stage one
not good ones i hope
and so you've going to see a solicitor you know what assets you've got you know who your family and UNK are
in theory you can leave your estate to who ever you like
UNK home your UNK round the corner one of the children and not the others however you like
in practice if you don't take proper account of who is entitled erm there will be proceedings after you've gone
you've got to have in mind who are your family and UNK
if you're keeping your spouse because you have the assets and he or she doesn't there's no good leaving nothing to the spouse unless that spouse is rich in his or her own right rich in comparative terms then there may be good reasons not to live him or her anything because you'd rather leave it to the children
again we're saving the inheritance tax as i mentioned
that'll be okay
children it's usually UNK to leave it to children but not every family UNK that there are circumstances that UNK against
the classic one of the UNK daughter who stays at home to look after parents for instance
that's an UNK daughter that you should be giving due recognition to for the efforts that she may have put in
you may have a handicapped child who has special needs who er has a requirement for extra resources you should think of that
erm you shouldn't forget the children round the corner that your wife doesn't know about or your husband doesn't know about
they're young and you're still maintaining them when you're alive you can't pretend that they don't exist when the will comes along
because if they don't know about it the mother or the father of that child will no doubt be coming along screaming i've been getting twenty five pounds a week for the last ten years and i've child on my own now
er it's surprising how things come out in wills that have been kept quiet
during the lifetime of the UNK
these people all need to be given thought
if you've given thought to them and excluded them that's fine as long as you've made it clear
husband or wife do get excluded for instance because the marriage has not been a particularly happy one erm and there would therefore be no particular one why the UNK would leave anything to UNK erm but it's worth saying so if that's the case to prevent an action coming along and saying UNK why am i not being there why have i been left out
you also need to have in mind having decided who's getting everything who's going to do it all for you
your will tells y the world what your wishes are somebody's got to carry your wishes out
that person or persons are your executors
difference between executors and administrators i've mentioned it briefly before executors are carrying out the will administrators are dealing with an estate where there is no will
you can have anyone you like as your executor
it's not a position where a number of people have the idea that it can't be a beneficiary it can it often is a beneficiary for the obvious reason that if the beneficiaries are getting the UNK why not make them do the work necessary to get hold of them
simple as that
but there are often good reasons why the beneficiary and the executors are not the same
first of all of course is your spouse
why not appoint him or her that may be sensible the younger you are the more sensible it is
when you come to retirement age whilst not suggesting that you are past it you are planning ahead for the time where you may not be quite as capable as were
if your not your spouse may not be either
so yes your spouse might be getting all your assets but if you're going o be seventy five or eighty by the time you've gone and your spouse is seventy four or seventy nine or whatever he or she may be a little bit past the running around that's necessary the actual UNK of it
if you've got children let them do the work survive the parents erm as long as they're the sensible sort who can do it and aren't going to fall out with parents and are going to be round
but that's the sort of thing you have in mind have someone who's a bit younger than yourself
erm because it is an UNK task erm UNK in terms of the time that needs spending doing the job even if it's relatively simple in terms of what needs to be done it still takes time and there's still running around to do
not everyone unfortunately has children so you may have to cast around for other members of the family
brothers sisters they're the same age as you more or less not necessarily a good idea
UNK and UNK might be a better bet erm those are the sort of people have in mind
you might have to go outside the family it could be next door neighbours or friends from work or social club or wherever
when you're getting outside the family you've got to be careful to make sure that they are people that are prepared to do the job that they understand what's involved because you cannot force anyone to be an executor
just by naming them doesn't commit them to do anything they may say well he never asked me i'm not doing that
and you've got difficulties because there they are appointed executor they're not doing their job nobody else there to do the job somebody's got to sort that out
so do think of that
and then at the end of the day not everybody has even friends or neighbours that they'd want to impose on
or be involved in
they don't think that they'd want to know
or should want to know
you may need to turn to professional advice
solicitors accountants banks perhaps
i'll go through those
if you've got a business you've probably got an accountant
a sensible choice simply because he or she will know a lot about your financial affairs in any event and therefore is going to know what to look for and how to deal with it
solicitors well they will know something about your affairs possibly because of hav to dealing with houses other difficulties you may have come across form time to time
banks yes you deal with banks and er they know a lot about your affairs because you've got your bank account and it goes through their hands and the know all about that
but then banks is expensive banks is
steer clear of banks is my advice
i don't how many of you have seen or heard reference to the recent which report about estates and managing that
it's typical which problems with wills i think it was called and then it came in the paper as where there's a will there's a bill
nice headline isn't it
it rings if there wasn't a will there wouldn't be a bill perhaps
where as in fact if there isn't a will the bill is usually bigger
and in the typical sort of way that lawyers get knocked these days erm we get UNK in with other people and the mud flies
er reading this article or at least the heading from it and the bit in the paper you got the impression that solicitors were as bad as banks
read it in detail and you find that most of the examples given related to banks and there was one relating to a solicitor
i'm sure that they could have found other examples where solicitors were not doing the job very well and were charging a lot of money because let's be realistic there are good solicitors and there are bad solicitors and i wouldn't pretend otherwise
i meet some of the bad ones er and see the work UNK they do and i agree UNK things aren't quite as they should be
but i've not yet met a bank who's good at it
not necessarily in terms of the way the job is done but in the cost banks really are expensive if you're minded to use a bank they do publish their UNK they say they give them out to people i suspect that it gets forgotten sometimes the principle is there the isn't
study their rates and then decide to throw them into touch and get somebody else to do it
because i used to say a solicitor would only cost half what a bank would
looking at what the examples given by which are concerned the solicitor was only charging about thirty percent of what the bank would
and it may have still seemed a lot of money at i think one thousand seven hundred and fifty pounds i can't comment or not having seen the size of the estate but it UNK quite well with the five thousand one hundred and sixty pound five UNK five thousand seven hundred and sixteen pounds that the midland bank charge on the particular estate
looking at this lot UNK six thousand and seventy two
lloyds five seven six midland four six two nine UNK west four six four nine seven solicitor one seven fifty
well one thousand seven hundred and fifty might seem like a lot of money but there actually is quite a lot of work in dealing with an estate
and i wouldn't say that was an unreasonable charge
erm it suggests that you should never appoint a solicitor or a bank for the reasons of cost
there i can't say that is right you should never appoint a
occasionally i even recommend a bank if you should work for a bank you can get the job done for practically nothing i understand and it might be worthwhile
er and solicitors well they're there the point is about the solicitors among other things they can er UNK when you have the sort of family who are going to UNK and i'm afraid people do have families that are going to fall out
not everybody does but there are some who do
if you've got an independent person doing the work they can say well we don't mind what you're doing falling out among yourselves the will says this and this is what we're going to do
and they can make sure that the wishes are properly carried out
they will of course charge for doing the job but if you appoint somebody else as an executor and that person goes to see a solicitor the solicitor will also be charging for the job
the mere fact that they are appointed executor does not of itself increase the size of the bill
on the one hand you're giving them extra responsibility so yes the bigger might be bigger for that reason
but on the other hand they're not having to deal so much with another executor there isn't there hasn't got to be so much to and fro correspondence and therefore the workload will be somewhat less and that's likely to balance the extra responsibility element
so that the bill i would es estimate if you have a solicitor as executor would be the same as if you had a private person as ex as executor who went to see that solicitor
what those costs may be i'm afraid i can't give you a good guide because depend on the amount of work
if you leave a complicated estate with lots of bits here there and everywhere and your affairs in mess and the solicitor's got to sort out he's going to have to do a lot of work for it
whether you leave a lot of money or not
the size of the estate is a relevant consideration but no the only consideration
a big estate will cost you more than an identical but small estate because there is the responsibility element of it
there's the fact that if he gets it wrong he's lost more money and therefore his you might say UNK risk is a higher one
i'm not saying that he will get it wrong or that he'll lose you the money but that's the responsibility of
can i ask another question
mm
if in the course of erm a will being proved and
yeah
things coming to UNK
mhm
and to raise money say to pay erm this forty percent tax
mhm
share UNK have to be sold
if they made a sale at a certain price
right
and just a couple of days later shares are UNK
yeah
and they sold at a very low price and
mhm
a few days later there they were at a very high price
mhm
is the person doing the selling guilty of any irresponsible acts
erm right
if it's known that they're up and down like
yeah
this
first thing is that they wouldn't actually be able to do that for the reasons you've stated
shares would be in the name of the UNK therefore can't be dealt with until you've got the grant to prove that you can deal with them
therefore you can't sell them to raise the money to pay the tax because you've got to pay the tax before you can get the grant
so in that context the argument wouldn't arise therefore any sale of the shares would take place after you've got hold of the grant and it may be necessary for other reasons like you've got bills to pay or a mortgage to discharge whatever the reasons
erm the answer would be no they've got to be sold at sometime and nobody knows what the market is going to do
in practice if there are beneficiaries who are capable of being consulted it's likely that one will say to those beneficiaries right we need to raise some money there's only the shares to do it with we're proposing to sell them do you agree with that or would you prefer to have the shares and gives us some money
and then you've consulted somebody else and if the say no go ahead and sell the shares and if two days later they've gone through the roof it's unfortunate
it's just a fact nobody could predict it and there for nobody would be liable
if they didn't consult
they would leave themselves open to
criticism
yes
just in time
they'd leave themselves open to some criticism erm because the beneficiaries of whoever otherwise may be entitled to the shares may have said i would like to have those shares
but they do actually have the power UNK that the will is appropriately worded to sell for any of the assets
and as long as their not acting in bad faith or er knowledge of a likely increase
you're unlikely to be able to do anything about it
yeah
it happens erm i've handled a case myself where shares were valued at a particular amount on the death and er in due course they needed to be sold as part of the administration unfortunately they'd gone down er a fair amount in the mean time
erm b but there was no reason why we should sit in wait in case they might go up because they might have gone down further
beneficiary didn't want the shares so we sold the shares and there's no good time you know unfortunately none of us has crystal balls where the market is concerned
good point then
you say you've got to pay tax before you get the grant of UNK but you might need the grant of UNK before you can pay the tax
yes
so what happens then
you've consulted a solicitor by now i hope
erm if you're trying to do it yourself and in theory you can just
erm it's one of life's UNK there are of course answers which solicitors should know about
number one is that if there are national savings of any sort they can be UNK to pay tax
erm you have to be in touch with the national savings and they send the money direct so you don't actually get your hands on it
but that's one way round that's possible
then there are the banks who will always be ready to lend you money to can it up so that it can pay
they may want security er one case i've been UNK dealing with they wanted the share certificates UNK by way of some security for instance
but banks unfortunately do charge negotiating fee and then interest at exciting rates erm solicitors will do it sometimes we've done it for clients where we know that it's not too large an amount and we know that there are assets easily obtained because that way the client saves the banks administration fee
we still charge the same interest rate that the bank would do because of course it's costing us that from the bank on our own funds
but done it up to two or three thousand pounds for an estate knowing that it
evaluation
you always need a UNK gift
one rather exciting will home made will i UNK to add i dealt with last year the lady of some who was not getting on with her husband and i think although i'm not absolutely sure that the handwriting is that of her sister and we have this form filled in and it mentioned the bank or special savings account and it mentioned the premium bonds and it mentioned everything in the back bedroom and the linen in the linen and the linen cupboard because she'd brought all this lot and it failed to appoint an executor and it failed to deal with the UNK estate it meant that technically there was a partial intestacy as there was a partial intestacy the rules applied to that first person to inherit
her surviving spouse the one she'd obviously done everything to make sure he didn't get a penny
second thing was that having covered absolutely everything she wasn't any estate or at least didn't appear to be any so the surviving spouse wasn't very interested in taking out a grant anyway cos it wasn't going to get him any funds so we then have the job of doing what's called UNK him and basically he UNK his right to be of the UNK and we then had to go under the rules to find the next person which was one of the specific beneficiaries i e the sons
in fact we turned up some gas shares on the way but er and a bit of cash but that wasn't enough to pay the funeral accounts and she made no provision for paying any of the bills so i sold the gas shares towards paying the funeral account and then got shouted at by the er beneficiary children because i hadn't consulted them about selling the gas shares and i said well they have to be sold because there's bills to pay and there is no way of dealing with that
in the end part of there specific UNK had to be used to pay the balance of bills but there was a complaint about how long it had taken to sort out and it taken long to sort out because it was a home made will that didn't make all the right provisions
er a and with a family row in it as well you can imagine the work involved was a bit more than initially might have been expected and i got criticized because the bill was bigger than i had first estimated cos i didn't expect there'd be trouble from the father
so all that for the sake of paying thirty pounds or thirty five pounds to go and see a solicitor and make a will
is it any reason why you shouldn't express it in percentage terms say twenty percent to this thirty percent to that ten percent to
in theory there isn't in practice it depends how you word the rest of it
er we're talking about UNK estate here and if you've made specific er gifts
say you are leaving some to a named person you have left that person say ten percent
you've got to make provision if that person doesn't survive you because if the person doesn't survive you ten percent of your UNK not been dealt with
so you would be UNK towards the ten percent
what you actually do is not put it in percentage but in shares
so if you gave that person ten shares gave ninety shares to somebody else it's a hundred percent in total but if that person then dies cos you don't want any of his relatives to have it then there's only the ninety shares remaining and ninety shares will be one hundred percent
because you don't know how big a share is until you know how many people are sharing it
i see
so you get away with that way but percentages is a phrase to avoid very in a will shares
i though my UNK will was that yeah
percentages you know
exactly that
percentage of a fixed got there
shares is a how many people are there dividing a share is
big or small depending on whether it's between two people or twenty people
thanks
and that's the way around that little er again it's something that you'll doesn't occur to you until it's come upon you you've dealt with it and you've realized it is a problem
and that's what solicitors should be doing
erm
if you have more than one executor
yeah
can you have an either or
suppose you had three
mm
and can you make it so that two out of the three can deal with it
i'm thinking of people someone shall we say er well i i've got two sons one lives locally and one lives a long way away
mm
an
you c you can er you can in fact have up to er you can find in you ex in your will as many people as you like but no more than four executors can prove at any one time
erm so what i have to is an executor appointed provided he lived in the country for instance because his address was abroad at the time
what you would do in your case with children is probably appoint them all and then they don't all have to prove so they would hopefully discuss this at the time and say well you know i'm a long way away why don't you two get on with
or the fall out about it they could still all three prove
so you should make the decision in the first place
if they're abroad i suggest you leave them out if they're still in the country i suggest you can leave them in
a lot of it's done through the post anyway
mm
well i was taking your point about you know o wives about being the same sort of age
yeah
erm suppose i UNK my wife and two children
could do
erm but any two out of that
yes what i it's usual to say is that i desire or direct that no more than two should prove it
erm i put that in practice it's a bit unnecessary because it is not UNK
and even if it were UNK and there's three how would you decide which two of the three could do the job
the either they're all going to agree and there's no problem anyway or they're not going to agree in which case you saying they've got to be two rather than three isn't going to help the situation
er but yes you could put your wife and two children and if your wife is fit to do it she can do it if she isn't the two children can do it instead or her and one of the children to help each other out
it's always a good idea ti have more than one executor because you don't know that your executor is going to survive you
mm
even if it's one of your children
children die before parents unfortunately and have wills i let everything to my mother i leave everything to my son
son died first the mother died five weeks later we had wonderful fun getting that one sorted out
just another example of how things can go
one thing you can put in your will as well is your funeral arrangements
some people are concerned about it and want to put specific details in
although i do put details of funeral arrangements in will in connection with buried or UNK in practice it's much better that you tell your intending executors what's intended because sometimes the will isn't even opened until after the funeral
and if you haven't told people it may get
one or two points now about the UNK of making a will
if you've got some better idea of what's going to go in the wills
straight forward thing is you need to be of sound mind that's not difficult
er
seriously it's not difficult
you've practically got to be committed under the mental health act before you're not sound enough to make a will
that or so er suffering form UNK or loss your memory that you can't remember who you ought to have in mind
you can be UNK and still make a will that
all you really have to do is to know what you have in terms of assets and to know who you ought to have in mind in terms of your nearest and UNK
on my experience dealing with people is however UNK they get you know nursing homes or residential homes or whatever and they can't really remember from one corresponding conversation to the next they still remember that they've got two children and that they own a bank account
good enough to make a will
the children can't make wills cos in law they're not of sound mind until they're eighteen and adults so any will supposed to be made by somebody aged fifteen which isn't going to be a will
it's in writing because it's got to be identified by somebody and your not around to say
it's no good telling the children you can have the grandfather clock when i go it's with the will
and indeed as people get old or ill i find again from personal experience that they tend to give things to several people
comes along and come along i was promised this oh i was promised this as well
tough it's not in the will and neither of you were getting it
it's no good until it's written down
written and signed by you and it's witnessed by some independent witnesses
now these are very important
they must be independent not mention in the will you can't have a beneficiary who's a witness you can't have a husband or wife of a beneficiary as a witness either because not i'm told very first clause there aren't to get a UNK made bungalow or something like that he might be missing out on the bungalow and the was the course leader at the time told me the story that saw him and he wouldn't tell me who it was i want my ten percent commission
put it down to just a useful
erm so witnesses er can't be beneficiaries and they must be there at the same time
they've got to see you sign the will or at least acknowledge it and in practice see you sign they don't need to know what's in the will they just want to see you sign but they've got to be there it's no good up the road as one witness did for not for me to her husband who was working in his shop witnessed the signature afterwards
i only found that one out by mistake because there were two dates on the will check it out when it was done
and they just happily told me that oh i just took it up the road for my husband to witness the signature and that totally UNK the whole will
will and that didn't please some people i can assure you
er wills are UNK
marriage UNK a will divorce doesn't UNK a will but divorce does have consequences
divorce has unfortunate consequences because of the way they worded the act
the UNK can't get a straight piece of legislation through
it says in the act something like divorce any gift to a spouse quote is of no effect unquote
but there are big problems that arise there because of this practice of having leave it to my spouse if she UNK twenty eight days
that's a UNK gift divorce makes it that gift is UNK but she may still survive therefore the condition would apply and therefore the subsequent er provisions that you've made in a will don't apply because they can only apply if the wife UNK twenty eight days but that's ignored
and that's an effect of statute so if you are getting your divorce make a new will
it's the easy way round that one
but marriage UNK it entirely and the law is straight forward on that
new marriage new spouse intestacy rules spouse is the nearest and gets the first lot so it UNK that having got married you want that spouse to have what you've got
of course it may not be the case cos spouse may be well off but you need to make a new will
more or less with what's a good will and who you have to have in mind and UNK of the estate and being tax effective so that
er if you get it wrong erm there's the inheritance provision for family and UNK act nineteen eighty five which is the statutory provision allowing you spouse who left nothing to all those children who left nothing to make applications to the court
they've got six months from the grant to do that
executors we've dealt with and expenses alterations i've just dealt with er oh if you want to change you mind and remember a will is only a piece of paper until you die you can change your mind as often as you like i have made a will in the past four wills in one year for one of my clients his right he's perfectly entitled to do that er and it's better that you alter it frequently if your circumstances change than that you don't be aware of how things go in the way that you don't want them do
but what you can't do is cross things out or add things one they won't be effective
any alterations to will a will have to be UNK in the same way as the will itself
so you've got to witness it sorry you've got to sign it you've got to have your signature witnessed
it's therefore nearly always better to make a new will
if you're crossing somebody out even if you er alter it and initial it someone will know they've been crossed out
if you make a UNK leaving somebody out they'll still see the original will somebody will know that you've changed your mind
it's better to make a new will then they don't know what you had in before and nobody's there to argue or question it
if for any reason you need to UNK your will urgently and there are occasions when it comes about you need to destroy it
burn it tear it up or both
don't just put a line through it saying UNK that's not good enough
er and rush off and make a new will as soon as you can as well as
what about
sorry
what about the
a copy is not of itself a will and therefore even if the copy is kicking around er that won't effect the matter
the only problem will arise if somebody thinks you've simply lost a will which does occasionally happen and then they turn to the copy to try and prove it
so if you've a copy you ought to destroy that if it's with the solicitor you should notify them
but again if you make a new will you've got new dates on that problem is less likely to come about
now time is nearly on us but i'm just going to rapidly refer you to procedures on death
actually i see another little bit that i haven't covered for us who's going to make a will but i think i've dealt with that
do see a solicitor cost is likely to be thirty pounds upwards
upwards depends on how complicated you want it to be
husband and wife together sixty pounds upwards
thirty five for an ordinary one you know everything to my spouse or most of it to the spouse with bits to the children er well r we usually run to about thirty five pounds
not a lot of cost compared to what it will cost if you don't make a will and there are UNK or if you make a home made will and there are UNK
putting it right will cost always a lot more than making your will
making a will with a solicitor also has the advantage of that you'll have a copy he's likely to look after it for you if you want him to
your copy will say where it is less likely to get lost people will know because he'll have a copy and can tell your beneficiaries to go an see a solicitor
all that for a very modest price
erm UNK or rather procedure on death because UNK is proving a will in the latin if there's no will it's letters of administration which is a similar procedure except that the will speaks from death and therefore your appointment of the executors is effective from death and therefore your appointment of executors is effective from death they can do certain things even before they've proven the will which administrators can't do cos they don't have the power until they've proved that they're the people entitled
check that the will is valid of course
find out all the details of the assets
assets are frozen you can't get your hands on them on the whole until you've got your grant of UNK or you've made UNK if it's a small will
apply for your grant i've dealt with that
inland revenue accounts
er UNK the papers basically saying who you are that this is the will er that er the person's died of course er a and that you're the person entitled to be a
having got that grant it goes round everybody banks building societies insurance companies and so on and they'll send declaration forms or withdrawal forms to the assets the assets and pay the UNK it's your job to that
it's your job to deal with tax
inheritance tax income tax as well is often a return that you needs making
more often than not you get a refund cos of course you have personal allowances for a whole year but you've not er not er lived a whole year as often as not and therefore there usually UNK over the twelve months and you've paid a bit too much tax if you've died in the course of the twelve months
pay the debts
that's an UNK responsibility
so you need to make sure you know about all the debts which is why if you ever read the papers some never understand why people read the public notices columns but they are read and you see notice about so and so who's died
that's so that a e anybody who's owed money by that UNK person they can put in a claim
cos if it's been advertised and they haven't put in a claim the executors are safe to distribute the estate
legal costs come out of the estate they're not an UNK personal responsibility but on the other hand an executor is not entitled to charge for the work that he does
or she
er UNK for expenses so petrol UNK that sort of thing but the time of running around you can't get back which is one of the factors that back to the old which magazine they never deal with this say yes you can deal with it and i read some person that says it only took me forty hours yes forty hours at legal rates well that would be a big bill
if a solicitor took as long as forty hours over it
so executors can't get their own er time paid for
and that really i think is about it unless there are interpretation of as much as i'm going to
unless there are any other questions that i've not dealt with yet
who's UNK sorry
who's liable to pay the funeral expenses
the funeral expenses are
not enough money to
if there's not enough money social services
you connect them and they have arrangement with funeral directors to get them on the cheap
er they're still proper funerals but they basically bulk buying so the cost will be typically about
no i've been on one and they do it properly
erm private arrangements
but it is a first charge on the estate
er and it's one of the things that people still worry about
could i just come in there and i do know an undertaker and this subject did come up in conversation
yeah
and he said oh he says never worry about that he said nobody in my
of course
now they don't like bodies lying around UNK so the UNK are always open for that
yeah i there's been some correspondence in the financial papers about the family trusts er and particularly with regard to inheritance tax and so
yeah
are they worth while for relatively small sums you know you talked about ten thousand over the hundred and fifty
no
family trusts are the latest moves by er financial advisors and insurance people to sell you policies
essentially you pay for f funds into a trust and create a family trust whereby you or your spouse can be beneficiary and so can children
it's so written so that it's UNK it doesn't form part of your estate and therefore it UNK inheritance tax that way
erm but of course if you die within seven years it could indeed be added back into your estate so i think that they also build a certain amount of life insurance against that and essentially what you do is you one of the schemes is you pay insurance against the amount of the tax bill seven years
er if you have a lot of money they can be a good idea er in that it takes capital out of your estate to provide income say children or spouse
but if you haven't got that amount of capital it takes capital out of your hands and you can't spend it in five years time if you need it because you've given it away effectively forever
i mean you can't UNK the money the back if you get a bit short in five or ten years time
i've heard some solicitor say he's a great believer in your looking after yourself the kids will understand
i put it stronger than that sometimes i say you know why worry about them
erm you've given them a good start in life it's your money enjoy yourselves with it
that's what you worked all your for you've not worked to pass on that amount to your kids
you know if you die and you've from the bank says you'll get buried anyway
spend it on yourselves
your will is only for those which you can't get rid of because you can't get rid of everything
er but yes people worry about leaving it to their children don't bother
you know they're either set up now you've given them an education and thrown them on the world UNK it now they'll only UNK it when they get their hands on it you might as well UNK it on yourselves let the kids UNK it for you
if you do have any other questions i'm stopping for a cup of tea so do please approach me quietly if you need some
on that rather delicate level
right can you have a look at those just have at the answers to this
did you find any difficulties at all
n no i don't
it looks all right from here
yeah
keep the UNK paper if you need it
that's all right
yes that's okay that's fine
hang on
oh yes alright from there
how did you come to that conclusion
what
the petrol station the petrol station isn't it
mm
mm five minutes
it's five minutes and fifteen
i UNK the
that's okay
in the first fifteen minutes of the journey yeah er what's fifteen minutes as part of an hour
quarter of a hour
quarter of an hour
that's point two five
mm
you can't
mm
you can't have time as a decimal time is not a decimal
mm
okay
i can't remember what it's called it's in sixties whatever that is
mhm
yeah
s time is not a decimal so you can't operate time as a decimal
nobody ever used to make that mistake at one time you know why
no
because everything worked was wasn't in decimal
mm
all the distances were in UNK
mm
and for and weights were in UNK so
aha
nobody ever thought about anything being a decimal
mhm
so nobody had any problems with that
no of course that everything's de you know everything's decimal time
yeah
becomes quite an awkward calculation
it didn't used to be
it didn't not been UNK
same constant speed
so you work the same the constant speed
yeah w shouldn't matter
yeah
that's fine
aha
doesn't make any difference at all that doesn't
erm so you would have done er yeah then you've got you've got your speed of distance over time correctly
mm
or time is distance over speed
it's all right but you've then gone that's not nought point two five minutes the UNK per hour
isn't it
mm
the speed is per hour isn't it
so that would have been point two five which should have been fifteen minutes
yes that's UNK of an hour
which is point two five of an hour
be very careful with your
mm
units
yeah
that's
mm
the UNK fine what you've UNK fine just UNK
put the wrong
the units up
yeah
right
so that's how many minutes earlier
now you've not done that you've actually done his journey time
mm
mm
so careful read the question
you must read the question
alright how're you getting on with them
or have i stopped you
didn't know what i'm supposed to be doing with that
your supposed to be doing them rotate them through do this one first
how do you mean them
hundred and eighty degree rotation around c
doing it do you mean drawing it on using this drawing it
yeah
you've done UNK and UNK and so forth haven't you
mm
mhm
that UNK a hundred and eighty degrees about that
mm
brought it by isn't it
but i know what to do i don't know what you want me to do
i want it i want it shown as a hundred and eighty degree rotation
there's an exam question rotate that
yeah
about that point the UNK through a hundred and eighty degrees
mm
four
what your not so fine
yeah
okay yes good
that's alright
use the patterns to write down the a three
a three is that
a four lets have a look
is it done
no i haven't done anything yet i'm on
look
i can't do it
i can't
you haven't done UNK have you
yeah i have but i don't how to do them like this i've not seen it been d drawn out like that
right draw something from the centre of rotation to the figure
mm
rotate that bit through a hundred and eighty degrees where's it go
over here
over there
there's a hundred
yes
and eighty innit
trace the original
yes
mm
round the centre of rotation it to the spoke while she's up the other spoke
dum
mm
mm
right
yeah
yeah
it's as simple as that
isn't it
go on then
as if you've drawn
have you got a pencil
no i was looking at the other one
no i want it actually done i want you
to physically do 'em
right erm
so they go into your brain
mm
via your eyes and
finger ends and so forth
mhm
okay
mhm
i suppose i should put UNK right okay UNK equations
yeah
with some degree of er success i trust this time
i think i UNK number one up
ah dear
yes you did
you know why
no
you made the classic mistake the only mistake there is here you multiply everything by two
mm
so that's twenty six
mm
that's the only i mean that's th that's the real problem with this thing it's one the difficulties you end up with you see you must remember to multiply everything that's there by the number you want to multiply not just half of it
and that's all the problem is
i think i've done the others right
yes that looks alright
yeah
well you can always tell can't you
how do you tell
st just stick
go back and check it
the numbers back in
just put the numbers back in
yeah it's alright
yeah it's alright
you see you managed to plough through these quite r readily did you
sort of
ah
what on UNK that question
two a plus
oh it's an a is it
oh i beg your pardon sorry
i changed it to
that's al that's alright that's alright i'm with that
i understand what you're doing it's a UNK
it's a little like as and bs
er it doesn't make any difference does it
no but i'm used to xs and UNK
yes but a yeah that's alright erm except for examples we where do up to
ten
up to ten
yes
have a go at fourteen and sixteen
whilst i sit here and admire your expertise and
ha
general facility at this subject
mm
and say to yourself
nine seven nine c plus
yep
or four y minus nine
yeah
which is probably as good
thirteen
thirteen is right
twenty six
that's okay
y equals
y equals what're you gonna do
divide it
yeah whoa
right it's two isn't it
mm
okay
substitute that back in
yes that's right
yes
do number seventeen
but i haven't done sixteen
just do number seventeen i fancy seventeen better than number sixteen
mhm you would
i know
i have this great in built desire to make people suffer
there's an easier way of doing it isn't there
what get rid of the UNK
yes
mm
suppose so
yeah there is there's an awful lot of suppose so about that you only gonna do one set of calculations rather than two aren't you
yeah
you must look at this from the minimum of point of view of the minimum amount of labour
yeah
equals twenty six
no it doesn't
i beg your pardon yes it does
mm
yes it does
you're right
that's right
and x equals
thirty three
yeah
alright we need to bother a i know you i know you can do UNK
yeah thing about it is though when you're looking at this you wanna be looking as to which is the produces the smallest numbers
mm
and which produces the minimum amount of UNK and that was that the second one wasn't it
yeah
you had much less to do than anything else
mm
right that's unfortunate
that i l i've forgotten to bring the other work
however
can i can i just interrupt and say i've forgotten
i'm sorry is that enough
yes
thank you
UNK funny
yeah
now look it asks you for a certain number of things it says as the average doesn't it
how
yes
do you work t an average
average is all the tests added together
yeah
divide by the number of tests he had
that's right
so what's the total for all his test
hundred and twenty six
hundred and twenty six how many tests had he had
x
x
so the average is going to be
hundred and twenty five divide by x
hundred an is it a hundred and twenty five
twenty six
hundred and twenty six divided by x is that
yeah
so what's difficult about that
nothing
so
now there's another two tests
yeah
so what's the total now
hundred and twenty eight divide by
where's a hundred and twenty eight come from
what's the total marks for the next two tests
oh
you're told what the marks are for the next two tests UNK
oh nine and eight
nine and eight aren't they
yeah
so what's the total marks for the now for the tests
how many marks you got all together
hundred and twenty thirty forty two
mm
what's a hundred and twenty six plus nine
no
what's a hundred and twenty six plus nine
come on what's nine add six
hundred and thirty six
o what's nine add six
eleven
nine add six
oh fourteen
and another one
six
fifteen yeah
yes
six and nine it's always one less when innit when you're adding nine
so it's fifteen do it's a hundred and twenty six plus nine is
hundred and thirty forty
i want a hundred and twenty six plus nine
oh a hundred and twenty a hundred and thirty five
hundred and thirty five
what's five and eight
not
thirteen
thirteen so the UNK gonna be a hundred and
forty three
hundred and forty three
you know what the a en end UNK gonna be every time i don't you
yeah
mm
hundred and forty three
that's right so the UNK a hundred and forty three
so what's the what's the average gonna be or even the mean
hundred and forty three divide by
by
x plus two
splendid
can we have it written down like real UNK
ah wonderful
wonderful
hundred and forty five
yes no i said a hundred and forty
forty three
three yes
over
divide by x plus two
plus two that's right
now what's the next part of the question say
if a if his average for the first x test was one greater than his average for
x plus two tests
plus two tests
use results of one and two
to form the equation and find the value of x
now what it just said think of another way of saying that
work out what x is
no you can't work out what x is you haven't got a c hope of working out wh
form an equation
form an equation
but what's one side of the equation going to be
hundred and twenty six divide by x
plus
hundred and UNK
no
plus two
no read what it says
if his average for the first x tests is one greater than the average sorry beg your pardon i've got it round me round me neck
if his average for the first x t is one greater than his average for the x plus two tests so a hundred and twenty six over x is gonna equal
what he got in the first
o in the second lot isn't it
plus one
mm
yes
so right it down
yeah come on
just write it down
hundred and UNK
what
what i've just told you hundred and twenty six over x is equal
hundred and forty three
three
divide by x plus two
yeah
plus one
yes
plus one
why is it plus one there
cos it's says it's this is one more than that isn't it
this is one more than that
so shouldn't that be plus one
how do you make them equal
oh yeah
yes think about it carefully
how do you make them equal
mm
that's right so
now what are you going to do
find the value of x
i'm an extremely patient soul as you well know but if you say find the value of x to me again how are you gonna find the value of x
what do you intend to do
get rid of the UNK
get rid of the UNK good
well done
go on then
is that right
no
what're you doing
what're you doing
UNK it by x
alright then times it by x
go on then if that's what you're doing go on
keep going
hold on a minute you've still got a this on the bottom haven't you
to start with come on
cos your multiplying by x go on you haven't cancelled it yet go on
carry on
eh
what are you doing
you can't do that
why
multiply everything by x go on
ju just do every term you've got multiply it by x
go on
i don't know how to do it though
course you do
just carry on multiplying things by x instead of trying to jump to conclusions
where's the two x come from
times it by
but you've got that over th on the bottom haven't you
it's x plus two there isn't it
it's got nothing to do when multiplying you're multiplying the top by x go on
that's better
that's right perfect
go on then get some stuff cancelled out
that's right
no
there's no way you can do that
but i've got an x on the top
aye but you've got an x plus two on the bottom
so if i put x minus two on the top
no it will not cancel
why not
you've got a hundred and forty three x over x plus two haven't you
hundred and forty three minus two
hundred and forty does not work
there's no way that works at all
just do what you've got there
write a hundred and twenty six
write a hundred and twenty six
that's right equals
hundred and forty three x over x plus two
that's right
plus x
that's perfect now what are you going to do
can i move across that across to this side
you can multiply everything through by x plus two yes
go on
bracket x plus two never mind about this s mm
equals that plus come on you're multiplying by x plus two
no you're multiplying by x plus two
you've missed a you've now dropped a plus sign out haven't you
and you've dropped an x out
why
you're multiplying this term by x plus two aren't you
you're
mm
gonna multiply everything by x plus x plus two
it just so happens that if multiply this term by x plus two you get rid of the x plus two at the bottom don't you
mm
but everything there it's the same thing as when you were doing this
the UNK equations wasn't it
why was it
you had to me s make sure that you multiply every term out haven't you
yeah
so here you've got to multiply every term out
do not forget that is a term on its own it's got n connected to this yet
no
you're a very careful about that so start getting it UNK up then
expand the brackets i think is probably the best thing
hundred and twenty six x
s x that's right
plus two hundred and fifty two
equals
hundred and forty three x
x
plus
x squared
x squared plus two x
that's right
right now things are getting a bit better aren't they
come on
what're you gonna do now
do all the xs on one side
well i'd collect the things together that were the same for a start i think
what d'you mean
well you've got some xs to collect together haven't you
oh
mm
that's better
that's UNK it
yeah
now s you can start you've still gotta get the every i would get everything over to one side of the equals sign
why
what's this
then use your UNK
this is a UNK isn't it
yes good
does it matter which way you put it
well i always like to read it from left to right but it doesn't matter really
yeah but i mean
you can do that if you want to
i would have put all the er
hundred and forty five x minus hundred and twenty six x
yes
plus x squared minus two five two
minus two five two
equals nothing
yes
so that's going to be
don't look at me like that
nineteen x
mhm
plus x squared
yeah
minus two five two
minus two five two equals nothing
equals nothing that's right
now if you're gonna do this you really want it in the form of x squared first don't you really to make it to make the thing easy to work aren't you
well that's gonna be your a
yeah it is
b and that's gonna be c
it's much be it's much better to see it as a square as x squared plus te nineteen x plus minus two five really
two five two equals nothing
right
formula
i don't know
you're gonna have some tremendously large numbers if you work the formula aren't you
yes
i mean b UNK nineteen squares you know just under four hundred isn't it
that's twenty times twenty
you imagine four times that
a lot
it's a lot isn't it
but they're only numbers
that's true
but perhaps it's easier i wonder what are other factors of two hundred and fifty two
one
one and two hundred and fifty two yes very good yes
two
yes good
we want a difference of nineteen somewhere don't we
that's easy
we drop the calculator everywhere
well you can drop the calculator if you want it would be better if you pick 'em up and stick the numbers in
how're you gonna do
two hundred and fifty two divide by nineteen
what you got
thirteen point two six three one five
yes
seven nine eight
yes
i don't think that's right
try the square root of two five two
fifteen point eight seven four five
yes a difference
don't know does sixteen go into it just try sixteen into two five two
fifteen point seven five
so we want something like erm seven and sixteen well that doesn't work sorry seven and twenty six
is that right
no
how about
no gives a difference of nineteen
use the formula then we're just sitting here wasting time
minus nineteen or minus b plus or minus the square root of b
minus b
plus or minus
plus or minus the square root of
the square root of b squared
plus
no
minus
minus two b c
minus four a c
four a c
all over
two a
two a is right
so what's a
it's an x
must be true
yes
i am delighted you agree
yeah
minus nineteen
yes
plus or minus
the square root of nineteen squared minus four times
nineteen squared minus four times
one
one
times
times two
no it's not times two five minus two five two
times minus two five two
lovely
all over
over two
two times one
yep
x squared
x equals not x squared
minus nineteen plus or minus
plus or minus can i do that
root
all in one
yeah
i can do it on here oops
hope so
square root of nineteen squared minus four times minus
minus
two five two
answer
nineteen UNK three hundred and ninety one i think
mm
three hundred and sixty one
really
three sixty one times eight thousand there's summat wrong
nineteen squared minus four times one
no it's minus it's plus it's nineteen squared plus eight nought one nought eight
mm
four time two five two
two hundred and fifty times four is a thousand two hundred and UNK
it's minus
it's minus times a minus isn't it
four
four times two th two five two is one thousand and eight isn't it
yes
two fifty times four is a thousand
so two five two times four is t one thousand and eight plus three hundred and UNK chunk three hundred and sixty one
mm
which is one three six nine
that's more like it
yeah but what about mm
above answer
mm
what about that
where do get that from
because what you did was you did er nineteen squared
yes
minus four
i don't know why i don't how that works
would that be in brackets
of course it is
i didn't put a brackets there
well you would have to although i would have though it might have worked UNK that's certainly wrong though
what did we say
one three six nine
nine
one three six nine yes
all over
er you want the square root of that
that's it all over two
two
yep so it's minus nineteen plus or minus
plus or minus
root one three six nine
square root
one three six nine
that's interesting
ah
yes go on
yeah it is isn't it
yes
go on then
you'll remember that
i will
thirty seven
so the f one answer is f fourteen
don't
just don't
it's not actually
one UNK nine innit
minus nought point five
yeah
and the other answer is
can you tell me how managed to produce nought point five how you managed to produce that
don't know
minus nineteen plus thirty seven without the aid of a calculator must be about eighteen mustn't it
mm
the difference between thirty seven and UNK about eighteen innit
approximately
divide that by two answer
nine
nine
mm
engage brain th you must regard a calculator
with the greatest and UNK of suspicion
cos it's not actually working UNK that calculator at the present moment i don't know what you've got it UNK in what you've got it at but it's not working UNK
now it might work
no unless we have to minus nineteen minus thirty seven divide by two minus twenty eight
yeah that's better
i wonder if minus
wait you've got minus fifty six haven't you here this is minus fifty six if you use your brain
and divided by two is minus twenty eight
yeah
yes minus twenty eight
now if you take the difference between nineteen and thirty seven you get the answer eighteen don't you
yes
you divide that by two you get the answer nine
nine
mm
but why isn't my calculator working
because you haven't got it in the correct mode it's not working UNK
which is in what function
who knows what your calculator and that's a such a wonderful piece of work that
yeah but
UNK scientific or you want it in scientific mode if it says scientific
yeah it does
in that case use it in scientific and then it will work that way
will it
yeah well it should do
anyway
okay
let's read the second part of this question cos it's taken us er quite some time to do it but excellent question
hasn't it
right
right let's read the second part of this
it has an average of thirteen point five marks for the first x plus one tests
his mark on the last test gave him a final average of fourteen marks for x plus two tests
what was his marks for the last test
how do you work out his total marks for his x plus one tests
thirteen point five divided by x plus one
that's his no you've got his average as thirteen point five haven't you
how do you work out his total marks which is what we're really looking for
times x plus
yes it's thirteen point five times x plus one
and how do you work out his total marks for his x plus two tests
fourteen times thirteen plus two
no
why
fourteen times what
times x plus two
yeah
that's what i said
was it
i'm sorry i UNK you
so what it's alright
mm
i UNK you okay
mm
so it might be a good idea to write that down and work it out
thirteen point five
yes
times
will you stop doing that
what
that
what's wrong with it
how do you write a multiplication in algebra
you're gonna multiply that by x plus one aren't you
mm
how do you write that
hundred and thirty five x plus one
bracket
x plus one
x plus one
ha
suppose so
that's how you write it
minus fourteen
never mind about this UNK that
you've been allowed to get away with
right go and work them out then
thirteen point five times one is
thirteen point five innit
yeah
mm
that's right
okay
so what's your total marks
sorry what's the difference
fourteen point five
you know what he total mark for his x plus one test was don't you
mm
and you know the total mark was x plus two tests
it actually asks you for the mark he obtained for his final tests doesn't it
yeah
so if you take two away one from the other you'll have the mark
nought point five
for his test won't you
so you'll have nought point five x plus
plus
point about it is y you can't see it can you unless you've got it written down so write it down
it's thirteen well it's fourteen x isn't it
mm
plus twenty eight minus thirteen point five x minus thirteen point five isn't it
or minus thirteen x plus thirteen point five isn't it
why is it
well you're taking the difference between the two aren't you
so don't you just minus them
yeah
so that's fourteen x plus twenty eight minus thirteen point five x minus thirteen point five isn't it
yes
mm
so that's nought point five x now what
plus
plus what's the difference here
hundred and thir hundred
what's twenty eight minus thirteen point five
oh it's point five
yes
what's twenty eight minus thirteen UNK
fourteen point five
fourteen point five
okay
so wouldn't
that's
you times it by two
another student has his average as thirteen point five marks for the first blah right
which marks for the last test give a final average of fourteen marks for so the one test is gonna give him that isn't it
that's right you agree isn't it
that's his total marks for x plus one tests is there
total marks for s plus two tests is there
the actual mark is that
that's for his nought point five x
so to get those two up to one x
up to one x you should times by two which is twenty nine
which i don't believe
well do you times it by four
no give but his mark on his last test gave him the final average of fourteen marks for x plus two tests
so that's his total there and his total there
yes it's gonna be doubled hasn't it to give you that
oh
oh dear
how daft can you get
what's the value of x
w we worked that out somewhere didn't we
we did didn't we
oh
oh
nearly as bad as
dear oh dear
eh
oh
innit
i'm very tired
so what do you do
times thirteen point five x by
well you do thirteen point five times ten if you want
yes
and fourteen times eleven
why eleven
well nine plus two is eleven isn't it
yes
hundred and fifty four
now who is being UNK
and you've got it haven't you
then you find the difference
yes
that makes sense
actually work here hasn't it
does that give you the same answer
yes it should do
let's just check it go on
you had thirteen point five times ten which i think is a hundred and thirty five in normal circumstances
yes
and a hundred and f fourteen times eleven
go on it's a hundred and fifty four
minus nineteen
no minus a hundred and thirty five
one fifty four minus hundred and thirty five
nineteen
nineteen
which is wh what we would have done if we'd done
if we'd done
that better
yeah but it we it's a UNK argument because you've got nought point five x haven't you
yeah
nought point five x i nought point five of x i is four point five isn't it
yeah
four point five plus fourteen point five answer
nineteen
nineteen
we actually got it right both ways
but it would have been simpler to have done it that way i think
and quicker
and quicker
but not as entertaining
yes
not as entertaining
mm
if you like
yes
they have a tendency to ask questions not quite as comp not quite as abstract as that
UNK
not even UNK not quite as abstract cos th the tendency is to ask the question the average weight of nine people is whatever it is you know somebody else has added
yeah questions
yeah
rather than quite as abstract as that but you can cope with abstract as that you can do a level
yeah
you have to cope
you have to you have to be as abstract as that
which will not do you any harm
good
a man bought three box of dutch UNK
good lord how appalling in this day and age
three boxes
at x pence per box and two boxes of UNK at y pence per box
calculate terms of x and y
cost of the five boxes
so what's the cost of the dutch ones
how many boxes
three x
splendid
what's the cost of the UNK
two y
so what's the total cost
five x two y
eh
five x plus two y
five x plus two y not just five x two y
plus two y
five x plus two y
wonderful
go on
the average cost per box in terms of x and y
so what's the average b cost per box gonna be five x plus two y you better write that down before our brains refuse to accept any more information
two y is the total cost how do you find the average
how do you find an average
add them together and divide by the number you've got
how many have you got
five
no you haven't
we've got five boxes
no you haven't got five boxes
why
read it again
three boxes of dutch
whoops
that's supposed to be three x
that's a three
yes that's better
so you haven't got
f divide that by five
divide that by five
yes
the whole of it
yeah
cos that's the total price isn't
total cost
total of boxes you mean
total cost
UNK the total number of boxes but that the top one's the total cost isn't it
UNK
that's right
yep
yes
oh
at a profit of thirty three percent of their costs
how do
thir
work that out
thirty three and a third percent is a third
yes
so i want a third of their costs
so what did he sell the dutch box
which is the dutch which is that half
well later he sold his three boxes of dutch UNK at a profit of thirty three of their cost
mm
so
so that's three x divided by
no it's not three x divided by five it's says of their cost
thy cost three x didn't they
yes
and the sold them for a third profit so what did he sell them for
x plus a third
if he sold the things for
four
UNK aye
four thirds
no
i if
if he's got
he bought them for three quid
yes
yeah which is highly UNK but he bought them for three pounds
yes
in the days when a gold sovereign meant something when you went abroad
yes
and he sold them that was his cost was three pounds
and he h he sold them at a profit of thirty three and a third percent which is a third
what did he sell them for
four pounds
four quid
so if he
four x
no if he cost him three x what's he gonna sell them for
four x
yes
so he sells his dutch s UNK for four x
when he only bought them for three x
that's right
so he sold them for four x
yeah
then what did he do with his UNK
he gave away the other two boxes as presents
strange man
a strange fellow
well no it probably a little bit of UNK for a business deal later one perhaps
mm
yes
i used to get bottles of whisky at christmas and so forth
and we UNK it
yes you now what it m yes you know all about that
yes
yes
so it's a box of h s UNK
so how much profit did he make on that
he didn't did he
he made
absolutely no profit at all in fact he made a loss of
two x
two y
yes two y
yeah
calculate the amount he received for the sale of the UNK
anybody been here before
no
okay excellent so you don't know what's going to happen
no
okay brilliant
well what do you think UNK stands for then
have you been told this
no
say that again
okay
it's UNK the first word
well the second two
resource centre
resource centre okay
archaeological resource centre
so what do archaeologists actually do then
any idea
yes
look for bones and things
pardon
look for bones and that
look for bones okay
what else do we look for
erm old things from the romans
ro UNK roman stuff okay
what kind of things do you think
we've got we've got bones is one good one
yeah
bowls
bowls potter pottery yeah
UNK another one
and what's another one
coins
coins maybe
UNK
UNK that's really UNK that's to do with UNK and that kind of thing
we're involved with people okay
well china pottery bowls all the same kind of thing
buildings brilliant
okay they're the main three
we've got pottery we've got bones we've got buildings okay
so you might want to remember that when you get in there cos on the first UNK you're gonna t have to use that bit of information
okay
right what other things do you think we might dig up
they're the main three
we've had coins as one
what else
think of some everyday things that you probably don't even think of
pardon
okay maybe
what else
weapons
weapons possibly depending on what period
clothes
clothes brilliant
okay we find quite a few clothes bits of leather shoes stuff like that okay
that's another UNK that's gonna be in there you'll be able to have a go at making a shoe
right
okay we've got these three kinds of building these materials okay
we've got bones we've got pottery and we've got building material
right what do you think happens to them once we've found it
we've dug it out the ground
what's the next thing that's going to happen to it
yeah
clean them
clean them okay
what with
brush
a brush and what else
well w we've got the we've got the object we've got a brush what kind of liquid thing
are we gonna use UNK or what
water
water okay
brush and water that'll do
okay right so we've cleaned it now what we gonna do
put it in
yeah we're gonna have to dry it first okay
we've got a wet object
right okay
at the moment we've got these piles of washed finds here
we've got building materials UNK bones all sorts all mixed together
what do you think we might do before we send it off
sort them out okay
and that's what you're gonna do as soon as you get in there that's your first activity
you're gonna be given
UNK because they're late they'll have to miss the video
oh
right well okay
cos the other group are here already they're here on time
right oh
so erm
we'll the UNK nearly finished anyway
okay
okay
right sorry about that
right okay we've sorted them out
that's what you're gonna do you're gonna be given a pile full of bits of UNK all sorts and you've got to sort them out to different piles
okay
right
so what happens after we've sorted them out
so we've got a pile of bones a pile of building material lumps of wood what do you think we might do to them next
okay yeah we might preserve them
and then what
we've got thi we've got these this lump of bone okay we don't know what it is what we gonna do with it
okay
we might study it but more likely
do you think people who are digging all these bits up are going to know everything about all the things they've dug up
yes
well they might not because there are people i mean like me students who might not
okay so what who do you think we could send them to tell us what we want to know about them
where could we send them
we could send them off to a university or something like that so the
okay
right so we do that send it off
and so we get this thing back erm and we find out it's a sheep bone and it's from about the age of the UNK
what can we tell from those two bits of information
it's old
it's old yeah
okay
it's an animal
it's from an animal
it's from an animal
but more importantly we can tell the UNK had sheep okay
so i mean from a couple of bits of information we could tell they had sheep they probably ate them teeth marks on it things like that
okay
right
if you want to how many have we got here
if you get into threes i think
how many have we got altogether
i think there's too many to do the actually er
well if we get them into threes
UNK
and then the rest can do
yeah
right
welcome to the archaeological resource centre
sorry about the delay but the school in front of you were nearly half an hour late
thank you very much for turning up on time
now so welcome to the UNK
now the UNK a r c
what does that stand for
who can tell me
yeah
archaeological resource centre
archaeological resource centre yes good
now i'm somebody now i'm gonna pretend i don't know anything about this
i probably know what resource means and what centre means what does archaeology mean
find things study them
we find things that we study yes
what sort of things
where do you find these things
underground good yes
and how do we find them
yeah
can dig down
we can dig down to find them yes good
now some archaeologists dig down to find things others study things that are above ground
things like this building
now you were standing over the road for five minutes unfortunately but i hope during that time some of you used your eyes
what sort of building was it before it became a museum
a church
yes good
which part of the church are we in now
which part of the church
what's up here
can anybody see
yeah
the tower
yes good
we're in the bottom of the tower so what do you think that was
that's right yes
that's a door you go through the door there there's a staircase that goes upstairs
now we can't let you go upstairs but later on you'll see the room up above here and you can see where that goes to
yes good
so the reason i asked that question is because i wanted to see if you were already thinking like an UNK
cos an UNK is somebody who looks for clues
like that clue
anything else that you noticed when you were on the other side of the road
yes well the rest is all modern cos this used to be a church but then it was turned into a museum it's now a museum
you can see some of the old things
when you're inside there if you look right at the far end you'll see one of the old windows a beautiful old window that's five hundred years old
so keep your eyes open when you're going through
good
so
now some of the archaeologists dig some look at old buildings like this but there's lots of other jobs that archaeologists do
so what we've done we've made a film just to show you all the different jobs that archaeologists do
and some of you'll be quite surprised at some of the things you'll see
right so any more questions before we see the film
good
now when the UNK over i've got one or two more questions to ask you so i want you to watch very carefully and listen very carefully as we go through the film
well it's good
right
s so apart from digging and UNK and looking at old buildings what other jobs do archaeologists do
yes
yes
yes good
they do
er they put the pieces back to where they used to be
you saw in fact the lady as you came in about the same time as you came in who does that
put the pieces back to make the pots
yes because we very rarely find a whole pot
usually what's happened is somebody's been doing the cooking dropped the pot on the floor and all the pieces have been thrown away
and one of the jobs we're gonna give you to do we're gonna give you one little piece of a pot and a picture and you have to try and work out which pot that the little pieces came from
yes good that's one thing we do put the pieces back together again
yeah
yes good
they look at them through UNK just to find out what they're made of
yeah
yes take pictures and draw UNK
yes good cos everything that we do has to be very careful recorded and taking the photographs and doing the drawings and UNK that's one of the ways of recording
how else do we record
now there was a lady who was working in the site and she was doing this with her hand
what was she doing
yes
yes good
she had a computer actually on the it was on the side of a surveying instrument so she was probably working out how far down she'd actually dug by looking through the UNK and reading the numbers and then she was entering up the numbers on the computer
yes good
now also on the site working there was a man UNK down like this and he had a black UNK don't haven't got the question yet
and a UNK and he was UNK away
what did he have on his head
yes
he had a UNK called a hard hat
does anybody know why
yes
cos something might fall on his head yes and he's also he's working on a building site and that's the normal regulations
safety rule regulations have to have a hat on your head
now as he was digging he was finding things
what was he doing with the things that he was finding
yes good
well it wasn't actually a box
did anybody notice what was it
it was a
no
somebody else was doing the washing
what he was putting them in a
it wasn't a bucket
it was a tray a black plastic garden seed tray that we call a finds tray and all then things he was finding he was putting them in there
now at the end of the day the finds UNK come here and all the finds are washed and dried and there's somebody called a finds assistant
a find UNK job is to sort them out into different types of materials
that's gonna be your first job here today as archaeologists
right we're going to give you a tray and ask you to sort the finds out
they're all things that have been found in york
right are there any questions before we start
yeah
yes good
a r c is UNK into the film
yes good fine
any other questions
now when you go through most of the things that you will see you can touch but there are things up on the shelves at the sides and we put them there for special reasons usually cos they're very heavy or cos they might break easily
now if you want to see something that's up on a shelf at the side ask one of the helpers wearing a red jersey and they'll take it down for you and show it to you
if you get stuck anything you don't understand anything you want to know ask somebody with a red jersey and if they know the answer they'll tell you
right if they don't they won't
now upstairs there are people working so when you get to the far end we ask you don't go straight upstairs if you can wait please and we'll all you'll all go up in the room together
right so how many have we got altogether
thirty one
thirty one
okay
but we're in er groups of five
so for the first activity you'll need to be in twos or threes
so what i'm gonna ask you to do in a minute is to line up in threes
so if i can just come through here
i think there might be a parcel for you at the door is it
for me
it's from
yeah that's it
that's right
okay step back
yeah
right i'll tell you in a minute
right
sh
right
now if you look in front of you you'll all see little a green tray with lots of objects
a lot of the people that work here are archaeologists and for the day we want you lot to pretend that you're archaeologists as well
right can you do that
right now the first job that we want you to do is to help us to sort out some of the things
now sometimes when archaeologists carry out the work they have to get in and out of a site really quickly
now all they have time to do when they're working on the site is to put them in the UNK and wash them
so you can see that none of these have got any mud on them or anything like that
now if you all want to pick one object from the tray
right
now tell me what you've got one at a time starting at this end
yeah
bone
yeah
no not stone
we call that we UNK that under building material
bone yeah
yeah
bone yeah that's right
do you what that is
bone that's right
shell that's right
pottery yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
bone yeah
bone
pottery that one
yeah
bone
building materials
bone
bone
yeah
yeah well done
that's right
right
now quite a lot of you picked a piece of bone didn't you
right
picked pottery some of you got building material this lad here and someone round there right and a couple of you picked a piece of shell
now they're the four things that you'll find in your tray
so do you want to take e each object out one at a time and then put it on the table in the categories so you've got one pile of bones
no that's a piece of tooth
yeah that's right
right now listen
stop what you're doing a minute
right
now if you look in your tray you'll see a label with a number on
right
now it's quite important this label and i want you to copy down this number onto one of these labels one for each category
now before you do that don't do it yet
i want i'm gonna explain what this number is right
now if you look at the first four figures there does anybody want to have a guess at what those first four figures mean
yeah
when they found them
that's right that's the year the UNK took place
now does anyone have want to have a guess what the next number might mean
now it's nothing to do with the day or the time or the months or the week or anything like that
yeah
no
no
yeah
yeah
no
no
no
no
no
right
yeah
no
yeah
no
right well i'll tell you
i've got i've got one
yeah
no
i've been having some quite intelligent UNK but no one 's hit the nail on the head
this is the number of the site
cos each site has a number and could you have a guess at how many UNK
yes
more than seven
this one's number seven and this one was in nineteen eighty eight
ten
more than that
more than that
a guess
more than nineteen
yeah
more than er twenty two
yeah
no not that many
yeah
higher
yeah
yeah
that's right
not far off a hundred sixty
well done
right
now what about the number in this box then
the first number there of the two
now the last number is the number of the site any ideas what number that might be
right something that nobody's said yet so i'll give you a bit of a clue
when you when archaeologists carry out the dig they don't dig up the whole site
now what do they do
yeah
er do they put them into boxes
not quite
do they have a special kind of ring round
well i don't think anyone's gonna get this so i'll tell you
when you dig when you carry out the digging on the a site you dig UNK
right
so they dig a UNK right down and this is the number of the UNK
then the last number which someone said earlier is the number of the layer in the ground
right
so do you want to copy this number down onto one label for each category and then put them into a bag and then but before now wait a minute wait a minute
now before you put them into the bag i will check them right
yeah just out all those numbers on there
right
so that's a UNK a UNK so that would go in there
what's that
excuse me is this your group here or
no i'm
there is a nearer one to you there
this is for real this is a bit of real archaeology
they really do get used
it's from a stone age and it's between four and five thousand years old
guess what it is
it's not a rock
well it was it is rock but it was something else it was a bone
no a f a UNK is something that's been turned to stone in the ground
you're thinking of a UNK as being an UNK a UNK one yeah
but that's a UNK is anything that's turned to stone
that's three quarters of a million years old
and the animal it was from would have stood about the height of that UNK
well you find them in africa and india these days
no
an elephant
that's from a UNK elephant
they were UNK animals
the UNK you mean
yeah
no that's a warm
a UNK was a cold climate
that's from a warm climate
UNK were around till fairly recently
that's right
it comes from real UNK
you know when they make honey
they make a UNK out of wax
do you see that
well when we take the honey away and we get the wax left over we can make it into lumps
and if you'd just like to try it on
at one end put the thumb down put it on the wax and put the thumb over the top and pull it along
like that
well done that's right
so you're catching the right amount of wax onto the outside of the thread
isn't that good
and then in the air it UNK very slightly as it UNK down but i think on a nice warm day like this is might be
so you've got a slightly UNK end which UNK it together so it doesn't
now you do some UNK
can you see them
do you think you can follow those
mm i think if you try and do it here so you make it into a shoe shape you UNK it all up into a shoe shape where do you think it's going to go
there it is that's right
ah
it's a sort of that's right push it through the hole and catch it at the other side
that's right yeah
you've got it
aha
and you can just pull it so that it UNK
that's right yes
and then you have to pull it pull it tight
aha
nearly right
and then if you pull it together it'll pull together
follow me all the way round and we have emma here who is erm who just keep on flooding round everybody and have a tray each
erm so everybody just come round to here
yeah
okay
now we will run out of UNK so if the people who haven't got a tray would like to go on
if i could just introduce for you this is emma who is a erm experienced UNK who's with us on a three month placement and she will take people through this
if there's anybody who can't fit in here there are one or two places round here we you can er flood onto these activities here to start off and then swap round back again
so over to you emma
has everybody got er a tray or sight of a tray
right
okay well and you've seen the video so you'll be aware of the sort of things that we do here
and this is an introduction to look really you'll experience of the work of archaeologists
and it's these finds in the UNK are actually real archaeological finds from real sites in york
and they're what we call bulk finds
er they're the sort of things that if you were if you were digging on a site you'd find these every day you'd find an awful lots of them er and they're really what the people of the time think of as rubbish
you know broken pot throw it away
they're but we do
so in these UNK you've actually got erm quite a variety of material
you've got pottery you've got building material such as UNK lumps of plaster around somewhere as well erm shell bone all sorts of things okay
so what actually happens these are taken off site and they're washed but they're not sorted
and this is the first job that we have to do really is to sort them out into their different categories
so you can just sort of take them out and put them on your desk all the bone erm all the pottery
i'll just tell you about this can i just tell you about this just for a minute
cos this is quite this is quite important okay
right
if you just pick up a UNK of pottery okay that really by itself can't tell you an awful lot
i mean we can say what it's made of and we might be able to make a guess at how old it is
but if you don't know where it's come from it really isn't as much use
that's where these labels come in okay
now these actually each tray should have one and they actually tell you where the stuff comes from
so here the first number in this case nineteen eighty nine is the date that the site was dug
okay
the next number is the site code
in this case it's number four
erm all the all the sites are given a code what that one actually is
now this next number in the box is the layer number
okay so we know exactly where these things come from
so then you we can UNK in on the site to not only a place actually on the site but how far down they came from as well
when y when you're dealing with seventeen feet of UNK as in york you n you need to know where it's come from
okay
so i'll tell you i'll tell you what to do with those in a minute but if y at the moment if you'd just like to have a go at sorting it out
if you've got any questions please ask me i'll try and answer them
when you've finished sorting them into their piles the next job is to put each pile into a separate bag so that you would put all your bones into one bag all your pottery into another
so these are now ready to go off to the specialists okay
so what you have to do then
sh
sh
sh
hang on
sh
sh
sh
sh
UNK
right
okay can you all i'm sorry i was talking to the study group
did you all get the bit the bit about
no
no
no
alright okay
erm when you've finished sorting them out into their little piles if you'd like to then put each little each pile into a separate bag so all your bones would go into one pile er one bag erm all your pottery into another bag and then this is where the label comes in
this is wh this is where the label is important
because for each bag could you
can we take them home then with us
write a copy
don't think so
of the label okay so that we can actually and put it actually in the bag so that when these things go off as they would do to their to the various specialists who actually know more about pottery know more about bones and can do a more detailed analysis still know where they're from
okay
you're gonna trust me to do this
now if i can say a little bit about the building to you
the er UNK the building is erm the oldest fabric here is the tower erm which from the er window the style of the UNK is clearly fifteenth century in origin
and also the main east window is also fifteenth century
now much of the rest of the stone of the building also dates from the medieval period but in fact in the nineteenth century the building er was very popular as a church and the vicar at the time decided that what he needed was more space and so they knocked down virtually the whole building apart from the tower and the east erm window and UNK it to put in the er gallery at the level that we're standing here
so and you can see this quite clearly if you look at the UNK
you see that arch there
that is an is an original height of the arch cos that arch is UNK into the main arch of the tower
but if you look at the next one you see the UNK er all the other UNK are have been raised about er a metre and that was done deliberately to get the extra height on the outside wall so that they could put erm a er higher roof in for the UNK and for the aisle so that they could ge make it a bigger space
so as a result of that because it's been erm changed in the nineteenth century the eighteen forties and eighteen fifties UNK who we who were faced with a real problem with york cos york had something like fifty medieval churches and erm er about thirty of them surviving into the twentieth century erm and they had to make some decisions about which ones to preserve and which ones to let go
and this building was one that was allowed to UNK because of all this victorian change
but for us as archaeologists it's a er it's wonderful because it shows change and that's what archaeology is all about the influence of humans on place or landscape or whatever it may be wherever you are
so it's a particularly wonderful thing for us
and now that we've started to look after the building we've actually discovered some very exciting and interesting small clues about the building
if you look up there for example can you see the row of heads supporting the UNK
yeah
there and on the other side
well they're those are from the style the art style of the heads they are very highly UNK
they're quite clearly twelfth century in date they're norman like er william the UNK that sort of kind of period
twelfth century eleventh twelfth century date
and that's a table that would originally have been placed outside and those heads are basically designed to scare away evil spirits
but what er what happened is when they UNK this building in the fifteenth century the UNK found these and UNK them UNK them inside because they'd lost their significance in over the three hundred years so but they were useful structural er things
so that shows su suggests that there's twelfth century fabric in this building
and there are other clues
if you look very carefully at the stones you can see erm can you see that some of the stones have got UNK markings all over them
mm
okay
and if you if you compare those UNK markings with the sorts of markings on er some of these other stones these are a bit UNK but if you look carefully they go there're some going in that direction and some are going that direction
the UNK on stones changes through time as UNK change their techniques and er this is fifteenth century UNK but that is twelfth century UNK
if you er you have to get up close to look at these features carefully but it shows very clearly that there's a lot of twelfth century stone incorporated in the building
and that all if you put this together with the documents that we know it suggests that there was a twelfth century church here which was demolished and then UNK in the fifteenth century
and in fact there are even more subtle things than that you can find if you look carefully at oh i might er i think that we might go out into the garden and i'll show you one or two other features out there that are er even more er interesting and er exciting
but anyhow have you if you have a look here there's erm er the er i think we ought to be thinking about er
yeah
er moving on
do you think that is about right
yeah
okay
yeah
so if you'd like to go down the stairs there are some coats oh your coats and things and i will er go and come and join you and we'll take off and look at the outside
if i may ask you about the window
oh sure
rebuild er every fifty or a hundred years or whatever
n no i don't think so
i think these are fifteenth century
i think they're fifteenth century they are they're well cut and they're well
the g the glass
er the glass the glass itself is replacement
oh sorry the glass itself is replacement
there but there are some UNK of fifteenth century glass up there
do you see the little coloured arrows in those
those are fifteenth century glass
that UNK
glass will survive
what happens is that although it does tend to UNK it builds a UNK on the outside that stops it UNK
so you will be looking at er glass erm here and elsewhere that is really very ancient
not no not well you know just like ordinary glass
i mean it's a fairly UNK er permanent material
you can get roman glass for example roman glass f erm pottery erm glass vessels erm which are incredibly thin the glass is as thin as light UNK and that UNK erm two thousand years
so we're only asking for five hundred years
oh does it
oh you do you work in it do you
oh right
yeah
okay well i'll well i'll just get my coat and come with you
huge number of people died in UNK and in er as infants
a lot of women UNK giving died giving birth
UNK
erm but there were er a small number of people who managed to make it to good old healthy seventies eighties
but there is er not many
right we've a man with a bicycle trying to get through so er i think if you if you
that's alright
come through on the grass that okay
oh yeah that's
have we got everybody
i noticed there a young man what's he called richard is he
no
patrick
no
robert
mike
michael
michael
mike
michael
michael
he's not come yet so erm perhaps while we're waiting for the others i'll just say a few words about the building because erm from out here you can see er quite clearly that the central portion of the building is the oldest erm from if you look at the state of the UNK
er particularly if you look just at the ordinary wall UNK the front wall the stones are very much more heavily eroded there than they are on this the aisle here
and er if you look also at the way that the stones fit together they're ve they fit together very neatly on the aisle where by the small window whereas the central part of the church there's much more UNK between the joints
so those are very good indications for later building
but there is in fact a very interesting er story archaeological story which we can UNK from the outside of this building
