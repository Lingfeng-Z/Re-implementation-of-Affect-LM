and i'd like to erm try and get you all to see what you can tell by simply UNK the building and i'd like to concentrate if we may on the central part of the building because there are a number of changes that have been made to that building erm which tell a story
and one of the things that archaeologists do all their time is try by looking at the evidence whether it's stuff that comes from the ground UNK or old buildings to try and understand the changes that have happened through time to see things that were there that have gone and to work out what
in the erm victorian period the stone was far so far UNK they inserted some new stones there
yeah
anything else yeah
little holes in that's excellent
why do you think they've got those little chips in them
to plaster over
plaster over brilliant
now that's a very important clue that you've spotted
brilliant
now what i want you to do no this is getting very exciting to me
i'm ve i this is the first time it's happened this way round that anybody's got that's the most subtle clue and somebody's spotted it
i think it's wonderful
so what i want you to do is to follow these little chips er UNK here they're on this stone there're a few on that but not on here so that bit it goes in that direction
they're on here they're on here a few there they're up there but they don't go any higher than that
i'd like you to look along and see if they go to that line and stop and they g you can see some over here
see how far you can trace them along there
see how far you can go
see how far
how far do they go
come on how far
here yeah and h how far along
three
oh no
how fa how far how far up do they go
what's the highest you find them
up to the window
okay up to there
so o so there was once a UNK surface across there okay
was it painted
er it may have been but you can't we haven't got much evidence for that
er well that bit you're go you're jumping too fast
now what other changes are there
what other changes
er let's erm have a look at this here look at this here
UNK
what
the UNK
UNK yeah so that's a new stone there's a very new stone
that was we put that one in about nineteen eighty six that one
erm but this doorway does this doorway look as though it's always been here
no
why not
cos the stones are UNK are little there while
if you look at the w if you look around the windows you'll always get a drip course
this has not got a drip course you know
you look even over there on that building there's above the window there's a drip course by the doorway is a drip course for the rain coming down dripping off
oh yeah
this has not got a drip course
okay
and if you also look the most the UNK change that's happened on the outside of this building if you look at that window if you if you follow the edge of the window the original window came all the way down to this point and then across and up and this has been all blocked up
okay
so and this doorway has been inserted that close to the corner of the window
that's you know any UNK tell you that's just wild that's just ridiculous it's very dangerous to put a doorway so close to the corner of a window
you have much more maintenance
so what we know is that this must have been blocked up before this doorway was inserted okay
so what you have got here is an a blocked up window an inserted doorway and a UNK surface
now if you can put all those three pieces of evidence together what does that suggest to you
h er why would the people want to do that in a church
plaster an outside of a wall with no so er with no drip course so this must have been an
this must have been an internal wall at one point
there was a room out here
exactly
exactly
there was once a UNK built out here and er this doorway was put in so that the vicar could get into the UNK to change his clothes
and that building has gone
it's no longer here
but by looking at the clues of the building we can see that it was there
and that's the sort of thing archaeologists are doing all the time
that's what we're trying to do all you know that's just our job that's how we're looking at buildings
now what is particularly interesting is if you take that and you try and date when these various things were done and if i ask questions why was it done like this
and it was done like this was done at a period when this church was changing from a roman catholic church the window the original glass in this was a massive stained glass window of the UNK and that had been put there in the fifteenth century by a lord mayor of york who was very wealthy and very religious and he wanted to show how wealthy and religious he was by pu er UNK this window to the church
but england ceased to become a catholic er country and we had the UNK and the emphasis changed from people looking at these spectacular coloured windows to learn about the bible UNK er and people started to read literacy came in
and the whole style in churches changed
they started to put up big screens behind the UNK blocking off some of the stained glass and writing on those big screens the creed or the lord's prayer in english which was done in the seventeenth and eighteenth century
and that was the time when this was all done
so the archaeology of the building and the UNK history are reflecting big changes in what people were thinking how people were erm what they believed their belief systems
but erm and it's all here for us to see if you have the eyes and the detective and the UNK and the research to pick all these little details out
and so that i hope that i hope you find that interesting
but the UNK been inside
yes exactly
this was a this was UNK so it'd be a ni nice inside wall for inside of the UNK
and this we see it's er quite interesting this you notice this bit here is not UNK and this has not got these UNK so we think that what actually happened is when they first did this the this bit of the window was blocked up with wood or UNK and UNK or something like that and so it was a and then when then when the UNK came down this these stones were put in here to block it up again
so this is that's why these don't have the UNK on them whereas they should have done if they'd you see so there's al there's incredibly subtle things that you can you can pick up
now i wanted to tell you a little bit too before we leave about one of the UNK publications that may be of interest to those of you who are self UNK
erm we've produced a little guide called the time UNK guide to york which consists of four archaeological walks of the city
and erm each one begins here at the archaeological resource centre and takes you through UNK and back UNK explains where to go er with drawings text and explains it all
one of the romans city so you can pick out some roman UNK one of the erm the er UNK city one of what happened in the norman period the eleventh century time of william the UNK and the two UNK and the big er erm UNK he put up and finally the medieval city
and this you can purchase for two pounds ninety nine from here or lots of other shops
i thought i'd give you that opportunity cos it is a little UNK publication it's one that we er so if you want it
so i i've got that with me but i've what we'll do now is we'll start to erm make our way towards coffee which i think might be welcome
er am i right
you c you couldn't be more right
okay let's er this way then
okay
about his car i wanna know about three things about him

he was younger than me
i would say he was early to mid thirties whereas i am mid thirties to late thirties
thirty two
oh
my dad's thirty
but if don't know if you don't know don't make it up

you got it right and you stuck to your guns and cos i'm put a little doubt in your mind you changed
if you don't know don't guess if you're certain say it
yeah
that's what i'm saying if a we hope you're never in the situation but if you was describing that man try and describe that man as honestly and as best as you can don't say if i say to you oh did he have jeans on

don't guess
don't just say oh yeah he was UNK you could be guessing wrong
say i'm sorry i can't remember
you see that's what i'm trying to do because you're getting older now you can remember all these things you can remember all these things what's the question there

excuse me er
it's alright it's UNK anonymous
good morning ladies and gentlemen
welcome to the fifty seventh day of this enquiry
i hope i imagine i should say perhaps that this is the last day on which the county council will be represented formally at the enquiry
we turn now to land north of skelton
mr
right
good morning ladies and gentlemen
we're dealing this morning with topic areas thirty nine and forty and sites two and three
erm can i just begin by taking the UNK first please
sir my name is george
i'm here in an UNK capacity as advocate and expert witness on behalf of the skelton parish council the skelton village trust
i don't think there's any need to read all the other names mr
it's all
erm
is it correctly set out on the day's programme
it is indeed sir
good
er s i it is set out on my proof g w fourteen
i haven't checked the erm er wording of today's programme but i've no reason to assume that any mistakes will have been made on that
erm
mr i have from you i think er six documents
there is a summary your proof your appendices there's a letter dated the fourth of february from the yorkshire UNK trust there is a special statement and last and only just received in the last few minutes there is a supplementary note by doctor on the greater UNK and its importance in relation to skelton pond
sir you have UNK all the documents which exist on our side and with regard to the letters erm er of the fourth of february and the twentieth of april to which you have referred they are part of the set of appendices and are respectively appendix eight and appendix nine
i appreciate that point mr but as they arrived separately they've been given different numbers er a as simply er a matter of administrative convenience
sir before i open the case er after you have taken the UNK it is my intention with your permission to make a special statement having regard to an event in the past and to then make submissions
thank you
thank you very much
please
mr
sir yes i represent the county council with respect to these objections sir and i shall be calling mrs to give the evidence and she will produce a proof and a bundle of appendices which consist of two plans
those are documents n y two three seven and n y two three eight
thank you very much
and for the district council mr
yes sir
sir i'll be calling mr
his proof is r d eighty two with er appendices r d eighty three
thank you very much
mr
yes sir
sir i'm instructed by mrs
i represent those who are UNK on the second sheet
thank you for not
yes thank you very much
that's quite a long list i think
sir you have before you i hope the proof of evidence and appendices from mrs
yes
sir with permission the course i propose to adopt is as follows
i propose to call her but if in the event i judge it to be unnecessary then i shall invite because i don't want to add unnecessarily to the length of these proceedings
thank you very much indeed
right mr then please
sir this is a special statement
i was advised by the greenbelt local plan programme officer on fifth march that counsel for north yorkshire county council with the apparent UNK of counsel for ryedale district council had delivered an oral submission to the inspector that at the hearing of the case which was to have taken place on the eleventh of march certain evidence contained in my proof of evidence issued on twelfth february should be treated as UNK
that submission was made at a time when i was sch not scheduled to be present at this enquiry and was not present
a prior indication of an intention to make a submission had not furthermore been UNK
on hearing of the UNK i immediately requested through the programme officer a copy of the submission as delivered but received in reply from the county planning officer of north yorkshire county council merely a statement that the county council was requesting that an issue be not UNK by the inspector on the basis of the council's position as set out in paragraph eight point one of its proof of evidence
not being in possession of a UNK record of the submission by the county i have prepared twelve linked submissions in this matter document g w fourteen b which seek to UNK with justification the point believed to have been made on behalf of the county and district councils
if after i have read my submissions the councils wish and are permitted to make any observations on it i request the right to reply UNK before the matter is decided by you
it is my intention to proceed to open the case proper relating to areas d thirty nine and d forty after the points raised in the UNK submissions have been resolved
er mr you have of course just been reading your special statement erm document number five and there is left the erm additional two pages which makes these er submissions
i would imagine that the er parties on my left have had a chance to read and consider these erm statements already
er i would think it very little advantage in actually reading all of this UNK now unless you feel it is going to be some great advantage
sir it has always been one of my principles that planning for its acceptance depends on public understanding
there is present in this hall today a number of people who are concerned with the future of skelton
they have had no opportunity whatsoever to hear the nature of the point which is due to be considered by you in relation to these submissions and i think that it would be in the interests of public understanding of this case were they enabled to hear
well mr of course the same argument could be put forward in er to justify reading all UNK of evidence in full and er that would UNK an already very long enquiry to er erm a quite UNK extent
however as this is a particular topic and as er i'm going to be asking the councils er and the supporters if they wish to comment on er your submissions perhaps to assist the public understanding of these replies er there may be some advantage in you reading er at least a summary of these er points
but i certainly don't want to take any other evidence in court other than this
pl please continue then and er
yes
with regard to
we'll deal with this relatively quickly
yes sir
the as regards to the other evidence you have my two page summary er and therefore there is no risk of erm any erm UNK length of time being taken the rest of
changes in proposed greenbelt boundaries affecting a given area and occurring at the consultative draft stage of local plans and or pre map stage and the formal deposit of those plans and or between the deposit copies and proposals subsequently issued by county and local planning authorities by way of desired changes to deposit copies UNK against and may totally UNK in relation to that area emergence within the meaning of the national doctrine most recently UNK in paragraph er within erm paragraph thirty two of the revised version of p g number one
proposals made by way of change to a deposit copy have a relatively stronger affect against emergence UNK to the lesser public consultation which UNK them prior to the enquiry stage
two
the existence of valid objections to the deposit copies and or to the proposals subsequently issued by county or local planning authorities by way of desired changes to deposit copies also UNK against the operation of the doctrine of emergence in relation to that area
three
UNK to emergence from more than one cause which exist at any one time in relation to the same area are cumulative in the degree of their effects up to a state of total UNK of emergence prior to adoption of the plan concerned
four
a change of greenbelt status and changes to a proposed greenbelt boundary UNK affecting the combined area known for the purposes of this enquiry as d thirty nine and d forty north of skelton village have been proposed in the deposit copies and in the desire to change proposed by the county and local planning authorities and UNK valid representations have been lodged relating to the exclusion of all or parts of the area of the greenbelt
the essential feature of these representations is that they seek greenbelt status and any question of the technical means by which this is sought to be achieved such as by washing over or exclusion from an inset area is UNK to the relevance of the representation of the end desired
this is especially so as the local plan makes no reference whatever to the proposal to effectively change from a washed over to an inset status while the greenbelt local plan refers to that change only by the one word quote proposed unquote in UNK on page twenty five of the deposit copy
in the case of neither plan was attention drawn to this fundamental change in the plans UNK the text or at public consultation displays and few members of the public have therefore been aware of the UNK washed over status of skelton and consequence consequently of the intended change to it
five
the cumulative effect of the changes proposed and the objections made is to UNK the emergence at this time of any new greenbelt boundary affecting the area of skelton
six
skelton village and the area of d thirty nine and d forty form no part of the built area of york but are separated from it by open country
seven
skelton village and the area of d thirty nine and d forty are located well within the general extent of the statutory york greenbelt as defined by policy e eight four of the north yorkshire county structure plan approved by the secretary of state for the environment
eight
no inset within the greenbelt is in existence for the area which is at this time washed over by the greenbelt
the local planning authority refer to the washed over status of the whole area from nineteen eighty one in paragraph two point one point four of their proof
nine
as a result of the village being within and washed over by the greenbelt no inset boundary exists in the vicinity
it is in my opinion UNK that a boundary which does not exist is UNK incapable of being re UNK but can only with ju justification be created de UNK
likewise the physical UNK or otherwise of a boundary as which does not exist cannot arise
ten
in accordance with the provisions of national policy as set out in paragraph nine of planning policy guidance note two any alteration to the general extent of the approved greenbelt is to be proposed only in exceptional circumstances
eleven
any alteration within the general coverage of the approved greenbelt by way of the creation of an inset would require justification in accordance with the second sentence of paragraph nine of p g two and in the strict terms of a proposal made under approved structure plan policy e ten as inserted by the secretary of state for the environment
no such proposal has been made by the county or local planning authorities
twelve and last
having regard particularly to submissions five eight nine and eleven above the changes currently proposed by the county and local planning authorities require to be considered in relation to the washed over greenbelt status at present applicable to the area under which no boundary is in existence
such consideration inter UNK is given in my proof of evidence and the summary UNK and they are therefore admissible and of major relevance to this enquiry
any submission to the contrary which may be or has been made by north yorkshire county council and or ryedale district council is accordingly strongly and totally UNK for the reasons detailed in these submissions
sir
thank you mr
mr do you wish to reply to that
er briefly sir yes
the deposit copy of the york greenbelt local plan showed site d thirty nine as being within the village of skelton and site d forty as being without in the greenbelt
objection was made by the skelton village trust to site d thirty nine being shown as being within the village UNK
that was the only objection made to site d thirty nine er that it should be the objection was that it should shown to be in the greenbelt
that would be
when the proposed changes were made known advertised and er members of the public and other bodies were able to make representations with respect to them site d forty was shown as being UNK within the village
skelton parish council and mr made objections to that proposed change
those were the only two objections made to that proposed change
we therefore sir have before us today to consider these two sites d thirty nine and d forty in the context of the relevant and duly made objections that have been made and they are the simple question is should these sites be in the within the greenbelt or within the inset
it's actually sir a fairly straightforward issue
what mr is seeking to do now is to raise a much wider issue it seems to us and that is that skelton ought to be washed over in its entirety with greenbelt notation
that objection has never been made
it's not a duly made objection it's not one that he has any right to raise at this late stage
we will not entertain it sir because it raises a whole host of wider and different issues many of which we in fact considered yesterday in the context of UNK if you will recall
the objectives which the objectors are anxious to see achieved are to have these two sites shown as being in the greenbelt
that can be achieved in the context of the objections that have been duly made
what we cannot UNK though sir is any widening o of the route that they seek to go down to have these sites included in the greenbelt and that's to say to entertain the argument that the whole of skelton ought to be washed over
the issue is straightforward should these sites be in the greenbelt or not
that objective can be achieved er under the terms of the objections that have been made
the er need to widen it to include er a washing over argument doesn't arise
thank you mr
do you want to add anything to that mr or does the same point apply
well er sir the same point applies and i'd only say this
erm in relation to the er modification in the plan which er the deposit plan which put these two sites er out of the greenbelt er mr did make representations
er in answer to the question which proposed change do you object to he wrote greenbelt boundary north of skelton and then in answer to the question please state here the full grounds on which your objection or representations will be made he wrote the change is contrary to my supported representations on the deposit plan
sir you will remember in the deposit skelton was inset although these two fields were not part of the inset
so he supported the deposit
and i object to it as i consider that o s fields seven three six five and six eight six two with the land extending UNK to the a nineteen should not be part of the skelton inset area
it's plain it's UNK
mr 's concern related to two sites and two sites alone not to the principle of UNK
indeed we're not aware of erm anybody
mr you you've er commented upon mr 's objection that he made himself but of course there are he is appearing for many others
yes
many of whom no doubt are present today
yes
er was the same did the same apply to the objections made by
well we we're not aware of anybody UNK to the general principle of UNK and seeking skelton to be washed over
everybody was concerned with these two fields
thank you
mr i'm not quite sure t w er what your standing is in relation to this point
are there any helpful comments you could make
sir i think i have probably have no standing and the answer to your question directly is no
thank you
mr before i make a ruling on this point did you wish to make er any further comment
sir one has to have in these matters regard to the UNK of the situation
the question of washing over and UNK is a technical planning matter in which the population as a whole is not well UNK
the representations which come from members of the public and others cannot therefore be assumed in all cases to UNK the approach which would be given were a full understanding of the previous and proposed situations in the mind of those who made that proposal
this is i am certain the case with regard to skelton
i have ample evidence that persons who are very aware of matters of public interest in general have been unaware at a critical stage of the washed over status at that time of skelton
it is i believe a result of that situation that reference to the correct that is to say the continuation of washing over was not known in the documents first submitted by way of representation to various planning
secondly i did say that the degree of confusion has existed because the two planning authorities have UNK about with the line a great deal
it is perhaps fortunate from our point of view that we can pin ourselves in so far as we are talking about an inset to the actual deposit copy of ryedale district council when they did get the matter right but no body apart from them sir did so
sir i feel that regard should be had by you to the UNK of the situation as well as to the submissions which i have made in coming to your decision
thank you mr
i have of course had the advantage of considering this matter er previously and i have had the chance also to look at the various objections that have been made
it does appear to me er that the view which has been expressed by mr and mr is correct that you and your clients did not object in terms or indeed as far as i can see by implication in any way to the existence of an inset for the village
they certainly did object to the proposed changes but they did so in terms of where it is right that the inset boundary should be placed and as far as i'm aware there are no references in any objections to the wider question of whether or not the village should be washed over or be inset
i have therefore to agree with both the councils that the comments you have just made and which you make at some length in your proof on this point amount in effect to a late objection
neither council wants me to deal with this as a late objection
it is therefore a matter which lies within my discretion as to whether or not i take it as a late objection
i am not convinced that special circumstances apply in this case which UNK the which is advice given very clearly in the p g twelve that in general late objections should not be UNK except in most exceptional circumstances
i should however indicate that to understand properly what is the appropriate position for an inset boundary i have to look at the reasons for there being an inset at all for the village as you correctly indicate it lies plainly otherwise within the general extent of the greenbelt
it may therefore be necessary to examine why the two councils did not adopt the alternative approach of washing over the village
you are however of course aware that this background to UNK was discussed at some length yesterday in the context of another village
there would therefore in any event be no need and no advantage for me in repeating all that was said then
and this is of course as if i agree with the view that you expressed yesterday in a general context although it was made specifically then in relation to one village any recommendation i make in relation to that village if it is based on the general principle must apply by analogy also to skelton and i would have little choice but to recommend to the councils that they may wish or indeed they should UNK this question of washing over or UNK elsewhere
i think i hope that is clear
it i it is i appreciate er a difficult er course now to steer between approaching head on an objection which is a late objection and dealing by er reference to UNK perhaps to matters that have been dealt with elsewhere to the question of washing over but i'm sure that you can steer this particular course or cross this particular UNK with success
sir we are much obliged to you for your consideration upon this matter and i assure you that i shall do my best to avoid in the evidence which i shall give and in my other remarks apparently proposing a washed over status for the village as a whole
however it may incidentally erm come into the words that i use that erm er i'm referring to the washed over or other status of these two sites
i shall endeavour to avoid that and i ask your UNK if this happens since to a great extent one cannot erm select particular sentences erm that have not already documents
sir if it is your wish i will now open the case
please yes
a are you going to be reading from your summary
er when i give my expert evidence i will read from the summary
sir it is my UNK to open er a case of this kind with a quotation
in nineteen fifty three the ministry of housing and local government issued their design town and village manual and because of difficulties attending design concepts the manual was made up of essays by UNK planners on various topics with the full UNK of the minister
a contribution relating to the english village was made by the late thomas and he had this to say
it has sometimes been claimed that the village is a UNK english UNK
whether that is so or not the english village is i believe among the UNK and most places that men have ever built to live in and certainly it has a physical character and appearance that is strongly its own
whatever may be its points of similarity to or difference from other UNK villages as social institutions it has very special qualities of UNK not of course to be confused with UNK
i do not think that these qualities arise wholly or even mainly as it is so often assumed from the character of its buildings and the beauty of the natural forms such as trees which stand in UNK to them
i believe that they lie as much or even more in the form in the ground plan which the buildings and the natural objects together make
sir you have heard the virtues of various villages around york UNK at earlier UNK in this enquiry
you have heard in response to a direct question put by yourself to an expert for north yorkshire county council that he regarded the village of flaxton as making a contribution to the historic setting of york that it had a greenbelt function
you have heard of the historical circumstances attendant on some of the villages and you have heard of the beauty of them
we have UNK wide
UNK flaxton sand UNK upper UNK they have all come before you
sir today you have before you what i believe is the most important village still existing close to york which has over a considerable part of its area UNK at this day a medieval character and feel
skelton is a very special village towards its north side
sir skelton has made its contribution to UNK housing problem in the past
an inset was at one time created for skelton and it resulted in a considerable amount of building on the south side
that building is not in character with the main part of the village to the north side
it is quite obviously a twentieth century UNK however good it may be in itself as such
sir skelton has taken all of that it could possibly stand without destruction
to envisage any modern development at all on the north side would be UNK having regard to the very special properties which there exist qualities which contribute undoubtedly to the historic setting of york
skelton is a village whose residents are proud
they are increasingly aware of their heritage
the village trust is a respected body which has been in existence for many years
learned contributions have been made and in that connection i need only refer to some which are part of the appendices for the case before you today UNK the contribution made following recent research by mrs on archaeological matters of significance to this particular area
i could go on for some time sir but i will now proceed to the technical planning matters
i'm a UNK of science in estate management in the university of london and a fellow of the royal institution of chartered surveyors
my first main appointment subsequent to the war was in the planning technique division of the headquarters technical UNK in the then ministry of town and country planning st UNK square
during the later part of my career i was university estates officer to the new university of york from the UNK in ninety sixty three until my retirement
skelton is a village with a long history and an attractive character in the area of the church
it is here that william the UNK is said to have UNK two UNK to help him gain access to the city of york after he had UNK it UNK
in eleven sixty six one david le the keeper of the king's was granted an allowance and certain rights here
the church which is a gem of early english architecture and which with the green is the focal point of the village was built about twelve forty seven UNK by the treasurer of york minster
there are many UNK aspects which are reflected in this
the coverage of the conservation area which is one of the earliest created in north yorkshire UNK from nineteen seventy two not nineteen seventy as written is limited to that part of the settlement which has UNK village character and contains listed buildings
it includes the present d thirty nine site near to the sixteenth or seventeenth century skelton manor house and it has important archaeological and nature conservation interests as described in reports
skelton is well within the general area of the approved york greenbelt and is a small free standing settlement that was washed over by the greenbelt in the draft southern ryedale district plan of nineteen eighty one
this plan UNK the full consultation stage and was employed for over ten years for development control purposes
the greater york study did not UNK skelton as an area for expansion until two thousand and six and no proposal exists in other plans for the making of an inset into the greenbelt on the basis of the need for expansion
sites d thirty nine and d forty are in any case not located within the built up area of the settlement in terms of greenbelt plan policy four
sir in making reference to erm policies which erm have relevance to the question of the status of the two sites we're concerned with i will start with those which are part of the statutory plan that is to say the north yorkshire county structure plan approved by the secretary of state and then proceed downwards to the more recent documents which do not employ
so in paragraph six i start with the c s p
the north side of the village could not accommodate additional development without UNK to its basic form and character in the terms of structure plan policy h three
as mentioned in paragraph twenty three of my proof an appeal decision relating to land immediately east of d thirty nine referred to the UNK for development of that area since the character of the village would be seriously UNK
policy h four of the approved county structure plan UNK any development which is more than small scale
structure plan policy e four and er erm that is a correction sir i have e five down there
thank you
structure plan policy e four provides that conservation areas will be afforded the UNK protection
can i help you mr
what are you looking for
thank you i do apologize sir
erm
right
is it e four you're looking for
er no sir er e four i will take as read
but we now have erm following research by the yorkshire UNK trust in relation to the document that i have described as appendix eight
erm the reference on page two of erm the conservation officer's er letter mr 's letter of the fourth of february a reference to policy e six of the county structure plan erm which in his expert opinion very firmly covers sites like this one
er i think that er i will not read any more of that letter at present but er certainly it's not only e four but e six er of the c s p which applies here
i would be grateful if at some point mr you were to deal with er doctor 's er most recent comments on the greater UNK since of course i've only just had those er more or less on coming into this room and i haven't had a chance
yes
to read it or think about it
yes sir
erm i will in fact deal with that now as an aside a very necessary one too
could you start off by telling me which pond it is we're talking about
yes
because i just want to be sure
there are two ponds of course which are shown on there is the much larger pond
yes
to the east of UNK and the smaller one west of skelton manor court
yes
we're talking about the one within erm the er area known as d thirty nine sir
i thought it might be
er which is immediately west of manor court
erm sir i don't know whether you and my friends erm on the bench opposite had an opportunity last evening of erm having UNK at UNK world but
i fear not i was too busy reading your UNK
oh thank you sir i'm much obliged for that
erm i UNK on it almost by accident and er it was very interesting in that erm the great UNK was UNK as a result of the action of the secretary of state in refusing an application by british coal for open cast coal mine
and the reason was that er part of the area at a pond near the was erm an UNK home of the UNK
erm a reference was made er by the by british coal to erm er their erm absolute willingness to provide ponds elsewhere
the secretary of state was not convinced er that er a UNK would be taken up er elsewhere
and sir the letter which you have before you er dated twentieth april from doctor is very much on that tack
we noticed that as one of mrs 's appendices er there was a reference to a willingness by one of her clients to provide other ponds were development to er proceed on the area known as d thirty nine
and erm er doctor has looked into this matter and you will see in the fourth paragraph of his letter of the twentieth
is obviously highly selective and
you can take a UNK to water but you can't make him swim
thank you sir
er sir i will leave you to read the rest of that letter
alterations have been deposited to the county structure plan and erm that took place before this hearing er before this enquiry opened
policy e two of the proposed structure plan alteration number three applies to all land outside existing built areas and countryside outside the greenbelt
and this policy would therefore UNK the development of d thirty nine and d forty
could you just er wait for a second
well i think probably i can compete with the UNK now by raising my voice
right thank
you very much that's
yes
thank you
erm and policy e two provides that development in the open countryside will not be permitted
it goes on in more detail but that is the basis of it
so that erm would appear to UNK development of d thirty nine and d forty in any case no need having been established
reserves of potential development land in such locations are not provided for in any policy
we now turn to southern ryedale sir
southern ryedale local plan policy c one three would UNK the development of d thirty nine as the development of that whole area would not enhance the character of the conservation area
i think it's worth actually looking at that policy
it reads in conservation areas permission will only be granted for developments including changes of use especially from residential from residential use providing that they enhance the character of the existing buildings in terms of design scale grouping materials and will not UNK substantially increase the generation of traffic parking and other activities beyond the environmental capacity of the conservation area
sir it is my opinion that any development in area d thirty nine which is wholly within the conservation area would have those UNK effects and the same applies for d forty two d forty two
continuing with the southern ryedale plan policy e n v one normally UNK new development outside the existing built up areas in the absence of exceptional circumstances
it reads new development will normally be permitted outside the existing built up areas only where it is essential to the needs of agriculture or UNK or there are other exceptional circumstances
while as settlement within the greenbelt development could not normally be permitted on d thirty nine and d forty as these are outside the built area in the terms of policy g b three which we have UNK considered at erm this enquiry
policy h seven applies in the event of skelton being an inset area when any development would have to be within the settlement and no more than small scale UNK d thirty nine and d forty
it is submitted that the whole of skelton village should be looked at as a unity that there is extreme environmental value over its north part and that were the village inset into the greenbelt the inset boundary should be precisely as shown in the deposit copy of southern UNK local plan
thank you very much
mr please
mr you're probably aware that the deposit plan inset boundary for skelton is the same as that was shown in the consultation draft of the greenbelt plan
er yes i am
and you will probably be aware that at the consultation draft stage which shows the same boundaries as are in the deposit plan both the parish council and the village trust supported the inset boundary as shown drawn in the consultation draft
were you aware of that
can i be clear what you mean by mr
when you say supported do you mean they didn't object or do you mean they
no
actually supported
they made representations supporting the proposed inset boundary for skelton both the parish council and the village trust
thank you
it's er it's page one hundred and three of the consultation draft report on the consultation
do i have that document
i don't think i
no you may not
not at this stage in the enquiry sir i'm not going to produce any great er any documents
were you aware of that er mr
i was not aware of that
i came into the skelton case at a much later stage
erm i would say however that there has been far more consistency about the view taken of the need for greenbelt protection on the part of the bodies and individuals i represent than has been shown by the two planning authorities judging from all the changes that they have UNK
and at the deposit stage erm mr skelton village trust made objection to site d thirty nine
having previously supported the site d thirty nine being within the inset
do you know when they changed their mind
no
do you know why er the parish council made no objection to site d thirty nine being included within the inset at the deposit plan stage
no
do the parish council object to site d thirty nine being shown within the inset
as instructed erm i present a case which is UNK on behalf of all the bodies and persons i represent
there is an objection to the whole of d thirty nine and d forty not being within the greenbelt
well y you'll appreciate why i've asked the question er mr because they supported it they made representations in support at the consultation draft stage they didn't object at the deposit stage and yet today as i understand your evidence you're telling us that they do object to site d thirty nine being shown within the inset
the objection i repeat is a UNK objection but i have no doubt that UNK consultations will have taken place not only by the bodies i represent in the past but also by your own authority
i'm a little concerned here mr
it does seem to me that the parish council are of course an elected body who will if they have views on this subject no doubt have formal minutes which will set it out one way or the other
i'm wondering whether this might be an exceptional case where er during cross examination mr might take instruction from his clients to find out what their minutes actually say
it must be a matter of record
well i indeed
so that was going to be my next question
i apologize mr
as to whether or not there were any
er as to whether there were any UNK if there are any record or minutes as to when er the change of mind occurred er because plainly there has been a change of mind
now er well th er th members of the parish council if there are any present as i imagine there are will have heard my question
let's proceed and perhaps erm at a convenient moment we could take instructions as to er what resolutions if any have been made in this regard
sir i will take this on board but i think it comes rather badly from an authority in fact both authorities which have so shown so many confusing changes of mind about this area in the whole process since the first plan was issued that the er details of the consideration by one of the constituent bodies of this erm objection er should be er examined er in such detail
erm we don't know the details of the consideration that has been given by the authorities what we are concerned with is what they are now proposing
what i believe you should be concerned with is what the erm persons i represent bodies i represent now wish to see happening with regard to these two sites
i think mr what i would like to see i don't want to go too far into the history but i would just like to be sure that er bearing in mind this complex history given on behalf of those you are representing that the views you are putting forward are the er current views of the parish council as expressed in their formal minutes
i w that is all i want to know
yes sir
as a matter of fact i'm sure
mr you and i have debated in the past er in this room er whether or not exceptional circumstances are necessary to define an inset boundary for a village which in the sketch plan of the greenbelt to have been shown as washed over
we've had that debate before haven't we
yes we've covered various subjects er more than once er so much so that er i would be much obliged if you would er focus on a particular instance that i could then have an opportunity to recall
well mr your memory appears to be very short
we debated it yesterday
right i know now what you're referring to
er you i take it you haven't changed your mind and you still maintain that exceptional circumstances are necessary because that is how you view how you read paragraph nine of p g two
yes and that is because we have an approved structure plan which indicates the general extent of the greenbelt and we're not talking here about an inner boundary or an outer boundary we're concerned with a pre standing settlement
you erm understand i think or will understand mr that if these sites are not included in the greenbelt that's to say if they are shown as part of the inset so far as the greenbelt local plan is cer is concerned they have no other designation that's to say the greenbelt local plan doesn't UNK to er allocate or to UNK the land for any other purposes
correct
it's simply the conclusion that the land doesn't serve any greenbelt purpose
yes that would be your reasoning yes
now the questions we have to address here today mr er are whether or not er this land these two parcels of land serve any greenbelt functions or not
that's the principle issue between us isn't it
not entirely
i would not exclude a consideration of the greenbelt functions served by the area but it is not for us to question the UNK of the approval by the secretary of state for the environment of the general extent of the greenbelt for york
a general extent of greenbelt within which this area lies
therefore unless excluded from the greenbelt by a particular process all land in this area must be assumed to have a greenbelt purpose
well mr that would apply to er any land lying within a six mile radius of the city centre
apart from the considerations which i mentioned a few moments ago it would indeed
well is er mr the issue which the inspectors ought to be er addressing themselves whether or not this land serves a greenbelt purpose or not
i said a few moments ago that i would not exclude consideration or the need for consideration of the greenbelt purposes served
what i attempted to tell you was that there is essentially no region that in respect of any land which lies within the general area of the UNK approved greenbelt its mere existence within the greenbelt must be taken to mean that it has a greenbelt function
but y you a are asking the inspectors to proceed on the basis that all land within the six mile radius of the city centre serves a greenbelt function
unless under some process it has been excluded from the greenbelt yes
and it would be excluded from the greenbelt because it didn't serve a greenbelt function
it might be excluded for various reasons
well what's another reason
the most obvious is that er an area had been inset because of the need for expansion of a settlement
that wouldn't serve a greenbelt purpose
it would not in the future as a result of that subsequent building
that is your UNK case
you do recall our argument yesterday
UNK which has been allowed by ryedale district council as the result of or its predecessor as the result of the creation of an inset to develop to the size of UNK
one of the er matters that er one needs to apply one's mind to in considering whether or not this land serves a greenbelt function or not is to look at the land and assess whether or not it is more closely associated with the village or more closely associated with the er agricultural open land beyond the village
no
there is no necessary requirement to do that
and although it may be one means of looking at the site it is not an essential part of determining greenbelt function
is one of the matters to which the inspectors ought to be applying their mind whether or not this land is more appropriately regarded as countryside or part of the village
no for the reason given in my last answer
is one of the matters to which the inspectors ought to be applying their mind would development of the site these sites amount to UNK into the countryside
indeed so
well how can you decide that without first deciding whether or not this land is part of the open countryside or part of the village
it is not necessary to incorporate the concept of being part of
it is simply necessary to ask whether the matter the whether the land is open land or not open land
the issue is whether or not the land is open land or not open land
it is essentially as simple as that
and all open land therefore does it follow from what you say that all open land necessarily must serve a greenbelt function
i would never in a planning matter readily make an absolute statement like that
in nearly all matters of physical planning there are exceptions
but i would say that the way to look at this site is to ask whether it is part of the built area in other words whether it is built on or whether it is not part of the built area in other words it is not built on
well that was the question that mr asked you a few minutes ago wasn't it er mr
sir at that stage the emphasis seemed to be erm a connection er whether the connection was principally with other land outside or whether the connection was with the settlement rather than the nature of the land itself
and my answers were in that sense
do you regard
er so sorry mr
i'm sorry sir
er forgive me UNK
but i don't understand the word that you're using mr
when you say land is built up presumably you do not mean simply that there is a building that there has to be a building on the land
er to a greater or lesser extent land within the UNK of that building er can also be described as built up
is that correct
in general terms yes sir one would look at the UNK of a building yes
but if on the other hand the UNK were particularly large erm then er it were otherwise UNK er it would not of necessity form part of the built area of the settlement if the situation were on the UNK
what i'm trying to understand you'll appreciate mr is the difference between the test that you are putting forward er which is whether or not it is part of a built up area and the test that mr is putting forward whether or not the land is part of the village
at the moment i'm not entirely clear what the difference is between these two forms of words
if you can help me more on that er that would i'm sure assist my judgement
i would say sir that my approach is neither
it is to look at the characteristics of the land itself rather than to associate it of necessity with the land on one side of it or the land on the other side of it
when we look at the characteristics of the land itself do we have to decide whether it's countryside or not countryside
you do not necessarily have to decide that
well what are the characteristics of this land
these sites are small fields
one's a paddock
a paddock is defined in the nineteen ninety concise oxford as a small field
therefore a paddock
i don't think we need to particular UNK
your the site c can you look at appendix two of er mrs 's er appendices please mr
while you are finding that could i make a general request of the UNK
it would greatly assist me er if i could have a copy of a one to two thousand five hundred plan showing these lands without any er heavy lines on them
i'm having some difficulty working out where UNK go because they're UNK by these twenty foot wide er lines
sir i've got one here
ah
i if that could be copied er perhaps er that would be of great assistance
thank you mr
er mr could you just repeat
i er appendix two
er mrs yes
right thank you
in order to focus in on
i don't think that's er mrs 's appendix two but i it
it it's the bigger it's the one with the bigger scale yes
presumably nothing turns on which plan
no i don't think it does i save that one makes reference to features on a particular plan
er yes
i think it may help
right yes
you've got it have you
do you s you can see where it's indicated on the plan where topic area d thirty nine is
yes
you see the land to the er generally to the east of it where there's the large pond
yes
a UNK substantial area of open land which is shown there as being within the inset of the village
yes
that land you obviously regard as being properly included within the inset
i've not made any comment about skelton hall
do you want to make any now
can you assist us
do you regard that land as being within properly included in the inset or not
i've not had the benefit of walking round the grounds of skelton hall
and the er the boundary to the north of topic area d forty nine indeed to the north of topic area
you said forty nine
thirty nine i beg your pardon
thirty nine and topic area d forty you'll be familiar with those boundaries
yes
trees hedges trees and there's a track on the northern side
indeed
and the boundary along the western side of topic area d forty is the a nineteen
yes
and er the UNK alongside the a nineteen
yes
and those are perfectly satisfactory boundaries for greenbelt purposes aren't they
yes
defining greenbelt purposes
one of the points you make in your er evidence erm mr is that because topic area d thirty nine is shown as being within the conservation area that it ought to be included within the greenbelt
that's right isn't it
on that point i would say that there are a number of considerations which arise as the result of that site being within the conservation area that UNK against development in themselves and this is in general well recognized on your side and by the er by the city council
and you're on you're supportive of the conservation area and its boundaries
yes
can you look please at your a appendix one in your bundle of appendices
yes
and if we turn er to the last page of the first appendix we can see the boundary of the conservation area
yes
it's shown by the erm large dotted line and we can see how it er follows the boundary of topic area d thirty nine
yes
would you turn back one page please and look at two pages i beg your pardon
turn back two pages and look at paragraph four of the report which we can see is headed description of conservation area
have you got that
yes
can you turn over the page again now i want you to direct your attention to paragraph four point six of this report which reads the boundary proposed for the conservation area is limited to that part of the settlement which UNK its village character
yes
do you agree with that
i have no reason to disagree
yes
thank you mr
thank you very much
mr please
thank you sir
i shan't UNK you long mr
mr erm paragraphs twenty four er to thirty of your proof draw our attention to the existence of the conservation area which was being debating a matter of moments ago
yes
yes
paragraph thirty one you deal with access difficulties
paragraph thirty two and thirty three you deal with UNK of listed buildings
paragraph thirty eight you deal with er UNK interest and paragraph forty archaeological interest
i think that's a fair summary of paragraph
that's right
none of those factors er i hope we can agree have any relevance at all do they to the issue of whether a site performs one of the five greenbelt functions
the answer to that is not straightforward
you started with paragraph twenty four which deals with the conservation area
yes
the characteristics er this is a general observation
the characteristics of a conservation are usually characteristics of special quality in environmental or building terms and as such they are likely to promote a contribution to the quality of the setting of york where they occur within the greenbelt area
and that of course is the prime purpose of the york greenbelt
i must have been UNK myself for a very long time mr
i'd always understood that land should only go into the greenbelt if it was necessary to be kept permanently open by reason of it performing one of the five purposes
now again where do i find in any government guidance a suggestion that the fact of the existence of a conservation area is directly relevant to the determination of whether or not land performs one of those five purposes
you have heard my opinion that in general terms the existence of a conservation area is an indication of the likelihood of a contribution being made to the special character of the settlement and therefore to the setting of york which is the prime purpose or the prime function of the york greenbelt
well as far as one is concerned with the a nineteen er isn't it fair to say that the northern and western boundaries are so er constructed with hedges and trees that in fact while er one is travelling along the a nineteen one doesn't actually have any meaningful view of the conservation area in any event
mr it is not necessary for a passing UNK to be able to appreciate the qualities of a settlement that he is passing
it is sufficient for the quality of that settlement to be such as to UNK improve the setting of the city
can you see york from within the conservation area
certainly
yes
yes
we'll deal with mr 's answer if you don't mind
he can erm answer for himself
mr you've taken issue with the conservation area
of course i dealt also with a large number of other factors highways environmental considerations archaeology
i take it from the nature of your answer that you would in any event agree that none of those other factors which you concern yourself with have any relevance as to whether or not the land performs a greenbelt function
certainly listed buildings do
as regards highways they do in this case because the nature of the road pattern in this part of skelton is such as to contribute UNK to the characteristics of this ancient part of the village
i would refer you to the late
erm it is a contribution by those er road patterns and the characteristics of the lanes church lane in particular UNK lane that contribute to the quality of the environment
and we are talking about this environment and the contribution it makes to the city of york
we are not talking about whether one can appreciate the city of york itself from here
the quality of skelton is what we're talking about
well i have your answer mr but i don't think that continuing this national
you remind us in paragraph twenty three of an earlier decision letter
and in that you er remind us of the view of the inspector that er this area has a strongly rural character
yeah
you have that
yes
isn't it fair to say that in itself does not justify greenbelt designation what is important is if the site forms part of the countryside and makes a contribution to it
here again i think that you're in danger of drifting from the essential feature which is that in the absence of a requirement to take land out of the greenbelt the whole of the area er within the general extent of the greenbelt as approved by the secretary of state erm has a greenbelt function
well i know you'd love to debate that with me but we devoted a whole morning to it yesterday so i'm not going to
with regard to the inspector's decision to which you refer it should be borne in mind that he was concerned with the effect which development would have and where development would be suitable or UNK
and he said that he did not consider that skelton should be allowed to expand so far UNK
he was speaking of the area around UNK lane north of UNK which was a new settlement concern within the buildings themselves
yes
mr as i read your proof you presume that by excluding d thirty nine and d forty from the greenbelt that these sites will be developed
you make that assumption and it's essential to your case is that is that fair
what i would say is that the power of the local planning authority to resist development on these sites would be UNK reduced were the initial negative presumption against development afforded by greenbelt status removed from them
well that is self evidently true
er i can't hear you
that is self evidently true
one accepts that
the simple fact is you presume do you not that these sites are going to be developed
i do not make that presumption
my presumption is that there is a suggestion that development would be UNK rather than UNK by the removal of the greenbelt protection
well it's just as i read your paragraph fifteen point two you say to exclude sites d thirty nine and d forty from the greenbelt UNK the expansion of skelton on its UNK
nothing ambiguous about that is there
you're assuming it is going to be developed along its UNK
the movement of the boundary which you seek to create is possible only under the terms of policy e ten
policy e ten requires that the boundary be moved only if a need for expansion can be established
i hear what you say and you know why i'm not going to debate that with you again today
you say in your proof paragraph forty three this is really the last point i'm going to deal with that the amendment to the deposit copy erm UNK several of the policies in the southern ryedale local plan
do you have that
i have paragraph forty three
erm c forty one is one of the er policies which you say is ignored by the suggested amendment
i'm sorry c forty one
c one sorry
c one
do you have that in front of you mr
i have c yes
c one is a development control policy is it not
it is
can you e please explain to me how a UNK exclusion from the greenbelt in itself UNK a development control policy
er it certainly doesn't do that
it is simply a case as i said in my summary that er c one is a policy that is applicable because it's a conservation area
mm
but of course there's nothing in national policy which creates erm a UNK upon development either in or UNK to conservation areas is there
no but what i have done is to give you my expert opinion that any developments within the conservation area er within the d thirty nine part of the conservation area would be likely to be destructive of the character of the ancient part of the village
i hear what you say what you're aiming to do now without ever having seen any form of proposal
but what about d forty
d forty is very closely associated with d thirty nine
you see UNK c one little one and c one little three in fact give a strong measure of protection to the er character of the conservation areas do they not
yes
e n v one is another policy you say our modification UNK
that's page sixty two of the deposit
yes i have it
mr
er e n v one
again how does exclusion of a site from the greenbelt UNK e n v one
you use the word UNK
er could you refer me to a place where i have erm er
well you say it UNK several local plan policies
so let's put it another way how does the exclusion
i think su surely mr the next sentence makes it quite UNK
the proposed change would be contrary to this policy mr says
yes
my answer to that would be that er since the only UNK reason for pushing out this inset boundary would be a need for expansion involves built development and built development would not seem to be within er the possibility of er policy e n v one as well as within the possibility of er other policies
e n v one
o one moment
mrs i c mrs i can hear your evidence as clearly as mr 's at the moment i fear
e n v one applies to land that is perceived as forming part of the countryside
you're aware that on this side of the room ryedale have stated in terms in their proof that they do not perceive this land as being part of the open countryside
the reference is four point two point seven
there's nothing inconsistent is there in UNK position having made that judgement about these two pieces of land
i'm not UNK er the erm view of the planning authorities on the grounds of lack of consistency in their interpretation of policies
i'm merely saying that their interpretation of certain policies is not UNK with my own
you refer to policy e n v one
mm
the reference in that policy is to development outside the existing built up areas
mm
i regard open land of this size as being outside the existing built up area of skelton
that's a matter for judgement isn't it
and the inspector will have to make that judgement in this case
yes i have given you my judgement on it
e n v three is another one that er that might be offended
you say our modification is contrary to e n v three
UNK e n v three as i read it is er a pure and simple development control policy
how do you say excluding this land from the greenbelt is contrary to that development control policy
well e n v three is basically a damage UNK exercise and i think that erm the qualities of this area are so great that er it would be im impossible to envisage
so if i
a situation relating to a new development under which there would not be damage
so if i short er short circuit the rest of my cross examination on these various policies that you say er we're in erm we're in some measure of conflict with your answer would be in relation to e n v eleven and e n v twelve which you also UNK do i put it fairly your answer would be this
look i cannot UNK of development taking place on this land without coming into conflict with those policies
that is the essence of your position is it not
before i answer that i must er address myself to e n v eleven which relates to ponds
right
and e n v twelve to UNK
mm
i think that the summary which you gave is fair also in relation to e n v eleven and twelve yes
can i be clear please i i'm sorry mr can i just be UNK clarified as far as e n v eleven is concerned which pond this is in terms of names
it's not it's not
this pond is not listed under e n v eleven
er it isn't either of the er ponds
no
listed in there
i think that's right isn't it mr
yes
erm i think that the exercise on ponds is not of very long standing
it's an ongoing exercise and er we have produced er sufficient scientific evidence to show that this pond is of tremendous value
UNK the
not UNK development
i rely in this matter on the evidence of experts in er UNK conservation and that is
i don't really think there's anything to be gained by any further questioning
thank you mr
thank you very much mr
i think we'll take a break now ladies and gentlemen for fifteen minutes please
thank you
erm somebody i know has asked me to er you know i don't know if you know how they compile UNK
no
well they read stuff and they get tape recordings of people talking and they go through and
mhm
analyze it and they see
mm
how words are used
yeah
because the language changes all the time
right
and they have to keep them up to date
right
and that's about what it is they've just someone's asked me if i'll just do some recordings of some of the lessons
also it'll help me to see er if i'm doing the lesson properly
oh right yeah
er it's totally anonymous
it's typed up they don't use the tape itself they type
no
it up from it with all sorts of weird accents and things put in
alright
and anything that could identify anyone is taken out
so that's a bit what it's about
erm it's tied up with dictionary it's and that kind of d do you know of the project
no don't know that
okay it's university and do that one
but they all work more or less the same
could i turn that off
oh sure yeah
the little red button on the top
the little red button on the top
oh green o it's the green one
so that should be recording now
spinning away there
yeah
and then it won't it won't bother us at all will it
erm
yeah there's that maths paper
okay
now then part of it is they ask me you don't have to but they ask me to ask people to sign erm to say it's just to say that you don't mind your conversation being used
but they won't there'll be nothing in it to identify you
oh sure yeah
they take out everything
i believe you
it's very it's all done very professionally in that it's very well controlled
have you got the paper
right
have you had a look through
yeah i had a look er through it just before when i got it
okay
it's been stuck in my bag all day
now when you looked through it and it wasn't an exam twenty sixth or something was it
yeah
did you think oh of course oh i could have done that but
yeah
any like that
erm there's a couple yeah
so we'll have a look at those and see if we can see why in the exam
yeah
it didn't that was obvious
okay
so what have we got
and this one yeah
okay
erm
erm what did you think when you saw it in the exam
erm i just erm read the question like and i just i thought it'd be like a triangle you work it out on the triangle and then i thought no that
okay
can't be right
cos it's so much longer the actual distance it UNK through dunno if it'd be flat
right
so when you looked at in the in the exam did you think oh they're not giving me enough information here or there's some trick i don't know or what did you think about it
i just thought it was erm i dunno i ju i j just UNK they were trying to get us to draw it draw it into a triangle
well did you answer the question
er no cos i realized that i was that it was totally wrong so i just gave it a miss and went on to something else
so you th so you thought ah draw a triangle and then when you sort of did you start it start the question at all
yeah i drew the triangle on the paper and i realized
and then you thought oh that's wrong
no that's
i mean you didn't go back
so you realized it was wrong
yeah
you thought oh it's not a triangle
so what is it
it's like an UNK like
it's an UNK
right so you can see now how to do it
yeah
and how d how do you it
er you measure get the erm well measure the whole UNK first
that's it
and then take that as a proportion of the
mhm
UNK
good
so you you're looking at it's not a question of erm doing much calculating or anything else it's just seeing what the problem is isn't it
yeah
if someone got the UNK gave it a flick
yeah
and it went all the way round no problem there
two pi r
but it doesn't it just does is it forty thirty degrees
mm
it's thirty over three sixty
so what was that
three marks
so it wasn't a lot on that anyway but it it's don't forget that's a good indication
i mean if they're only giving three marks for it you're not going to do a lot of geometry and all sorts of UNK and complicated things
no
it's going to be fairly straightforward
so without knowing any more than you knew when you sat the exam you could pick up an extra three marks there
yeah
yeah
just by not being thrown by the question
mhm
or er don't forget part of it especially in an exam erm part of solving er any problem is oh i know how to do this
ah that doesn't work
and then you go back
you find out what's wrong with what you've done and sort of go off in another direction or maybe follow the same direction slightly and UNK off
so don't be put off when your first attempt doesn't work
yeah
there's still time in an exam if you realize soon enough as you did to have another go
now what about this one
that one
i UNK erm c er s complete accurately below accurately below the part of the wind that shows wind directions
so i measured that it was about five centimetres
right
and so i UNK that complete must mean continue on
er but i did it at a scale like erm one centimetre for o for every hour it's blowing in that direction
so i wrote it along the top of the er paper i was using
mm
and i thi and erm i think west was seven and that's only five centimetres so i extended it another two centimetres
oh
and i thought it was complete like
and then and then completed the rest of it
but what i should have done was measured that would have been about forty nine centimetres UNK be out maybe
right
seven millimetres
right
so that was sort of completely misunderstanding the question
yeah
really
you're UNK making a an assumption that they're obviously going to use a scale of
yeah
one centimetre to whatever it is one
i mean thi this wind force here er what are they
they go up to did you do the first part of it
yeah
yeah i did that
mm
the eight angles divided by three hundred and sixty so three si three hundred and sixty divided by eight
erm well let's have a look again
the wind UNK from the north okay
calculate the size of the interior angle of the regular UNK
let's have a little bit of paper and have a look at that
you've have you had your paper back
erm y
it back today
yeah
and er then he took it back of us for some reason
that's teachers
not very helpful was it
okay
a regular UNK
erm how about if i leave you to do that one
i'll make mine a regular UNK
oh yeah
okay
so if you want to draw a UNK erm how many points equally UNK around the circle
we're going to draw a UNK inside the circle
yes there's six
six okay
and where will they come
zero degrees where's the next one
erm i see that erm this one is that's sixty degrees it yeah
right
so you're going to divide three sixty into six equal UNK
i see yeah
of sixty
and the next one
that's a hundred and twenty
okay
and then
a hundred and eighty and erm then two hundred and forty
okay
and er three hundred
okay
and then you're back to the three sixty or nought again
oh i see yeah
okay
so we've got a rule somewhere
my ruler
i keep losing my set squares and rules and things
there's one though
okay where was the centre of that
right
now this is a UNK
erm join that up okay
and we should finish up with about six sides roughly
now while i finish it off if you'd like to just measure one of the interior angles that i've already done
and what's it come to
a hundred and twenty degrees
a hundred and twenty
okay
now according to your theory that you were applying to that
yeah
one you just divide you say it's a six sided figure divide three sixty by six
oh right yeah
oops
what angle does that give that sixty degrees
where could you find that angle
erm could be UNK other side there if that was extended
okay
i think so if this was this was extended
oh right
so if you extended that
that bit there
that would be that is sixty
now we've got a very special case here haven't we
yeah
because we've got sixties all over the place so maybe it wasn't a brilliant one to try but it gives us some indication of what's going on
where's another
another sixty
erm between these connected
okay
any other ones
no
right
now that one is bound to be sixty the angle at the centre because that was how we made it
yeah
put that down and we thought right draw the circle space it out equally six equal angles is what we were doing at the same time as six equal UNK all at sixty degrees or all at one sixth of three sixty
right yeah
okay
now the UNK
could you do that one
okay
so we'll make a little centre somewhere
right
okay
right
okay
erm
so what's the angle going to be
how are you working it out
erm be three sixty divided by eight
okay
what does that come to
erm about
about
erm yeah
use your calculator
so that's three sixty er
could you do three sixty divided by four
it's nine yeah so four and a half
okay so forty five
okay
you start from wherever you like
start that way up
bit easier
good
so you'll get all your right angles marked each ninety and then the halfway points between
yeah
each ninety
this is i mean you wouldn't do this in an exam you wouldn't draw one and work how you draw it but by doing it now erm
you get to know a regular figure
you get to know sort of how to construct one
i mean now if i said make me a figure that's got ten equal sides you could do it couldn't you
yeah
or twenty
so you could construct those
and then join the join these points up to the centre
get that out of your way
so you'll be able to see
well you know what the UNK going to be at the centre already don't you without
yeah
without measuring cos it because of the way you constructed it
it's got to be forty five
so we can then when we've drawn that find out what the other angles are and try and work out what will always be true and what will depend on which angle you choose
if we draw a join a few of those up through the centre just so we can mark the angle
so you can join any two opposite corners and it'll go through the centre
yeah
erm
in fact you might as well do the last one as well
so what angle do you know absolutely definitely without thinking about it
and that is what
forty five
that's forty five
that's your three sixty divided by eight
okay
and you've got lots of lots of triangles that are the same
that's forty five right
that's forty five
it looks forty five
definitely
yeah
erm how can you tell it's forty five
well
i mean is there any way you could
it's erm
prove it
i mean you could measure it maybe and say
yeah
okay it comes to forty five
you could draw lots of these figures
you did another one sixty and it came to sixty
yeah
well it'd be for the this angle if you extended it so it'd be eight divided by the three sixty isn't it
erm
three sixty divided by eight
it looks it looks as if it is
i'm not
yeah
UNK if it whether it is or it isn't but how can we show that it is
how can we say
erm
well it always will be
oh right erm
think about what sort of things add up to one eighty
yeah it'll be all the angles on this line
okay
erm
let's say if we marked this is forty five degrees
yeah
okay
what about these two angles what do we know about them
oh right they've got to add up to a hundred and eighty
right
right
they're both the same angle for a start because we've got an UNK triangle and forty five plus two x must add up to a hundred and eighty
yeah
that one there is also x
so here we've got this angle plus two x
yeah so the two x minus one eighty is
okay
the outer one
it'll always be that one
so this'll work for anything
now what was the question
what did they ask
a size of the interior angle of the regular UNK
what do they mean by the interior angle
the angle between these two points
right
and what should it be
erm a hundred and a hundred and thirty five
okay
right i see
so you've got the right idea of dividing it by eight but you needed to take it on a stage and see what the was
erm
like i divided
yeah
UNK divided by eight then minus one eighty
mm
that'd get that angle all the time
right
yeah
it'll always work
now the other question they've got is what is the angle between the two UNK
well there's one UNK and there's the other one at right angles to this one
what's that angle going to be
it looks like forty five
erm
it looks like forty five and it's almost certainly going to be forty five and we could probably work out some reason why it would be forty five
would it be erm a hundred and thirty five for the interior angle
that's a right angle there and
yeah
that's a right angle
carry on
erm minus one eighty to get this angle
to get this one yeah
and then the same
yeah
the other way round to get that one
so if it was that one if you could get take that one it could be anywhere along the plane
if you were at a right angle if it if it was two right UNK er angle lines like that at right angles
right
so you do ninety degrees one of your ninety degrees
yeah
off the off the one eighty
yeah
okay
so are you happy with that you can if someone gives you someone says draw er a figure er a regular UNK with twelve sides you kn you know how to construct one
yeah
and by UNK it you learn its properties if you like
this is that's the obvious one
that's the
yeah
big thing
that's always divide three sixty by n to give you the angle at the centre of the circle
what about these two angles what's the important point about those then
well add up to erm plus that would add up to n a hundred and eighty
plus that they add up to a hundred and eighty
and
and they're the same
and they're
UNK yeah
right
so once you know that these two are the same you take that from one eighty UNK the answer and it'll give you these angles and if you've got that UNK if you've got these angles then you can work out most things
any q any questions they give you based on that you'll be able to do it
erm that way you'll have an understanding of it rather than just saying well this bit is always
would it work for a square
erm
without drawing it try and talk about a square
what would happen
erm
how would you work out
if you d er just sort of talk it through
drawing a circle what would you do
well you'd er mark off
mhm
every erm ninety degrees
okay
and draw through the points
you'd draw through the four points
work if you d drew a UNK
okay
the centre
you know
erm be ninety
ninety
and these angles would be
what would the angle
erm
here be
forty five
they'd be forty five
UNK yeah
so the interior angle
would be ninety
would be ninety
yeah
and the UNK angle would also be
would be forty five
would also be ninety
oh yeah it would
yeah
right
in a square
i see it
so it would work with a square
erm would it work with a triangle
erm three points the centre point
right
so what would the angle at the centre be
it'd be erm twelve
hundred and twenty degrees yeah
hundred and twenty
okay
yes but it wou cos if you had the centre point up to the top of these two that'd be hundred and twenty hundred and twenty hundred and twenty
so if someone said like do a hundred and eighty sided figure
yeah
it it'd just look like a circle
but you could do it
so you're happy with UNK
okay
so that's one if it comes up again
definitely
no problem on that
yeah
so you've obviously dropped a few marks on that
yeah
erm probably on this and on this one
the big thing there is there's no rule in life that says you know if someone says five them you must draw five centimetres
yeah
this might have been five knots five miles an hour
yeah
decide well we'll have five inches
erm it is likely that it's not a linear scale anyway
it's possibly the UNK scale
yeah
which is a sort of UNK scale
yeah
erm so don't make don't make too many assumptions
carry on with UNK
yeah
i got all of er for them more
okay
so let's have a look at the others
now you tell me which ones you think were an absolute UNK
a UNK
this was the ones here
mhm
measure the size of the angle UNK
okay
did you
erm protractor sorry
did you use that or
no cos i didn't have it at the time when i did that
would it have been an advantage to use the
erm well er yes i thought cos i'm just measuring the
yeah
it depends what you're used to
when you get used
aha
to this one you'll find it so much easier
yeah
erm it's a bit off putting at the start because it's got the two scales on
yeah
make sure you're reading the right one all the time
okay
so no problem there
you think you got did you did you see which ones you got full marks on
erm yeah
i didn't do this i d i didn't quite finish this one cos we only had erm one and a half hour to do the two hour paper like
okay
and there were how many marks on that then
erm eleven marks like
mm
mm
so at the start of the paper have a quick UNK through see where the marks are
do them first yeah
and think well i'm going to not necessarily do them first
i mean you can whi you could go through and you can pick up lots of ones and twos that build up
you're probably going to do them anyway and they're good to get you into it
so you're thinking oh this hasn't been an exam these are dead easy to just play yourself in
erm but don't like the
mm
ones the or others if you're getting stuck on them don't miss something like this that you could do and get full marks
yeah
er you know makes a big difference to your final grade doesn't it
right
any problems with these
erm no
they were they were straightforward just
okay
how did you do this one
erm i drew a i drew a erm UNK diagram
right
put my twenty one in the UNK circle or whitby circle and the thirteen in the erm scarborough circle
put x in the middle and twenty one minus x
okay
just show me how you did that one
so a trip to whitby and a trip to scarborough
you've got thirty pupils interested in one or both trips
right
twenty one interested
in the whitby and thirteen interested in the one to scarborough
so there's an x in the middle
how many interested in both of these trips
erm
now okay
you've got thirty down there that's good x in the middle twenty one minus x thirteen minus x
yeah
okay
so
so when you get to that point you you've more or
yeah
less solved the problem haven't you
if you can if you can handle simple equations you get the answer
like most of these the key
mm
is what should we call x
once you've
yeah
sorted that out then you follow your system
okay
and does that does that work out
how many would you have in here then
yes you'd have erm seventeen
so you've got seventeen in there seventeen in whitby
and eleven
okay
and then erm four interested in the both trips so
what does that come to
erm it's twelve
oh right that's not right is it no
erm
mm
okay so we've got eleven and four is fifteen and seventeen is thirty two
it says there were thirty pupils
yeah
mm
now did you see your marks on this one
erm no
i d i didn't er not on that one
no that's okay
so there's another one where probably you can pull up your marks quite easily
yeah
cos you know you know the method you know what to do it's just a question of sorting it out
you know a little bit of extra thinking about it
so one of the points that sort of comes up is you haven't used the thirty at all have you
now did they give you that and it's something you don't need or do you think maybe it's something you do need
er
i just didn't know how to apply it
mm
okay
is this basic idea okay
we've got x pupils interested in both so we've got twenty one minus x in that and thirteen want to go to scarborough okay
thirteen minus x in there
now where did this come from
twenty one minus thirteen equals two x
well you've got your x there you've got your two xs there so you subtract them and you've got
mm
and then take the UNK
well th you've got an equation okay
twenty one minus thirteen equals two x
now where did it where did it come from
show me where each term from so you could thanks very much
cheers dad
put away your er UNK
er cheers
scattered about
cheers
right
okay
thanks very much
s erm so i had to subtract these two
mm
try and explain it in terms of say let's get all these kids out into the school yard
yeah
and draw two big circles that UNK
yeah
and say now we want to sort you out see who's going where so we can organize the coach now and if you're interested in scarborough go and stand in that circle UNK whitby there interested in both then stand where the two circles UNK
yeah
okay
now take it from there
what will you what how can you work out
well erm just count how UNK erm
i mean two teachers come back and one of them says well i've counted all those who are going to whitby
and the other one says i've counted all those who are going to scarborough
mhm
and er nobody remembered to count the ones in the middle
but we do know there were thirty pupils which hasn't has that appeared in your equation anywhere
no not really
no
now erm i still don't really understand where you got this from
erm
why did you do twenty one minus thirteen for a start
well i had the twenty one and thirteen in the two groups so subtract those two and have twice the amount of x i thought i would have
erm you seem to be UNK the groups
okay
we won't go into where you go that from cos i think it sounds a bit like sort of UNK at UNK really
yeah
i'm going to get an equation out of this
you you've started off brilliantly
you've got marked on you know exactly how many are going to whitby right twenty one minus x how many are going to both and how many are going to scarborough
so what could you find out from that
that ties up with this
that ties up with
you could er subtract the number going to whitby from thirty
you could
erm
you could do something a lot
and then
simpler
a lot simpler
how many pupils were there altogether
there were thirty pupils so
and how many are there standing there in the playground
there's thirty
right
right
so an equation
yeah
count how many you've got in here
we've got twenty one minus
so twenty one minus x plus thirteen minus x is equal to thirty
and those in the middle as well
but oh twenty one minus x plus x plus thirteen minus x is thirty
right
so we just right that down that's the total
so we've got twenty one minus x those are the ones going to whitby and we've got x going to both and we've got thirteen minus x and that's the lot
now assume that this is assuming they all voted
they all said yes we do want to go
yeah
erm it would have been better if they'd given you some information to say they all voted for at least one
yeah
trip or there were four who went nowhere
okay
so
erm
what does that give you
so it'd be erm thirty four minus two x plus x erm
okay
er x
so how do you just i mean rather than do it in your head especially in an exam just what you're going to do put the add x to both sides say
erm
if you add x to minus x
oh it's three yeah
right
let's have a little look
thirty four equals thirty
right
if we just take it from there
thirty four minus x equals thirty
now as soon as you've got a minus x and you're trying to take it over to one side and you're trying to bring the other one over there's a good chance that something's going
to go wrong
so why not just follow a nice simple system
thirty four minus x equals thirty
okay
add x to each side
they go out
subtract thirty from both sides
thirty four minus thirty equals thirty minus thirty add x
okay
so x is equal to
four
which is what you've got there
and
yeah
now does it add up
it should do this time if your if is this right
we've got let's check that
got the same answer still
twenty one minus x if i give you some numbers to add up
if i said twenty seven add thirty five add forty nine add seventeen would you add them up like that
or might you put them one under another
yeah i'd probably put the numbers
okay
so
which are easier to
yes
fit ea slip easier
twenty one minus x plus x plus thirteen minus x
UNK those up
plus x and a minus x go out
that gives minus x
thirty four equals thirty
erm there may be a simpler way of doing it
now is this right
cos we're still getting x equals four
add the x to each side take the thirty off each side we've got x equals four
so what's going wrong here
seventeen and ah
oh sorry nine yeah
nine yeah
because that comes to because that comes to nine
yeah that's right
and that comes to
that comes to thirty
okay
so it does come to thirty
erm the way you were doing it will sometimes give the right answer but the easiest way
yeah
is to make sure every box is marked in there
let's do a slightly more complicated version
erm scribble on here
now let's sort this out
erm let's see okay
let's see if those erm right
this time let's take that off
this time there are twenty nine in the class
so you've got twenty nine students in the class and fifteen want to go to whitby and eight want to go to scarborough and three little UNK want to stay at home
three of them don't want to go anywhere
twenty nine in the class so what i'd like to know is erm draw the UNK diagram and find out the numbers of students in every section of the diagram
and then if you can do that you can do any problem of this sort can't you
yeah i suppose so
three
right
okay
so where are you going to start
yeah but this right
that doesn't add up to twenty nine does it
it doesn't add up to twenty nine
eleven
erm
twenty six
twenty six
okay
well spotted
i probably mean nineteen or something
let's have a look
erm okay
seven don't want to go anywhere
right
seven don't want to go anywhere
right
okay
that's great
erm that's
so you've got the various sections of the diagram
you've got the whitby lot the whitby and scarborough and the don't want to go anywhere
when you when you add them up just if you just put them under each other it makes it very easy
so keep the numbers
that goes there
that's it keep the numbers under the numbers and the xs under the xs
okay it's twenty nine right
so an x plus er
so x equals one
okay
what will that give us
that's
fourteen and seven is twenty one
fourteen
that was sent to me by the people who want the stuff
so
oh right yeah
okay what does that come to
er twenty nine
twenty nine
now you might think erm oh a bit UNK saying do it this way but it's a good system
erm also when you're when you're adding up if you get this fifteen minus x right eight minus x and you're putting
you just cross those
the numbers underneath each other and the xs underneath each other plus x and then the plus sign
x
well that goes with the numbers
yeah
then when you add them up
you don't get confused
so i can just
mm
take these two off
because there are
mm
so many it's very easy to do
yeah
lots of UNK finish up with oh that's a three x and they'll put plus three
mhm
and this way it's more obvious what's going on
there's going to be a minus x left over there and then you can add those up
thirty minus x equals how many were there twenty nine
and it more or less does itself
yeah
so as i said if i give you a list of numbers say two or three UNK numbers
yeah
in a long line UNK you'd think oh i'd like to put these UNK
yeah
and do a nice little adding up on it
so why not do it with xs because there's more chance of an error
now why it's a good idea to do it that way
so i don't in me head like and mixed up
again in an exam there's more chance that you make a little slip because there's little bit of extra edge
nerves like
a similar one
erm this time everyone's at UNK and you're asking people right if you draw this time we draw three big circles in the middle of UNK okay and ask people to come and say which football team they think is a good one
so we've got liverpool UNK and UNK rovers
so they say the instructions to the crowd are if you think liverpool is a good football team stand anywhere in that circle UNK in that circle UNK rovers stand in this one
and we get something like this
erm and let's say there are a few a few awkward ones here er who don't think any of them
yeah
are a good team
so those who think liverpool is a good one standing in that circle we've got say twelve thousand
okay
in the UNK circle we've got say fourteen thousand
and in the UNK circle we've got erm twenty thousand say
okay
and we've got thirty thousand people there altogether
now so i want to know the sort of the numbers in all the boxes
now
right
talk about it a bit before you start it
erm is it similar to the problem you've done
is it harder
is it much harder
well it's just erm it's like doing three of the previous ones isn't it like
yeah
how are you going to sort that out
erm well i'll start off labelling these w x y z
right
and er label this
that's
so as you're labelling it what do you think of the problem
erm it's er
do you think it's easy or very much harder than the last one or
just er pretty difficult eh
no
you're not going to be able to just look at it and write down something equals two x are you
no
you've got to really work out what's what
right
okay
so you've labelled your diagram and you this one is that minus w minus y minus x so on
erm it's a bit a bit awkward looking isn't it
yeah just a bit
could you have labelled it in a way that would sort of help yourself more
make it a bit simpler
those three added together so w plus x plus y plus the er the rest of e equal fourteen thousand
yeah
okay
so what's your next step from there
oh right i write it down on the paper
so erm
okay
and how many equations are you going to get do you think
erm
about
about
okay
all right
hundreds
about hundreds
erm
no erm
well okay let's look at it another way
how many equations would you l would you like
mm about one
just one or two
erm if i gave you a problem about sort of prices of apples and UNK
i suppose it no i suppose erm two w plus two three y plus x plus z
mm
if i said erm ten UNK plus six apples costs two pound forty
yeah
how much does one apple cost what would you say to that
you can't really do it really
why not
cos you've got two UNK
and
and only one equation
right
so that give you any ideas about this
you got to have two equations
two equations
how many UNK have we got
erm
three four five
no
that the i've got i know these
you know those
i've got four UNK there
so you've got four UNK so you're going to need
four equations right
does that sound a bit UNK
yeah
well so four UNK equations
mhm
and they won but they won't be difficult cos they're all linear
yeah
they're all there're no x UNK or w UNK or anything else in
but you can do them
so with that you know how much the total comes to thirty thousand
right
so i could put oh aye yeah w plus e y plus x plus e equals fourteen thousand
mm
and erm
have you used say in the first one
yeah
er
you didn't use that
so can you use can you think of an equation that involves that
the total people
well tell me tell from your diagram what's the total
thirty thousand that are there
right but that okay
oh just these added up
okay
so don't forget the one thousand who don't think any of them are a good team add all those up and that will give you a fourth equation
yeah
and all you need to do then is to find one of these in terms of the others and substitute in and it'll come out fairly easily
now you can choose these erm slightly differently
for example you've got lots of got lots of UNK in
what you could have done say was this one here that's marked e doesn't have to be all of those who supported UNK it could be just that bit
yeah
right
and you can an expression for it then in terms of that
but there's no reason why you stop at three
it could have been twenty five different variables
yeah
there are in real problems
erm with two it's not too difficult
i mean sometimes you can almost just try an intelligent guess and maybe
yeah
about the third guess you try you get the right answer
with that there's not much chance
no
okay
erm so you need to develop a system that's going to always give you a method and is always making the work easier for you and not getting you lost
okay
so that's enough i think
mm
on that to sort of show you the power of the system we were just using to erm the obvious thing to do is to label every area of the diagram and don't forget they do sometimes say seven were not interested in
yeah
in anything
label every area and then use what they give you about the total number
the total was thirty pupils add all that lot up equals thirty
and when you were doing these with lots of you've got now got w x y and z in when you're adding up if you lay them out like that
right yeah
with the UNK under the UNK it's you'll find that those horrible looking equations will UNK quite nicely cos there'll be a plus w and a minus w
i see yeah
and you'll get things that you know you'll get an equation just in x then
so it'll be erm so fourteen thousand minus w minus y minus x
mhm
and the next one then twelve thousand minus w
mm
minus y then
yeah
miss that gap plus z
that's it
exactly
and then that one
right you've got it
two thousand plus
yeah
y and x and z
so although it looks like ooh this is horrible four equations four UNK i'll be here all night
and then
it's not cos you're just
i've got
you're UNK one at a time
yeah
once you've got that fourth equation in from all this lot adds up to the total and that's the one that you seem to be forgetting that's the one you've got to try and remember
okay
so shouldn't be any problem on those
this one er i wasn't too sure either
mm looks like geometry to me
mm yeah
so a b is parallel to d c
calculate the values of erm write down possible okay
erm it's geometry
that's the answer to that
yeah
basically
it's something that i usually say leave till the last
it is a did you spend much time on that
no i j just had a l er
good
er an attempt and then i thought no i'm not
good
gonna it's a waste of time
it's the sort of thing that i would always recommend
and there's only about three marks for it anyway so
exactly
leave your attempt till the end
so rather than you going well on this nice question and you could you could have done it and picked up
yeah
another sort of six marks or maybe eight marks for the end bit of the question erm you'd spent a bit of time on this
anything to do with geometry unless you've had a lot of practice and you're very good at it you can finish up wasting time
yeah
so i would say have a go but leave it till last when you when you've done everything else and maybe you when you've just checked through to see if the others are okay
so let's have a little look here
political party making election promises
erm was that one alright
yeah
that wasn't too bad
eight percent every year
a hundred and seventy five billion
mhm
erm put it over a hundred times the eight
okay
and then you add that onto that
and the next
right
year you get
now
okay
erm mm yeah that's good
and did you do it that way you worked out the percentage and added it on
yeah
added it on after
right
what's start off with a hundred pound
yeah
and add twenty percent on
yeah
what's the final amount
hundred and twenty
okay
start off with a hundred pounds and add thirty five percent on
so a hundred and thirty five pounds yeah
okay
start off with erm two hundred and add thirty five percent on
what's your final answer
erm two hundred
okay
and seventy
so how are you working it out
it's erm two hundred over a hundred
two hundred and then work out thirty five over a hundred of that
er
work out what that comes to which is seventy and then add your two hundred on
okay
well if we do something like what we finish up with is thirty five percent of two hundred of two hundred okay plus a hundred percent isn't it
yeah
of two hundred
so what does that come to
a hundred and thirty five percent
oh i see yeah
okay
so if you want to so it's if you when especially as you're going to do it on your calculator anyway
what would you multiply to get the answer straight off
what would you multiply that two hundred by
one three five and then percentage
one point
three oh three five
three five
yeah or a hundred and thirty five percent as you said
yeah
erm if you find you've got a calculator without a percentage key and some of them haven't especially
yeah
some of the scientific ones
mine's got one
erm you can just do that
so if i wanted to find out erm let's do that one with the n h s and this time i want to know how much it's going to be it starts off at a hundred pounds
yeah
a hundred billion
okay just call it a hundred
and we increase it by ten UNK well let's say we increase it by it's not out money is it so let's really spend it and increase it by fifty percent every year
yeah
what would you multiply that by that hundred
one point five
okay
so do that try that on your calculator
so what did you get
hundred and fifty pound
right
so while that's still in times one point five again
well you've still got your one fifty in so times one point five
so two hundred and twenty five right
and leaving that in times one point five
that's three hundred and thirty seven point five
so you can see how they as if they ask you to do it over three years or five years or something
you just keep on doing that yeah
you don't you're not doing several operations and putting some in memory and bringing it back and giving yourself lots of chances of making mistakes
no
it's just multiply it by that constant thing each time
and with most with a lot of UNK i mean you don't try it unless you really know your calculator and know how it works you can just keep pressing equals
yeah
and it does the last thing you've done times the
yeah
say do it once and say we want six years put equals
yeah
more times
erm if you're going to use thing something like that in the exam i mean there's no reason why you shouldn't use that multiplying it by one point whatever the percentage is
yeah
what would you have multiplied it by if it was erm the eight percent
one point eight
one point well what would you
oh UNK oh zero eight yeah sorry zero eight
yeah okay
that's the only thing to watch that
yeah cos that'd be
UNK eighty percent
that'd be eighty percent yeah
eighty percent is one point eight but eight percent okay seven percent one point o seven
that's the only UNK with that you can get the wrong but it's very much way of doing it
yeah
okay
solve the equation
that's pretty straightforward that
expand that
you can do that
yeah
so much for its call out fixed charge plus the time
that's okay
yeah
yeah
and then working backwards
it costs
yeah
sixty five pound
and then just er just changing the subject there like
right
now if we put that on there
erm i dunno this is somebody else's paper so this is before i had a i worked it out as i th i thought it'd work out a three four five triangle
mm
did you work out it was a ninety degrees
erm yeah well i
why
i realized that cos
why
cos it looked it
no cos erm the here you've got this in a UNK
right
and if it's touching
okay
the top it's always ninety degrees
did you say that on the paper
erm i just put a little arrow with ninety degrees in the UNK
mm
cos it looked it
erm wh what they're looking for in this answer is erm because it's the angle in the UNK angle b is ninety degrees
yeah
and then carry on and do the other bit
erm you know you can look at that or you can put a protractor on it and
mm
think well that's ninety but you need to say that it is ninety because it's the angle in there
yeah
okay
right
so you'd probably get minimum marks for that
three marks for that anyway
mhm
what did you think of this
i looked at it and i er UNK
then i looked at it again and i realized that it wasn't too hard
mm
i mean i got er the only th part erm i did mess up a bit was the part here
mm
cos i got this the wrong way round
but other than that i got the right
right
now this what i'd like you to do is read it out but only read the absolute bare bones of it
we don't want to hear anything about janet having trouble with her bike and janet a powerful young woman or riding the race of her life or any don't want
yeah
any of that
it's just rubbish
when you when you're reading this through you're having a quick UNK through you can you can cross out you can sort of totally UNK
yeah
what you don't want to know because it's one of the problems here is there's so much noise
yeah
there's so much random stuff that you don't just details irrelevant
yeah
you don't want to know that she was wearing odd socks and one of them was green it's
mhm
nothing to do with drawing the graph of distance against time
so what are the important points in that
that they set off neck and neck
okay set off neck and neck
right
alright
then janet took the lead then UNK ten seconds later
mhm
then built up a lead of fifty metres
right
and so she behind all the way but caught up with her a few metres
before the end
before the end
oh just before the finish fifty metres from the finishing line
and then janet UNK her just before the finishing line
right
so all this about the north rose UNK and it's just when you see you f you said you felt like UNK
yeah
you're in middle of an exam you're trying to do everything very quickly and there's a great long UNK of text
mm
to plough your way through
erm so get sort of practise reading it so you can cut out the irrelevant stuff
and a good thing as i say is to just erm highlight the stuff that you want if you've
yeah
got a UNK or maybe underline it and maybe even cross out
yeah
because you rea you're going to read this about three or four times aren't you
yeah
before you understand what on earth is going on here
they started off neck and neck
they started off together
okay
this one goes in the lead and then stops and then the other one goes in the lead and then she puts a UNK on and catches up
you'll read that sort of round and round a few times before you get it straight in your head what's
yeah
going on and you don't need all this UNK in it as well
so your first time through you can cut some of that stuff out and then you've got it
you've got the bones of the problem
then you can work with it
erm so do you think you got it sorted out roughly
even i mean you didn't quite get it sorted out in the exam but
no
did you think that you know what you've done wrong now
yeah
and how to do it
yeah
there's there is often something on distance time graphs and also quite often it's like that
now i think that's not a maths question
no
no
that's an english question
yeah
i mean if you i don't know if you know of anyone whose standard of english is quite poor
no
but their maths are okay
mm
now that's quite an unfair question
cos if they can't read through a lot of text and sort it out they haven't got much chance
no
they just sit there UNK for half an hour and then
right time's up
okay
so you're alright on UNK time train
yeah
train UNK
mm
you just draw a line of best fit you know line of best fit through erm all the points well
okay
the one that goes nearest the majority of points
one goes nearest the majority of points
okay
so if you've got a load of points all here
mm
and there's one stray off here you'd go through that way the line of best fit
ignore any UNK
mm
okay
how about the gradient of the line
that's like the average what is it it's a distance so it's the average speed that's been travelled throughout the journeys
mm
erm
the gradient of a line okay there's a there's a bit of graph paper
okay x is and there's a line
what's its gradient
erm the change in the y
okay it
so change in the
it it's so measure the gradient of that and tell me what it is
i'll make it so they're nice and e even
now you said you'd make it even
yeah
what did you mean by that
oh t i had two point nine by three
mm
by seven point nine
okay
the one you made nice and easy was the nice and even was the y
yeah
which one are you going to divide by
the y so change in y over change in x so
mm
you're going to divide by the x
oh yeah best off doing the yeah
it doesn't matter cos you can
better get rid of that line yeah
probably pencil
okay
and what does that come to roughly
it's about erm two point eight
right
two point eight
seven centimetre
so that's erm
what's the units
i don't know it's just whatever the
well what have you done
what did you do
oh i cha i divided y over
you divided
divided the change in y
so many millimetres
yeah
by another number of millimetres
oh right oh millimetres that's it yeah
and what's the answer
erm millimetres
millimetres divided by millimetres is what
yeah it's millimetres square
millimetres erm the other one
what is it
erm what's x divided by x
one
er one x
just x
just one
it's just millimetres
no it's just one
it's not millimetres it's nothing
it's just a number
so that's just millimetres then yeah
it's millimetres divided by UNK no it's not millimetres
no this
the answer is not in millimetres
the answer is just a number
oh right
it's a ratio of one length to another
okay
yeah
find the ratio of that height to that length
mm
okay
and let's say it's a third
mm
it's not a third of metre a third of a UNK or a third of a UNK it's just a third the ratio of that length to that one
okay
i see
so the ratio of that length to that one is point four
but the gradient the gradient of the hill erm you could express it in terms of an angle couldn't you
yeah
if i say is that hill very steep
ooh yes about forty degrees
so if we look at this
twenty five
twenty five
find the tan of twenty five degrees
it won't be in centimetres or millimetres it'll just be a number
two point four six
right
six three
that's a much more accurate way of finding the gradient
just find the tan of the angle
you don't have to measure
you've got two measurements here
this two point eight isn't accurate
no
it's what plus or minus point one almost
yeah
i mean point one of a UNK not much
you could be almost well you could at least plus or minus point o five
yeah
right
which is a big percentage that you're and both of these could be out
one could
yeah
be too big and one could be too small which would make a big difference
but you can measure the angle pretty accurately on that to s to within say half a degree and have its tan
right yeah
erm because there's your angle there's that and this is opposite over adjacent
so the gradient it's a ratio it's not no units to it not metres millimetres or anything else and it's the tan of the angle
so the gradient gives you a UNK if i gave you the gradient if i said the gradient is one what would the angle be
erm
how would you find the angle
just one and then do the tan backwards
okay tan to the minus one
five
so there's a that's what gradient means the tie up between them
it's not in some cases like erm the diagram you were doing about the two girls running erm then the distance against time gradient will give you speed give you velocity
we've done the roses you're okay on the UNK you know about that now
yeah
i mean if it hadn't got a there's noise in the problem there's
yeah
irrelevant stuff
if you if you strip it down to the
actually i didn't know how to do the UNK
i wasn't sure how to do that
okay
but you know now
erm
that was pretty st that the height of just a bit of
it's a bit of UNK and a bit of pythagoras
yeah
in together
and the area
what is how about that one
what is the square root of six point four by ten to the ten to the five
well erm eight hundred but when i did it wrote it into normal terms like six point sixty four with one two three four UNK
mm
and then i square UNK it
mm
erm yeah i square UNK it
okay
yeah that's a good way to do it
mm slightly more easier for you is just multiply it by one of those tens so you've got sixty four by ten to the four
the square root of sixty then take the square root of
eight
the square root of the sixty four is eight the square root of the ten to the four ten squared
oh right yeah
yeah
erm okay
it's a good way to do it to if you think oh i can't really handle this going on here put all your UNK on and then you can work out what they come to
okay
erm weather stations near the north pole
we should start ringing alarms bells a little bit
so what did you do for this one
right i measured well it's seven kilometres apart so i measured the distance between them
ah
mm
erm in centimetres or millimetres
and it came to five
it wasn't seven centimetres eh
no so it's
and it should have been shouldn't it
fifty millimetres
right
okay so you worked out what the scale was
yeah
and then what did you do
erm i so it was for one so seven kilometres is equal to fifty millimetres
mhm
i did erm
yeah
so you
seven
work out your scale that comes to
so seven over five
and then what did you do for this next bit
it knows it's between four and three UNK kilometres away
yeah
so er point seven one er is equal to one UNK
mhm
so work out the
yeah
so four kilometres so multiply point seven one by four
yeah
you worked out what that would be
and then
on the one the scale and then what did you do
yeah i worked out what this would be on the scale
that's from t so i dr drew a line a UNK a UNK
a circle
right
so i did round there
yeah
and a smaller one round there
right
so you work out
what the scale is so you can set your radius and draw your two circles and say it's in there somewhere
yeah
okay
that should get full marks
yeah
bit
mm
erm er that trig UNK there again
mhm
and then er just work out the length of this and then the length of that and then subtract these two lengths
so that's quite a nice question
erm seven marks on that
okay
transformation
you alright on the transformation
yeah
yeah
you've been doing those alright haven't you
ah
mm
how many of those can you get out of one of those eh
erm
how many UNK of water to fill the tank
okay
so you UNK calculate the volume
yeah
that one's no problem
yeah
you think right i've done that with me fish tank
that one
what did you do for that
erm i used the equation sheet which he UNK wrote on the board
right
okay which would have been on the front of your paper
yeah but he we didn't have any
right so as soon as you see that you think
ah volume of a cylinder i know UNK straight to the front
look at it and then erm measured it i did i d and then i UNK this one and put it in the same scale
yeah
and then erm the answer i got for this
mm
so
divided it by that
you what did you used centimetres here did you
yeah
right
good
because that thing you did with the fish tank has shown
yeah
you that you can't say well one centimetre is a hundredth of a metre so
no
one cubic UNK going to be a hundredth of a cubic metre
it's obvious
it's not it might be obvious but it's not true
okay that that's the big thing they're looking for there
convert it to the same units use the formula and then i mean that's a gift that isn't it
yeah
mm
six marks there for nothing really
imagine them all bringing their UNK to fill the tank
mm
now you've got to UNK it again in cubic metres
yeah
and work out how many seconds
there's nine marks on that
yeah
really a gift wasn't it
yeah
i mean it's a it would be a joy to do it as well cos you think i know how to do these
yeah isn't this easy this is relaxing
okay
erm i think you know there how to pick up quite a few
quite a few more marks yeah
quite a few marks without you learning anything
no
that you don't know already
yeah
yeah
it's just sort of looking at 'em a bit
erm the geometry one that we didn't look at you might be able to spot it in minutes
yeah
you know seconds even
you might be still on it twenty minutes later
yeah
so keep it for the end and keep it for when you've not only done all the questions but had a quick check through to see have
yeah
you done something daft
yeah
cos that's where the marks are thrown away
not
yeah
not something you can't do but something you've done ten times before
you just make a one silly mistake like
and you just think you know you like you've put metres instead of centimetres on the
the UNK or something like that and you think oh that's not right that you will spot
like when you write a letter and you read it through and you think ooh i've missed a word out here
mm
or i've you know run two words in together or something
so that few minutes at the end is important for picking up these extra marks you've been trying to throw away okay where you can do it and the few minutes at the beginning is to look through and find that question wherever it was that one on the last page
lot of marks going for it dead ea and again it's a s it's a joy to do this sort isn't it
yeah
cos you can see where you're going all the way through
yeah
you know that you know it it's nice
it's just like nice and easy
and you feel really confident about it you think wow this is UNK up the marks
so look for the good ones don't spend too much t there'll only be one little geometry thing
yeah
UNK about with triangles and circles and stuff like that
so have a go
and it's only about two or three five marks
exactly
so have a go at it when you've done the others
okay
well i'd better get off
another one to get to soon
that's mine
that's yours
right
practise with that protractor
yeah
so that you get used
to it so that you prefer to use it to the other one
have both but if you've got bearings
it easy to b better
use that
if someone gives you a UNK to draw
yeah
use that cos it's not UNK
yeah
around UNK it
i mean in the time is takes you to do a sketch you can draw accurately
be easier to
draw round it dot draw even if you then sketch it without using a straight line if you just join up the dots UNK
yeah
you get a very good sketch and you can see what's going on and you can see the angles
that's your one
erm next week
what's happening about that
where are we
i'm on holiday then so er
you're on holiday
right
yeah
okay
so is that for what about the week after that
erm no i think i've got about two weeks off
okay so i'll see you erm
so we break up on wednesday that's friday so three UNK
three UNK
yeah
so i'll see you in about i'd better work out what the date is
erm
can have a look on the calendar in there
okay
and probably be an idea if you remind me sometime during that week when i'm due to see you
alright yeah i'll give you yeah
just give me a just give me a ring
but er we'll skip the next three then
alright yeah
okay
i better remember my tape recorder
okay
erm i've found out when the exam is
yeah
it's erm right at the end of the month of the rest of the exams
okay
so erm yeah it's well at the end of the month
so have you got what's the best
helps me to sort of see how the UNK going
right
so that's maths is it
how do you feel about last week's
erm it was good i made a lot of progress in it
compared to usual
yeah
yeah
that that's how i felt that you were getting into it you were understanding how the bits tied together
yeah
and making sense of it
so you're feeling happier with it
yeah a lot better
okay
erm what you done since last time
erm i did that work you asked me to do
great
great
and did it make sense
sort of yeah
i was a bit
okay
it got away a bit you know and
this is what i'm saying last time that if you'll work through it understand it oh yeah i can do that
yeah
but if you if you if that's all you do then in eve even a week's time but definitely in a few months' time it's just gone
you'll just have this vague memory that ooh i could do that once now where d how do i get started
yeah
how do i get into it
so you need the practice
erm been tending to concentrate on specific things which you know stand a good chance of being on the paper and even if they're not will help you with others
so how much of it did you understand
erm
which bits were you happy with
the positive and the negative
okay
erm
so from your table you could find out
yeah
there's a good chance that one of the UNK will go with one of those negative
yeah
and you can make something out of it
right
now what were the bits that were a bit tricky then
erm just remembering say i had to put four o hs with n h i was sometimes i was getting it right sometimes i was getting it wrong and stuff like that
right so for the for the diagram
it was just where i was putting the four i wasn't sure about
yeah
the diagram was okay
what was physically happening you could relate to that and you got that sorted out
now how do you put it down on paper
what's the notation
that
yeah
that's the only problem okay
yeah
so you're understanding it
you could explain that to me
yeah
yeah you could say what it looked like and what was happening and then say well i'm not quite sure what the convention is for writing them
right
down
well that's fine
i mean the convention is each of these ex i mean what you could have you could put brackets round everything
if you think of maths you can you can put brackets in where you don't need them can't you
yeah
so you could put there
if i wanted to do something like three add six i could put brackets round the three and round the six and it wouldn't make any difference
erm if i put two times brackets three add six it does make a difference
mhm
yeah
mm
it makes a big difference
well it's the same with this
if you put something like n h and then o h four well the convention is that when it's a UNK stuff a UNK and a UNK below the line there and just after it only applies to the last element
yeah
usually mean the last letter cos most of the UNK well a lot of the le the elements have one letter
so that would just be four hs and one o
right
to make it mean that you've got four os as well you put it in brackets
so with the maths it's like it's the difference between four times o h or just sort of o plus four h four o plus h
so anything that you've got four of put a bracket round it
right
erm if we had something like erm n h four and we had something with a UNK of eight say which is impossible
yeah
but we had one with eight so we'd have we'd have the whole thing there twice
so how many hs would you have in that weird thing
er eight
yeah
and how many UNK
one
no eight
two
two
so
yeah
anything inside your brackets multiplied by what you've got outside just the way you would have two times brackets three add six close brackets
okay
yeah
so it's the same with this
it's just a slightly different convention but
mm
basically it is maths
it's telling us how many sets of different things we've got
right
so let's have a look what we've got here
so got n a positive o h negative n h four positive and o h negative now what's going on here
you've got an alkali trying to react with an alkali
is this is this what you're supposed to be doing
well that's
no wonder you had trouble
is that what i wrote er right what that's what i wrote but what i said was each of the acids reacting with this starting
ah
with hydrochloric okay
one
these are two these are two common UNK
UNK
okay there's n a o h which is what
er sodium hydroxide
okay
and n h four o h which is
nitrogen hydroxide no er
have a look in the tables what n h four is
n h four UNK
UNK
UNK
okay
n h three on its own UNK when it's combined with something else it's n h four ion and it's UNK
like erm chlorine on its own
chlorine combine it with
sodium it becomes a chloride
right
so let's have a look at that now
you shouldn't have any problem with so you've tried there with which acid do you want to use
UNK probably the simplest so have a go with that first because then you can see the pattern
er hydrochloric acid is
erm
erm
no erm
it's got
erm
hydrochloric what does that sound like
hydrogen and chlorine
okay
h c l that was it yeah
right
i couldn't remember
okay great
so it's h c l and c UNK got a UNK of one so that's nicely balanced one c l with one h plus
erm now you've done that quite a few times before n a o so do the n a o h first and you should be able to UNK through that
yes
erm
so then you can work out which are positive and which are
right
UNK the one we tend to treat as a metal
yeah
hydrogen is positive
right
chlorine is a negative
er sodium is a positive
hydroxide is
you've got one here there are some on this
yeah er negative
right
yeah
so
so most of these are one positive and one negative
so the hydrogen with go with hydroxide
okay making
erm so that's h two o plus this two h UNK there
yeah where does the two go
down there
right
okay
two goes down there so it's two what two whatever letter came before it
yeah
two hs and one o
and on the c l we add the so yeah we get sodium c l is a negative n a is a positive how many that's spare one spare
okay
transfer that's n a c l
yeah that's it
that's
h two o and
s o you write the equation out for that now
that's n a c l
erm the sort of
erm
from what you start with from what it gives
from the hydrochloric acid and the
oh right
h c l plus n a o h is equal to n a c l
right yeah
plus h two o
right great
so what's the sort of general term for this is an
hydrogen chloride
yeah er what about this then
sodium hydroxide
and it's an example of what
an alkali
okay this is
er acid
so you can just write under it acid plus
acid plus
gives
equals n a c l is a alkali
erm
no it's not it's a salt
good it's a salt
and you know what
and water
right and that's a general reaction that happens with virtually any acid and any alkali
acid and any alkali
salt and water
er so have another go now at a similar sort of reaction
same acid this time use a different alkali
use UNK hydroxide
which is UNK n h four
usually put the acid first
right the acid and what acid gonna use
so use the same one
so h c l plus UNK hydroxide that's n h now it's got four spare ones and the hydroxide has got
er whoa now it's n h four right
yeah
so put the put the four on for n h four
now if you look it up on the table let's have a look at erm say calcium double positive
right zinc double positive this type of ion
UNK positive
is a UNK positive
but n h four
so it's a single positive
oh right
okay
yeah
so
it's four hydrogen with the
four hydrogen one nitrogen all their bonds got get together and there's one the result is one positive bond left over
right
okay you're not too bothered about what's going on internally
so it's n h four o h
so n h four o h because it's just one positive on that whole n h four cluster and we think of that as an entity
that's a positive that's a negative er that's a positive that's a negative
mhm
so the positive the negative
yeah that's good
and the negative the positive
that's it tha i like the way you did it because that's a good one to do first the h positive and the o h negative are going to give you the water
now what are you left over with it's a nice that for working it through
so that put the equals underneath so h so the chlorine and the n h four chlorine has got one spare one
right
and so's n h four so it's n h four c l
right
small UNK don't forget
oh yeah
plus
okay so just write the equation out again
no need to write acid plus alkali
okay
now try do you remember the formula for sulphuric acid
sulphuric acid erm yeah i will do now
okay or nitric if that's easier whichever one
yeah
comes first
erm n a o h no that's sodium hydroxide
the ones ending in o h
yeah
are the UNK
yeah
okay
the acids all start with
i know it it's just that
with an h
yeah
well you know we put the h first
h two s o four
brilliant
okay
yeah
so h two s o four right before we go any further with that h two s o four how many hs in it
two
and how many UNK
one
good
one s
if we'd put brackets round
four os
the whole lot and then a four down there it would have been four but four os only one s
right
okay
plus erm plus you could do UNK erm now let's have a calcium erm hydroxide
calcium that's c a two plus c a and that's a double positive
right so
so i'm gonna need two hydroxide
two UNK cos they're just a single negative
which is o h
o h now how many of those do you want
in brackets
great
and there are two
right
you got the o h is the bit you want twice so write it down put the brackets round it and then the two
right
hydrogen is positive
right
so that's positive
the sulphur UNK
sulphate
sulphate is a double negative
yeah UNK was a good sort of
and then i'm a bit
any of the UNK any of the UNK have got oxygen in
yeah
in as well
so nitrate has got nitrogen and oxygen in it
the calcium is a double positive
and the o h is a that'll be a double negative cos there's two of them no
well now no
no cos they're joined together that'll be a single negative
o h o h is a single negative but keep it inside the bracket that's it and don't forget the two applies to everything inside there so
yeah
we'll finish up with two negatives one from each o h
so hydrogen
right
UNK with the o h
yeah
and the s o four UNK with c a the calcium
so hydrogen there's two of this hydroxide
two UNK so if you just write twice just write o h negative and then another o h negative
yeah h two er no yeah i need h two o h mm no two h two o
brilliant
two h two o yeah
what we've got if you write them out separately
yeah
just to show what's happening
what have we got we've got two lots of h positive okay there's one h positive and there's another h positive
yeah
they're two separate it's h positive times two
what have we got here o h negative times two
two lots of o h negative
right now we're just back onto what we were doing here
one h positive one o h negative gives you the h two o we've got two lots of that so we're going to get two h two o
mhm
and you've even and you've even balanced the equation as you've done it
and then what's left over
right
two h two o and now we've got the sulphate and the calcium
mhm
and they're both double negative and double positive
that's right
so it's c a s o four
so that's something that you've never done before an equation you've st perhaps never even heard of calcium sulphate
but just from that little table which you'll get used to as work through them you can work what would happen
so you can
mm
work out what would happen for any of the any of the acids with any of the UNK
mm
erm do you want to try another one
yeah
yeah
it's the time to do another one is when you think oh yeah there's no problem here i've definitely got this
then it's a good idea just to do another one and make sure
okay sh so erm let's try mm say stay with erm sulphuric acid so sulphuric acid plus erm
sulphuric er yeah
sulphuric acid plus what shall we have out of this lot
erm
how about UNK erm hydroxide
h two s o four
yeah
plus what was it again erm
UNK hydroxide
UNK n h four er
o h
right
i know that's a positive that's a double negative the n h four a positive and that is a negative
so again the h two and the o h
right
make er h two o
okay
h o plus
what have you got left over
the s o four and the n h four that's a double negative and that's a single positive it's going to be two n h four s o four no erm let me think about it again er
what's wrong with
s o four n h two n h four
it's you were
yeah
you were right the first time
right
so it's n h four
two n h four i said
you're going to have two lots of n h four right
let's say we were doing
right now what do you mean by that
what does this two apply to
erm the n h four so brackets
let's
with the two afterwards
right brilliant
so s o four bracket n h four two
right so it's the right way round n h four n h four twice so n h four two
s o four
s o four
right
erm when you put two h two o what did you mean two h two o wherever it was there it is
two waters
yeah and how many UNK all together
er one oh no two four UNK
and how many UNK
two
right so if you put the number in front it's as though you've got brackets around the whole lot
i mean
mm
really you should have brackets round the whole lot but we don't bother to put them
yeah
should do it's a bit UNK in the notation convention
so if you just wanted two UNK when you put it down here
if you just wanted two n h fours you'd put it down here
okay
yeah
so i think you've definitely got that
right
very well on that
erm UNK and what else any other UNK that you've heard of
erm UNK
okay now just stick with those
i'm just think i i'm just thinking
don't worry
er
there's one in there
yeah i'm just thinking
another ate
and it's not it's not the same as these as these it's not
UNK
UNK yes there is a UNK
erm there's one down there
carbonate
carbonate which is not quite the salt not the sort of thing you get from an acid normally like sulphuric acid give you the sulphate
what's the special thing about carbonates and acids
i mean is a carbonate erm an alkali
erm no
what happens when you drip an acid on a carbonate
don't know
do you know any carbonates
are you UNK up
i'll just i'll just
so what happens when you drip acid onto a carbonate
do you know any carbonates
not really no
well i probably do but
okay er have you come across calcium carbonate
yeah
what's that look like
erm
is it normally a solid or a liquid or what
a liquid
no erm it's a solid
okay what sort of rocks have you come across
erm marble UNK
marble UNK okay so what happens when you drip acid onto marble UNK
er you told me last week
remember but i can't remember
er have you ever seen it done
no
er
i may have been absent or something
right okay
what often happens when you drip acids onto things
they react
react maybe it's carbonates they
UNK
yeah UNK they UNK a bit
what's happening
er they're producing gas they're giving off
okay what gas
carbon dioxide
right
mm
so acid plus carbonate gives
er carbon dioxide
right and probably a few other things
yeah
let's see if we can work out what it is
so let's pick a nice simple acid
the choice is yours
erm
which is the easiest one to play with
h c l
yeah h c l good choice plus and we'll pick an easy carbonate er we'll pick the one that we normally use calcium carbonate
which is c a erm and carbonate is c o three c a c o now that's a positive negative the calcium is a double positive double UNK positive yeah
and the c o three is a double negative
right
right hydrogen and the carbonate so there's going to be h brackets two c o three yeah
okay well maybe
it's a good try
erm the chlorine and the calcium it's a double positive er
ah you remembering anything
go on carry on
i could write two h c o three
erm well what's the difference between h two c o three and
er
two h c o three
that's two of h c o three
right
h two is just two of h
right so there i they're not the same compound at all
you can't just
no
swap one for the other
so what's happening with the chlorine then
er two c a yeah
okay
now we usually write the metal first
yeah
so we'd have calcium chloride
yeah so i'll rearrange it
okay how would you write that
just rearrange that
right
okay well that's quite possibly what does happen
now go to the c l it's just one element we don't need the brackets it wouldn't be wrong to write the brackets round it but we don't usually bother
no
you can just write c a c l two
right
for that
now this thing h two c o three erm so you've tried the reaction you've tried these different compounds
mm
pull 'em apart shove 'em back together again see what you can make
and you've made this thing hydrogen carbonate
yeah
and calcium chloride
the calcium UNK definitely going to get formed
but we decided that you get carbon dioxide
oh yeah
right so maybe this is an intermediate stage we don't know but we know carbon dioxide comes out of it
what would happen if you took carbon dioxide out of this
UNK do
mhm
you know the formula for carbon dioxide
er di is two isn't it
right good
so it's carbon which is c
right
c o two
okay so just re write c o two underneath it
c o two
now if you took c o two out of that what would you have left
you're left with h two o er so it's
right
h two o plus c o three
plus c o two
right
yeah
yeah
plus c a
c l two
no you don't need the brackets
yeah
it's better without the brackets they'd probably accept it with
okay so this was worked out not really knowing anything about what's going on here we've got that and that go together what would happen well pretty good bet that you'd get this calcium chloride cos that seems to form pretty easily
mhm
the other reactions we've had
calcium hydroxide hydrogen chloride you get calcium chloride formed and you got this thing well it's quite likely that this does form initially but it doesn't last very long and it's not very stable and it
right
splits up splits up into carbon dioxide and water
mm
erm and that's it we've sorted out the reaction
so just going back to these UNK sulphate has got sulphur and oxygen in it a carbonate has got what
er carbon and
and
oxygen
a nitrate has got
nitrogen and oxygen
now a chloride
chlorine and
just the metal and the chlorine so sodium chloride would just be n a and then c l
UNK
would have
UNK yeah chlorine and oxygen
that's it so there is a system behind all these weird names
yeah
there's a bit of a system
erm once you sort of crack the code and get into it things you've never heard of when they come up you when you know the system you think oh well i know what i know what it means by that
so if someone said erm UNK or UNK say what's the difference between calcium UNK and calcium UNK what the difference be
UNK is just the UNK with the
yeah
metal UNK is UNK with the oxygen
good so it might be it might be something like b r o three or b r o or b r o two something like but it would have oxygen to go with it
so you're building up now i think a good understanding of the er terminology
right
and a good understanding of the systems and putting these numbers in the equations
yeah
so as you feel happier with that you'll b more able to play with them
but unless you do play them
forget it again
exactly it'll be cos we looked at this last week as you said at the end what happens dripping acid onto
onto chips now the things to know about acids bases and salts
a metal plus an acid what happens
a metal and plus an acid
drip metal onto an acid i'm sorry acid onto a metal
right
think that might be a bit difficult er
it might be a bit awkward if you it might be highly reactive if you dropped UNK metal onto it
erm it UNK and produces carbon dioxide
mm would it no a metal with an acid
it's a metal erm
erm it UNK
right so there's a gas given off which is
carbon dioxide
hydrogen
okay right so there's a s there's a system to what's going on with the acids and it's not just one acid like hydrochloric most of the acids will do it some of them do it very readily some of them you have to get the conditions right often you have to get the temperature high to make it to make the reaction go but a metal plus an acid erm there's a typical one zinc h two s o four gives zinc sulphate and the hydrogen
yeah
and you can think of that pretty easily if you look at your table erm just write down with the charges on the ions what h two s o four looks like
h two s o four
right erm what's the charge on that h
positive
right good
er double negative
yeah great how did you work that out
er the hs are positive
right
yeah and there's two of it so that
good so that was i like that because you worked it out you didn't look it with table you
yeah
good
so it's h two s o four plus erm a metal erm chose zinc then shall we try it no we'll use zinc
yeah
have you got it in here
no
no
okay we'll use erm
yeah zinc ion
right
z n two plus
right
thought it should be in there cos it's normally okay now all that happens here if you if you think of it going back to the picture with the UNK or the UNK charges or bonds whatever you like to think of it
yeah
you've got an s o four with two bonds on it and it's holding on to a hydrogen
yeah
in each one
and the zinc comes along and pushes the hydrogen out it says hang on i want that sulphate
yeah
and it UNK the hydrogen and that we that's why we describe it the zinc UNK the hydrogen from the acid
so zinc sulphate gets formed the UNK the zinc just goes in place of that h two
so it becomes z n s o four
and the two hs that got pushed out
h two yeah
yeah
h two and the charge erm now ah hang on yeah this is this one is a bit tricky because that is not a zinc ion that's zinc just on its own so it's just z n
right
erm it wants to be a z n double positive and go with the sulphate
yeah
if you like so it UNK the two positive charges off the hydrogen cos in these equations the charges must balance as well so that if you just cross the double positive out you need to you can't write it in but you need to remember that it wants to become a double positive given
yeah
the chance
so the zinc comes along pushes the hydrogen out takes its two charges off it as well
right
and you're left with h two
so that's the first sort of reaction with acids
a metal plus an acid and most of the metals and most of the UNK give you hydrogen
some of them you remember the table we had a long time ago showing the UNK of different elements particularly the metals when we were looking at metals
erm some metals are much more reactive than others
i mean some metals with an acid a fairly weak acid will give you hydrogen some metals will give you hydrogen just with s water
or with steam
and some of them it's hard to get them to go so but in general any of the fairly reactive acids and any of the fairly reactive metals they're going to give you a salt and hydrogen
so metal plus acid gives you a salt and hydrogen
and you can do that
then we've got a base plus an acid what's the difference again between a base and an alkali
a base
mm
is neutral no a base
is an alkali a base
yeah
yeah okay
a base
so what's so special about an alkali that's not quite a special about a base
erm
an alkali is a base but a base isn't an alkali
hey
yeah
erm an alkali is contained in the base family but it's got a special property
erm
it's a fairly simple physical property actually but they're soluble
right
so
mm
but this thing we've been doing with an acid and an alkali most of the bases will do it as well
yeah
so let's try that one
now the base is erm most of the UNK are bases the metal UNK so what would magnesium oxide look like
and what's going to happen if we get it to react with h two s o four
so try that one h two s o four plus magnesium oxide what's that going to be
m g oxide
is
so that's a double positive a double negative that's a positive double negative so h two and the o so that's gonna be that'll be a double positive because there's two of it wouldn't it
it's well
yeah
erm
you wouldn't write it like that but
you'd write it as a single positive okay now because there's a two
but because there's two of it
down there you've got two
yeah
negative two positive
that's
UNK on it
h two o plus s o four erm that's a double negative so the goes there so magnesium m g s o four
let's have a look
oh that's a shame
what
was going to say check it in the book but i gave you wrong one
never mind
okay i'll do the other one
okay check it yeah okay try the other one then
erm an easier one in fact
erm magnesium oxide with hydrochloric acid
m g oxide which is o right with
hydrochloric acid
h c l and that's a double positive
right
double negative
good
that's a single positive
right
that's a negative
right
right
and what's going to happen what was the first way you can see
magnesium chloride
well try the one you tried in the first equation
oh yeah
we did
oxygen and a hydrogen
right so what have we get we've got one o negative
so that'll be h
o erm
two o
yeah that's the h two o
where did the two hs come from you've only got one there
er you'll add another
okay put a put a two in front now
and what's that going to give you
two that's going to become a double
so it's going to give you two hs and two c UNK
two c UNK so that'll be h two o plus magnesium chlorine so that's a m g c l two
brilliant go on see if that's well i'm saying so see if that's what it gives in the book
m g o
it just says it's UNK but i mean when it when it when it happens
yeah
because magnesium chloride is soluble it'll be dissolved in the water and you'll finish up with a solution of magnesium chloride
that's it so metal and acid gives what
a metal and an acid gives erm er water and
this is the one that doesn't give water
oh yeah er
what did the zinc do to the hydrogen
carbon dioxide and
hang on hang on metal and acid say think of the zinc and which acid was it we used h two s o four what did the zinc do to the hydrogen
er it pinched its
good go on it what did it do
right it pinched its UNK its electrons
right it pinched its place and it pinched its charge it UNK it pinched it out of its nice UNK relationship
so you get hydrogen
and it liberated the hydrogen okay
so that's an acid plus a metal now an acid plus a base which is this one we've just done a metal oxide the metal UNK are bases er you can think of them as being UNK we call it basic but very similar sort of thing to UNK okay so what happens with a base and an acid
with a base and an acid
well what happens with an acid and an alkali
er acid and alkali er it gives a water and UNK
right great and what happens what seems to be happening with a base and an acid or an acid and a base
erm gives off hydrogen ah no gives off
it gives you well this is
erm
this is one that you did here
it gives off water
this is one you did here yeah you get water and
er the metal chloride magnesium chloride
in this case in this case you got a chloride if you'd used sodium you would have got sodium chloride which is
er
oh right salt
so this is magnesium chloride is also a
er salt
right so we tried
couldn't eat it though
acid and a base
mm
acid and a base and we get salt and water try alkali and a base you get salt and water so they're very similar reaction the base and the acid and the alkali and the acid
they're the same sort of thing they're UNK each other
and the other one with the carbonate what happened then
the one you
er
worked out yourself
the carbon which one was that erm cos there's so many of them now i'm getting a bit
i know and i'm trying to pile them up now and let you see the patterns so these
the carbonate i can't remember what it is i'm getting confused i
okay right you mentioned it a few minutes ago you suggested that this thing was formed
which one wa i can't remember what i sa i was saying a f a lot of things a few minutes ago
right okay carbonate
what's the er what's the symbol for carbonate
er c o
yeah c o
two
three
three yeah
c o three and what did you take out of that
an o no c ah
let's go back to where you did it here
what you did was you tried h c l plus calcium carbonate
yeah
okay and you sorted this out very nicely what was going to happen and what you'd have left over
right so you got your calcium chloride out and then you got this h two c o three
which we said do
left over
erm er carbon dioxide
right so you looked at this h c l plus c a c o three quite messy
yeah
what can we get out of this
mm can't see any water there can't see any h and o h
yeah
but there's our old friend calcium chloride right
yeah
you take calcium chloride out what have you got left
you've got this h two c o three
yeah
hi
thanks
hi some UNK
lovely
don't tell me you don't like them
there's not a lot is there
do you what more
you've been UNK then
oh useless
come on charlie out
go on out
out
out
he said he can't hear you with that on
yeah he can
right
got an ear problem
erm well he split his tail the end of it
yeah i saw his tail was UNK
so we had the end cut off and to stop him UNK the bandages off we
ah
wrapped it up
mm
the vet wrapped it up but he also had a little thing on his ear so he cut that out as well and he's gonna wear the collar to stop him UNK his ear and
to stop him UNK his tail
cos he's
been in a fight has he
no erm it was just it was just like a little er spot on his ear and the vet sent it off to find out what it was
mm
and he cut it out and UNK it up so
right
okay meanwhile back at the carbonates so you've sorted out your calcium chloride and you've got this horrible looking thing h two c o three
right
but we know this is marble UNK you know you were getting this carbon dioxide off
how could you tell it was carbon dioxide what tests c could you do to it
erm if it's carbon dioxide it'll react with lime water wouldn't it
yeah
make clear lime water cloudy
right that's it makes it UNK
and it will put out a UNK or something
so if there w well we've got to get carbon dioxide out of this somehow cos we know carbon dioxide is given off
so you're doing a bit of detective work here what must be happening in this
well let's take carbon dioxide out of that and what do you get
well out of that you've got all the UNK there of carbon dioxide and water
so
mm
gives us the other thing that happens with them that er an acid plus a carbonate gives you carbon dioxide as well as a salt and water
right
and that's about it for the acids
it also brings in the bases the basic the bases and the UNK
if you know that lot just there you can probably get through about ooh eighty percent of your chemistry
yeah
at least seventy five percent you can work out well what have we got we got an acid or a base or a carbonate or what and does it fit any of the i mean there aren't many patterns there's metal acid what does that give
metal and acid
yeah
er carbon dioxide no er oh i'm getting confused now there's that many of them that
i know i know i know but i want to just keep going round the lot
metal and an acid
it might help if you write them
UNK i don't think it is i l it's just remembering they're all different and i
right they're all different but they're similar enough to be a bit confusing
so right okay
it UNK with it and it gives off oh shit
okay right
can i look back and
no work it out
oh fucking hell
work it out
it's getting too confusing i've got to try it cos if i just
yeah no you've
keep on working it out i won't remember it
so you've got what have we got we've got a metal the one we used was zinc
yeah
z n plus an acid let's use h c l
h c l
and what happened remember what happened what did well what what's going to get formed with zinc and chlorine about
zinc chloride
right okay
take zinc chloride out of that take the zinc and the chlorine away and what have you got left with
hydrogen
okay
yeah
so you didn't remember it you worked it out
now you you're very keen on remembering everything you can't remember everything
yeah because if i work it out i'll just know that i it made so and so but i won't know that it gave off that i'll just remember that it made like zinc chloride or something i won't remember
if i i'll just remember the symbol i won't even remember the symbols but i'll just know that i can work it out if i needed to
not i won't remember the answer
okay i mean the question on the paper might well be what happens when a metal UNK with an acid
yeah
not any particular one so then you've got to think well i don't know can't remember well let's try it what would happen let's try zinc maybe you'll vaguely remember we tried zinc and hydrochloric
mm yeah
what would happen well you're almost certainly going to get the zinc chloride and what have you got left hydrogen ah
so what happens with any acid and any metal with a UNK a metal and an acid you're going to get a salt and hydrogen given off
so this is
yeah
this is your way of working back rather than try and remember every little detail because a lot of them are similar easy to get confused between them but you think well hey what would happen what happens with an acid and a base what happens with an acid and an alkali now those two are virtually identical they are more or less identical
what
mm
happens there
with an acid and a base
well the easiest one perhaps is what happens with an acid and an alkali
erm you get a water and a salt
right now you didn't need to go did you need to go back to remember any
no
specific ones
no
no and the same thing happens with a base
water and salt
water and a salt
and then the other thing is what happens with a carbonate and an acid
erm carbon dioxide
right and
er hydrogen no carbon dioxide water
yeah
and
and
you've worked it you've worked it out over here and yeah and
what did you do you got this horrible looking thing and we said oh that doesn't happen because we know we've got carbon dioxide
oh er you mean
but you'd already taken out
it made yeah i know it made that but i thought you just wanted to know what it gave off
oh okay what every everything that's made so
it's calcium chloride
right so there's a salt and the carbon dioxide
and the a
and the water
water
so if you want to just sort of remember them all as a table we've got sort of say acid plus metal and see what happens see what's given off well we get a salt a lot of the time don't we and we
yeah
get water a lot of the time so erm salt water hydrogen carbon dioxide
yeah
can you remember what happens with the metal
erm
acid and the metal what did we get
acid and metal it gives off hydrogen
right okay so it's hydrogen and
erm salt
right
brilliant
acid plus an alkali that's about the easiest one
that's er salt and water
right
acid plus alkali gives you salt and water
yeah
and
acid and a base
good
and that gave you what
er salt and water
right and acid and perhaps the most awkward one the carbonate
which gave
right er hydrogen
the carbonate
oh yeah carbon dioxide
dioxide okay
yeah carbon dioxide and the water that was it i was thinking i saw the h two yeah
and the water yeah and the water and the
and salt
salt
right
okay so that's your table of what goes on
now you can look at that and sort of UNK it out to yourself and learn that as a table or learn it visually or vaguely remember some of it and fill in the gaps by going back what happened when we tried when we UNK ac acid on a metal
yeah
hydrogen
what happened when we UNK acid on marble UNK on a carbonate
what did happen
er marble UNK on UNK it gives off carbon dioxide
carbon dioxide okay what happens with the old standards the UNK
er water and a salt
yeah and the same for the bases
right
so i reckon you've got that all sorted out
you know the sys that i mean that's the system this is say this is the key to a good getting on for eighty percent
yeah
of the chemistry you need
erm you'll be able to look at it and say well is it a is it an acid and a base acid alkali acid metal acid carbonate
if it is even if you've never heard of them before you know sort of UNK carbonate or something
yeah
you're going to think well i know what will happen we'll get if you drip hydrochloric acid on it you'd get UNK chloride water and carbon dioxide
yeah
right
you'd need to know
yeah
what the UNK is to make up this formula you could do the same if it was if someone told you it was an some unknown so if it's an unknown compound and i drip let's say it was unknown compound and i UNK hydrochloric acid on and i got carbon dioxide given off yeah
yeah
and i got calcium chloride and water formed what was it that i was dripping onto
er and you got calcium
i got i got carbon dioxide given off
yeah
so it must have been
erm a carbonate
it must have been good it must have been some sort of carbonate and the salt that was formed was from the hydrochloric acid was calcium chloride so it must have been
calcium carbonate
so i mean if i might have magnesium carbonate and i drop hydrochloric acid on
yeah
what would i get
magnesium carbonate
magnesium carbonate drop hydrochloric acid onto that
magnesium hydroxide
magnesium salt of hydrochloric acid
it's all too much i'm getting a bit confused now it's
okay go back so what you need is a when you get when you get
i'm trying to do too much at once now it's
okay when you get confused when you get lost you've got to go back and find your direction again so carbonates
yeah but it's not it's not oh i don't what direction i'm heading in
i'm trying to do too many things at once and i'm getting oh is it
and this kind of thing it's getting er i just think i'm going to end up more confused by trying to do it all at once than if i concentrate on one thing at a time
cos i'm going to be getting it mixed in future now
okay let's say let's say we're looking at carbonates
yeah
right we're dripping this acid on a carbonate erm and you know you've worked out you've remembered carbon dioxide and water and a salt
but what on earth is the salt
well they all give a salt
which is the easiest one to remember for working out the salt out of these four here
which is the easiest one to remember
the easiest equation if i said write down the equation for one of these
which one would you go for as being the easiest the one you're most sure about
er the acid and an alkali
right acid and alkali okay so try it
h c l plus an alkali c a o h is that is that balanced what's c a
er double positive
c a double positive okay so how many o hs will we need to go with that
two
right good cos the o h is only a single negative
s
you don't need brackets at the end do you
s erm i need if i just put c a o h two
yeah
it would only be two hs
right
cos they're separate elements
like
yeah
each capital letter starts a new element and that would mean one c a one o and two hs but what i is one c a and two o hs which is two
right
os and two hs yeah
yeah
so i've got that lot and what's the salt
forget about all the rest of it we know it gives water okay
calcium chloride
right now calcium carbonate c a c o three is that balanced up
what do we need how many do we need that's a double positive what about c o three
er
well have a look where's the c o three gone
okay
erm
and that is a double negative so that's balanced
well you wrote the equation out you worked out what was happening that and the you need two of those so those two got together and the salt again was
yeah
yeah
you're looking at the carbonate trying to work out what on earth goes on here what is the salt when you drop hydrochloric acid onto the carbonate
don't know but i can remember what happens with the alkali and the acid you get calcium chloride er it's the same
the salt is the same all the way through here
whether you're dropping it on the putting the acid to the UNK the metal the alkali the base or the carbonate the salt is always a salt of the acid
so hydrochloric acid always gives you the chloride sulphuric acid always gives you the sulphate nitric
yeah
acid always gives you the nitrate
yeah
okay and that's the so that pattern straight the way through for all these four reactions it doesn't matter which one you do
so the salt you can remember it through going back to the acid plus alkali reaction it's the same one you get there
right
the base acid base it's exactly the same there's no difference you're going to get the same salt and the and the water
carbonate it's the same again just chuck in the extra c o two
right
and perhaps the most difficult one to remember is the easiest of the lot the acid plus the metal cos there's none of the usual stuff no salt no water just the hydrogen coming off
yeah
but it's you can i know you think it's a lot to take in
yeah
but if once you can see it as a pattern all this lot fit together and you're not if you learn those four reactions separately a month apart or something yeah
you're learning the same information over and over again this lot you're learning the whole lot once it's as though every time you learned a word you had to learn your UNK all over again
right
and didn't realize that the a made the same sound in this word as it does in that
i know it doesn't in most but there is enough of a tie up
mm
to make it easier to learn that way
now do you still feel that it is too much for you to take all that lot in one go or do you think it's all it's UNK it's
a little bit yeah
you know
yeah
UNK together a bit
no i think what it is i understand it now but if you ask me in a couple of weeks
right
i'm not going to be sure UNK whether an acid and a carbonate
well i'll ask you every week
i might say yeah
i'll ask you every week
can i just say something but i might get an acid and a carbonate mixed up with an acid and a metal
or
okay
an acid and a metal with an acid and a carbonate
but if you write the formula down let's say let's say you get it all wrong and i say what happens if you have an acid and an alkali and you say well i know they all give a salt so that's a safe bet so i'll say they give a salt
erm they all give a water apart from the one that's just with the metal right so UNK a good bet
and i think this gives carbon dioxide
let's say you're doing acid plus alkali and for some reason you think oh well i think it gives carbon dioxide
so i say okay where does your carbon dioxide come from then
acid h c l and the standard alkali acid alkali reaction we use what do we normally pick for the alkali
what's
er
the well known one we keep choosing
er sodium hydroxide
right all the UNK that we're using anyway all the UNK are UNK
so what's going to happen there
they go together the chlorine and sodium go together to make the sodium chloride and the h and the o h go together and make the water
you've got no chance of making c o three out of that you haven't got the c anywhere
yeah
so if you want to make sorry c o two if you want to make c o two out of something you're going to at least have to have a c in it somewhere
right yeah
and which one of this lot has got the c in
is it the metal the alkali the base or the carbonate
carbonate
carbonate
not only has it got the c it's got the c o three take the o out of it to go with the h
and we've got that c o two out
so it's a combination of sort of working at of working and that
yeah
to give the water
stick to the nice simple ones like h c l
yeah
what's going to happen
n a plus h c l
a straight forward metal plus an acid what happens here
n a plus h c l right that's a metal
a me a metal plus an acid
erm gives off hydrogen
right
everyone of these the big the one thing they've all got is a salt
so what's the salt from there
er the n a c l
n a c l and what have you got left over
er hydrogen
h that's it
so we take twice we take two of it so that we get h two
yeah
so with this system you'll remember bits you'll forget bits the bits you don't remember you can now work them out from the patterns
and each time you work it out it's more it becomes more er one you remember rather than one you have to work out
till eventually i mean you UNK doing it with these as you were going through here you weren't looking at this table you were working some of them out you were saying oh that'll be a double positive that'll be a double negative UNK go together
the more you use it the more the system becomes natural to you
yeah
and you think well of course it would wouldn't it you know you're trying to you get to the stage you can believe me you get to the stage quite quickly where you can't understand why other people don't see it
look it's obvious this one's a double positive and that's a double negative so they're going to go together and you're left with h and o h which is going to make the water it's obvious isn't it
yeah
okay so try if you can do you think you can do that you can try to take those four reactions out of one group and see how related they are
yeah
what's the big thing that's common to all of them
erm they all make a salt
right they all make the salt they all make it in the same way hydrochloric acid would make
er water and a salt
hydrochloric
yeah hydrochloric acid what sort of a salt would it make
er well mixed with what alkali
well say if it's mixed with erm sodium hydroxide
er su er sulphur hydroxide
hydrochloric acid hydrochloric
er
hydrochloric acid okay
i'm thinking about too much i just can't i'm getting totally confused now
yeah i kn
right look at the pictures then don't okay stop thinking of hydrochloric acid think of h c l
h c l
yeah but it's still making me confused i'm thinking about too much at once it's making it worse
okay
how can we UNK it
erm to work out
i think i think i'm trying to do too much at once i'm going to be really confused next week
you've decided
no i've not decided but i know i am i've done this thing before it's
right how much should we take out of this just to learn and concentrate on for all of next week
it's not that you're asking me oh well what happens if you
and i i've thought about it and i've thought about so many of them today i can't i'm getting confused at which one it is
because you've asked me about so many of them
right well we're only we're looking at four different types so if i ask you which one
yeah i know it's only four different types of
right
of these
you think now
but you're using so many different chemicals that it's getting more and more confusing
alright so we'll stick to one acid h
yeah
h c l
yeah but if you just said an acid and a so and so but you're saying a h c l and a and it's i know
okay
i know it's still an acid but the way it's thinking about it's making me confused
okay right so an acid and an alkali what do we get
erm a water a salt
right now if the acid happens to be hydrochloric acid with the c l on the end when it makes the salt have a look at that one
yeah
what's the salt going to be there
er UNK a c l
and n a
that's it so it's n a c l
the salts of h c l are something c l
yeah
hydrochloric acid makes the UNK
yeah
yeah
mm
if we'd have used if we'd so that was hydrogen chloride makes the UNK
hydrogen sulphate h two s o four gives you the UNK the ones that end in and what does hydrogen nitrate nitric acid what does that one give you
er h n o three ni
so this let's say we're using n h
sodium nitrate is it
yeah it's sodium nitrate
so nitric acid because it's hydrogen nitrate gives you the UNK
sulphuric acid gives you the UNK
yeah
hydrogen chlorine UNK chloride h c l gives you the UNK
mm
erm we'll do i'll just get you to write that out in words and then we'll have a break
yeah
and a little UNK around the room or something
yeah
because
it's coming up to time now anyway so we might as well forget the break
okay what time did i get here then
quarter past
yeah okay then
so hydrochloric acid hydrogen chloride
yeah
right plus sodium hydroxide now what all that happens is that these two change places
yeah
so we then get sodium chloride and hydrogen hydroxide
yeah
hydrogen hydroxide h o h well we usually write that h two o
mm
so if you think of the sort of the word patterns hydrogen chloride sodium hydroxide gives you sodium chloride and hydrogen hydroxide
yeah mm yeah
it's perhaps easier to see it as the as the n as and the o hs though okay or if we did it with sulphuric acid we'd have hydrogen sulphate plus sodium hydroxide what's that going to give us
again they just change round they swap places
mm
to give us sodium sulphate and hydrogen hydroxide again
yeah
water h o h water
nitric acid hydrogen nitrate plus sodium chloride again these two swap places and we get the sodium nitrate and hydrogen hydroxide again
yeah
h o h water
that's the that's the pattern that all the acids are following
write their names write it like this h c l n a o h
yeah
swap them round and there's the answer
right
that's done it
hydrogen sulphate sodium hydroxide swap them round sodium sulphate hydrogen hydroxide UNK we never say hydrogen hydroxide it's simpler to say water but if you write it as h o h then you think ah we've got the two hs and the o there
water
mm
and that's it that's the pattern for all of them for all those four reactions
so that'll
right
the salt
erm have you got any of your books with you
yeah
erm have you got your chemistry course book that you're working from
we're not really working from it we're
mm
it's just a book we have
okay
the
well if you can get that we'll have a look at that and i want you to try some of these equations in it
and i want you to try them in groups so that acid alkali
yeah
i think i reckon you could you could just do that without looking at your book couldn't you
yeah
yeah
yeah
if someone said okay nitric acid and calcium hydroxide as long as you were using this chart to work out which are single negative and double negative what's going to happen to that one
you've got nitric acid
yeah
hydrogen nitrate plus calcium hydroxide
yeah
is going to give you well these two the metal and the hydrogen just swap round each time
so it's going to give you calcium nitrate and the old hydrogen hydroxide again
you can you can look at i mean it's easier with your formula if you've got h n o three and c a o h twice c a and that's going together
you'll need two of these because we want two o hs to go with those two o hs
yeah
and you'll want two n o UNK to go with that c a
so any of these i reckon you could work out any acid with any alkali you could work it out
yeah
so have a look through your book have a very quick glance at erm if you can just at an acid alkali one at one side of an equation co try not to read it cover it up write it down and leave it for a few minutes till you've forgotten if you did accidentally see what was on the other side till you've forgotten it
erm
right
write a few of those down all the same type all acids and alkali and then you just you can just bomb through those
then try some with bases
yeah try a few of those erm that one really
yeah
you could work out any one of those at all any metal with any acid because the metal just comes in pushes the hydrogen out
so if it was hydrogen sulphate sulphuric acid it'll push the hydrogen out and become zinc sulphate and UNK the hydrogen
if it was hydrogen nitrate the nitric acid the zinc would push the hydrogen out and make a zinc nitrate
erm the carbonate perhaps the most awkward one
yeah
but you've worked that out yourself i like that because you went for the salt see you knew you were doing exactly what i was saying sort of forming the pattern
yeah
but you don't want to you don't want to see that you're doing it that way
yeah
so went straight for the calcium chloride this is the page where you did it
right quite an awkward one that i gave you
hydrogen chloride calcium carbonate you put your double and single negatives on
well we're going to get a salt cos they all give salts
there's your calcium chloride what have we get left over we've got this we've got hydrogen carbonate and that was really should have been your answer but then you know carbon dioxide came out so you just took it out and you got water left over
yeah
so that gives you this fits with this pattern acid carbonate they all give a salt apart from the hydrogen one they all give water as well and this one gives a c o two
yeah right
so i do want you to try to build up as many of those as you can
think i think the acid alkali there's no problem
oh yeah i know but all i was saying was that much of different things
right
in one lesson within a space of fifteen minutes
right
that in one or two weeks time i'm going to be thin i'm going to be slightly mixed up
right well learn them this way then learn only the sodium hydroxide right
yeah
and erm oh calcium hydroxide is perhaps a more interesting one but you pick one of them that you're happy with and take it through here so what would happen with let's see i mean you wouldn't actually drip sodium an acid onto sodium if you've got any sense
okay
yeah i know
boom
but you should get roughly the same reaction
erm so maybe we could we've been using sodium a lot try calcium because it's interesting cos it's got a double one a double positive negative is it
mm
right
so take them through there acid plus calcium acid plus alkali calcium hydroxide acid plus base calcium oxide
so the alkali any UNK use c a o h twice for the base c a o calcium oxide and for the carbonate c a c o three
the metal just calcium
okay
yeah
so you can work through those with each of the acids
so go through with h c l
right
okay
yeah
and just go straight through that what happens then go through again with whichever one you want to do next h two s o four
yeah and then go through again with nitric acid
in each case you did it this is what i like you went straight for it you went straight for the salt on the most difficult one the carbonate
right it's going to be calcium chloride
you got that out and you found this horrible hydrogen carbonate thing left over
mm
so you can do you can use exactly the same system you used on that for working out each one and see what happens
now are you happy with that you can do that or do you think that's sort of UNK you
no that's fine
i th i'm quite sure that you can go through that because you're recognizing the patterns much more now you're accepting more things as oh yeah you don't need to tell me that i know it
yeah
i can feel this coming back much more rather than tell me that again
why is called a chloride
why is called a sulphate
right
so you recognize these patterns
yeah
okay
yeah
erm now next week you were saying something about you'd like one on easter monday i won't actually be here
mhm yeah
erm
some time next week i mean
you want one some time next week
i mean whatever days you give
right now
apart from saturday or sunday
i was very pleased that you'd had a good go at that
yeah
you'd misunderstood
yeah
now can you write out either now or just before i or when i've gone what you're going to do
take a piece of paper
yeah i just wanna write down what you
so what are you what are you going to do
erm
can you remember what you're going to do
learn some of these
right taking calcium as the metal you want to write equations for each of the four types of reaction
do you remember what those four types where
or any
er
of those four types
yeah
go on
er bases
right
UNK
yeah
carbonates
right
erm
and the most simple one which is the hardest to remember cos it's so obvious
yeah erm oh shoot what was it
taking calcium did we say
yeah
yeah
as the
metals
just the metal
yeah
just the metal plus the acid
right
okay
so go through use calcium go through each of the four reactions
mm
yeah
so use calcium hydroxide which is written on there as the
mhm
alkali calcium oxide as the base calcium itself as the metal calcium carbonate as the carbonate
we got four types of reaction using first h c l okay so write that in using first h c l then h n o three then h two s o four
right
and they're all they UNK they're all patterns within lots of similarities by going through it a few times like that and when you when you've done that go through again say and with and everywhere you could write the whole lot out again
yeah
and everywhere you've got an a c a you could put an m g and everything would fit because it's c a double positive m g double positive
right
you could go through again and you could put sodium instead of that m g but where you had things like m g o h twice you'd just have n a o h so you UNK have a have to do a little bit of changing about
are you happy with that
yeah
you can do that
and don't forget for each for each of the acids
yeah so it's first four h c l then h n o three then h two s o four
yeah
okay
right
now erm for next oh something else as well i'm not sure whether you sign this or i do it erm right what's the date is it about twenty eighth
twenty ninth
you can read it if you've got time
yeah
i always re i wouldn't sign
right
anything without reading it
erm what it says
yeah
i'll just read it
thank you
okay
that's the big point there
but you don't have to sign
yeah
there's no UNK to sign
oh yeah
at all by the way if you don't want anyone to it will be someone who doesn't know you will try to code up that tape into UNK which is
yeah
then stored UNK just the
yeah
words not your voice or anything
just the words right
and the
just sign it here
it's the erm the way you stress words the way for example the way i will repeat words quite a
yeah
bit
and the way
and the way you use and what use them for
the way people
where i'd say right meaning i understand kind of thing but i'm not saying that's right i mean right
yeah people say that a lot right
yeah
yeah got it yeah
yeah yep
all this sort of yep you wouldn't find it in the dictionary
no
it goes in now
yep it's what people say when they
it will do now in a couple of years time
erm okay that's great
now erm at the moment i've got a lot to fit in
i feel sorry for the poor person who has to translate it
for next week
oh she's very good actually she
yeah
UNK away all day putting the stuff in erm she's she trained well she
i'm pretty dubious to me
trained as a UNK
ah but she's she is
yeah
interested in it this is
yeah
the thing
she is interested in accents and she'll listen to it and think ah that's someone who comes from liverpool er not a very not a very UNK accent but because they say
i don't know you know i've been on holiday and people think i've got an UNK strong
and you think no i haven't
it's
no i haven't they even a they even say my dad's got an accent whereas
yeah
i would say ee hasn't
ee hasn't
yeah
erm but she will you know she'll notice that you don't say bath and grass
yeah
you know bath and grass
yeah
things like this
UNK and UNK
well one doesn't say i don't think one says UNK any more
there are good
mm there are people who have done
yes
strange
there are good things have come out if as well like
yeah
erm i mean i did a teaching initial for foreign language course at the university
mm
and the thing what we found out there was sort of up to date english usage
i think i'll just take those sheets i said i would give you
so you used to say in business letters things like i should be grateful if
mm
nobody really says that any more they say i would be they don't bother saying i should
mm
they say i would
would
so
i mean i got that with my interview at i should be grateful if you would
mm or
i've ne i don't think i've ever heard anyone UNK say it
well it's quite correct
i would be grateful
it's UNK
or i will be grateful
yeah it's UNK correct
yeah
but soon it will be appearing in a dictionary as a bit over formal a bit UNK use it if you like in a business letter but most people would prefer
it's way down the i mean all these people go oh it's people aren't using the english language properly but if you look at the english
language two hundred years ago
exactly
it was nothing like what it is today
it's developed it changes its form and it's
yeah
like a life form it's
right
they go on about UNK and UNK but if you spoke to them the way UNK used to speak they wouldn't understand a word you were saying
they wouldn't understand whereas we can just about understand UNK
yeah so as you say it's a it's a developing thing and the only
a life form it's growing it's spreading
yeah new words come in erm you know i'm well pleased
yeah
that's wicked
yeah
it's really wicked oh
like a lot of old UNK words from you know like a hun fifty or so back years ago are now proper words now
yeah they're accepted and the language developing is developing more quickly than that so they want to get the stuff into UNK
yeah
you know and
i suppose it helps nowadays with things like
tape UNK and so on
and computers
yeah
so because they will thousands
you can store it easily you can use a database
thousands yeah exactly from all over the country and they'll put these together and they'll say well in do you know about eighty percent of our interviews people are saying yep
nobody actually says oh yes i agree dear chap
they say yep
yeah
mhm
it's not a word but
it's
it will be one day
it is a word cos it's something that people use
yeah
a lot
it's not a recognized word
they use it a lot more than other words that are in the dictionary but no one 's ever heard of so they want to get usage
right
anyway i'd better make sure i remember that
you okay for that
yeah
that UNK
er UNK be in
right
most evenings
have you any ideas now what will be a good day for you next week and what will not be a good day
er any day apart from monday of course
right
er tuesday i've got my maths tutor so apart from saturday and sunday
and you'll be UNK you'll finish this you'll be available during the day time won't you
yeah oh yeah that's fair enough
so i can probably give about sort of
two o'clock if you want
yeah something like
yeah one o'clock two o'clock
i've got a two o'clock slot on tuesday next week erm
wednesday thursday friday
yeah i'll check what i've got booked where and then i'll get in touch you for next week
er
as long as it doesn't cause too much disruption for you
it doesn't
erm
yeah
i've got some students at the moment erm
i suppose with easter most people do stay i mean
not his hair not other things about him obvious things about him
his colour
what colour was he
erm white
good lad
he was white
obvious things about him again that you might forget obvious things
he had a UNK
he had a UNK yes but i'm talking about really obvious things that we might forget
policemen would remember but you might forget obvious thing he was white
slim
good girl
he was slim
and we have done this before haven't we
yeah he was slim what else was he
was he right at the back
quite tall
he was quite tall
obvious things about him you forget right
he was white slim and quite tall yeah
then you can give him the clothes right i want the clothes
erm dark no light brown leather jacket
light brown leather jacket we'll see in a minute on the video
he had black jeans on and white
UNK
shoes
black jeans and white UNK we'll see if you're right it's gonna be on in a minute
black shades
black shades when do you mean black shades like mirror shades yeah
yeah
right well done
erm he was in his thirties
he was in his thirties i would put him in his early thirties yeah i'd say he was younger than me
yeah
he had brown hair
he had brown see if you're right in a minute
see if you're right
he had a UNK
he had a UNK yes
he had a blue car and
he had a blue car stop it there i'll stop it there he had a blue car
what is important about the car
you've gotta remember
oh
yeah what have you got to remember about the car
registration
good girl the registration number yeah we had before once or twice
right all hands down and no UNK no UNK what was the number
oh
oh
no UNK what was the number
there you go my man
m j b three six seven x
is he right or is he wrong
right
who says he's right
who says he's wrong
top of the class well done
m j b three six seven x
cos i've caught you out on that before yeah
what else do you remember about the man
he had a deep voice
he had a deep voice yeah
i think we've got all of it haven't we
but the important points what
his shoes were like UNK
his shoes were like UNK fair enough yeah we'll but the UNK important things to remember if you can was his car his number plate yeah
he was white he was slim and he was a tall man
yeah
very important
okay you may not have ever seen him he may just have been sitting in the car then remember his colour maybe his UNK and then the type of car he had
can anyone top of the class what kind of car was it
oh
shh
what type of car was it
UNK
UNK what
UNK
no you're guessing
it was a UNK
it was a UNK
you're gonna see it again
no it's not it's the other one innit
it was blue
blue yes blue
if you didn't see it it's a tricky one but there's a good way we've brought up a good point as well if we look at the car when the car comes up who said UNK
cos it's not a UNK it's a UNK it's the one with the boot but if you can't remember what it is you can either did you know the difference between a car with a boot and a car with a UNK
do you know the difference
do you know the difference
if you don't say you don't know the difference and i'll explain
i don't
you don't
a UNK is where all the back comes up here like a UNK yeah
and where a boot is where only the UNK bit comes out the glass window doesn't come up as well
understand that
yeah
yeah
a UNK is where it all comes up and it all UNK up the whole back UNK up doesn't it
what's that like a ford UNK
a little UNK
a UNK
no a UNK a UNK the whole lot comes up yes but they've now changed to a sapphire and the sapphire is just the boot yeah
so you can explain if you don't remember the car remember if it was a UNK or a boot
it comes in handy know a blue car and i think it has a boot i can't tell you the type of don't make it up if you don't kn know don't make it up
white slim early thirties very tall man yeah
very
would you have said he was slim or very slim
slim
i thought he was very slim actually
i'll go with you i'd say he was very slim he was a very slim man
thank you
no it's not being horrible to anyone skinny wasn't he
yeah
we'll see how well we got on and how we didn't
see what we've got
UNK type trainers UNK yeah that's close enough innit
who said black trousers
are they black
no grey
grey you could say they were dark if you didn't know for definite you could say they were dark trousers
if you don't know don't make it up don't guess
who said UNK
well done
yeah
the glasses well done
UNK type i don't know what they are casual shoes
m j b three six seven x well done
it's a UNK a v w UNK
right when you start your holiday been coming here now years and years and years and every year i show you that video you know that video off by heart you should do so when you play safe that's all i'm saying play safe
enjoy yourself but play safe
if someone approaches you and you don't know them someone you don't know is a stranger
did you see how nice the man was when he started to talk to UNK oh i'll go and help you how friendly he was he was UNK him he was UNK
just remember play safe someone you don't know is a stranger yeah
now i've frightened you all have a nice holiday but play safe
yeah
will you do that for me
yeah
good stuff
i'll see you later
take care
thank you
you're getting too good i've gotta UNK
okay
now what we'll do you like pizza
yeah
i've got some UNK pizza here do you like UNK pizza
do you we could make that into a whole pizza
okay right that's lovely
now do you know what any of these are
do you know what fraction that would be of a whole pizza
er
what UNK that
well don't worry if you don't know
how many of those would you need to make a whole pizza
erm
let's have a look one two
three
and this one here
erm four
so we need four of those to make a whole pizza so we call that a fourth well the americans call it a fourth
fourth
we call we've got a special name for it we call it a quarter
quarter
and we write it like this
it's one on the top and there's the table and then
mhm
the fourth underneath
one shared out that just means one shared between four
UNK fractions are a bit of a UNK really because this is what we do we say let's have a look at the page how much would you get if you had one and you shared it out between four and you just write well it's one shared out between four
you haven't really got the answer at all you've just written it differently and that's all it means whatever you're sharing out goes on the top what ever number of people of people it's being shared out between go underneath
erm do you normally sit on the table stand on the table
no
no
if your mum brought a pizza in would we put it under the table or on the table
on the table
on the table so whatever you're sharing out goes on top there's the table put some little legs on okay there's the table whatever you're sharing out goes on top and we're sitting here with our knees under the table okay so the people are underneath the table
how about if we had one shared out between three people have a guess at what it would look like the fraction
one erm three
one over three that's a third
now can you show me here any are there any pieces there is there a piece there that would be a third
so that you'd get move those round a bit so that you'd get say that pizza came in like that and your mum sat down there said right we're having some pizza we're going to share this out between the three of us so we all get the same sized piece
how big a piece would we get
one of those
how many how many pieces like that would you get out of it
a lot i think cos this UNK a quarter isn't it and we'd get that'd be enough if we cut it into quarters how many quarters would we get
erm
how many of those would we get
erm
right that'd be that'd be the same as well wouldn't it that'd be another quarter
how many how many quarters would we get out of this piece here
one two
two so we'd get four quarters right four fourths if you like that's one fourth one quarter
we'd get four fourths
so if there are less people sharing it out are we going to get more pizza or are we going to get less
more
we're going to get more so it's going to be a bigger piece that isn't it it's going to be bigger than the quarter
can you see any pieces that are bigger than the quarter
that one okay
so let's see if we could get three pieces like that out of a whole one
yeah cos these that'd make another one wouldn't it
mm
let's have a look
one
one two
two
and this one do you want to put that on there
and they'd be all the same size so if we had a piece like those two stuck together
three
that'd be that'd go round three people UNK so that'd be a third if we had these two pieces stuck together that'd be a third
yeah
and this one that's a third
third
so one shared out between three people is a third
now what i'd like you to do is show me can you divide it up if we were going to eat this whole pizza between the two of us if it was one shared out between two people how much would we get
mm
erm
show me again
those
would that be it
yeah
so that how big a what's that
half
that's a half
so one shared out between two people is just one a half again okay
where do you think erm how would we write one shared out between six people
how would we write it
one and the table and then the six
that's it so that's what a sixth looks like
what does it mean
well it means we had one and we shared it out between six people
now any idea what one sixth would look like
we found out what one shared out between three people is like that's a third
if we shared it out between six people would we get more or would we get less
less
we'd get less wouldn't we
erm how many of how many of these would we need to go all the way round
it takes two of those takes two of those to make a third to make
two
so how many thirds did we have
three
three thirds that's it three thirds
now let's say let's say your mum came in and she said how many for this pizza and we said oh just the three of us and she cut it cut it up into three pieces three pieces all the same size
cut it into three thirds
show me how big they'd be
show me which one's a third
right that one or those two stuck together would make a third
or these bits stuck together
so we'd get one third and then just as we were going to eat it three other people came in
and said oh can't we have some
how would you share it out so we all got the same
we you you've got let's say let's say there's your third you've got your third
and i'm sitting next to you right
and so there are six people all together there's your mum and your dad okay and then there's two friends over there and we're sitting here
so mum and dad have half of that third they'd share it out between them so they got
mm
me and me UNK have half of that one
yeah yes
so you'd need six
six
of these six pieces like that
now that's what's that kerry if we get six like that make a whole one
a half oh
if it needs six like that to make the whole one these this is one sixth
cos this is what you get if you have one shared out between six people so they all get the same okay
so that's one sixth okay
now don't worry about this is it going do you think it's going a bit quickly
okay
do you think we're doing a lot all in one go
mm i'll just show you one last one and then we'll start this again and have a little look at the beginning
now let's say we've done that we thought there were three people here so you though you were getting a third right
and then there were twice s many people there were six people
so you had to share yours with someone else and you just got a sixth okay
and then just as you were about to eat that another six people turned up so there were twelve altogether and you'd have to UNK share that
yeah
with some one else
let me just get down there
just get that little piece
now that's the piece that you'd get if there were twelve of you sharing out one pizza so what do you think that's called
have a guess doesn't matter if it's not right
a twelfth
a twelfth yes great that's a twelfth and how would we write it
one
shared out between twelve people equals what would it look like
equals one table
one and then th one on top of the table and underneath
twelve
twelve that's it
so that's one twelfth and that's what it looks like
how many twelfths would you need to make a sixth
two
good and how many sixths how many sixths would you need to make a third
two
erm how many how many twelfths would you need to make a quarter
think how many you'd need
that's one three
three right so perhaps someone had divided this pizza up and all the extra people kept coming in and your mum was saying oh no i thought there were going to be three and now there's six of us
right cut it into six
oh no more turning up twelve of us cut it into twelfths
yeah and then she's already cut it up into twelfths like this and then she thinks about asking them who wants pizza and there's only four of them want pizza after all this trouble
so one pizza shared out between four people how much are they going to get each
one shared out between four is
a fourth
a fourth or a special name for it a quarter
quarter
and that's what it looks like
so we'd have that but she's already cut them all up into twelfths so how many twelfths how many twelfths would we get each
three
three so she'd say oh you know mind i've cut it up a bit do you shouldn't it's still a quarter still a quarter you haven't lost a bit of it but it's still a quarter three twelfths is the same as a quarter
exactly the same isn't it you get the amount
how about how about if she had erm say just the two of us
just the two of us
and share one pizza between the two of us how much would you get each
er
so it's one shared out between two
yeah a half
a half right
so your UNK cut it up or you've cut it up this time just between the two of us and you've cut it into two halves you've got half there and i've got another half
and then another two people come in so we've got four people all together
how much are we going to get now if we share one between four people
it'll be
thirds
one shared out between four
fourths
a fourth exactly a fourth
so we'll get a fourth we get one of those how many fourth would you get out of a half
two
two you don't do you remember the special name for a
quarter
quarter so how many quarters would you get out of a half
two
right and how many halves make a quarter
mm one
how many oh i said that the wrong way round didn't i
how many quarters make a half
two
two brilliant
very good okay
erm can you remember what size that is
it's a quarter
let's have a look that one is a quarter and this one's a bit bigger
a sixth
so we must be shared now this is the interesting thing which do you think is bigger a sixth or a third
a third
yeah in the number on the bottom is bigger but that just means you've got to share it out between more people so do you get more or less if you share it between more people
less
you get less
so as the number on the bottom is getting bigger
you get less
the UNK getting smaller and smaller the piece you get is getting less and less
that was all we got when it was a twelfth a little tiny piece like that
so that's a sixth and that's a third which is bigger
yeah which one's bigger
the sixth
the
third
the thir it sounds as if the sixth should be bigger doesn't it cos it's got a six in it
a UNK only got a three in but the third is bigger
how many sixths would you need to make up a third
try it
try this
mm
erm two
two so two sixths would make a third
now this is two sixths that we've use to make the third
how many twelfths would make a sixth
a sixth
okay here here's a sixth
mm
and how many twelfths would make a sixth
two
right very good
now a tricky one how many twelfths would make a third
there's the third two sixths how many twelfths would you need
one two
two okay
three
