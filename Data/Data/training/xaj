yeah
four
four so four UNK make a third
so if our mum had cut it up into twelve pieces and then only three people wanted pizza so she cut it up into twelve twelfths and then said who wants pizza and only three people wanted pizza she'd now have to put some of these twelfths back together again then and just three of us how many twelfths would we get
one two three four
four so we'd get four twelfths
okay what do you think about fractions
they're hard when you know how to do them but like
if you don't know what they mean i anything if you don't know how to do it it's hard but if you don't even know what they mean it's very hard to work out what's going on isn't it and what you're supposed to be doing
do you think you're getting a better idea of what they mean what it's about
it's just sharing out
i mean if i said share six mars bars between two of us how many would we get each
erm
six mars bars share them out between two of us
there's six share it out between the two of us
three each
three each okay now if i said share erm if i said share ten pence between five people how many would they get each
well how many fives make ten
two
two each
now if i said share five pence between ten people what would you say about that a bit hard isn't it
mm
so say we put the people into pairs into sets of two
how many sets of two would those people make then if there were ten of them
how many twos make ten
five
five good so we'd have all the people sitting round a table five sets or two
perhaps they could both sit on one chair between one chair between the two of them
and then with the five pennies we could say well penny between you two penny between you two another penny between you two between you two an
so that the five pence we shared it out and we've given each two each two people one penny between them
how much would they have then
if we had the penny between the two of us how much would we get each
nothing
nothing okay if we had the pizza between the two of us how much would we get each
one shared out between two
how much would we get each
half
that's it okay
erm so if we had one penny shared out between two of us we get a half a penny each a half penny which they don't have any more they used to but they have them any more
so fractions it's only sharing
it's just like sharing i mean if we had two pizzas and we shared them between the two of us how many would
whole
we'd have a whole one
if we had erm four pizzas and we shared them between the two of us how many would we get
four share it out between two of us
two
we'd get two each
mhm
if we had six pizzas and we shared them out between two of us how
three pizzas each
we'd get three each so it's just fractions are just sharing
it's just that what happens is we we've got less sometimes we have less pizzas than we've got people
okay so we've got one pizza share it out between the two of us we get
a half
share it out between four of us how many would we get
a twelfth
if we shared it out between twelve of us we'd get a twelfth
get erm
share it out between four of us we get
quarter
a quarter yeah
you could say a fourth it doesn't matter it's the same thing
erm if we shared it out between six of us
a sixth
how about if we shared it out between a tenth of us
have a guess go on
if we share it out between four of us it's a fourth if we share it
a tenth
a tenth yes brilliant very good
how many fourths make up a whole how many fourths to make a whole one
four
four how many how many sixths make up a whole one
have a guess
how many tenths make a whole one you got it right said ten
ten
how many how many sixths make a whole one
six
yeah good
how many twelfths make a whole one
twelve
very good erm alright go for an impossible one how many mm how many UNK make a whole
twenty
yep
i think you've got it haven't you
how many UNK make a whole one
a hundred
yeah
that's it
now which is bigger a sixth of a third
a third
very good very good now a lot of people take a long time to get that
they keep saying well a sixth must be bigger cos six is bigger
that's how many people you're sharing with so that's very good you got that very quickly
oh i'm very pleased i think you're going to like fractions aren't you
if you if you don't understand things it gets very hard to like them cos you d just don't know what's going on do you
once you get to know a bit what's happening
and you get good at doing it then it's hey i can do this
then you start liking it
so do you think you're going to get on alright with fractions
yeah when we've had a look at fractions a bit erm we'll play with those and we'll find out things like what's half of a quarter things like that
so what does that's when you start thinking about half of a quarter it gets very confusing what do you mean do you mean half or a quarter
well what they mean when they say a half of a quarter is that we had a quarter and we've shared it out between the two of it so we've got half to that each
how much would we get
have a guess
it's not one that we've met so far so it's a completely new one
a fifth
if we had there's a quarter
how many of those to go all the way round
erm
how many quarters would make a whole one
four
four okay good
if we cut each one of those into two pieces the same how many of the new pieces would we need to go all the way round
four oh
we need we need four like that four quarters that's good and then for each one of those when we've cut it in two it would give us two of the new pieces so every one of those four would give us two new pieces how many would we have altogether then
we'd have four lots of two wouldn't we do you know what that is four twos
or two fours
two's two four eight
eight so we'd have eight pieces all the same size and what would that be called have a guess
an eighth
that's it an eighth
that's an eighth
so two UNK would make a quarter
two quarters would make
a third
a half
oh
would make a half and two halves would make
a whole
that's it good
that's very good
okay so don't need to learn all the fractions but we need to we'll probably just go playing with these the ones we've got here
now which is bigger
what's what size is this
a fourth
a fourth okay which is bigger a fourth or a sixth
a fourth
a fourth
now let's see how much bigger
well it's that much bigger isn't it
can you see any there that would just fit in that
right so if we added together a sixth and a twelfth what will it make
this one here what's this
a quarter
a quarter so a sixth and a twelfth makes a quarter
quarter
now this isn't i mean there are some funny rules with fractions aren't there sort of tricky things you have to do
not that tricky once you understand them
and we didn't make them up
just to make it hard it's because this is how it really works when we're sharing out things
so a quarter how many twelfths ion a quarter
three
three twelfths in a quarter
that's what size is this piece go on say it
a sixth
a sixth how many twelfths would we need top make a sixth
two
two
so if we had a sixth and a twelfth well the sixth is the same as two twelfth and another twelfth makes how many
two twelfths from there and then an extra twelfth how many have we got
two twelfths there and then another twelfth
excuse me would you like another drink
erm i wouldn't mind actually i can't drink milk actually i'm it's okay i did say but yeah so just black no sugar that'd be lovely thanks
oh look i'm sorry i'm sorry so black okay
now and so that's
a sixth
two twelfths there
that's sixth one sixth but you could make two twelfths out of that
and another twelfth
what would two apples plus one apple come to
three
three apples okay
have a guess what do you think two twelfths add one twelfth comes to how many twelfths would that come to
two and the an extra one two twelfths and an extra one twelfth how many twelfths would we have altogether
have a guess
we've got two UNK and then we had we had say two bananas and then another UNK how many bananas would we have then
three
if we had two pigs and another pig how many pigs would we have
three
if we had two twelfths and another twelfth how many twelfths would we have altogether
three twelfths
that's it three twelfths
and three twelfths is the same as a quarter isn't it
we stuck three twelfths together we can make a quarter
do this is how we have to add up fractions
if i say well let's try and add up a sixth and a twelfth and most people want to add the six and the twelve together and things like that but you can't do it that way you'll have to change them both into something that's the same
twelfths is a good one quite often and then we'll add up and find out how many twelfths we've got
and then see what that how many that would make
so three twelfths that would make a quarter
a quarter
so a sixth plus one twelfth is
a quarter
good very good oh that's good
okay how about if we added here's a tricky one see if you can work out how we're going to do it
a quarter add a sixth
now could you turn them all into twelfths
yeah
okay how many twelfths would there be in the quarter
how many twelfths would there
three
three twelfths good and how many twelfths would there be in the sixth
two
so how many twelfths would we have altogether
five
five brilliant
so we'd have five twelfths
that's very good
thanks very much
okay
okay thanks
so we'd have five twelfths
right erm now you're doing very well at this
let's try this one
quite a big one
that one's this one's a quarter and remember what this one is
a third
a third good
so if we added a third and a quarter could you turn them into twelfths
yeah
okay go on how many
three
good
two
let's have a look at that
one
put it there
how much is that bit there that we haven't covered
a quarter
a quarter and how many twelfths in a quarter
three
three so there's three twelfths there and that one makes
seven
good
so it's seven twelfths altogether so if we add a third to a quarter
third and a quarter
say add a third and a quarter can't do that don't know where to start
change them into twelfths
seven
and add the twelfths up seven twelfths
okay how about erm this one
now this time we don't need to change them into twelfths could you add that's a half add a sixth
any idea what we could change this into so we could add them
erm
what could we change that half into so that we could one sixth to it
go on have a guess
twelfths or
we could twe change it into twelfths yes and we could change the six into twelfths see what that would come to
how many twelfths would we get in that
two
two in there and how many twelfths would we get out of the half
seven erm
we'd get
t two
two out of that and then another two
two
would be four
four
and another two
would be six
six so six twelfths makes a half
yeah
six twelfths and another
eight
two twelfths is eight
eight
twelfths right
so if we add a half
to a to a sixth
to a sixth we get eight twelfths
eight
okay
erm we could even do it without UNK with twelfths on this
we could just change them into sixths
how many sixths would we get out of a half
two
have a look
three
that's a half okay so three sixths add one sixth
sixth
how many would that be
three four
four sixths
and four sixths comes to the same as two thirds
one third and another third
mm
okay have you done cancelling fractions
no
no
okay have you done things like erm three twelfths is the same as a quarter have you done that at school
i'm not too sure really
no well you may have done
but this is the this is the secret with fractions this is the trick
so that you can do anything
to be able to change them into different fractions
so you you'll already know how to change a sixth into twelfths don't you
how many twelfths does that make
two
two twelfths good
and you know how to change a quarter into twelfths how many twelfths does that make
three
three twelfths good and can you remember how many twelfths you got out of a half
mm
one two three four five six
six twelfths
so what would a half add a twelfth come to
seven
seven twelfths very good
you're doing all this in your head you know you're not writing any of it down are you
doing fractions in your head
adding them up i think that's very good
i think that's excellent
you could probably do take UNK
take away fractions
you don't think you could i think you could
what would be a quarter take away a twelfth
cut that off
two
two twelfths
and two twelfths is the same as
one quarter
one sixth yeah one sixth
so you're doing take UNK in your head now
a quarter take away a twelfth
what about a sixth take away a twelfth what would that come to
one twelfth
one twelfth one twelfth
how about one third take away one twelfth what would that come to
mm
three
three twelfths which is the same as
mm one fourth
a fourth
okay erm how about a half take away a twelfth
how many would we have left over
four five
five twelfths cos we started off with six twelfths take one twelfth away start off with six pigs and take one pig away got five pigs
start off with six twelfths and take one twelfth away you've got five twelfths
i think you're very good at this
what do you think
do you think you're getting you know you know what it's about don't you
yes
well i think that's very good
okay erm what i'd like you to do now is i'd like you to tell me what you think are the important things about fractions and anything important or interesting that you've learnt this afternoon
what was the most interesting thing
did
well
you find any of it interesting
was it better than school or worse than school
better
oh that's good
and what was good about it then
working them out and then
good don't forget if i go too quickly or if i give you too much say ooh hang on
and i probably won't stop i'll just tell you a different way
probably tell you the same thing a different way
and do you think you understand do you know what fractions are about
how would suppose you have you got any brothers and sisters
one sister and me UNK
okay and how UNK she
erm eight
eight so if you had to explain to her about fractions how could you tell her about what's what is it all
er
about this fractions
it's the same if you're erm tell her the take UNK and how many twelfths in like a whole and stuff like that
so it's all about sharing things out and it gets into this sort of fractions when we get when there's not enough to go round and we have to start cutting things up cutting the pizza up
okay erm now have you got any work to do during the holiday any homework
no
or UNK
none okay do you think the fractions were more interesting than erm what numbers add up to make ten
mm
mm
yeah
and more interesting than tables
yeah
yeah oh definitely hey
well sometimes when i was asking you things like erm say if i asked you how many quarters to make a whole one
how many quarters make a whole one
four
four good
and for every quarter we need three twelfths so we need four lots of three twelfths how many twelfths to make a whole one
three erm
right now if you know your tables if you knew three fours or four threes it'd be a lot easier wouldn't it
now the trouble with fractions is if you don't know your tables it can be you can work it out you could get there but it'll take a long time if you do know your tables you just go yeah three fours are twelve
four threes twelve
straight away like that
if you don't know them it's going to take you a long time
now if you're doing fractions with the others and they know their tables what's going to happen
i'm gonna be slower than them
they're going to keep being first all the time and you'll be thinking hang on hang on i haven't worked that out
you know you can do it you can do the fractions and once you've turned it into twelfths you can do it
but you're going to be finding out they're all rushing off ahead and you haven't worked out how many twelfths there are in two thirds or things like that
once you work it out you can do it but you need your tables to do that
so i'll get some tables for you for next time erm if
will i need to erm buy a maths book or anything to write in
no have you got any sort of pad like this will do anything to write in
but i do want you to write some things for next time
erm have you got a have you got pad or anything
yeah i've got this little book in here
okay
right well the first thing i'd like to have you got counters or have you got a
counters
a big jar with pennies in or anything like that
yeah
you have that's good
if you get just pennies out right
if you'd like to make a little note of what i want you to do
i'll tell you what it i want you to do first and then you can write it down
i want you to get ooh start of with twelve pennies okay
twelve pennies and then use them you know the way we were working out things like three times four makes twelve
set them out like this okay so that's three fours or four threes make twelve okay
how else could we make twelve
we could make
two sixes or six twos
twelve
i'd like you to play with that and just with twelve pennies until you've found all the ways of arranging them like that
so they can show what two numbers multiply together to make twelve
then i'd like you to try thirty six
thirty six
maybe twenty four first okay
so try twelve pennies and find all the numbers that will multiply together to make twelve and one you mentioned earlier which was very good cos a lot of people forget it was just twelve ones or one twelve
okay so try it with twelve first of all and then try it with twenty four
and see all sorts of numbers that will make twenty four
so you could try it like this if we had twenty four we could see what happens if you make them into twos
would that work
yes that would work
what happened if you make them into threes
how many lots of three would you make
you might find it works you might find you've got some left over in which case it doesn't work you can't make sets of three out of them
and then try fours and fives and sixes
do you think fives would work with twenty four
mm
your five times table always end in a in what
five
or a nought don't they
yeah
does twenty four end in a five or a nought
no
ends in a four
no so it wouldn't so it wouldn't work wouldn't work with the fives
so you try it with the sixes see if they work try it with the UNK try it with the UNK see what works
and find all the just play with them and find out all the things and write down your answers
what numbers would multiply together to make twelve
what numbers would multiply together to make twenty four and then try it again for thirty six okay
yeah
so if you like to write that one down
and then if you've done that by next time got all them all written down and you're quite happy and you want to go on and do some more try it with sixty pennies
sixty
sixty pennies okay
now have you had your tea yet
no
have you just come in from school
what time do you get in
no i came home at half two today
cos you'd finished early did you
yeah
okay so you'd had a bit of a break that's good
erm the other thing i'd like you to do is adding up all the numbers that make ten
okay do you want to make a note of that and do you remember how we did it
erm yeah erm
you could do it with your coins again if you like
so we started with five add five didn't we
yeah
cos that was the first one that you know
five add five makes ten
what did we do then
mm
we took one out of there that made s six
six add
six add four makes
right
six add four makes ten
and what would four ad six make
s ten
right so you worked out that you've only got to learn half of them
don't want to i want you to learn things but there's no point in learning everything twice is there or learning more than you need to at the moment
just learn we'll try and find some easy ways for you to learn it erm cos i think you're a good UNK you've learnt a lot today haven't you
and we're
performing this lovely task for you in UNK in bonny scotland
it's now quarter past nine
your old man here has brought me all the way up here for a complete and utter waste of time
and has only offered to buy me one beer so far
two
two
right
well let's see if that comes over
that's if i can get this going
yeah
right the idea of this little chat this briefing before we go out and do the er driving assessments next week is just to sort of give you an idea and a and a bit of an UNK into what we're looking at and what we'll be doing next week
now er who did it last year amongst you
i know dougie did
two three
must have been the year before you did it then
yeah
right
so i mean obviously er if you've done it before and have y have you done one before at all
i don't know
my dad's
did you
yeah
there was one just prior to that
i think er
that's quite a coincidence
were they
mm
well th the thing is those of you who did it last year with me it'll follow much the same sort of format so erm but we didn't do a little talk before
now that idea was to get everybody together and erm because there have been certain members of the staff which haven't been looked at for a period of time they've escaped the net as it were in the last couple of times and it seems that we've had the same guys for the last three years and some have erm
well i suppose that's it you see
when you when you come up here and do the driving you find that erm because people are just not available at the time and erm y i'm here just for a and stan only here for a limited period and er you're sort of trying they're downstairs they're trying to get people off the trucks when they come in or whatever the case may be to go out and do an assessment run and it's not always possible
now this time we're here for four weeks so it would probably be that they want to get everybody through this time without anybody UNK the net
and the policy now with is that this will ta now take place i know that there's been somebody here for the last three years but this will now take place every two years
so er whether or not it'll be the same faces c l as come up and do it er but it shouldn't make that much difference
it will follow the same format
but of course it is nice to come back to the same places over and over again sort of er see friendly faces
and er it does make a bit of continuity
there's a few UNK and UNK
right so the company that we work for is and they are one of the a number of companies which are operating in the fleet driver training market and erm they we UNK presently have the contract with for this f course of defensive driver training
now they call it defensive driver training and er what we're really talking about is safe driving nothing more and nothing less
and er if you have a defensive driving technique then of course you'll be driving safely
would you not agree with that
so first of all then what will we be doing
now when we go out on the road we would like to go through a vehicle check with you
erm now we didn't er it's not always possible to do that
the last year wasn't because the way things were running and the way drivers were being brought in
but where possible we would do a t er a vehicle check
and now this time we would like to do a vehicle check with you when we before we go out
erm i think it is beneficial mainly in the sense that erm if nothing more than running round the vehicle to make sure there are no marks and UNK and UNK on it which you're going to inherit from the previous run that it had er with a different driver perhaps
yeah but she's a
aye
i'm f frightened of ben move down in case all the wiring comes off
oh yeah that's right
we were looking at that last night
so you would just take that round and just mark on anything
that's gotta be
and that's just a pre vehicle check before you go out is it
well
yeah
right
and n normally i suppose the company have a policy in relation to checking oil water and all the necessary bits and pieces before you go out in the morning
is that right
is that done once a day or each driver
each driver
each driver
so the fact that the vehicle has been out on shall we a mor a morning delivery and the back shift man comes in and has a look at it he would then have to do it all again
right so we just we would like to do that bef before we go out
now the time which erm i is scheduled for around about half a day each
now obviously commercial requirements might mean that is modified to some extent
but erm i think last year we w was it about three hours they went last year
do you remember
about three hours wasn't it dougie
no it was about two
just about two
two
er
two hours
yeah
it d it did depend on the t run that we had
yeah
but erm say this yeah it'll probably follow the same format
and now when we first start off er i know what it's like
it's not very nice when you're driving the vehicle and er i know you're all experienced drivers and then you get somebody sitting there alongside you starting to look at you do and i you could've been driving all your life but you still feel a bit UNK and a bit tense
is that not so
when someone's looking at you
yeah
so what we want to do is erm for everybody to drive naturally
you know not put anything special on because either myself or stan is sitting alongside you
and er you won't drive naturally for two reasons i suppose
one is that you want to make sure that erm you do everything right
well that is good
i mean if you're going to sort of er dr vary your driving a little bit to put in the techniques that you think should be put over that's good
however sometimes you can fall into the UNK of doing things erm because you think that we want to see that
and very often we don't
you'd very often be better off driving as you normally drive
do you follow what i mean
mhm
now the other reason why of course you won't perhaps erm drive naturally is because of this little bit of tension at the fact that who's this person sitting here looking at what i'm doing and it it's putting me off
and that does do that
so to start with what we're doing is just having a little assessment seeing what sort of driving erm techniques that you have
and also we can have a little chat providing it doesn't upset any concentration just to break the ice and settle in and er relax you and to drive normally
and er i say we're not here to er UNK picking up every little fault that a driver does going along the road
cos it doesn't matter who you are or what you are reverse the roles everybody makes mistakes when you're driving
so we're not looking for little every little error that a person makes
it's not like a ministry test or anything like that as some of you are well aware
you're just looking to see if there are any aspects of a person's drive where you know one or two habits might have UNK in which could possibly UNK upon safety margins to some extent
or you may sort of erm people who you do the same thing over and over again the same sort of job would you not agree a little bit of UNK can set in and erm things don't perhaps come over quite as they should
and so we will try and UNK and UNK the main basic principles to make sure that you maintain proper safety margins and er good reaction time room to manoeuvre as we're going through
so that that's all it is
there's nothing t to anybody to get really UNK about
and then we'll carry on er having had a stop and a little chat about different things we then carry on and if there are sort of some areas in the drive which we think might sort of erm come in chaps
morning
morning
much
thank you very much
i've only just been talking about what we're going to do
stan at the back mick are the company and i think we met last year didn't we
i think so
yeah
i think s oh i can't remember
some faces you c
no
anyway
i missed it
another one escaped the net last year
so i was just saying that this year it would be hopefully everybody will go through it
and it will be company policy from now on that it'll be every two years
alright
the new policy has been UNK
and i'm just going through what we're going to be doing whe on the training day itself or the assessment day
first of all as i said we'd like to go through a vehicle check before we go out
then we'll go out on the road
the first little bit of time is spent just to sort of take it easy take our time get to know another and for us to assess the drive
and then we can pull in or have a stop probably at the delivery if it's a delivery involved we can have a little chat about any areas which we can discuss
and then a bit of a roundabout route coming back trying to get a variety of road and any areas of the drive which we can look at we will discuss amongst ourselves practise one or two things maybe one or two little techniques
and then when we come in the assessment form is written out and erm er there's a marking sheet which i'll sh show you before we go out on the road
there's marking sheet and on the back comments about what we've done and er the standard which you drive at
now both stan and i have the same policy that erm we will write out it takes about ten minutes or maybe a little bit longer with me cos i'm not as clever as stan
it takes a little bit longer for me but erm we show you then what's on the sheet so you know what is there
alright
and then if there's any areas which you want to discuss with us then by all means we can
right
any questions about what we're gonna do on the day then
that's just a rough UNK about what we're gonna do
right what we've got t like to sort of talk about now is just one or two aspects ab about defensive driving techniques
why we do it and what it's all about
erm i think th as far as lorry drivers are concerned stan and i both go around various companies and you are dealing with car drivers van drivers large goods vehicle drivers such as yourself and er it's fair to say that erm there are different levels of ability in each case
but normally you find that erm both stan and i would consider the large goods vehicles drivers as being the professionals because you are driving all the time
would you not agree that your job is driving
really not much else is it
er it is driving
now you get the car drivers they are not really drivers
they are given a company car to get from a to b and their main work starts when they get there isn't it
and therefore for various reasons their interest in driving in most cases not all cos i mean some of them are very good but in most cases their interest in driving i is limited to what they're gonna do in their time off
not an interest in perhaps bit more depth of thought i in surviving while they're driving
whereas people such as yourselves er have got two things in mind
you're gonna be on the road the number of miles you do is obviously going to put you at risk more than somebody who does a third of your miles
would you not agree to that
it's not relative because anybody who does er more er a great number of miles then you would i imagine that because they do this amount of miles that their ability would be overall better because of the experience they gain by doing to extra miles
but i we're all in a in a risk business
and what we say is and what we're trying to put over i'm su i'm sure you're fully aware of yourselves is that it's no good going around driving your drives thinking that it's never going to happen to you
do you think that's fair comment
now er with the vehicles on the road today more and more accidents and certainly motorways and bearing in mind i would imagine er would it be true to say that the majority of mo driving is done on motorways and dual UNK
when you get
mm
so when you get accidents on motorways they're normally pretty horrendous aren't they
it's not just one vehicle involved
and i we just feel that cannot go along thinking it's never gonna happen to you
you we should do something about it
and as a company whatever other political ideals you have about them but as a company they are very safety conscious
and erm they are doing whatever they can do just to keep people aware of the need to maintain safety margins
and unless you do something positive yourself to maintain safety margins you're not gonna turn around and say it's not gonna happen to you
the chances are you're more likely to be involved in something
and so the idea of these days is just to UNK these erm basic principles of safety
but having done it having completed the half a day or whatever it is we have you know it's not really a case of saying right well that's it
it's something which really should be thought about continuously er and carried on
which is why of course they've decided on th the grading system that they have that they want people to achieve perhaps a class one status wherever possible and maintain it
and it will not be maintained really unless that sort of effort is put in throughout the year
so th as far as si oh excuse me
as far as the risks are concerned then we feel that by adopting a technique defensive driving technique that the risks will be calculated more in your favour
do you not agree with that
so let's drive on the road taking a calculated risk as opposed to sort of just driving along hoping it's never gonna happen to you and i
now i'd just like to sort of this is a this is not very clear on here but i would just like to bring out this is an accident which happened down in kent about two years ago now
and this is er a dual carriageway
it's not motorway
that's the central UNK
but there are no crash barriers down the centre it's straight over
and er this is the way to UNK and the docks this is the way to london
nighttime weather conditions good UNK fine clear no real problems
but it was dark
and these this is er a private car going along the road about fifty miles an hour going down towards UNK
now this is er a lorry end it's er i think it's a UNK
so it's a left UNK the UNK sitting over there
now this is a british lorry coming down in the offside lane cos it's only two lanes
and erm this one is slowly closing on that one this one is catching up on this one at quite a rate of knots
and you can tell what's gonna happen can't you
as this one comes up to this one here this one then pulls out to overtake this vehicle
and er to avoid a UNK and in fact i think they did strike but i'm not really sure but to avoid a UNK this one then goes over the other side of the road picks up this ford UNK coming the over way rolls it over the bank and it goes underneath the UNK unit of the UNK
and consequently this poor guy is killed
now i i'd just like your opinions as to what you think that erm you would how would you think about that as a accident
was it a who was to blame would you think
if we're gonna call it a UNK accident
so first of all we'll have a look at a UNK aspect of it then we'll have a look if whether or not it was UNK
can i ask you who you would think would be to blame for that accident
er UNK one could have maybe UNK down
yeah
would you agree with that
yeah
yes
mm
i think that as professional drivers we would all w look at that and s and see that er i mean been out with very many lorry drivers and er that is the way that i've sort of been with the majority of the guys that i've been in
every now and again you're with somebody who's putting their foot down and either not anticipating enough or not thinking in enough depth or they might have an attitude whereby sod it i'm just going anyway
but absolutely right i mean there the guy should be able to see that this person is closing up on there
and the thing to also as he gets closer as it's a foreign vehicle he should be able to
clock the
the left hand drive
yeah
clock that it's a left hand drive and therefore perhaps give a little bit more consideration to that driver and anticipate the fact that he might come out
now when the accident was all complete and over and the UNK of this vehicle was examined the speed was i think it was eighty two or eighty three miles an hour stan wasn't it
yeah that's right
now
that's plenty fast enough for a for a thirty eight tonne UNK vehicle isn't it
fully UNK
plenty fast enough
he's got a bit of a roll on going down the hill would you not agree
now again that is too fast for an h g v
it's too fast for anybody in some circumstances
but let's face it gents speed in itself on a completely open road with nobody around is not in itself dangerous that's down to the individual
i might suggest that perhaps eighty three miles an hour is a bit over the top anyway
but when you've got other moving vehicles around and things which could happen eighty three miles an hour is far too bloody fast isn't it
far too fast
so certainly er your point is absolutely right
what so what be p doing then would be looking assessing and anticipating that this might happen and then UNK off and an and holding back to see whether a is he going to come out or b is he going to steady
you're satisfied he's staying where he is before you move through
what about erm any would you say an er blame attached to anybody else
well er partially in that the lorry that pulled out
yeah
mainly for the boy at the back
because of his speed and er th certainly this one here i mean the highway code says that you must make sure that it's safe before you commence an UNK manoeuvre
and he hasn't done that has he
erm he's alright you can excuse the fact that he might be a left hand drive vehicle
this bloke here has only just come about fifteen miles up the road
he's from his depot
he hasn't come far
no telling us where i don't know this one come but being a foreign driver i mean he could have from anywhere in the country and he could have been on the road a long time
and the fact that he's a left hand drive he's erm perhaps not got quite the view out of his offside mirror or our offside mirror it would be to us that perhaps somebody like yourselves have with er a right hand drive vehicle
so he certainly didn't pay due care to the pace and the speed and make sure that he'd got a safe gap before pulling out
so certainly
i think the end result was that erm i say this man was dead so married man with four children just coming home from work UNK his own business
he got two years for UNK death by UNK driving
this one was done for driving without due care and attention and he got the maximum fine
it was fifteen hundred quid or something like that
but that was the result
now we've got it erm are we switched on here stan
yeah
gonna do it for me
th this is just a video of the erm accident itself
it only shows you the UNK of it but i it's erm just highlights the point
and when we're talking about defensive techniques UNK obviously is one of the things which is the UNK of the top drivers isn't it
your degree of UNK is it's one of the most important things which is going to keep us safe
one of the top skills a UNK got have on a road if he's gonna maintain safety
this guy when he the policeman spoke to him afterwards his words to the policeman now let's bear in mind he might have been in shock
his words to the policeman were i like driving fast don't i
i know but i mustn't say that on here
this is not for er any sort of this i i'm doing this talk here for erm UNK daughter who's at er college and she likes to hear the sound of my voice when i'm UNK
so
if i do say the odd naughty word just UNK at me
so you can see that er that's the UNK underneath there
they're just UNK into it there
it's absolutely smashed to UNK
it took three hours to get what was left of the body out
that's a job in itself then
n
yeah
mm
if you think of the trauma on the people who have to deal with that
aye
now you never forget those sort of things
yeah
cos both mick
aye
and i were used to do that sort of work and er
you can remember every incident
particularly those that very UNK
you never really forget them
i know those pictures there are just showing you the result of something but you know when we discuss erm er a p er a situation it's not a theoretical situation it's something which happened something that does happen
and erm you know as lorry drivers we class ourselves as the professionals of the road but at the end of the day our standards or our reputation is UNK by the actions of a few isn't it
and i'm sure that when we go down the road we can although i we're always ready to look at erm car drivers and some of the stupid things they do and some of the stupid things that they do which UNK us at the end of the day w you've still got to bear in mind that erm there are people in our own UNK as it were that er don't do as they should
but let's see just see the number plate on it underneath there the
UNK rolled right over the top
sometimes these blokes they have just to commit one particular error resulting in a action like that
and erm
just that one wee mistake
that's all it needs
that's right
having said that the UNK of that particular vehicle illustrated that as far as the speed was concerned it wasn't one isolated incident
in other words he was consistently at that i part on that particular day
without UNK on previous ones on that particular day he was pushing it
for whatever reason
and the reason doesn't matter as mick has said because we're talking about the situation and the man's attitude of mind at that particular time
all that's all that it needs you know for him to alter his attitude
right
so when we're talking about defensive driving and we're talking about safety which is the main object of all this to keep yourself safe one of the most important things is the attitude of the individual would you not agree
and it's the attitude i think that very often causes everything from a major accident like that where someone loses their life and very often to the small little UNK on a lorry which occurs in a in a in a yard
the attitude of the driver
bit too fast bit too UNK whatever the case may be
having said that i've been on some of the deliveries that you guys have to do and some of the places where you have to go into and er i fully appreciate it's not easy
and the fact that i say that a lot of these accidents happen because perhaps you're not paying the attention very often i've been or know of situations where the bloke is really paying attention to what he's doing and the still the unfortunate occurs
so i'm i don't want to sit here UNK than thou start preaching that erm you know things are not going to happen because we're all human and we all make errors
but erm we could cut down an awful lot of these accidents and erm it doesn't matter at the end of the day what level it is
cos the end result th the potential is always there
do you follow what i mean
the end result might only be a slight scratch but the potential might have been in that situation for something a lot worse
so it's always there
and attitude is the thing which erm we look at quite closely and i think you must consider your attitude
for instance a person who naturally er y has a got a bit of a short fuse
now that very often you get that sort of individual their attitude could at some or other be detrimental to their standard of driving
would you not agree with that
so she other thing is you get p some people who are naturally aggressive
car drivers for instance you get car you the your neighbour is probably the UNK bloke you've ever met in your life
soon as he gets behind the wheel of a car he's an absolute UNK
taxi drivers
you probably know a few
what are you looking at me for
we must have touched a little spot there i think stan
so th this a aggressive attitude
now the other way of course which your attitude can er be affected is that you're probably yourself quite a relaxed steady sort of guy but do you respond do you react to the UNK of another road user
in other words someone throws down the UNK do you pick it up
you know we've all see th t one we've discussed a couple of times
down the motorway say just two lanes or whatever roadworks ahead all moving down the offside lane closes in eight hundred yards six hundred yards and you're going along in your lorry and the cars going
two hundred yards still going by
three inches
they're still gonna try and get by if they can
now very often i c you can understand it can't you that these people and you're in the queue
you you're sort of just stopping and starting stopping and starting as the others are going down
and you could quite rightly think why don't they take their turn
now you could react in two ways
there's the one coming down right at the last minute wants to get in at th the very last minute
you've got two options
the o
what was that dougie
oh sorry i mustn't mention the name
that's right
you can as i said just now pick up the UNK and say squeeze him out and force him through the UNK and whatever thing might result of that you just don't know or you can say well alright ease off go on you have the space i don't really need it i'm not in a hurry
now the correct attitude we all know is the one where you ease off
and i suggest to you gents that's the only way you can drive without getting involved in something
cos the minute you react to what that person's doing your involved and y and you're as bad as he is
so the other thing you've got to think about if you do react the wrong way and we've probably all been tempted to at times if we haven't done it but if you do react the wrong way consider who is that person coming by
you think it could possibly be and it may well be some rep in his car rushing from here to there don't give a UNK about anybody else as long as he gets where he wants to go
and that is in your mind when you react the other way
would you not agree
have you ever considered to stop to think well it might be your son your daughter who's just passed their test and that's doing this in er and just doesn't know any better
i mean because motorways can be quite frightening to people who've just passed their test
and they get themselves in situations don't they UNK drivers
which they wish to god they'd never got into
so it might be with a bit of help from you y you could teach them a valuable lesson
i it may not be the case but i think it's possibility you've got to consider isn't it
that by UNK off holding back you could teach them a valuable lesson and they they'd sit there and you've seen them sometimes when they come alongside you and they're forced and th they don't what to and they look up and go
there's fear they're pale
and er so i think there's a thing you could think of there is that who is this person doing this
it might not be the UNK you think it is
it might be a lady driver with a couple of children in the car again doing her incompetent best
so i'd just ask yourself the question before you react UNK towards a situation like this
worth the hassle
sorry
is it worth the hassle
well that alone
that alone
because at the end of the day if something does happen you've got all this filling in to do and you might well turn around and say it wasn't my fault you could turn around and say it was their fault for coming by
but was this situation UNK
it's worse when and you go
i'd just like to sort of show you and th this is a
you've probably seen this have you
yes
it's an accident on the m six and er now if you look there in a moment you'll see a car come out of control up through there
is that rain
that's rain yeah
look see he's just he UNK trying to brake
look at the van on
oh
the central UNK
everyone's trying to brake and get out of the way
now that starts it
look at the white van on the right
now obviously he's got nowhere to go
now watch the white van in the middle
he can't stop
now look at the fast lane at them all pi UNK in the back
oh dear
oh dear
oh
that one goes right across
ooh he just managed to make it
that's for all the people a couple of miles up the road
now look at right at the very back
at the back
er right at the top there you'll see an UNK right into the back
see him going across there
right across the carriageway
well that's effectively UNK that hasn't it
mm
doesn't take long does it
no
attitude play a bit of a part in that
hadn't noticed that
it could have been
the film is
probably a couple or three years old now and it was
right
taken by
sixth of august ninety
wish you could do that here
that'd be fine
aha
turn it all back
start again
the first guy who slipped there probably these people that s maybe one or two in his
what one
what one
and then this
yeah
as well as
looking at those that were involved in the accident look how close look how close
they are there
aye
but look at some of the others
you'll s
that guy i mean he was UNK it
he was
he just couldn't stop so he UNK out you see and lost control
mm
he was so close
aye
and er he realized too late
h i was gonna say look at that lorry up there which is probably this one
now er some of them can stop you see
mm
yeah
some can stop
coming down through there at the top there i think we've probably missed them now
th there er look
now he's
coming down quite steady
there are some of
those are driving quite sensibly and can stop
he UNK up behind
what we're trying to say gents is that a situation like this the best driver in the world really y you could get involved in something
but you can take efforts you can make the effort yourself to keep yourself safe
separation distance
is the mo especially in that sort of weather
you've gotta keep well back
you've gotta give yourself that time to react and that room to manoeuvre
and if you've got somebody right up your bum keep further space so that you can lead them into a situation safely as opposed to sort of having a anchor on yourself
now i it's the sort of thing that you y you read about you pick up the paper you put n news on and nasty accident on the m eight or m six whatever the case may be and a lot of vehicles are involved
so the lesson to be learnt from that is that erm it's not always possible to keep yourself out of trouble but you can do what you have to do to keep yourself safe by maintaining a proper separation distance
and bearing in mind when you get that sort of weather the separation distance has to be double
do you know what th we mean by the two second rule
no
if you pass a too fast
that's right
and for lorries they say four seconds
which should be in some cases be doubled in very bad weather like that
now obviously the you could see the cars in that fast lane there they were just nose to tail nose to tail
and you can see them like that every day you drive down a motorway
but stop and think gents have you ever seen lorry drivers like that
mhm
mm
mhm
now
a lot of people would turn round and say right i'm a lorry driver and i leave a nice gap
what happens to the gap
somebody will pull int between it
but then you might feel that you're going backwards but you still just modify your position to keep that gap there
and just ask yourselves the question when another UNK coming by you what do you do when he's just clear
flash
flash him to let him come in
and when he comes in what have you done to your safety distance
so again it's a thing which you might consider when you're er letting vehicles come in front and er i the rights and UNK of erm flashing lights er really the only flashing lights should take the place of a horn
that is the highway UNK erm system for flashing signals
y drivers we know they have their own code and er what we say is although we perhaps don't agree with it ourselves you do it
all we say is that just be a little bit more UNK about when you do it
don't go along the road trying to keep yourself a nice separation distance and as soon as the tail end of another lorry has passed you flash him in and then you're like this
consider UNK the flash till he's gone by a bit further or whatever the case may be
and there's no doubt about it the flashing of the lights is a beneficial thing
especially i mean you're in the UNK and you've got UNK fitted now have you all of you
you're in the UNK lane and you're going UNK and er you're UNK away quite nicely you see a guy coming down in the fast lane down the hill getting a bit of a roll on fully UNK and he gets halfway up the hill he runs out of steam and he's looking for a hole to get into
so as a l fellow lorry driver you would probably think well i'll ease off and when you think you've got a gap there you give him a flash okay mate you can come in now
now he he's quite erm UNK of that isn't he
he's quite pleased to think that someone's given him a hole to get into
so that's nothing wrong i mean that's fine
but just consider as i say when you flash people that you've got to maintain the separation distance
now th there's two things we want the separation distance for and one of them as you say is time to react
react
and to stop
what's the other reason we want er a nice separation distance between ourselves and the vehicle in front for
probably even more important to some extent
so as you can see
so that you can see
obviously when you're driving along the road the observation y wants to be up the road as far as it possibly can be
and er therefore if you can see mile half a mile quarter of a mile up the road you can see other vehicles slowing down brake lights coming on
you don't need the brake lights of the guy in front of you to tell that he's gonna stop you've anticipated that in a minute this guy's gonna stop so you you're already er UNK and slowing down
now if you just pull in a little bit too close it's a natural reaction of the body to direct the eyes at the vehicle which is going to cause you the danger
and even though you may physically be able to see up the road your eyes won't be looking there
and then so now you're travelling a little bit too close your eyes are UNK on the back of the vehicle in front what's the sort of feeling you get
a little bit UNK up
and i you're a bit on edge
and yet people you see them lorry drivers and car drivers but lorry drivers themselves they're happy to go along the road at fifty sixty miles an hour with such a short distance between themselves and the vehicle in front
and the thing is when these sort of UNK and boxes like you've got on there you just can't see
and people are quite happy to do that and there's te the stress and the tension must build up inside
and er as probably er you gathered stan and i are both ex policemen in relation to erm to er our background and er i think i said yesterday to the er some of the guys as well one of the things that lorry drivers and policemen do have very much in common is that we have pr probably one the shortest erm pension lives of most UNK
and it's because of the UNK the UNK and the old bloody heart keep going
and as it t as er as you get on in later life you know it tells on you
so let's sort of think about attitude keep back keep ourselves safe
you're a lot less stressful you get to the end of your journey a lot UNK
you can take a journey of three hundred miles if you like
one guy's a bit of a UNK
pushing on pushing on
the other guy takes his time
the difference in the overall running time will be UNK
all the guy who's pushing on has done is got from one UNK to the next UNK quicker than the next UNK
i think that's fair to say that do you not
one guy's got there thinking cor
let's go and have a UNK i need something i've worn out had a hard day's work
the other guy will rea really get out of his cab and think well we've got here now go and have a cup of tea
all goes over his head
do you think there's any value in that
just like to show you a couple of videos now
we're talking about attitude
now th the first one is erm what is the first one stan
this is er
a personal carrier
oh no
the first one is a bloke wants to overtake
lorry in front car in front of him and he's number three
and he's so desperate to overtake
and the position he goes at
you could be a lorry coming the other way
again it's attitude
you see the lorry up the front
you see the one just pulling out
now that was now look at the vehicles coming the other way and there's a car in front of the opposing lorry
what a UNK
now he went completely blind didn't he
that lorry UNK as well
the one coming the other way
yeah
i think he's passing two
i think he's passing them both on the same time
mm
three of them
look at this
now this is a van load it's a it's a personnel carrier
a load of UNK going on a day out
now he starts to overtake and you'll see there's a UNK sign on the left a roundabout sign they're approaching
he's go no hole to get into and pr looks there the person not letting him in
so he stays out to the centre
so again he's approaching the roundabout and he wants to go straight on so he's completely in the wrong position
and what does he gain
why didn't he just stay where he was behind the UNK everyone else was taking their time
now watch as he goes round the roundabout
now he's on his way now yes let's get through here we can't hang about here let's get through and away
now as he comes out of the roundabout he starts UNK down the offside of those vehicles
which throws him he's got no view there has he
no view whatsoever
and as you'll see in a moment he's completely on the wrong side of the road
now what if something had been coming the other way
another lorry
UNK completely blind
attitude
it's gotta be hasn't it really
mm
just an aggressive pushing attitude
now you'll see the speed in the bottom left hand corner
now this guy is er out for a little afternoon run on his motorbike
now the thing is you'll see in a moment UNK some lorries
you'll see some lorries up the top one of the being an n f t lorry
i think you might find one of the lorries is UNK the other one
and er he's being followed by an UNK police car
and you can see what have got up to
oh we're just getting into four gear now i think
now there're the lorries and the see the n f t just up there going round the bend
must be going
no that's a policeman
his hands er s he's a bit worried
now he he's gotta find somewhere to go so where's the only p place that's clear
the hard shoulder
now as he comes in front of that lorry back onto the carriageway if the one that was over taking suddenly decides to pull back in his mate having UNK him the value of a UNK mirror
mind you you'd have to be quick wouldn't you
cos he'd be
look and he's gone up through there
now er
see all the flashing lights of the vehicles there they're so UNK they're flashing their lights all over the shop at him er as he goes
mm
through
but he actually went through between those two goods vehicles
came up and shot in and then went round
and UNK there's an UNK there
you know an exit
mm
now you s there's a situation where that was attitude absolutely stupid
the num amount of vehicles which were around
now this one is speed in itself
not the erm UNK of vehicles to the extent we saw with the UNK film just now but this is erm again the police car is staying well back cos he's following this vehicle you can see a hundred and thirteen well the UNK gets up to about a hundred and forty in a moment as you'll see
it's a s a straightforward er an m r two
this is a s er UNK or a UNK carlton with a UNK engine
and he's following er a UNK m r two
and er th this guy
has got his nine year old son in the car and he's showing his son how fast his new car's gonna go
still not making a lot of impression on this guy
where is it
h he's just he's right in the distance
in fact the camera can't quite pick him out
as i say the
now what was he going at that speed for
just to show his son how fast his new car's gonna go
er but how long was he doing it for
well look er th this was more or
less shows you the whole of the chase
but th that's actually they followed him for about ten miles
so he's done that for five minutes there
so anyway we i've got it here somewhere
so er just a just a few instances o of actual film of things which happen on the road which UNK attitude
any comments on what we've got there
now they're sort of things that you've probably seen yourself quite frequently i would think
so the other the main thing we're thinking about then with the defensive driving technique one of the most important things is attitude
so naturally we'll be looking to see the attitude of a guy when we're sitting there
that's it thanks
what was that one
that's the erm car in the
a and the
double white lines system we'll show you this one in a minute and coming the other way you will see there's an overtake
and th i'm sure every one of you have been in that situation where somebody's suddenly UNK out and committed UNK to an overtake and they've got nowhere to go at all
and that's a prime example of it
and you see the accident with the car driver when the brakes come on
but watch where the brakes come on
in other words if the bloke hadn't have got back there would've been a f a total impact
cos he wou his reaction time UNK cos he wasn't expecting it ce happened like that and hi his reaction time was too slow to compensate for the UNK of the bloke coming the other way
but you'll all recognize the situation
after this one it runs into one with a car er car UNK
the attitude of a lorry driver which you can have a look at
here he comes look
watch the bloke coming up there
now here he is look see
now see how the brake lights
ooh
now
UNK
the brake lights are that there
far too late cos he didn't couldn't and i'm not UNK
see the van UNK
the fact just a question of the bloke didn't have time
you know didn't have the time
mm
to react
completely UNK against th o over the double white line in all that traffic
there er here's a situation with this er rather aggressive attitude of a car UNK driver
now he's UNK because he can't see but nevertheless look at the gap there
the slightest movement with those
three lorries and there's a real UNK isn't there
what's the safety margins there
think of the UNK between those vehicles there you know the air displacement as they pass
it's thirty seven miles an hour
not fast but it's fast enough for that sort of distance between each oth
i bet UNK themselves
he found out what colour UNK was when he got home
now you'll see him in a moment he this guy driving he wants to go off on a slip road
and it's one of those slip roads where you off and other people join at the same place
but he's not g
UNK
he's not UNK er yeah UNK a typical example of this
aye
but he's not g no give and take with this guy he's just taking advantage of his size
er and he's going you watch in moment the way he s see there's the one trying to come out look
look
and he got straight in front there
there now watch and see the how he UNK the central UNK those UNK
now if that car had pushed on and didn't brake when he did that driver would either have taken car out or the keep left UNK wouldn't he
his speed was such he didn't approach it at a speed where he could erm er l lay off and er let something happen
so they're just examples of attitude gents which and it's attitude which causes the problems
if you have a more UNK attitude one where you're going to sort of give way to people show a little bit more consideration to other road users i think you'd find that it's gonna it pays off
right very briefly we've been here a little while now is erm we're just gonna a little talk about the other aspects of what we call a defensive driving technique
have we got something on there stan
no that's the fog one
the erm
fog
yeah thanks
we'll show that in a minute
yeah
so what a el else are we gonna to be looking for
when we're talking about defensive driving attitude plays a big part
the other thing we're looking at of course is your technique as a driver
now the technique that you employ driving your vehicle is divided into two parts
how you control the vehicle and how you read the road ahead
now UNK we can look at various things and i think last year we had various discussions on different things but naturally you're looking for smooth positive control of the vehicle
a nice balance between UNK and UNK
now i know that now you've got or two erm UNK boxes yes
and UNK not necessarily all the time
but nevertheless a nice balance can be obtained by giving that split time to get in
if you rush it too much you can very often find you're in a false neutral can't you or whatever the case may be
then you've got to start again to try and get it
invariably it's done through bad timing or trying to rush it
not always
it does a little bit of technique to get used to these things i ag i agree
but so we're looking for a nice balance between UNK and UNK that you're not being UNK and the not UNK is not bloody flying every time that you take let your foot to engage a gear
nice balance of steering
the steering should always be smooth progressive and accurate
it's gonna get your vehicle where it wants to go
now steering on its own can very often be complicated by other aspects such as your correct speed for the situation
co that can affect your steering can't it
if you're sort of travelling a bit too fast you've gotta rush your steering things might not be right
but your er basic style of steering and naturally we come from a training establishment we think and we practise the push pull method
we think that is the best method
because it's the most accurate it's the UNK and you're always in a position to respond should you want more or less steering
if you go over the top underneath or palm you are not
er plus the fact your hands could slip off the wheel or whatever
so we er advocate this
but we s we know that people have their own styles
you might have been driving for years by going over the top of the wheel as a lot of lorry drivers do
so although we think that our method is best we fully realize that you've got styles things th which you've built up over many years
and providing your steering is smooth positive and accurate then we accept it
it's no real problem
so we realize we're not gonna be here to change the habits that have built up over a lifetime
you can't change habits like that b in two or three hours
but if there was an aspect of your steering like erm
er i've got two i've just been two UNK who are not doing very well and they the end of term they've you know the teacher's said they're sort of very far behind and they need to do some work during the holidays
now normally over each break there's not that much there's i've had a few students who say they want lessons through the holiday cut normally not that much but this
mm
this holiday everyone's saying ooh yeah i need some more lessons you know
i'm going away on monday so i haven't allowed for all this so i'm trying to
yeah
rearrange everything to fit them it
let's have a look at
this week
then
yeah this is what wanna i just got onto like the first lesson of it
okay
erm notes you see they were just er exercise that we done out of the book
right
erm that was week eight we started on that yeah
you're okay on trig aren't you
n no this is one
no
no this is erm where bearings and that come into it
mm
i sort of was a bit lost on me trig so that's really what i want to get to go through a bit of trig
right okay so are you happy with sine cos tan
you know which one's which and how to sort them out
i could do with it going over
okay
these they'll be on the front of the paper
erm you'll have sine you'll probably have a triangle with a b c marked on it
mm
and it's say sine is a over b or something
the best thing to do with that are you you're more used to erm you're more used to opposite over adjacent and things like that aren't you
or
yeah well we what i normally think you see is when we've got ninety degrees there
yeah
that's the opposite
the hypotenuse is the long one
right
and that's the adjacent
okay so
is that in every case
easy way to sort them out this with trig or with pythagoras you're only working with a right angles triangle
so find the right angle which is usually pretty obvious and the side opposite that the longest side is the hypotenuse which is a long word
yeah
so it's the long side
okay
so the longest side is
so
the hypotenuse
the longest side the biggest side is always opposite the biggest angle
mhm
that's the hypotenuse
and then depends on which angle we're working with
well if we're working with this one down here okay let's say that's forty degrees or something
the next easiest one to sort out after the hypotenuse is the one that's opposite
mhm
so that's opposite the angle that we're working with
and the one that's left is
the adjacent
must be the adjacent okay
so that'll work for every triangle
yeah
if you'd been working with this angle instead we didn't know that and we're trying to work with this one or we say we're interested in this angle so that will be the opposite and this would be the adjacent
mhm
and that's where the confusion comes in that it varies depending on which angle
so just go over that again
so first of all go for your right angle
mhm
and the hypotenuse that's the biggest
yeah
that's always going to
right
be true
the next thing to do is which angle am i working with
so this one you're working with that thirty five degrees
mhm
this is the angle we're interested in
yeah
so if we're going to work out sine tan or cos of this angle that's its opposite
yeah
and the one left is the adjacent
right
same with all of these
mhm
now if we were looking at these the other way up right if somebody gave you the triangle
yeah
and they said i want to work out this angle
mhm
well there's you right angle that's still the hypotenuse which one would be the opposite now if we're dealing with this angle
er for dealing with that a that'd be the opposite yeah
that's it that's opposite and the one left is
adjacent
okay same
yeah
if we were working with that
so the opposite is the one opposite the angle
right
right
just write that down for us
so it's the one opposite the angle
first of all go for the right angle sort out the hypotenuse okay
and then work out which angle
yeah
you're going to deal with
right
which angle has the sine cos or tan right and then that's two if you like two a work out the angle and then two b work out which is the opposite
mhm
the opposite is always opposite the
opposite the angle
angle yeah
okay
work out the opposite and then three the adjacent sorts itself out then
yeah
the adjacent is the one left over
mhm
that'll work for that'll work every time
right
so you won't you know you know you won't be
mm
ah now which one am i supposed to be using here
yeah
okay
okay
so front of your sheet you will have things like sine is a over b or things like that just write on the front of your sheet and convert it so that you've got sine is equal to what do you know what sine is
sine erm no i should really brush up on it
i mean i know it's so c
mixed up
it doesn't matter cos it'll be there
so c so something
silly old cow or something like that some people remember it
yeah er
so
so ca
i'll just get this
in one of these
i think you had it near the front of your notes actually
yeah
let's see pythagoras on this first one no
no
i it'll be on one of these
see i do i get them right in the class
good
but er it tends to go a bit out of your head
right
let's have a look at another one at pythagoras as well as
there was a i mean i've also been given a couple of ways to remember it but
right you can't remember the ways to remember it
i've got it written down somewhere but
there you are UNK
okay
japanese isn't it UNK
okay so what would what would sine be from that then
what would the sine be right so erm which one are we on
so that's the first one sine
the sine is the opposite over the hypotenuse
good
and the cos
is the adjacent over the hypotenuse
yep and tan
is the opposite over the adjacent
okay
but they will be on the front of your sheet
they won't be written like that in terms of opposite
not even with this new change that's happening
well at the moment they're putting them as just label the sides a b c and they'll say
mm
sine is a over b
yeah
cos is c over b
right
like that
erm it's just that it throws you a bit if you've learnt them that way
so
mhm
just label the triangle that they've got opposite over opposite and hypotenuse and adjacent and translate what they've got written there and use those
mhm
so if we just do one
yeah
erm
cos i wouldn't mind doing one working out with the with the
right
just so i can er brush up on
so there's a triangle and we're interested in this angle here is forty degrees say
mhm
okay so
right all have gotta add up to a hundred and eighty hasn't it
right so if you'd like to label that triangle
label it right erm UNK be the opposite
okay
UNK be the hypotenuse and UNK be the adjacent
that's it right okay
so
that'd be ninety
that's the ninety
yeah
okay
which would
so we know that erm we're standing let's say we're standing a hundred and twenty metres
yeah
away from the bottom of this building
right now we know that the angle from where we are up to the top is forty degrees
yeah
right
how would you work out the height of the building
i don't know
erm well let's call it h or call it UNK if you like
mhm
the height of the building is UNK
now can you see any of these
oh i see
so you want to find the height
right
and you're calling it UNK
right
so it's going to be the UNK isn't it
which one's got the opposite and which two sides which o
because that hasn't got the opposite
which ones do we which one do we know
oh i see
yeah we know the adjacent
right we know the adjacent
and we know the opposite
and we're trying to find out the UNK so we want something that ties up UNK and adjacent
which one is that
UNK
okay
right
so we've got tan forty degrees equals UNK over adjacent which is equal to well we don't know UNK so we'll just leave it as UNK over a hundred and twenty
okay so if you find the tan of forty degrees
now how do i do that do i just
oh okay you just put forty degrees in
forty f forty
and then press tan
and then the equals
that's it
do i press that no makes no difference
that's nought point eight three nine one
okay leave that in
so it's nought point eight three nine etcetera
mhm
okay and we've got opposite over a hundred and twenty at the moment and we want we just want opposite
so what would we do to both sides of the equation what would we do to that side to turn it into opposite instead of opposite divided by a hundred and twenty
don't know
right if think of a number any number you like
yeah
okay multiply it by ten and now divide it by ten
back to the number you thought of
ten
okay
yeah
think of a number multiply it by two now divide it by two back to the number you though of
mhm
so think of some number right divide it by a hundred and twenty now we want to get it back to the number we first thought of so what
mhm
would we multiply it by
we thought of some number divided by one twenty now we want it go back to the number we thought of
er what would you make it one twenty
so that's it
we just multiply it by one twenty now
any number you like divided by one twenty then multiplied by one twenty comes back to that number
mhm
so that will just cancel out and we'll have that
now we do it to one side of the equation so there that's one twenty write it out again nought point eight three nine etcetera is equal to opposite divided by a hundred and twenty
multiply that side by a hundred and twenty so we must do the same on the other side of the equation
mhm
right so we multiply this by a hundred and twenty
so what if i just go
times it
times one two o
okay
equals one hundred point six nine
so we've got on this side one hundred point
six nine
six nine equals UNK
so that's the height
so the height is a hundred point six nine metres
now you'll then have to look and see if they tell you to give it to the nearest metre or the nearest maybe the nearest maybe the nearest point one of a metre or three significant figures or three decimal places
mhm
and make sure that you give it the way they want
now what would that be to the nearest metre
a hundred
would it
no a hundred and one
right okay watch that watch the UNK if it's
mm
point five or more you round up
mhm
so opposite is equal to the height
of the building which is equal to a hundred and one metres to the nearest metre
yeah
now if there'd been i don't know the length of this or something
yeah
then you'd use it's what you do is you work out which ones do we know
well we know
mhm
the angle and we know that so how can we it up
so this slightly different than looking for angles isn't it
cos say i was looking for angles and that would've just been fifty up here wouldn't it
right that would be fifty
yeah
so let's do
but then you wouldn't need the erm UNK theory would you for that
if we've got if we've got the angle usually we g going to use trig
mhm
if we've got two side but we haven't got an angle then we'll just use pythagoras
mhm
okay
have a look at this the other way up
we didn't know that angle but we
mhm yeah
knew this one was fifty
right well this time
we want that'll become the
we'll get
opposite
we'll get that's the that's going to be the opposite
that'd be the
that's still the hypotenuse that never changes
but this one would be the opposite and this one now would be the
ad adjacent
okay
that's the one looking at fifty degrees
yeah
so this time what do we know
well we know the opposite and we're trying to find the adjacent
mhm
so which one of these uses opposite and adjacent
tan
so it'll be tan again but his time we'll have tan fifty is equal to one twenty over the adjacent which is what we're trying to find
right
multiply both sides by adjacent
so on this side
we get adjacent
we've got fifty tan haven't we
fifty tan
okay
that's one point ni one nine
one point one nine
nine
okay equals a hundred and twenty over adjacent now multiply both by adjacent
adjacent times one point one nine is equal to a hundred and twenty
yeah
we multiply adjacent there and adjacent here
now divide both sides by one point one nine
adjacent times one point one nine over one point one nine equals a hundred and twenty over one point one nine
okay
mhm
they cancel out so the adjacent is going to be that
so if you do if you just press ah
one two o
divided by
divided by one point nine
now if you just put in fifty
divided by fifty
put fifty and then tan and now equals
now we've divided it by the tan of fifty because you see
well that comes to a hundred and sixty nine
if you round up half way through the way you were going to do then
mhm
and just call it one point one nine
mm
you lose quite a bit of accuracy
mhm
so again that comes to a hundred point six nine
so it doesn't matter which way you do it and which way round you do it
yeah
and which angle we work with it still come to the same thing
so you can
mhm
do it either way
yeah
and usually you'll work with the angle that you've been given rather
mm
than working out the other one
so some of them will be given and some of them won't and you'll work out which ones can i fit in here opposite adjacent or that
now on is that okay
yeah
or do you think
well
could do with another one
yeah i could do with another one i think
okay
er let's see if we've got
you see these ones i suppose
let's pick one out of there then
erm all he's been doing here is getting me to find the sides
see opposite hypotenuse adjacent
opposite adjacent this is what you've been talking about the a the angle isn't it
okay
it's only just UNK on me now how he's got to that
right
hypotenuse is the longest side and the opposite is opposite to the
angle
angle
and the adjacent is the one left over
which makes that the adjacent
that's it
yeah
and you've got these written in here sine
mm
cos and tan
we've been using the words UNK to help remember these
each angle has its own unique sine UNK or UNK
this means they can be stored in a scientific calculator
er
they're usually not stored they're calculated inside the calculator
the calculator
yeah
has a little program that goes UNK away
mm
working it out
mm
oh there are silly old howard UNK and his team of UNK
okay can you remember that
what
silly old howard UNK and his team of UNK
er the maths teacher in school didn't like that cos he's an UNK supporter
ooh
right can you remember that
as i say it will be on the front of the sheet so you can
i'd probably remember that easier to be honest UNK
mm UNK
i mean having found you know this sine is the opposite over the hypotenuse tan is basically what you've got to find i suppose is which two sides of the triangle you're using
that's it
yeah
and so you'll look for sort of these two UNK to find out whether it'll be a UNK a UNK or a sine
exactly that's it
yeah
that that's all there is to it
what sides have i got here
right and let's say in this one we had opposite and adjacent so we said where does that come there it is opposite and adjacent so it'll be tan
now if it had been opposite and hypotenuse which one would you have used
it would have been sine
and if you'd had adjacent and hypotenuse
it would've been UNK
that's it
mm
that's all there is
yeah
to it
once you've sort of spotted that which you have you
mm
shouldn't have any trouble at all
yeah
so let's just try one to sort that out
erm here UNK we've got a lad with a UNK it's fixed on the ground well let's say let's say it's fixed on the ground first of all and erm we're trying to find out how high it is and it's directly over this point which is erm and we don't we don't know
we know it's at an angle of ooh let's use forty degrees again
the UNK string is making an angle of forty degrees there and it's got a hundred metres of the line payed out
and he wants to know how high it is
mhm
so the first thing is what what's the first thing you do
find the sides
okay so the first thing to go in which is pretty obvious
that's it
which would make this the opposite
right
this the adjacent and this the
which is the one you really did first isn't it
UNK what
in fact you really did the hypotenuse first i think
yeah
cos you put the right angle in you though right
yeah
okay so what do we know and what are we trying to find out
well we know we've got an angle of forty degrees
okay
erm a hundred metres we want to find the height
so we want to find the opposite
right and what do we know which of the other sides do we know
the adjacent
mm we don't know that do we
no
oh er the hypotenuse is at forty
that's the hundred metres that's the length of his string
there's his UNK on the end of that
mhm
okay there's a hundred metres of string out so you know
yeah
the hypotenuse
so we've got opposite and hypotenuse and opposite which one ties those up
the hypotenuse and the opposite erm
have a have a look cos they will be on the sheet
okay
well it's opposite over hypotenuse is sine
right so just write the equation as you've got it there sine equals opposite over hypotenuse
so all
yeah
you need to write is sine of sine of forty equals what
equals the opposite over the hypotenuse
which is equal to a hundred
well what's the opposite
we don't know that's the one we're trying to find out so we just put
we don't know do we yeah you wouldn't put ninety degrees would you we don't know
no opposite that angle
yeah we don't know we want the height
that side so okay it's just
and
just put so just write UNK
and we'll find it later
mhm
and the hypotenuse is
a hundred
yeah
right
so if you calculate the sine of a hundred of forty degrees now and leave it in the calculator
for doing that you go forty
that's it forty and then sine
helps if i put the calculator four o
sine
sine and you don't need to put press the equals do you do it's nought point six four two
so we've got nought point six four etcetera
mm
is equal to opposite divided by a hundred
well we don't want opposite divided by a hundred we want just opposite
so what would we multiply this thing by to turn it into just opposite
a hundred
that's it
so we multiply by a hundred on that side so we must multiply by a hundred by a hundred on the other side to keep
mhm
it balanced
yeah
what's a hundred times that come to
so i'll go times one nought equals sixty four point two
sixty four point
two seven
which is nearer point three
yeah
sixty four point two seven nine
eight seven UNK eight
oh sorry two seven eight seven six
yeah
two seven eight seven six etcetera is equal to
that's fine so that's opposite
and it depends on what they want if they want it to three decimal places with this
yeah
they probably want it to about the nearest metre
yeah
how high is it to the nearest metre
so what would that be to the nearest metre
it'd be sixty four wouldn't it
excellent sixty four metres is equal to the opposite
right
height
now can we
to the nearest metre
okay
erm it might be this might be the paper actually no i don't think it is
i don't think it's the one i was thinking of
erm what was i thinking of
yeah could we do number twelve
okay
i mean i've not done it before this is
right
a paper that i
a straight section of motorway UNK between p and q
so this is this is drawing a scale diagram
mhm
this isn't calculating it using sine and cos or anything
oh isn't it oh well
but they haven't it looks as if it's a right angle there
mm
it might not be
you can't take it that it is you have to draw your scale diagram
yeah
now how would you draw this diagram
i haven't read the question so
okay
the diagram below shows a s straight section of motorway
mhm
nine hundred metres long p to q is nine hundred metres long
and a church c which is seven hundred metres from p
right
and five hundred metres from q
b is a bridge over the motorway UNK between p and q
mhm
using a scale a one centimetre representing a hundred metres so that'll be nine centimetres
right
draw round like the point p
that'd be nine centimetres erm five centimetres and seven centimetres
okay
so how would you go about doing that diagram
i'd erm i wouldn't have thought of using a UNK but you're right aren't you
okay have you do you
do you want a ruler
i've got one somewhere
okay so you decided on your scale and you decided it was nine centimetres along there okay and f the way to do it fairly accurately is just draw a line that's a bit longer than nine
mhm
and the measure off nine on it
give yourself a starting place get the zero on that nicely
mhm
and then nine
right
now i've done the hard bit there straight line
yeah
what are we going to do about this church how are you going to find out where that church c is
erm well it's seven centimetres
okay
if i just put a point then i measured up to there
mhm
and see if i got five centimetres five
so
just say if that was seven and mm er that'd end up seven
i don't know
er maybe i should do it on graph paper
no cos your graph paper wouldn't show you the s at an angle
no
you could do it with two UNK couldn't you
if you put one ruler on here and kept sliding them about until it was
yeah
seven from there and five from there
mhm
but there's a much easier way of doing it
right what is it
well use your UNK and just draw that's p show me all the points that are seven hundred metres from p
draw the draw the path of all the points that are seven hundred metres from p
an idea here
hey
that there so er that's seven hundred right
okay
and this is p
right
right
so if we sort of went like that
okay
that's the that's the path isn't it
right
and if we set this on five
brilliant that's it okay you've got it
like that and set it on q
right
right where it meets which is there
that's it
so anywhere along there is seven from p anywhere along this one is five from q
and that place where they meet
should be
five from q and seven form p
should be just right then shouldn't it
yeah so we'll go simple when you know how innit
it's like a lot of things if you if you do know how to do them you think what's the problem if you haven't
yeah
done them before oh lovely thanks very much
have you had your hair cut then
yes oh you don't like it do you
i've no comment no comment
no i prefer longer hair for women
yeah
yeah my wife's always saying she's going to have her hair cut
yeah
and then measure that angle it says
right now where's the question oh here it is up here isn't it
use that one or another one
now how do you measure an angle
i'm not used to using this on a circle
ah hang on
right
you gotta get it somewhere like that haven't you
mhm
or has it gotta be on this line here
well the angle we're measuring is this one here what angle are we going to measure
find the angle p c q so
p c q so we're measuring this angle here
it looks very much like a right angle
mhm
so we need this on one of the lines yeah
yeah
and that little cross sometimes it's a little hole on the corner on the angle itself
mhm
now we can measure it and it's not
ninety
not ninety it's
eighty five
what have we got have a look i mean we don't know that we've draw this completely accurately
looks about ninety four
yeah right
right
yeah
ninety four
how could we check if it is actually ninety and we've got it wrong
that was seven wasn't it and this was er sorry that was nine that was nine
no that was nine that was seven and this was five
that's seven and that's five
how could we check if that was if that's really supposed to be ninety and we've and the UNK not quite right
cos that line you've drawn there
it's just slightly off yeah
doesn't go to that point at all so that would make see how much difference that makes to the
mm
angle
yeah
so measure that angle again
now it's looking like about ninety one
yeah
ninety two ninety one ninety two
see and that's not quite on that there
and that's not quite on so that would bring it a little bit it might be about ninety two or something it might
mm
be ninety
how can we check if it is ninety
erm
from the numbers we've got there
by using one of the UNK
okay good
so if that if that's a right angle only if it's a right angle cos UNK doesn't work if it's not then we've got the easy way to remember pythagoras is long equals medium plus short
mhm
i mean it's not just the long it's long squared equals medium squared plus short the medium and the short sort of would add up to give the long
mhm
that's one way of thinking of it
so the long one squared does nine squared equal seven squared plus five squared
so what's nine squared
nine UNK is eighty one
okay yeah and seven squared
erm forty nine
alright and five squared
twenty five
right
what's forty nine and twenty five come to
well it doesn't
seventy four
it doesn't come to
seventy four
yeah seventy four it doesn't come to eighty one
no
so it's not a right angle triangle
but you look at the diagram they've given you which is not exactly the scale and they do this quite a bit
see it's about like that it's a little bit it's ninety and a tiny bit
yeah
and you look at it and you think ooh must be a right angle
mm
and a lot of people answering that question will just assume it's a right angle
yeah
and they'll do that and sort of get very few marks on it so watch
mhm
that when you've got one that looks like a right angle and they
mhm
don't say it is
yeah
but that way for doing pythagoras
erm let's have a look at a couple using pythagoras
let's say we've got erm this one is if that's thirteen and this one is twelve right mm with a bit of luck that should be a right angle UNK
it's not exactly a right angle it's not drawn to scale
but that's a right angle call it x or whatever you like
want to find that side and we know that's thirteen centimetres and that's twelve centimetres and that's a right angle how would how would you go about finding that
and you want to find that side well we get the right way wouldn't it let's see
that would sort of tell me that was the hypotenuse and that was the adjacent
right okay so that's the hypotenuse
adjacent
ah now you haven't got an adjacent or an opposite with pythagoras
oh no
you've got all you've got really you've got the hypotenuse but you don't need to bother with you just can call it the long one
mhm
and remember your equation long squared equals medium squared plus short squared
mhm
okay right which is the long one which is the longest one
thirteen
thirteen
so we get thirteen squared equals and what's the medium one
one three times one three equals one six nine
okay what's the medium one
and the medium one is x
is it
mm
on no sorry that's the short the medium one is twelve yeah
it doesn't matter if we get them the wrong way round it'll still work out
which is a hundred and forty four
plus the short one squared so
and the short one is x
if we subtract twelve squared form each side
thirteen squared minus twelve squared equals short squared
okay
mhm
so if you work out what thirteen squared minus twelve squared
so it's a hundred and sixty nine minus a hundred and forty four isn't it
mhm
twenty four
twenty
twenty five
right sounds okay
centimetres
that's what i that's what i got
yeah
equals short squared
so five is the short side
five is equal to the short side
mhm
so that will be five centimetres
right
okay
so if you get on an exam something like that and they're and they're saying to you a to b is sixty mile to london
mm
what's the bearing between london and glasgow
ah
like how does it
okay so we'll UNK
we'll finish up with right angles first
if you're looking at triangles you're first thing you're looking at is has it got a right angle
is there a right angle in it somewhere
if it hasn't well you probably you've got problems
mm
so that's your first one has it got a right angle
if it has yes we go do they give you an angle
right let's say they do
have they given you have they given you the length of two sides
yeah
mhm
two lengths given yeah
yeah
if so you can use pythagoras which is long squared equals medium squared plus short squared
to find third side
okay
yeah
if it isn't if you haven't got the two lengths given you've got you've got one length plus one angle
that one angle is apart from the right angle
right
yeah
apart from the
so if you've got one length and one angle then depending on which one you've got you're going to use sine cos or tan to find the side the length you want
mhm
that's if you've got an angle and a length
a length and an angle you'll use the trig
yeah but otherwise
you'll use pythagoras
right so if they give you two s two lengths to fine a third length the easiest way and the most accurate way is use pythagoras
mhm
if they give you one length and an angle then you'd use either sine or cos or tan to find the other one
right
sometimes on this one they might give you erm two lengths and they might ask you to find an angle
can we do one of them
right er they might sometimes so that's to find a side and this actually comes off here
right given two sides plus right angle
mhm
find an angle
again you'd use trig
yeah
right
opposite not opposite but opposite page
mhm
so let's say we've got a hill
and erm we know that we went along this hill and we went along fifteen kilometres
okay
yeah
and when we'd gone along fifteen kilometres we'd gone up by four point eight metres
mhm
right what we want to find is how steep is the hill we want to find that angle
x degrees
how would you go about that
erm
didn't get much of you last time speak very quietly
do you speak very quietly when you're playing out when it's your turn to be rush
do you say excuse me chaps could you just pass the ball over this way please
no i shout but if they
on me UNK
i just go
so the way you talk normally when you're outside when you're playing football that's not the same as you need to talk when you're writing is it
er a lot of people think oh i'll just write the way i talk
well if you do everybody tends to make a bit of a fuss about it
what's this you can't have that don't
say that and you say well i do say that
so don't write that
so there different ways of putting things and i e words can you think any words UNK got i and e together in them
and we can perhaps use some of those in sentences
erm
okay we'll give up for today
any you've come across recently and somebody asked you to spell them and you've thought oh i haven't got
cupboard
cupboard okay that's a good word
cupboard hasn't got i e in it has it but it's a good word
erm do you remember how to spell cupboard
well it's you don't spell it like cupboard you spell it like a cup board
cup
cup board cos it used to be just a just a shelf just a board with some UNK on it hang your cups on it
okay where's that it's in the cu the cups they're on the cup board hanging on the cup board
and after a while you say cupboard
like UNK
some people say oh must be fore head
it's UNK cos that's what people say and it used to be fore head and they change all the time that's why need to record the words and see how they're being pronounced
so that if everyone if people who wrote the UNK didn't know UNK still be going round thinking that everyone said fore head or break fast
things like that
okay now what have you done on punctuation
what do you think punctuation means
oh sorry
oh it's my fault leaving it there
erm
okay how about erm do you know how where to put commas and full stops and
sometimes
full stops then which
full stops
which is the easiest
after like monday and
okay
after monday and names and
right erm so when you read for reading
oh well we'll have a look at these i e words and we'll have a look at punctuation some time
how where to put full stops
remind me before the end of this lesson and we'll have a little look at how to get full stops right cos it's not too hard with those
i e mm right
what have we got here
could you could you write thief
thief
mm
t mm
go on
t h
t h right ooh that's nice writing that's nice that's very and now
e i
well lets have a look
e i pen isn't it
now ooh okay
erm now you're putting you're e i again aren't you
right so it's very awkward erm really you just think i can't remember is it i e i
you write it down and you think mm maybe that's right maybe it's the other way
so there's a fairly good rule that works nearly all the time
the first thing to do is it making an e sound this i e
e yeah
e yeah okay so we can use the rule which should now work pretty well all the time
so it's i before e except after c
so is it after a c does the i e come after a c
no so it's going to be i e
so try t h i e that's it and then the
what
what's the last letter
h innit
f
thief
oh f
yeah thief
okay that's it
now on your own have a go at chief
chief
alright chief
chief
chief
chief
like an indian chief or
c
that's it
okay very good
and brief
mm
oops missed the i
mm do it again that one with the with the whole lot in
just one line through when you cross out
brief
oh not again
so
do the b r and then stop and think do b r and then think now which am i gonna do i e
r scribble there
so do yeah
now
i f
that's it okay so if you can remember that rule the these words are ones that a lot of adults get wrong a lot of the time
they'll they and they you'll see them going mm not that not that one back to the first i don't know and then they get the dictionary out
yeah
and they have a look and then they say oh i'm sure it wasn't that way
so how about grief
grief
that's just the same with a g
exactly right very good yeah well done
so if that's brief grief is going to be the same cos it's the same
mhm
rule
how about erm field
erm
as in a football field
does it make an e sound
l
yeah so it's i it makes an e sound so we use it this i e or e i is it after a c
no so brilliant
so it's a good rule that
there are quite a lot of words that will work for
now let's try the other ones where it's after a c okay
let's try could you spell ceiling
it starts with a c i'll give you a clue on that
mm
and the next thing that happens is an e sound
that's brilliant
that they that's it exactly
have you ever spelt it before
no
see so it's just by learning the pattern it's like say if you were you were playing football every time somebody every time the ball came towards you had to learn all about the way the ball goes oh it's you know it's slowing down cos the grass is wet and it's UNK and things like that
if you had to learn every time you couldn't spot patterns you'd never you'd never be able to play football cos you'd be you'd always be a UNK wouldn't you
you'd always be thinking oh what's go what's going to happen to this
but as yo as you learn
hold on
UNK the garden eh
is that your dog or next UNK
the UNK
oh
so i think that was pretty good i think it was brilliant in fact ceiling you've never seen it before worked out how to spell it
so it's a good rule this
now how about receive
these are ones these are ones that a lot of adults get wrong receive
okay is that a is that a y that last one
yeah
er receive v
v
v what sound does a y make on the end of a word
right UNK
oh
or jolly happy makes a makes the e sound usually
so that's great you've got the hard bit UNK and then it's v that y should be a v e so just cross the tail off the y
receive erm there are there aren't a lot of other words that do have c in well there are but they're quite sort of awkward words like try UNK
UNK
just finish off receive so that's v e okay receive try UNK
UNK oh
that's it
that is brilliant
i've never heard of that word
ah if you're erm UNK someone you
calling
con UNK someone
oh UNK
you're giving them a load of old UNK and trying to trying to trying to persuade them that something's true you're UNK them
yeah erm you give you give you give me the money now and i'll give you the elephant later it's just round the corner
you know
oh it's a good car this yeah it's only done two thousand miles
one lady owner a UNK wife you know
okay erm now so does what are the rules about this i e thing
i before the e except c
except when it comes after c except after c
that's brilliant but that's only when it makes an e sound
now there are some i e words e and an i or an i and an e and it doesn't make an e sound
how about erm things like ooh foreign can you spell foreign
foreign
or neighbour do you ever watch neighbours
neighbour
no
nor me can't stand it
the first time i watched it i thought that's wrong
okay that's not right but what's right about it
it starts with n ends in s okay
n something
erm is this a d or a b
oh
okay so that's a b
yeah
erm you don't always get it wrong you've been doing quite well but occasionally you just if you're
mm
if you i think it happens when you're worrying about something else in the word and you're concentrating on something else thinking ooh what's he want here is it going to be an e i or an i e or what
you're concentration goes it's like er it's like someone's going to try and head it in to the net and he's trying to work out which corner it's going into and he's
yeah
so busy working it out he UNK the ball in the end
yeah
concentrating too much on the little details rather than the main thing so b and d quite important to get those
erm right mm do you know you know you know d and b don't you
you don't need to practise them at all you know which one's which
yeah
cos some people have trouble with them and they can't see a difference they can't see any difference
i know
but er i don't think you are at all UNK are you
no one ever mentioned that
i don't think so
okay other words with do you think you could look that one up
neighbour it's erm it's quite an awkward word it comes in occasionally you can look it up if you like
look it in a di have you got a dictionary
i don't think so erm
erm
probably
look in the do you get
yeah i've got
a t v times or radio times or the paper
we've got we've got a dictionary yeah
right if you haven't if you can't find the dictionary you could look in the paper see what time neighbours is on
mhm
and it'll say you'll see how to spell it
erm do you read the paper at all
what do you read
the what's on telly what's on the UNK
mhm
erm
anything else you read er football pages anything like that
yeah a bit about football
okay
erm when you read it you come across strange words you know words that maybe you know you've heard them but you wouldn't think of trying to write them
erm
well i read
well if you if you couldn't read it yeah you can get someone to help you but if you can't u usually see you know quite a lot of words
you know a lot more words than you know how to spell don't you
and this is the problem
erm as you get older once you get to my age you can spell most of the words you know
but at your age you know so many words you couldn't really be expected to spell all of them and you're thinking oh whatever i do i every word i write down is wrong
and it's not
something like ooh nine out of ten maybe more than that perhaps ninety five out of every hundred words that you write down are okay they're spelt correctly it's just the awkward ones
the only trouble is the teachers keep giving you all the awkward one don't they everybody
yeah
does because those are the ones you have to learn how to spell
now they don't come in right today we're going to spell can anyone spell is
ooh that's a hard one
right he goes now who's going to spell cat
right all these words you know how to spell them
but there's some awkward ones and they've got to concentrate on the awkward ones so that you get this impression i can't spell anything
we had twenty UNK yesterday and i only got five right
okay but they were f they were twenty awkward ones if they said right we'll have you pick any twenty words you know and see if you can spell them you'd get twenty out of twenty wouldn't you
okay
the maths now
the maths we'll have a we'll have a look at that erm tied UNK right can you spell eight
eight
eight number eight think about maths
it's one of these i e words but it doesn't make an e sound does it
good that's it good go on
oh
that is brilliant
excellent
now that is a very awkward word i mean it's nothing like that it should be a t e shouldn't it
that doesn't look a could you do weight
that's eight
yeah and UNK just the same but
just the same
go on
right now it is just the same is that what you've written though
what
what did you do
eight
there
that's eight yeah
yeah
and what have you got here
weight
what does it say
oh UNK
right UNK
quite UNK
so i think you get bored with some of this when it's easy you're looking at that and you think oh i can do this just put a w in front of tr
yeah and then mm and you forget
yeah
you're not concentrating so you need to concentrate a bit on making sure that you finish off like you know somebody's passed to you're right in front of the goal all you've got to do is tap it in and you think oh anyone could do this which foot should i no problem
and then by the time
cos you just lose concentration
yeah i haven't kicked the ball yet
mm you've got to keep on top of it and keep with it
mm
so how a so write that one out again s with the way it should be for weight
yeah that's it on the same line
weight
hang on that's eight
yeah ei oh
that's e i right
now you tried it there and you left the e out now you've left the i out
oh
okay third time lucky oh that was UNK just got it in
right weight and last one freight
freight
have you heard of a freight train
no
ah fr
okay you can do eight you can do weight so can you do
have a guess at freight
that's it
erm can you do height
height
height sounds as if it should be pronounced hate
height
it's the same as same as eight
is it
yeah
i hate my height
just do eight
there there's eight
eight
and then put an h in front of it and it's height
oh yeah
which is ridiculous cos if you put a h in front of it should say hate
i know
so it's absolute rubbish some of this
or
spelling isn't it
or UNK heat
h e i
hate
h e i g t
nothing like it absolutely nothing like it
so try and remember that i e one when it makes an e sound i before e except after c now that's going to help you with quite a few words
it won't handle all of them it won't mean you're g always going to get all your UNK right now
but
but it'll mean you can get a lot of them
most of the i es
yeah you'll be getting most of those right and you won't have to learn sit up all night saying oh he's given me another thirty five i e words to learn tonight
mhm
it'll work for a lot of them
erm i did say we'll just have a quick mention punctuation before we look at the maths
yeah
erm
what does punctuation mean
UNK punctuation do you want to try and do you want to just write it down
p u n
title
oh yes oops sorry you write it
p u n c
p u n c
UNK
p u n c
t UNK and then u letter u and then UNK a t i o n
and underline the title
for next time if you like you can think of some UNK words and write them down
words ending in UNK like station a railway station or see how many you can but punctuation
the real reason you put it in is to make it obvious what we mean
so people don't get mixed up about what exactly we mean and to help when you're reading it
so if you're reading something out
this is about maths so we'll have a look in that for punctuation
mm not many here not much so we'll questions
i mean most of these end in question mark
so the main thing about punctuation is first you know you know the main points
erm just going to start a sentence what would i do
capital letter
right okay and now i've finished a sentence how do i finish a sentence
that's it now that that's m that's about sort of seventy f seventy five percent of punctuation
capital letter for the first one full stop at the end that's the main point
if you follow that people can understand what you're writing
and they can have a good guess
and then sometimes you need to put commas in if they're are long lists
when else would you need capital letters
writing the date
right okay
days of the week
writing
writing the month yeah
writing names of people
writing names of people what about if you're writing names of countries would you
mm
yeah
okay so the important things capital letters and full stops you already know how to use them
okay so you're okay on that what about commas
no
don't know nothing about them
well if we had a long a long thing to read
i've got some here
er here we are
okay i'll move it round there
how about this one about cricket
could you read all that could you read that
go on read it out
cricket is a popular sport in yorkshire
sometimes members of the yorkshire team are chosen to play the england and they play against teams from australia
the west UNK and pakistan
what about the west UNK and pakistan
so the way you read it you said and they play against teams from australia and then you said and then you stopped there but you said the
mm
west UNK and pakistan
now this is where we use commas
so cricket is a popular sport and so on
the yorkshire team are UNK are chosen to play for england and they play against teams from australia comma the west UNK and there should really be a comma there and pakistan
there should really be a comma there but we've got a funny twist to the rule we don't put comma before the and don't put a comma before the and
like if there's a full stop you don't put and next to it
that's right
you know quite a few rules don't you about punctuation that's good
so a comma we use it in lists of things
erm next year i'm going to play for liverpool UNK rovers UNK and erm
sheffield wednesday
and sheffield wednesday and sheffield UNK and manchester united if they'll let me
if they'll let me
and if i'm and if i'm fit enough
okay
so i'm going to play for manchester comma
but
UNK comma when there's a list of things okay
it should be commas
you have commas but don't do a comma before the last so er if i said tonight i'm going to have sausage egg chips beans UNK and cake
right where would the commas go
i'm going to have sausage egg chips beans UNK and cake
comma next to sausage what else is there
eggs
eggs so comma but all of them just before the last one
okay so they're all so could you write this one down then tonight i'm having fish chips and peas
i am having
f erm well what would you like
sausage egg and chips
yeah
okay
oh sausages
ah
you should think before you say yes
how do you spell sausages oh dear
well it's a some it's a german word it's a funny word and it's s a u
s
s a u sausages
sausages
s a u s so that's UNK and then ages a g e s
sausages
sausages
what were we having sausages
comma
yeah sausages comma erm we can have what we like can't we
oops
beans
sausages
beans
sausages egg and beans
okay
egg no comma because it's
no comma there because there's the and coming you learn very quickly very good
and you can spell beans
do you know another way and what goes at the end what goes at the end of the sentence
full stop
now you told me how to start a sentence
a capital letter
but what you do a lot i think is you know how to do quite a few things but you're concentrating i mean here you're thinking ah all i'm doing now is where w get the commas in the right place
and while you're thinking about that you forget all about everything else
now you've got to keep on top of what you already know
keep
sort of keep on so that you're building on that all the time so you think right okay i know how to do capital at the start full stop at the end keep that don't let that go just cos i'm concentrating on something else
so what am i going to do right i starting a i'm starting off so let's gets the capital
now i can forget that
now i can now what am i doing i'm doing commas
okay now i've finished my commas i've finished the sentence now what do i do now right full stop
so you're sort of thinking at different levels
watch
doesn't matter
let it go
so
it goes on for a minute
ah that's alright
so capital t there but you have a look at what you've just done
tonight not an easy word to spell i mean you might think it is but a lot of people spell it UNK
you see it written down all over the place UNK
n i t e at the end of it
you do you see things like that so tonight okay i helped you with sausages but you got most of it
beans could you write erm i have been out
i have been out i have been out today
good capital full stop
and what's the difference between this been and that UNK
that's been like going out
right
and
that's the one you eat
okay well they're two completely different spelling different things and you got them UNK right i didn't i didn't help you i didn't even say and think about which sort of UNK you're using or anything like that did i
you know i think i think your spelling i think your spelling and your general english is pretty good
but i think the problem is that you only concentrate on little bits at a time
mm
and you forget what you already know or you don't bother with it you don't bother sort of concentrating on that thing oh let's get that bit right
erm you're just looking at a little bit that's new and you're forgetting about the old stuff
okay so you need to keep it all keep a general picture
make it a team if you like you know get all the all the other bits of stuff that you know all the other knowledge get that coming in all working together so the whole thing just flows up and down nicely instead of
mm
jumping about
okay i think that's very good really i don't think i think you're writing is very nice as well
what do you think
it's okay
it's i think it's pretty good
erm one problem i think is that you can you tend to look at letters i think sort of one or two letters together erm instead of trying to think of a whole word
because i when you do think about the word then you leave some of the letters out
so maybe think of them as UNK little bits say if we're going to say something like UNK rovers
say UNK mere ro UNK
mm
split it into each one so you'd write UNK i've got that mere ro UNK like that erm and then you're not going to miss bits out
cos you could easily miss bits out
okay i thank i think tell me e tell me what where you'd put UNK on this one about the cricket
on the p
right tell me where you'd start off with UNK
good so first one because it's the first in the sentence that's an
c
automatic one
cricket
on that c
right and what happens next
cricket is a popular sport in
yorkshire
right so capital y for that
full stop here
good yeah full stop
so starting a new sentence
oh
okay so good a capital letter on there yeah
times members of yorkshire
good
capital letter full stop
hold it
capital letter erm
sometimes members of the yorkshire team yeah you could have it you could have a capital on that
mm
but no full stops yet cos we haven't finished a sentence we haven't
oh
finished what we're saying about them
yeah
sometimes members of the yorkshire team
are chosen to play for england and they play against
okay
teams
capital e for england yeah
mm
and they play against
teams from australia the west UNK and pakistan
okay so what's what punctuation along here
mm comma
okay so let's go for the easy one first and get it out of the way
before we forget it at the end
full stop
okay
australia country capital a and as you say comma the west UNK capital w and i and
pakistan full stop
right and a full stop
i think you're pretty good at english and punctuation i think well you tell me what do you think you've got to concentrate on
mm
don't know
yes you do go on tell i what have i just been telling you then that you need to concentrate on that i think you should be concentrating on
well just don't think about one thing and forget about all the others
it's if you think about say you're playing football
mm
now you've got to be at different levels all the time
you're thinking about if the ball is coming to you you're watching the ball
it's going to finish up about ten yards in front of me
okay i'm running a bit faster i'm going to be there
right well forget about thinking about that for a moment i'll look round where everyone else
he's over there he's running up through there
mm
he's on the left wing
ah
two defenders coming up they're probably going to get to me so i'm going to pass it as soon as i get it
what's going on all around you so then you concentrate on the ball again
so you're concentrating on the little bits you're doing and then you're
mm
moving back a bit to get the bigger picture what's going on
yeah
with everything else and then you UNK in again and concentrate on
so you need to do this in lot's of jobs in maths in english in any work that you do
sometimes you see someone painting a door or something and get that little bit done there and then they step back to make sure they haven't missed something cos they could be it could be so obvious to anyone who's just standing what's he doing there he's left a big piece in the corner there that
yeah
he hasn't painted
mm
he's going ooh look there's a little tiny thin bit there i haven't done oh
no
yes that's fine
he's only looking at that bit
that and then you leave
that's it so you can do these same with your words
you're concentrating to getting the i e or the e i and you leave half of it off or something
so concentrate and then sort of pull back a bit from it and check the main bits and a good way is going through the sounds of each UNK
so if someone said erm UNK go UNK o UNK i a
mm
like that and you'll that sounds right i mean you think i don't know how to spell it
mhm just do that
but you could do like that
UNK o so UNK i a
UNK o UNK i a
and people would know what you meant even if you didn't spell it right
thank you
erm no i'm fine thanks
now i would like you to tell me about numbers
numbers
mhm
what are they
numbers erm
what do we use them for
maths
well it's a bit like that's a bit like saying what do you use words for
english
oh right
don't use words just for UNK i mean you use words mainly for talking
mm
don't we
would you like a drink please
no thank you
erm do you want to come out and play
no i'd rather do my english
i don't like football any more i'd rather do maths
things like that it's for letting that's what words are for well numbers are for telling other people how much you how much do you would you like a cup of coffee
no i'll just have half a cup please
yeah
okay
erm what time are you coming out to play football
oh
ooh
about half past three
or ten p m
or in about two hours time
mm
so all these numbers come into your life all the time it's not just for maths you need
go to the shop and you're wondering if you've got the right change
exactly or have go enough money
mm
how much are those lion bars
oh they're thirty four p each
what rip off
can i get can i get can i get three of them
and will i get three out of a pound
is a pound enough to get lion bars
don't know you'd have to work it out okay
so that's why erm the numbers are important it's not for maths
now this is open here is this were there particular things you wanted to do
time
d time
well i know me time we done that not so long ago
okay
and you're happy with erm twenty four hour clock
no
no well it's dead easy there's a little trick on the twenty four hour clock
twelve thirteen is one
okay
fourteen is two fifteen is three
right okay so you so i asked are you happy with the twenty four hour clock you say no and then you know it
erm
i've seen the paper
an awful lot of adults have awful they have an awful lot of adults
like the twenty and all the
okay twenty what time is twenty thirty
erm
mm
give me a minute
don no don't do it in your head just write it down there
oh yeah
just write twenty thirty
okay and we have to put something in between there
put a yeah
right
yeah now take twelve away from the twenty right twelve underneath it and take it away
no one says you can't write it down don't have to do it in all in your head do you
no twelve er an twelve well twelve away from twenty
mhm
twelve is ten and two isn't it
if you took the ten away from the twenty how many would you have left
ten
ten if you took
eight
that's it you were there before me right
so take the ten away and the you have ten left over and then take the two away from that so eight
so what time is twenty thirty put the just put the eight under the twelve there
eight o'clock
we've still got thirty still got thirty cos we haven't taken any so perhaps put twelve nought under that and take it away
half eight
half eight at night
erm on twenty four hour clock then what time would seven o'clock be
how would you work that out
twe on the twenty four hour clock what time would seven o'clock be
mhm
oh i won't bother writing this
so
one down
why not
okay what are you going to do then
tell me what you're going to do
fifteen is three sixteen is four
mm
seventeen is five eighteen is six nineteen is seven
okay nineteen
so nineteen
seven o'clock could be ni nineteen hundred hours
oh well i think you're alright on those
erm what about i'm just trying to find something that you're not good at
divided
UNK division
okay
share between and all
mm
that's the that's the most awkward thing to do the one that most people have most problem with
let's have a quick look at where the numbers came from
okay
the first numbers we got were just counting numbers
everyone's happy with those with that you can do three add five
yeah if i said do three add five would you actually do that would you do three add five or would you do five add three
five add three
good so what would that come to
five three eight
okay now so let's say if we had some numbers you can you could make your own notes about this
if we're doing add we're just starting off with the counting numbers
so we can say start with counting numbers
right start with cou counting numbers
counting numbers those are the numbers you use for counting things with like three or six or most people call them the normal numbers
now we're going to see what happens
counting erm cou
ah counting c o u n t count counting numbers
count start with counting what
numbers
doing something else when i'm doing my own work
okay in the easter
holidays
okay now
we have like twenty five a test and then these must be another test for another group
okay what do you think of these words
erm some are
could you
quite easy
okay so some are quite easy some of them you're not going to have much problem with at all
you
mhm
already know them or you could have a good guess at them
erm it may be some will be not so easy need a bit more work and some of UNK be sort of in the middle
yeah
in between
so which are they easy ones
the easy ones are erm use puppy key desk kept use used
yeah
okay so you could do all of those
you don't even have to bother learning them
erm what about things like UNK and UNK
i erm
bit of an odd word isn't it
mm
you don't have you seen an UNK
no
no you don't you see
them in films about africa or something or
i
you don't
i've never heard of one
it's like a big cow
oh
an UNK is just like a cow
oh
just a another name for a cow really
oh
so once you know what it means it helps a little bit and can you think of a word that ends the same as that
erm no
what would you keep things in
box
okay
can you spell box
mhm
you can spell box you can spell UNK
yeah
no problem it's just g it's a bit funny if there's more than one of them if you get two or three you don't say two UNK if you had two or three boxes fine but with UNK it's one of these silly words you just have to remember it's UNK
i don't i mean you're not going to write about UNK very often are you
no
no so just try and try and learn them
one of those
well like a cow
oh
UNK is a cow UNK two cows two
oh
UNK if you like only you say UNK
mm
okay
so just learn that to and er keep them happy
right
you won't use it very often
some of these words you're much more likely to use aren't you
yeah sale
can you spell sale
is there another way you can spell sale
like sail on a boat or
right and how do you spell that
erm
well have a go at the first letter
s
right okay
and then it's not spelt the same way as this when it's on a boat
mm
is it
do you know how to spell tail
how do you spell that
t a e l
see there's t a l e
oh
like telling a tale
mm
and what would a UNK tail how would that be spelt
t a e l t a e l
t a i l
oh i l
erm do you know how to spell UNK
mm s n a e l
right okay it's not actually e l it's i l
i l
but
the same as
you're getting in a lot of them you're tending to think that a lot of them end in
mm
a e l
now that UNK sound that a sound it's usually either it'll be a l e or it'll be a i l
so you've only got a choice of two there
it's not UNK a bit messy isn't it
it's
mm
there doesn't seem to be any sense to it really but you can try and make a bit of sense out of some of it not all of it but some of it you can make a bit of sense out of it yes
whoops
let's see how many words you can think of that have an UNK sound in them
a UNK like sail
sail okay so we've got sail that's on a boat and this sale like your UNK going to go to the sales and see if
mhm
they've got any good UNK
mm
yeah erm any others
what was the one that we had that the dog would have
mm tail
tail
it's a bit ridiculous really having the two ways of spelling
mm
that's a tale for someone who tells UNK
seal
seal that doesn't make an a sound that's making an
oh no
e sound isn't it
yeah it's an e
so that's a different sound but that's a good one
we had UNK earlier how did you spell that
s n a
i l
i l yes
okay
i thought it was
i don't think there are any that are a that are a e l
we've got the e a l ones like seal which you said
mm
UNK plea
erm so that's UNK now what o what else could we have what letters could we start with
erm fail
mm
okay have a guess at that i'm going to put under this column so have guess
how to spell it
yeah
a f a
right f a
e or i l
i that's it i l fail
okay erm do you know a nursery UNK about jack and jill
no
no went up the hill
where jack and jill fell off the hill to
to fetch a
UNK of water
how do you spell UNK
p a i l
that's it p a i l when it means a bucket
mm
they went to get a bucket of water or if i said ooh you're not looking
too pale
you're looking yeah how would you spell that
i'm going to put it under
p
this column
a
yeah
l e
that's it brilliant
so you're spotting that pattern
so there is some pattern in this spelling it's awkward it's not as trouble is english is mixed up with bits of all sort of other languages over hundreds of thousands of years
and they've all taken words from different languages and they all spell them different ways
but some of them have got patterns to them and you work them out
pale erm what else can you think of
how about what's the american word for post they don't say oh we'll put it in the post they say we'll put it in the
mail
in the mail
and that's m a i l
are you male or female
male
male how do you spell that one
goes in this
oh
column
m a l e
that's it m a l e so it's perhaps not a bad idea that we spell it differently cos you can tell which one you're talking about then
whether you're talking about the mail the royal mail the post or whether you're
mm
talking about somebody being a man or a boy or something okay
any other that have got UNK in them
how about ale
hello
UNK sorry about that just feeding
oh that's alright
the baby
yeah i'm
did you get your books out to show you what he's been using
y yes we're just we're just having a look at the UNK at the moment trying to make some sense of them
oh right
oh is that your homework for the holidays right
but we're not all the homework we're just trying to find some pattern in the spelling
okay then
and see how we get on that
i'm sorry i was late getting but i got held up by another lesson
oh right
very UNK at the moment it's should've normally been dropping off quite a lot this time but
oh right
everybody wants extra lessons for some reason
oh right i was just thinking of sort of trying to you know cos he's in his second year now for the
mhm
next two years trying to sort of get him to bring himself up a bit you know
mm
possibly for going into another school
they automatically go into s f x but apparently there's two different UNK there
yeah
and i mean i'd love the UNK but i mean you've got to be pretty clever for that
but you never you never know
well he'll have to work very he'll have to do a lot of work
mm
erm if you want to get into the UNK
mm
erm it's up to you how much whether
but there's a few good schools isn't there
you can get interested in it
mm
mm there are there are quite a few good schools actually around
right
erm
saint UNK is good or was wasn't it
well i'm a bit biased cos i went there so
oh did you
but it is t it is erm very good they've got a very long waiting list i was helping
helping someone with an entrance exam for there and it's very stiff competition
is it yeah
their exam is more or less g c s e for eleven year olds you know
really
they have to be very good just to get in yeah
so oh well we'll have to wait and see
do you recognize any of those books are they the sort of normal
yes there all sort of fairly standard that they're using
mm
but it's erm not so much what's in the books as sort of how simon looks at them
and because if you're just looking at every word separately everything lo you've got to learn so many things haven't you if you can pot the patterns and then you can start having a guess at what it might be and getting it right most of the time and then you gradually learn them as you go along
you can't you can't be expected to learn everything all at once can you
mm
you've got to people tend to forget that erm things you find easy before you knew how to do them you found them quite hard
yeah of course
and you were probably quite confused and didn't
mm
know what was going on until you got it sorted out
right
and got yourself a system and started building on it
this is it yeah
until it just seems as if it's an impossible task
yeah
there's just too much to learn
so you've
mm
got to break it down into little steps and do a bit at a time
yeah
and get a gradual improvement
and another i noticed erm UNK been bringing a few of his friends home from school and erm i mean he's in a class of thirty eight
right
i mean which is the norm now more or less isn't it but he's i think the third youngest in his class too most of his friends that he brings home are all nine already
right
he's actually not nine till august so he's one of the young ones in the class
mhm
i mean that can have that can sort of
yeah so
you know contribute isn't it yeah
yeah it's more difficult to keep up with others if they if they're older and they've been learning this stuff for a lot longer
yeah
but erm i think he he'll do it alright he'll be able to sort this out
shall i make you a drink would you like a tea or coffee
erm er black coffee please
black coffee
no milk no sugar
that'd be wonderful
right
do you want some er juice simon
er n no thank you
no juice do you know how to spell juice
mm j double o
sounds as if it should be double o it's j u i c e
oh
actually
one way you can is that a juice bottle over there
well yeah but i mean i've like you know ones and two and that into it
mhm
and i add them to me UNK collection of ones and twos
okay but you can learn quite a bit you could check any of the food or the drinks that you've got in the house you could at those to see how you spell them can't you
so you could look on the juice bottle and juice there you think oh that's how you spell it
do watch out cos sometimes they put silly UNK on which doesn't help
okay what else can you think of any more on that erm
erm no
well we could do female couldn't we
yeah
have a go at that
female
oh that's just the same with on
f e and it's just the same
yeah
m that's it just f e on the front male
so that's female quite a quite a good word to be able to spell isn't it
especially at your age
mm
erm how about erm when it's great big little lumps of ice falling down what do you call that ends in UNK
erm
have you heard of UNK stones
oh yeah erm when it hurts your legs
when it's UNK
right UNK how do you spell UNK
h a
right
i l
that's it UNK
okay so there's quite a few of these that you're getting to know
mm
mm
that's UNK
that's lovely okay
now any others that you can think of
UNK yeah we've done that one
UNK good we've got that
thanks very much
there you go son
er where do you go if you go to court and they find you guilty and they lock you up
oh jail
how do you spell that
erm j
okay
a i l
that's it
so quite a lot of these you know don't you
erm what do trains run on
railway lines
railway lines okay how do you spell rail
i'll leave you two with them if you need me
right okay
i'm just in the next room
right
r a i l
that's it
r a i l
so there's quite a few of these that you know as long as you can forget about this thing of wanting to put a e l
mm
i mean it sounds like maybe it should be that way but we don't spell it like we have the i a l or a l e
male and sale and sail
i think that's enough of those
now how many have we got there
quite a lot
do you think you could learn all of those
probably
probably no i think definitely
i think let's say you could learn which ones couldn't you learn then do you think
mm
i think you could learn all of those couldn't you it's just that there's quite a lot of words to learn so they give you some funny ones like UNK because it's got a funny plural and there's two or three of them you say UNK you don't say UNK
so apart from that you don't need to know about UNK do you
you're not going to be walking down that road and say look there's an UNK or
no
no
but some of these they're a bit more important
er now here's another a sound
playing stayed
erm how do you spell play
play
mm
p l a y
okay how about say
s a y
and stay
s t a y
well i think your UNK pretty good actually isn't it
what's this what have we got here oh a cat okay
erm and what about what do you do in church
sit and talk
do you
poems and
that ends in UNK
pray
pray how do you spell pray
p r a y
okay and how about day
oh d a y
right so you know a lot of these so there's another way of making an a sound isn't it there's this a i sail and mail and UNK and things like that
and this a l e like female
how would you spell erm another word for beer that ends in a e has an a sound in it
very short word
erm
can you spell ale
mm
how do you spell that
a i l
i'll put it in this side
a
see it's going in this column
i l
going in this column
mm
with sale s a l e so have a guess
a i l
try a l e okay
oh
okay you won't need to know that for a long time yet anyway will you
okay erm so going back to these we've got day s say stay play pray
erm any others
what about erm thing that they make pots out of
for modelling ends in UNK
erm
starts with c
c erm clay
clay do you know how to spell that
k l oh c l
good c l
a y
okay great
and how about that cat is that your cat
yeah
yeah it's not a stray cat is it
how do you spell stray
s t a
UNK
oh r
s t r
a y
that's it stray
now how about if the cat if your cat had UNK how would you spell that
s t r a d e
that'd be a good way of spelling it that would be a sensible way s t r a d e but they don't spell it that way unfortunately
all they do is they just have stray and then they put ed e d on the end
mm
UNK
erm do you know how to spell played
it's on there
i know right okay do you know how to spell played
it's got e d on the end of play
that's it
p l a y and put e d on the end
erm how about stayed if so if your friend stayed overnight
put e d on the end of stay
so that's
s t a y e d
okay stayed
and how about if they UNK
put e d on the end of pray
okay so what's that's going to be
p r
right
a y e d
right okay
couldn't really say someone had UNK
how about if someone said something
oh UNK
UNK it should be UNK really but we don't say UNK
what do we say
said
said
erm s a
right
y
it's s a i
oh
d which is ridiculous really i mean if you pronounce it said it should be something like s e d
mhm
shouldn't it
yeah
or if you're going to do it the same as we've done these it should be s a y e d so said is a funny one
one that you'll just have to learn
right
okay
so
but the others easy you worked out the pattern just put e d on the end
mm
so for most of them UNK stayed played you can just put e d
this one say said you just have to learn that one cos it's a bit awkward
that's a lot of words
will you have any trouble with any of those learning any of those
yeah erm
what about these what was the hardest w thing about clay
oh it sounds as if it's got like a k on it
it sounds as if it should have a k usually most words if you're not sure and they start with a c sound put a c
it's normally a c yeah
there aren't many that start with a k
there are some can you think of one
that your mum would use for heating the water up
coffee
to make heating the water up to make a coffee what would she boil that water in
kettle
a kettle okay
that's a c
that's a and that's one with a k
kettle
is it
kettle is
is
a k
is it
oh
yeah
erm if they've got a letter e in the s for the s for the next letter then usually they'll have a k
key
key yeah that's a good one key
right
there's a name keith
keith and one that was in here
yeah
erm are you going to keep that
yes i
am
kept it i kept it
so they've got a k in
mm
keep and kept
erm but
in school when i'm copying off the board words with like k in the front but like they start with a c but i usually put a k and then the teachers go over them and say like this is a c sort of you know UNK and all that
i just keep on forgetting that
yeah it's not really UNK is it it's a question of do you know it or don't i mean
mhm
you're not going to put the wrong one down if you know the right one are you
no
so it's learning the right one
and then finding UNK what they've said on there is try to make some sentences that use it so that you can remember what it looks like
erm perhaps you can think of daft things like think of someone kicking the kettle
do you know how to spell kick
kick er k i c k
right kick
and think of someone kicking the kettle
if you a football easier with that kick
right
and if you think of that and of the kettle that'll rem that'll remind you that it's a k for kettle same as a k for kick
erm this is a daft one
what what's that on the carpet there
cat kicking the cat
and how do you spell that
erm c a t
right now if the cat has UNK how do you spell that
c i double t e n s
very good the only the only there's only one letter wrong in that have a guess which one it was
double t erm
it was the it's a k
oh
and it's ridiculous c for cat so you'd think it's going to be c for UNK wouldn't you
no it's k for UNK
now how can you think of remembering that one
maybe the UNK might sit in the kettle or something
mm kid
but the cat wouldn't
whichever wa it doesn't matter if it's really daft if you can think of some way yourself to remember it to remember that UNK has got a k and cat has got a starts with a c
most of them most of them start with a c
if you're not sure if you can't remember try c because it's more likely to be right so you're going to get more marks oh he's got this right and they won't be putting UNK on it they'll say oh he knows what he's doing here
mm
erm so if you just remember try and remember the ones that have got a k
it's no good trying to remember every word that starts with a c cos there are lots of them
just remember the ones that start with a k
and if it's not one of the ones you've remembered you think well it's probably a c
mm
try it with a c it's an easier way of doing it isn't it
mm
erm you like football
yeah
er how would you spell keeper
keeper c e
how do you spell keep and how do you spell kept
kept is k e p t that's on there
good that's on there and keep
k double e p
k double e p is keep so have a go at keeper
k double e p erm e r
that's it
they write e a r at the end don't they some words
some of them but not very many
they usually make a sort of ear sound if they've got i mean
yeah
if you have e a r e a r that's ear so how would you spell hear
h
as say in i
h at the front of ear
that's it i hear with my ear
hear when you hear with your ear it's spelt like that
and when it's what's the what's this over here
that way how do you spell i say is it over here and you say no it's over there
how would you spell there
there t h e r e
right so here and there
you just put a t at the front
just a t at the front they're almost the same
so that's
mhm
one way of remembering those two
how it's here and there and the other the other sort of hear you hear with your ear and it's got an ear inside it
so if you can think of things like this top remember it helps
if you're just trying to remember them all and you've got all these words and letters floating round in your head it's quite awkward isn't it trying to sort them out which is which cos there are you know millions of words
mhm
and you'll just think oh i'll give up
so you've got to get a system where you can something that'll help you so you can make sense of it and learn
you're not going to learn all the words in the dictionary overnight are you
no
no you can all you can do is just learn a few each day or learn some patterns so that you can get quite a few words in one go and sort of learn some tricks like guessing well we'll try with a c
if it starts with a c sound we'll try a c if it's not one of those that i've remembered starting with a k then it's probably a c
erm how do you spell coat
k o a
are you sure it's a
oh c
c so go for a c first unless you're sure
yeah if you're not sure you should go for the c then yeah
because most of them start with a c
so how do you spell coat
c o a t
that's it c o a t bit like cat with a with an o in it coat
and can you think of any others that start with k
there aren't many
kit like a football kit
kit that's a good one
kit and UNK so that's maybe one way of remembering UNK
mm
right that you know how to spell you know how to spell kit like a football kit or your UNK kit
so UNK just put ten on the end of kit
mm
okay that was a good one kit
erm i can't i don't think there are many more
so each time you come across one have you got a UNK to write things in
upstairs
yeah if keep it sort o erm UNK okay so you've got the as then the bs the cs depending on which letter the word starts with
and in your UNK whenever you come across a word that starts with a k make sure you put it in your book and have a look at those occasionally so that you're pretty sure you know all these k words and then if it isn't you say well okay got to be a c
mm
erm what other words can you think of that start with a c sound
oh cup
cup okay and so have a guess at that one
do you know how to spell it or do you need to guess
c u p
mhm and what sort of a c is it
oh
c or a k
k is it
what did we decide
oh c
right always have a always g if you're not sure go for the c first so there's cup okay
erm and what would you wear on your head for going to school sounds a bit like cup
cap
how would you spell that
erm c
good
a p
good was that a guess
didn't know whether to use
yeah so you went for the c and you got it right it's a good one
yeah
to go for go for the c each time cos there aren't many that start with a k
and if you can just when you come across the odd ones that do start with k just learn those and then instead of learning about a hundred thousand or something
that start with a c you learn maybe about ten or twenty that start with a k and you say well if it's not one of these i don't know i'm gonna s try it with a c
and nearly all the time you'll get it right
occasionally you'll come across some new odd ones and the UNK say oh actually this is a k should be a k and you think right
mm
i'll put that in my little UNK
and so that you keep on top of it so you know that you've got all the ones that start with k
okay
erm any other c sounds
computer
good
that's a c one
that's a c you know that one okay how do you spell it
oh erm c o m
com yeah
p u t e r
brilliant
that's quite a long one computer
mm
okay
curtains
curtains that's a hard one let's have a go
erm
right what are you gonna do you know whether it's a k or a c
no c
so what you gonna guess
guess the c good guess c
i
it's c
mm
u r
t
t
o
and then it's a i n s which is ridiculous curtains
oh curtain
curtain
curtains
you don't say curtain
i know
you say curtain but it's spelt curtain which is ridiculous really
curtain
do you know how to spell mountain
m o u t
UNK
oh n
yeah
t a i n
brilliant
yeah
yes
so curtains and mountains should really be saying curtains and mountains
mountains
mountains i'm going to the mountains
oh take the curtains with you when you go
okay so sometimes it helps if when you see a word you pronounce it to yourself
don't pronounce it the way they normally do but just say oh mountain they went to the mountain
or write or write it on the table and the table
or write it
and scrub it off again with you've finished school
write it on write it on a bit of paper
write it in your UNK well keep a piece of paper with you
write it on the table
and then you can that was very good mountain that's a good one to know how to spell curtains the same
erm
more k
or c more c more likely to be a c
mm
erm at school they usually have one teacher for each
class
how do you spell that
c
good go on
c a l
cl
class
c
l
good
a double s
good class
how do you think you'd spell classic
i c on the end
that's it
and how do you think you'd spell classical like do you like classical music
don't worry about it cos these are getting quite awkward words
a l on the end
c l a s classic and then a l on the end yes brilliant
class classic UNK
always adding two words
just making it
two
that's it making it a bit
letters
longer each time and making another word out of it
like
yeah just like
so if you learn the words this way thinking well do i know a word that's a bit like it and could i add a bit onto the end that's another way another good way of learning cos you don't have to learn class and classical and classic you just sort of learn one of them
you can you can work it out
let's have a look at the ones that they've given you
which ones are you going to have trouble with
well there's kept we've go keep and we'll put kept on there as well as
mm
as one of these k words
put that in me little note pad and all
yes have we got any other k on there
no
any words that start
key
with c
key good so we'll put that right up at the top
the key to learning it all key
how do you think you'd spell UNK
put a key in the UNK
so k e y key and h o l e
that's it
okay so another k word key well you wo could have guessed that if key has got a k then UNK pretty certainly have a
mm
k won't it
what have we got here
oh would and could you're going to use those quite a bit in writing
mm
aren't you
would could and should they're going to come in quite a bit
cross you might like yesterday i crossed the road to go
right so cross
to the field
yes cross is a UNK be a good one to learn there
erm let's see which one of these you think you you're pretty sure about
erm
okay i'll just ask you and you see which ones you do
how about pound
pound
yeah
pound p o u n d
good
kept you know that
mm
use
use u s e
yeah
sound
s o u n d
bound
same only a b in front
yeah same only a b in the front
so you know quite a few of these
you know kept you know key do you know desk
desk
desk
d e
go on
s c
now this when it comes at the end of a word
oh yeah
and makes a c sound then it's usually a k
oh
so if it starts the word and you're not sure go for a c
c and the end
but if it's end it's nearly always nearly always a c and a k
how do you spell back
back
he was a full back
how would you spell back
mm
oh UNK
UNK
position in a
yeah half back
b a c k or
that that's it b a c k and that's the first one to guess really c k that's the most likely one
erm desk is a bit of a funny one because it's just got the k
if it's got another UNK do you know what a UNK is
no
ah do you know what a vowel is
a vowel no i've heard it a few times
no yeah
but
a e i o u and sometimes people count y but a e i o and u
it's hard to make a word without them
you can say pat pit pot put if you put a vowel in
mm
well the other letters that are not UNK all the rest of them are called UNK
erm and if you've got see if you've got a vowel and then a c sound so if we said let's have a look at some UNK and then a c sound
so we've done back
which is b a c k
draw a line of UNK and see if i mate a make a word or something
right that's what we'll do okay
erm what else could you put in front of UNK
there's another vowel a
UNK
to make a word
act
erm put something in front of that so this ends it
you had back
erm
if you were going on holiday before you went you'd probably have to
very good
you'd have to put things in your UNK
yeah
you'd have to what would you say i'll have to i'll have to something my UNK
mm
lock erm shut
pack
pack it yeah
but lock was a good one
okay pack we'll put lock down then
down here
lock ends in c
mm
c sound and it's got a vowel it's got this a i o or u right in front of it so we go best guess is c k
it's one nearly always right is that
so lock erm how would you spell UNK
UNK er UNK
how would you smell UNK then
s h o s h o
good
k
don't forget if it's at the end it's the end of the word the best guess is usually
a k oh a c k
c k right
c k
right so what you said i said how do you spell UNK s o c k but what you said was s h o c k
what does that spell
shock right
so that's another word you've got there lock UNK shock
shock
oh that gave me a shock erm
the ghost
and how would you sp show would you spell
under the table
how would you spell mock
mm
it's the UNK
for halloween
how would you spell mock
mock
have a guess what's it going to start with
m
m okay
o
o
c k
that's it
yeah
c k is a almost certainty for the ending it if it's at the end of the word and it makes a c sound go for c k if it's got a vowel just in front of it
erm mock okay
have a go at UNK
erm o f r o c k
brilliant
it's easy this isn't it
yeah
once you've got a UNK once you've got a method you can you can get it right nearly every time
if you haven't if you're just trying to remember every word there is in the dictionary you'd be there all your life and you'd still never remember them all
mm
because you'd you couldn't hold that much in your head so you have to try and break them down into little patterns of oh it's one of that lot or it's one of this lot
probably working them out and all
ah okay well we'll car we'll do a little bit more we'll find out some more of these words ending in k and when we've finished off those erm we'll have a little look at some maths
okay
okay
so how would you spell sack
s a c k
that's it
if it's at the end it's almost certainly going to end in c k
erm how about track
t r a c k
that's it
so just with that trick there are a lot of words now that you'll be getting right yeah
i'm going to school dead UNK and everyone's going
good
track erm how would you spell UNK
UNK l i c k
good did you know that or were you just guessing
in a way i knew it in a way i had to
yeah c k c k is definitely a
mm
favourite that's the one to go for
so if i'm not sure i should always go for c k
if it's at the end
if you're not sure at the end of the word go for c k
and even you'll probably get one or two of them wrong occasionally but most of UNK be right and when you get one or two of them wrong the UNK say oh not c k like desk for example not c k on the end of desk because it's got this letter s in it as well
erm you've got lock and we could put lack in here
lack
as well
how would you spell that
l a c k
that's it you've got track erm how would you spell luck someone had a lot of good luck
luck
luck
l u c k
that's it
did you know
how would you spell lucky
lucky l u c k
lucky
e y
just y
oh
just put a y on it lucky
okay
mm
and i think you're getting th the idea of this putting c k on the end of a word haven't you
mm
mm
erm how would you spell truck
truck
t r u c k
that's it
erm if i get something wrong and the teacher's going
have the teachers telling you a way of learning something like i've been saying put c k if it's on the end of the word
mm
erm why do you think well why do you think i was telling you that
so i could get more used to them so
yeah do you think i was doing to make it harder for you
no
right well what was i doing it for
making it easier for me
so you could see the pattern yourself and make it easier and a lot of the time at school when the teacher's telling you why don't you do it this way they're not trying to make it harder for you
you might think ooh it's hard that way
they know from cos they've had years of experience
mm
teaching people how to learn that most people will find it easier if they
we've got
learn it that way
we've got the oldest teacher in school
oh
fifty erm birthday
is it a he or a she
she
all she's
mm
apart from the headmaster
do you get on all right with the teachers
sometimes i get a bit told off
what do you get what do you get told off for
really stupid things erm
why do you do stupid things
don't know well sometimes i playing like and this girl oh that's stupid doing all this and you know and she just like
mm okay
do you play sometimes cos you can't be bothered doing the work cos you can't see any sense in it
no i always sit down and do me work but sometimes people just UNK me all the time
mm
dead UNK easily
okay so if you can learn to concentrate on looking for the patterns and looking for oh well what sort of word is this is it going to end in a k end in c sound so it'll be c k
does is start with a c sound
so what would be what would you try first if it started with a c sound
c probably a c
right good
and if it ended with a c sound what would you want
probably c k
that's it
or k
c k most of the time there aren't many that end in just a k
desk is one of them erm have you got any disks on your computer
yeah i've got a UNK so i've got
okay and how do you spell disk
disk d i s k
that's it like a desk that's really that was the american way of spelling it but we spell it that way now
that's another problem with spelling is the americans spell things a bit differently
in america in american world you're doing all this and they'll be going oh no you don't
that's not right
yeah they're UNK are a little bit easier than ours cos they change some of them some of the awkward ones
so theirs is like the way i think
yeah
oh
and other people other people think spelling should be changed but it's not going to be and they're still going to mark it one the exam if you don't get it right
so we'll have a look have a look at your
i'll get
er let's have a look
right and you're joining up you writing nicely there
mm
reading book pattern book
what's your writing like
not too bad
okay
me double isn't all that good
no the only way to get your writing better is to practise it
look at this she's given you lots of c k to do together because
mm
very often
you've got to do c k at the of the word
at the end of the world it's going to be c k at the end
so she's given you those to practise not just a c and then a k but show both as one making sort of one sound like in back and lock
and me
and flock
me best word when
so you're good at hey that's good because some people can't go their f goes all over the place
yeah that's good keep it up
i would think your UNK are probably pretty good if you can do a good letter f
yeah
yeah good that looks good that's very good
okay which are the hardest letter for you to do
hardest that would be
in the joined up writing
erm oh erm like is all the i s
ah
look like es
ah
okay
you know when you do the i s like that
right so when you do when you do the letter i try to keep it we'll do a letter i here
try to come down nice and straight my k isn't very good i bet you could do a better one than that
mm
okay like erm
k is
but if you're doing the letter e it goes up there and comes down okay
and the other thing about the i s is if you make sure you put a dot on them on the top then if it looks a bit like if you people can't tell that you've done an e or an i if you'd a dot on top it's got to be an i
mm
okay so that's a thing that would help
okay some maths hey
okay
let's have a quick look in your folder see what you've got
tricky ones
do you know your tables
which ones
which ones do you know
oh that's just a how to make your circle
tables
mhm
mhm ones
ones what's the easiest tables
the easiest probably tens
tens erm although are the ones very hard
no
even easier than the tens yeah
yeah
and what about your nought times table
they're other UNK
more UNK okay
okay
so you might know some of these
yeah
er how about inside and outside
inside and outside
inside is i n i n s i d e
okay and outside
o u t s i d e
yeah so if you can
yeah i
spell side you can spell inside and you can
mm
spell outside as well
good well done
how i remember outside is like the end of a erm o u t spells out
right
and that's how i remember it o u t spells
right good
any way that means something to you that's a good way
if anyone says to you oh you don't want to remember it that way
as long as it works for you
mm
that's fine
it something that you use
mm looking a little bit a little bit like a
e isn't it
an e but if you put a dot on it
mm they'll know
you won't have people calling you UNK then
oh hello UNK
UNK
UNK if it's an i put a dot on it
okay erm can you spell with
with
yeah
oh erm t i mean t w h i t h
it's just w i t h
oh
so it's not as hard as you thought w i t h with
how about without
oh w i t h o u t spells out
t spells out okay so there's some connection between a lot of the words isn't there and if you can spell one you can have a very good guess at another one that's got that word in as part of it
erm can you spell walk
w i mean
yeah
l
w
is it
yeah
erm w a c k
w a l
oh yeah w a l k
walk
walk
can you spell talk
t a l k
that's it
talk so can you spell walking and talking
walking and talking
w a l k i n g
that's it
and talking is talk with i n g on the end
well it'll just be the same that's it
okay so you could spell walked and talked
mm
erm what about talked
talked t a l k
yeah
e d
that's it
and walked would just be the same
now how
mm
about asked
a s k e d
that's it now that how do you spell ask
ask a s k
yeah a s k so that's a one a bit like desk
it doesn't it's not like back where you've got c k at the end because there's the s in front of it as well it's ask
if it says so a UNK sound usually just s k desk ask disk UNK
okay
okay it'll be that so you can eventually you can build up a few tricks that'll help you sort out a lot of the spelling
and i'm pretty sure you'll be getting a lot of UNK right soon
i don't suppose you could spell football could you
yeah f double o t b a double l
and match
match football match m a t c h
very good
excellent
can you spell you can spell play cos we've done that can you spell ground
g r o u n d
good so could you spell playground
yeah p l a y g r o u n d
i think you're very good at spelling actually
i mean seriously
you're not having a lot of trouble with these are you
i think it's just
one or two odd things that you get wrong sometimes like when you should be using a c or a k or a c k or
and me d and cs get mixed up
ah
like for ball i do UNK and all
ah well okay
they look they look pretty much the same don't they
mm
so you've just got to work out some way that'll make sense to you for remembering which way round they go and probably one good way is just write them out quite a few times think of a lot of words beginning with d
mm or
check it somewhere that you're writing it the right way
or picture them in your mind and
yeah picture them in your mind and then just draw them just write the letter d dog door
mm
and things like that
some d words and some b words so that you can sort it out cos the only way you the only the only person really who can make sure it works is you
your teachers can say oh why don't you do this
and i can help you say try this way
but you're the only one who can make it work by practising it and by trying it
it might be a bit awkward when you start off but once you've done it a bit it gets easier
like say playing football
never have you ever seen little kids trying to play football
yeah
and they go up to it and they f as soon as they pick one foot up to kick the ball they fall over
mhm
they can't stand on one leg and then they're UNK their foot about and missing the ball all together and you think anyone can kick a ball but they can't but then they get better at it
erm you can like say there's the ball and like and like up here you can go can't you
they go say they're standing
yeah or they go and put their foot on it and trip over
i know mm
but eventually they s they soon learn cos they keep trying
mm
but if you imagine when you were about this high and someone gives you a ball to kick and you fall over and you right i'm not trying that again
mm
right i can't do it i give up
and never give up
and you just never you never you never play football you never enjoy having a game and things like that so
so if you
you should never give up or
you need to have another go maybe sometimes think well what am i doing wrong
oh well maybe i have to practise first without a ball just standing on one leg and waving the other leg about and trying not to fall over
and then do it with the other leg
exactly yeah and then when you can do that when you can balance on one leg now we try it with the ball and see if we can kick it and then kick it harder and make it go exactly where you want to
things like that
so it's building it up in stages
sometimes people expect you to do everything overnight don't they
they say you know right go on you've seen it done once now i want you
erm UNK and
yeah
UNK you're the best football player in the world and
yes that's good UNK that you can do it
okay well what's so terrible about this folder then
everything
what's all this
you're doing this
oh erm
this poem is an excellent choice for older boys and girls
is it
mm and
do you like it
this is me best one we done this UNK where's the gentleman's UNK
is he feeling too hot
when i am a man may i walk up the street in my UNK and then all the other people shout certainly not
certainly not
that was the UNK new clothes
right okay which so you like that one
and what did you think of that first one then funny words in it
we haven't done that one yet
i wasn't in i wasn't in that song but i went to watch the play
mm
and then when i got this sheet when i joined choir went oh yeah i remember
right okay
but i really like that one
well that's oh that'll be good
and we came second out of all the schools
did you
well that's brilliant isn't it
that's brilliant okay
so maths
mm
cos when you're sitting down for ages
you get pins and needles
you get your legs get stiff you get pins and needles and things like that
erm we'll just have a look at what we've got
the words are mixed up
you have many toes how
what's that all about
you have how many toes
it's got a question mark on the end so it's a question good
how many toes have you
we would normally say how many what would you say would you go up to someone and say how many toes have you what would say
or you have how many toes on your foot or
yeah you'd say how many toes have you got probably wouldn't you
mm
you wouldn't say how many toes have you
is the third year what month of the of
what do you make of that
erm
what do questions normally start with what sort of words do they start with
erm
can you see any word in there that might start a question
the
oh what
what okay so what
what month of the year is third month oh no
now then what is the third
year
month
of the year
good
what hard of the opposite is
erm what of the opposite
so good what is probably going to start it cos it's a question
mm
what
is
what is right what is
what is the opposite of hard
good what is the opposite of hard
easy
do tree grow what UNK on
so what's it probably going to start with
what
okay so what
do tree
well
what do trees grow on
what do UNK grow on tree
okay good what
do
yeah what
tree
tree good
what tree do
do
UNK grow on mm
grass what is the colour of
grass
what's it going to start what word is it going to start with if it's a question
what
okay good and there's a good chance
what is the colour of grass
good no how about this one
many has a how legs lamb
so what which one of these words is going to start a question
how
good so how
how many legs how many legs has a lamb
good
and what's this one
probably going to start with what word
how in a week days are there many
so how
many
good how many
so that
yeah
how many days in a week are there
right
how many days are there in a week
so what you need to do with these is work out the right way round that they should go and the answer is a number and you need to put the numbers in there don't you
well sometimes it's a number here it's how many it's what do you know what sort of tree UNK grow on
UNK tree erm
it's an oak tree and it's another one
yeah oak tree
that it just ends in a k
yeah
oak
how do you spell look
look
look out there
look at that
okay erm l double o k
good
now so if it's got a double vowel if it's got o or say e a say UNK l e UNK l e a k if it's got a double vowel you just have the k on the end of
okay so you could do those
could you do any of those
erm in each
underline which is different
erm different
so have a look at number one
erm which is the easiest one to do of this lot
now i okay right i don't want you to underline them now i'd like you to wait until later and then try and work em out again yourself so you get practice
doing it
so okay which is the easiest one to work out of this lot do you think
erm out of
all those
just that line
yeah
probably
which one
six times one is pretty easy
okay how about six time none
six
is it
mm
six times none
six what does s what does six er let's have a look at this one what does three times two mean
three times two six
it comes to six what does it mean
why would we want to work out three times two
well let's say er if you had two ps if you had three two ps you might want to work out how much that comes to
how much would it come to
how much would three two ps come to
yeah
three two ps comes to six
so that or you might just have erm say you had biscuits and your mum was going to give you biscuits and you've got two friends round
and she said oh i'll give them two biscuits each
so she put them on the plate and she might want to work out what would three lots of two come to
okay so how much how many would that come to
six
six erm maybe one of your friends didn't turn up and you so out of that six you wouldn't get three lots of two you'd get two lots of three
and you'd have three each then
so that's what this is what this is what times means it just means lots of
mm
so what's six lots of one
six times one
six lots of one how many would you have altogether
twelve
times one so if there
oh
were six of you one for you and one for you and one for you six lots of one
six lots of one
six lots of one
is oh do you mean like one six
i mean one another one
so there's six
six yeah
and one
six lots of six how many are there in your let's look at just three lots of two again
there are two in each lot
yeah
let's use these
so three pound there there's one lot of three pounds and three pounds there
so i've got two lots of three pounds i've got six pounds altogether
mm
how much would i have if i had three lots of two pound
three lots
three lots there's one lot for you one lot for you one lot for me
each person gets two pounds how much
oh three
so i have three lots of two pounds how many have i got altogether there
six
six right okay
how about if there were just two of use and we had two lots of three
six
six
how about if there were six of us and we all got one pound each so we'd have six lots of one
six
right how about if there were six of us and we got none each no one got any how many would there be altogether
none
none so what's six lots of none come to
six lots of none
so there are six of us here it's none for you none for you none for you none for you none for you and none for me how many altogether
none
none six lots of none
what do ten lots of none come to
ten lots
ten lots of none ten people sitting round a table and they all got nothing they all got none
none
none
erm how about a hundred lots of none
i don't think a hundred people would sit round
well we've some of them UNK outside and they're all they're all UNK up for something and they're going to get nothing each
you know how much would they get altogether
none
none what about a thousand lots of none
none
okay so that's the easiest one anything times nothing is just
none
nothing
how about if we had no lots of ten
no lots
how many
of ten
yeah
let's say we had let's do it with three
none
that's none good yeah
six lots of none will always come to the same as
none
no lots of six they'll both come to nothing
mm
so three lots of two
three times two erm nine
is it
there's two another two
oh
another two
oh six
six you were doing a harder one than they was asking
mm
okay
three add three
yeah three six
six
six lots of one
er six
six
five add one
five add one
oh six
six
and six lots of nothing
none
so which is the odd one out there
oh the odd one is
that come to a different answer from all the others
three add two three times two
or that one nine
three ti hang on three add three
oh f oh that's
that's six
that one
that one so that's the odd one out
six lots of nothing comes to nothing
so you can underline that one
so you can underline that one later
now what have we got here
eight take away one
eight take away one is just erm seven
okay eight times one eight lots of one eight ones
eight ones eight
two lots of four
t erm two fours oh four twos erm
four twos two fours which ever one's easier it's going to come to the same answer
eight
eight and well four twos two fours and four twos
two fours four twos
eight
four add four well we've got two lots of four there haven't we
yeah
so it's going to come to two fours so that comes to
erm
four add four is the same it's just the same as two lots of four eight
four add four is erm eight
eight
so the odd one out there
the odd one out there is erm
that came to eight that came four add four is eight
eight
four twos are eight
eight
two fours are
eight
eight ones are
eight
eight take away one is
seven
so which one's the odd one out
that's it
okay
three times four three lots of four
three times four three fours is three six nine three six nine twelve
twelve
twelve good three lots of four is twelve
six lots of two
six lots of two
or you could do two sixes
yeah good
twelve
twelve
and you've done th you did three fours and you got twelve what's four threes
twelve
good and you did
that's just the same as that one
yeah
really
you did six twos so what's two sixes
erm forgotten what the answer was
two sixes came to
twelve
twelve
five add eight
or eight and it's usually easier to put
eight add three
yes eight add five
eight five
thirteen
right so which one's the odd one out
that one okay
nine times one nine lots of one nine of us
nine
and we all get one pound each what would that come to
nine
okay
eight add one
good
eight take away one
right eight take away one
nine take away one is going to come to eight
eight add one
eight
eight add one
oh eight add one nine
three lots of three
nine
five add four
nine
okay so you worked
erm i think you can do these on your own you can
yeah
work those out okay
yeah
there's stuff in erm them there
okay so you can do these
mhm
those some of those might be a little awkward
erm tables if you learn the tables it's a lot easier
now there's no need to learn all of the tables erm er what i will do is if you want any more lessons i'll do you some special tables cut down so you only have to learn about half the normal and then you'll know them all cos if you know two sixes
if you know six twos you don't need to learn two sixes do you
and if you know four threes then you don't need to learn three fours
i know
so we'll cut it all down so there's only about half of it that you need to learn okay and i'll print you a table out on the computer like that and then you can ask your mum to ask you them
tell her not er not to be sort of UNK you too much saying oh come on come on you should learn
it's no good
no
it's no good saying to someone come on you should know this if they don't it doesn't help does it
no
okay and you say there are some in here
we're starting this book erm when we're coming back form easter
you're starting this
yeah so
okay so you'll be doing angles and things like that
and weight
you'll be investigating area and UNK
okay and drawing pictures of UNK
mm
have you been to any UNK
well edinburgh castle
mm oh that's good
i think i saw edinburgh castle i haven't been in so
well we haven't actually been in but
ah that one i think is UNK castle
i've been in there
it's
any good
oh very nice yes yeah
UNK or is it i know i've been there i took a photograph of my son outside there holding the doors
i've got a picture of me standing outside edinburgh castle you know
mm
in between two guards like that with the
yeah
machine guns
okay so you'll be doing all these how far is it from one place to the other
yeah
and things like that
that's your book two
have you got your book one about
book one's
is that okay
well i think if we can and it's up to you if you want any more lessons
but if you want to have some more lessons you want if you don't want to you can tell me now or
you can leave it and get your mum to tell me later that you don't want any more
erm if you do i think what we'll do is we'll go through this book one so that we make sure that you really know everything in this and you're really good at it
yeah
so
and then when you go on to book and we'll if we get through this in time we'll have a look at book two as well
but it's no good going on to that until you're really pretty good at this then you should be able to follow what's going on here
it's a bit like somebody sort of can only just about kick a ball and you say we'll make him our centre forward
and you wonder why you're losing all your matches cos every time the ball comes to him he can't trap it or if he does he kicks it the wrong way
an own goal or something
so you've got to build up gradually doing each little bit at a time and working on it
they can't expect you to do everything overnight can they
to just suddenly be able to
do the whole lot yeah
a little bit at a time
build it up
we'll work a little bit on the maths and a little bit on the english each time
oh mm i'll tell me mum to get erm a few you know come round a few before go back to school so
okay
it's up to you
let's have a look i'll leave those you can have a look through some of those and
okay
you know you're coins that you've got there
i count them put them into little money bags
okay well this is what i'd like you to do
i'd like you to put them out just bring me the bottle over now i'll show you what i want you to do
what have we got
they all one ps
or mixed
ones and twos
ones and twos so we'll sort some out
orange juice
orange juice okay squash
now find all the
right keep all the ones over your side
okay what i want you to do is to get twelve of them first and put them into see how many UNK you could make
i mean you could make if we had twelve we get another two
so with twelve we could make
two
the way you're looking at it it's six lot's of two isn't it
if you look at it from round that way it's two lots of six
so you can do things like that you can do erm playing with your coins
draw round them
draw round them just put them put them out like that and when you've put them out to make a pattern you can say if you just work with twelve first
and you do things like two lots of six makes twelve and six lots of two makes twelve
equals twelve
and then you could say well we could try threes try that see if you could make em into sets of three
into sets of three
how many lots of three would you get
right so i'll UNK them all up so like
like that okay
okay
and then carry on and you try that and see what you can do with that
when you've done UNK and you've got all the answers that you all the things you can make out of it
see if you could make lots of fives maybe you can maybe you can't that's for you to find out okay
mm
then try it with twenty four of them
then try it with thirty six
now that will probably be enough all the different
thirty six
patterns you can make
but if you still get through all that and you want to do more try sixty
sixty of them and put them out and make them into nice little lines and that and see what things you'd have to multiply together to make twelve or what numbers you'd multiply together cos it'd be so many sets of like four sets of three or three sets of four
two sets of six sets of two
i don't think you'll take very long on the UNK i think you'll have that sorted out pretty quickly
then you try the twenty four and then try the sixty
so i'll leave that for you to play with and erm i better give your mum a shout because i should have gone by now
i've got another i've got someone i'm supposed to ring up and somebody else that i've got a lesson starting soon
it's nearly twenty past eight
so i'll tell me mum to give you
that's probably best
erm if you get to ask your mum to come in i'll just ask her what's what you're doing next week
i think the best is get some of this stuff done during the holidays yeah
and then when you go back to school you won't be thinking oh they're all rushing ahead and doing it and i'm getting left
i know
behind
cos it makes you feel bad that doesn't it
yeah
and you start thinking oh dear
that's what puts me off me work really
it does put you off and you start thinking oh there's no point trying it cos i know i'm going to be last
sometimes goes first one to finish wins so and so
and the last one sometimes
but
but i'm not the last
good
i've never been last
oh that's great
well i reckon if we practise a lot during the holidays if you play with the pennies and things and think about the UNK and try you know you don't have to read through the whole dictionary just learn some
or re UNK all that at some point
yeah
i've do it's like it's like practising for football i mean you might be the best UNK in the world and you say you know they say well you've just won the cup say
mm
and then they say are you going to what are you gonna do now for next cup
oh nothing
i don't i don't need to practise
so you just sit and watch the telly for a year and not do anything he's not gonna be very good
no
in the next years cup is he
so if you just call your mum
oh yeah
oh yes i'll take that
that's it just give her a shout
mum
UNK getting on
oh well how did we get on
what did you think of it
okay
okay
okay
good
good so
so that's good
how do you feel about it do you think you're going to get the hang of this
yeah
spelling and the sums and things like that
yeah quick
do you
yeah
quick
i think so i think he's good at picking it up
it's just that if in you need you want it explained to you in a way you understand don't you rather than
mm
someone going on about how they think you should understand it
yeah
so i think he's picking it up very well
i've given him some things to play he's going to play with his pennies and make patterns and work out his tables
alright
and for next time i'll get some erm a special set of tables for him a lot easier to learn so that he can learn his tables and he'll only have to learn about half of them and then he'll know all of them
cos some
right
are UNK
mhm
so we'll get that sorted out and been talking about it i think the best bet is if we can get a few lessons in during the holidays so that when he goes back to school he'll be more or less up to date
mhm
erm if we get on very well if we get through say that book one on the maths if we get through very well then we can start having a look at what he's going to do when he goes back so he'll understand the terms when they're explained to him
mm
cos we want him to get maximum benefit from the school not just
right
rely on me
that's right yeah
yeah
yeah
i thought he said he got through book one but is there some stuff in it he doesn't understand yet
erm i think we need to just go through it
yeah
and just make sure about a few things don't we on the book one
yeah
mm
because this is this is very common in maths that there isn't really time for the teachers to give them
yeah
this attention everyone needs so
sort of UNK through it okay you've done that
yeah
now we go on to book two because
mm
that's what we do this term we go on to book two
yeah this is it yeah
and if you don't know it you're not a hundred percent sure on book one
you're gonna be struggling yeah
you just can't understand what it's on about so
mm
the only way to do it is get that book one really sort of so he really understands it and then he's gonna be interested in book two cos he'll
right
understand it and he'll get
okay fine
so what day do you suggest next week
i i'm not sure at the moment are there any days that are
erm i i've just been talking to me husband about it
UNK and UNK we though were good days so leave it at them
okay erm
because erm
right
monday it's too soon after the weekend
oh yes yeah
and he does UNK classes which he's
does he
gonna start up again on wednesday
oh good
evenings
good
and then if he ever wants to stay over a friends
yeah
UNK not a good one you see
okay well
so
UNK yeah tuesday and thursday then cos we'll try and fit in with you if you can
so do you want tuesday and thursday next week
or just the once i think what's whatever's best for you
okay
tuesday or thursday
right now
oh very good
that's good that's good
erm i'm just trying to think we really want to try and fit a few lessons into the holiday if you can it's up to you fit in
erm probably about sort of four or five would be ideal but we can see what we can do with about maybe three or something like that
mm
it depends on how much you can do how much simon can do on his own if i give him stuff to do
okay
erm so have a go at that stuff and work through it and think about think of new words for yourself and i've suggested that he gets a UNK to put some spelling in
right he's got plenty i've got plenty
yeah
of pads about the place
to just k just keep that with you
yeah
keep your UNK in that and when you come across new UNK put them in there
okay
that's a bit like erm didn't you used to have a word box with words in
yeah
yeah
have you still got that upstairs yeah
yeah good that's a good idea but now you can start keeping them in a in a book
we'll keep them in a book
so shall we erm say tuesday then we'll see how we go from there
yeah UNK
is that okay
be fine
erm i'm not sure what time yet but erm it's more likely to be sort of just before lunch or just sort of or maybe just after lunch or round four o'clock i try to keep the younger ones earlier so they're not you know it's not
yeah
too late for them so it'll be earlier on
erm if i give you a ring about sunday or so i will have sorted out cos i've got quite a few to sort out at the moment
okay then yeah that's fine
okay
are you gonna put your things away simon
there we go
right thank you
now that's how much is there
five
and that one
oh erm fifteen
right and it's thirteen pounds fifty so how much change
fifteen
so thirteen fifty and that would make how many
thirteen fifty what how much i
thirteen pound thirteen pound fifty and then
thirteen pound fifty then it's
how much does that make
another fifty onto thirteen pound fifty
if you had fifty pence and
fifty
then you got another fifty pence how much would that be
a pound
okay so we've got thirteen pounds forget about that for a minute and then fifty pence
two pound change isn't it
no
fifteen
that would make it up to
but it's thirteen fifty
fourteen pounds
oh
that would make it four
well now erm what it says here is that you want to sort of talk about possible options for a year out and then relevance of archaeology to career in surveying or land management
that's
yeah
basically what you want to talk about is it
okay well what about this year out then
what do you know sort of what you want to do at all or
not a great deal i mean i'd like possibly to try and stay in erm the field of archaeology to some
mhm
extent erm but obviously i also want to earn some money
cos erm i w i'd like to erm do some sort of further qualification after first degree so erm and now whether that is going on to do
ah
something with erm surveying or whatever erm through one of these courses which gives you exemption from their sort of passing their exams or whatever or
yes i see
whether it's to do archaeology heritage graduate which i'm also interested
right
in
that
right
means i've got earn three and a half thousand pounds f five thousand pounds erm at some point to pay
er
for that and living expenses
and you hope to do this in one year out do you
you hope to get somewhere towards there anyway
so well i don't hope to get somewhere anyway yes
yes i see erm er well i suppose the question is erm well i mean if the aim is to earn money basically in this year out then d do you have any skills which are in high demand and people will pay for
well i'm really not sure i mean erm
erm er or even any skills which would make you UNK at all
yeah
is another you know
erm
it's erm i've got i mean i've got a job for the first six weeks already set up with
have you yeah
the department but working as a supervisor
yeah
on one of their sites
oh great
so you know that's about
that's okay
seven hundred pounds straight off that i've got
right yeah
so erm i've got a bit of time also in which to apply for a few things and go and see a few people erm
yes
so
yeah
the other option of course is not to do that and to try and gain some experience erm m maybe voluntary for some of the time so that maybe i can then spend you know in another years time get a job which is a bit more relevant and i'll be able to earn some money
i see yes to transfer so the other aim would be to try and get some skills which er would improve your chances of doing whatever
yes
it was you wanted to do in
yeah
in the end yes
erm well if we i mean you're probably fairly clear about the archaeology area
yeah
and you probably know more about that than i do so i won't you know
yeah
there are other people who could
yeah
tell you more about that
so erm may maybe we should look at the surveying land management bit
yeah
which i must admit i'm not an expert on
but erm my understanding of erm gaining a surveying qualification
mhm
is that basically erm you go and work as a UNK and erm graduates are allowed to take the exams within two years and you'd probably have to go on night school thing or something
to get it you know
but basically there aren't any real really or there are very few decent schemes where they actually take graduates
yeah
with a view to training them properly
yeah
and more or less you just earn your bread and butter er doing things i mean it might be in the office
yeah
doing clerical work or it might be using erm surveying instruments now
yeah
i mean are you
yes
can you do all that
i mean that's one of the things i want ed to talk about was the relevance of archaeology to that sort of work i mean certainly i've done surveying you know
right
fairly UNK surveying but more or less i know how to use
well
a level and er
yeah
a UNK and that sort
right yeah
of thing so i would have thought that it's the sort they're looking for
yes well i'm sure there are that you know there might be some scope for doing that
yeah
erm er it might be sort of rather like archaeology you know er
mm
when they've got to do the road or something they want somebody to do it for the three weeks or
yeah
three days or whatever it takes
yeah
to do it and then they don't really want them any more
yeah
so but on the other hand if you've got somebody i suppose a firm that was doing that sort of work and they
yeah
knew you could do it i i'm just not erm at all sure of er how that actually works
i mean erm presumably i mean obviously the local authority has its own people
yeah
who do that
well a as far as i'm aware anyway from all from reading
yeah
the information there appears that there should be private companies i actually haven't looked in the yellow pages yet actually i should do that and you know and yeah
no who do it who do that sort of work yeah
you know maybe i am the sort of person they're looking for who's already done a little bit of surveying erm to join as a UNK and then over the two years or four years however long it does take erm you know slowly presumably you just get given more responsibilities
the
erm
the best training for surveying now interestingly we recently had a thing about this from gosh
i can't remember where it was now but it was certainly you know probably one of the er new er very new universities you know the ex UNK
yes yeah
and they were running a surveying course in conjunction with the er inland revenue which now
yeah
yes i
oh have you
well that's
nearly
er nearly well that's the best thing i've seen for getting sort of properly qualified erm
yeah there are a number of courses which you do
mm
erm most of which are only a year which
right
give you exemption from
partial do they
yeah
yeah
some of them actually give you exemption from all of them although i think they're
right
maybe no only they're more than a year
yeah
erm i have heard that there's a particularly there's a good correspondence course with reading university
well reading does the degrees in estate management
yeah
so i mean they'd
yeah so
know what they were about if
yeah
they were running a correspondence
erm yeah
course
the think is i have to earn money to do those beforehand
you know
yes well i suppose it's a question of how much a correspondence course actually costs
yeah
and it should be relatively cheap
because i
well that's what i thought
mean you know they don't
yeah
er i mean it depends i suppose the extent to which there's any tutorial element but i mean erm whether they have you there for a week or something and teach you some of the practical
yeah
stuff
but it's obviously very minimal compared
yeah
with what you get
yes i mean i'm wondering if perhaps
mm
i mean i may be able to get some money from my parents a little bit
mm
erm and with this money that i'm going to earn in the first six weeks and then possibly erm getting a job while i'm doing the correspondence course erm you know even if it's just bar work and especially
yeah
if i'm living at home which
it would be cheap yeah
erm then maybe i would be able to do to
mm
do the correspondence course
i think the thing about correspondence courses is that erm y you have to be very good at UNK yourself
yeah
you know because there's no sort of backup really i mean alright
no
you've got your assignment and it has to be done by the end of the week or the end of the fortnight or
yeah
whatever it is and you've really got to get it off and then presumably it's marked and
yeah
maybe there are some things you haven't covered or
yeah
whatever and maybe if it's a good correspondence course they may refer you to the actual you know things you should have er read and so on
yeah
erm and then you've got to do that
yeah
and get on with the next one
yeah
and it's really almost all up to you
i think erm i think i could do that
right yeah
i think if especially if i wasn't if it was one of if it was my main
yeah so i mean if you were doing bar work but really that wasn't the main job yes yeah
erm yeah if that was the case then i would be able to do that
well the thing about it i suppose is that erm er then you've got to take the exam haven't you
yeah
erm but i think i think certainly i would have thought a place like reading probably half their people set the exams anyway so
yeah
you know they it should be pretty well
yes
spot on for
yeah
what you what you actually
yeah
want you know the key thing is to discover what how much work a week you know how many hours a week they think it's going to take now that's
yeah
actually extremely difficult to estimate really
yeah
because i mean you know some people are pretty quick
yes
and some people are actually rather slow
yeah
and erm but i mean i remember when i was doing er work with the open university now i was a sort of er tutor with them or UNK with them and i think we used to say ten to fifteen hours work a week
yeah
erm for one of their subjects you know one of their main
yeah
er full courses and i think too people tend to say about that level for something like the accountancy
right
erm qualification
so that's probably what you're looking at
yeah that's
erm
that's actually not really
it isn't that much is it really not if you're doing bar well
yeah
it can work quite well with bar work cos bar work's a real pain cos it
yeah
splits the day up in such
yeah
an awkward way doesn't it
yeah
but if you get in a couple of hours
yeah
and you work really hard at it and then you go back and do your
yeah
you know it's
i mean fifteen hours in a week is not much at all when you consider how much you're expected to do for a degree
right well it may be of course you see on the other hand the accountancy takes three years
now er it could be it yes but i think you need to check that to see
ah yes it could be that you're expected to do thirty hours a week
yeah yes right yeah
what they and they if it's a good course they should actually have some sort of estimate of this
yeah
you know
erm and i mean you've obviously got to judge a bit your own capacity
yeah
to say well if it's a lot of it's erm maybe there's quite a lot of figure work or something
yeah
then if you're not actually UNK hot at that
yes
then maybe that's going to take you a bit longer
so
yeah
you know you maybe UNK on the safe side a bit but as you say even if it's erm well thirty hours would be getting
yeah
er quite probably UNK but
yeah
you don't want much more than that do you
don't want much more than that no
oh as you know
anyway i think that's worth checking
i think the er the course actually leads to
mm
complete exemption from the exams
does it yes all the exams
yeah
then you've got to get the experience
yeah
presumably to qualify
yeah i think i think once you've
erm yeah
done that you're then you then are in a position to join a firm
mhm
properly still probably as a bit of a UNK and then you have a sort of
mhm
UNK period where
erm i mean it depends
what you're looking for i mean there were firms like you know
mm
this huge firm in london erm who used to take graduate trainees on
yeah
but they were much more interested in people of course with degrees but they did take people who hadn't
yeah
now if you'd passed the exams
yeah
they'd er you might it might be worth writing around to see what the or even ask the people who are running the correspondence course you know what
yeah
the chances are or whether the pattern is that you get a UNK job in an ordinary firm of estate agents you know and you're
yeah
doing that and that's working your time out so that
yeah
then you know i'm not sure either whether of course i mean one would hope that erm the institute would have certain requirements about the erm practical period that you
yeah
actually had to have experience of
mm
x y and z you know
i think there's very strict erm you know
erm yeah so you might be able to find out from the institute
yes
who was offering this
yes
erm and the approach them and try and find out
yeah
what the chances were
cos i think you probably need to check it out a bit
yeah
before UNK on you know that
i mean i mean obviously the it may be that erm there's very little these days i'm afraid which is an absolutely copper UNK guarantee you know but if they were able to say well you know yes we do take people who've got the exams you know we took somebody last year or whatever
mm
and you could get a feel for the fact that they did do it
yeah
erm then you know that would be something whereas if they say well the UNK so bad we haven't taken anybody for the last five years and your UNK can't UNK anybody who seems to be prepared to er give you even half a chance then i mean
yeah
it's obviously not
yeah
probably a very good idea
yeah
i mean i think
erm
reading and sheffield and whoever are doing the course
yeah
they should have things about who they've placed where
well they should
erm
the thing is you have to be slightly careful about those because
right
erm it may depend on what experience the people had before they did the course
yeah and you can't tell
and if you know they had none at all
yes
and th you know they came from an arts background fine you know
yeah
then they really like you
yeah
erm but you know if they've got a couple of years in er something and
yeah i mean it is the sheffield one
mm
it says in the brochure that they're looking
ah
for people who are er who have already maybe ex a bit of experience
so they've
ah yeah
actually said that so yes
yeah so you've got to be slightly careful but i mean if you already can use UNK and things then in a sense i mean what do they mean by experience
yeah
erm and er so you know but you've just got to be slightly careful i think of the figures and erm i if you know it's much better if you can talk to the
mm
admissions tutor or whatever or
mm
or UNK a letter which asks some very direct questions
yeah
you know erm er which cover the business of previous experience and or somebody how many people do they have with your particular background of a little
yeah
er actual practical surveying experience in the context of archaeological UNK er and so on you know and can they say what those people have gone on to
yeah
erm
i mean what ideally i'd like to do is to go is to get those qualifications and then move into back into the field of archaeology working with
oh i see
someone like english heritage nation trust people like that who are lo who are you know who work with erm
mm
UNK and er you know surveyors that and you know
mm
you know working out the potential of their land and how they can erm use their land and their properties to the best
mm
effect so erm whether that means actually working directly for them or working for a company who UNK in erm the management of historic erm buildings or environments or areas
yes i th i think you've
yes
yes it's tricky isn't it i'm afraid we don't know who these companies are
yeah
now that's what you really need to find out isn't it
yeah
and then to find out what sort of people they've got working for them and what qualifications
yeah
i mean architects use these sort of people don't they
yes
because i remember erm talking to one and there are a number in york who
yes
do this sort of work
well i would imagine so and i th i think if i talk to jane
yes she might have some ideas
she would be the person who would know about
mm
it or martin maybe
erm you know
mm
yes
and possibly even go down to the trust and talk to them
oh that's a good idea cos i gather the department
and the trust don't quite
no
so they might know some different people
be better for doing yes exactly
yes yeah mm yeah
i think perhaps there are a few more places where i can get some information but
i think the architects cos i was i was engaged in trying to find a sort of temporary work for er somebody in archaeology and erm i remember i got to s to an architect and he did quite a lot of that sort of work you know and they
yeah
would know who do which architects do that sort of work
and i think he was keen on whether the person could do erm sort of surveying of a of a building and actually you know do the drawings
yeah
for it
so that
yeah
i mean if you could do that
yeah well certainly the you
then
know that we've that's part of our training
well they they're very interested in that because
yeah
you know they will have to do that sort of thing as part of a job and they don't really want to spend time doing it
erm well it's cheaper if they can employ
yeah
somebody
yeah
i mean i know also one architects firm in UNK where i live
oh yes
so that deals with that because when i was originally going to do my er UNK i was going to look
oh yes
at farm buildings and jane said get in touch with
oh i see
this arch this architect because this bloke is particularly interested in it and he deals with historic buildings and things like that
so erm
mhm
you know i can always go back there as well
well maybe you could have a go back there too
yes i mean it's obviously better to work in both places
mm
yes cos you need all the contacts you can
exactly yes
yeah mm yes
so i think maybe sort of first priority is find out a bit more information then about erm who UNK these sorts people
i think that's right i'm sure the architects do those and there are sort of UNK practices who are particularly interested in
yeah
doing sort of historic buildings and so on
erm and that of course is the sort of area that you want to get into really isn't it
exactly yes yeah
erm so they that might be quite a good area
yeah i hadn't actually thought of architects so that's
mm
and of course there is the institute of advanced UNK studies in the university
yes
i mean i don't know whether they and they run this conservation course you
yeah
see so i mean they should know
they should know who these yeah
who these architects are
er if you can get in to their see their secretary or somebody er i expect
i see
she might be able to
yeah
you know or if any of your erm archaeology know anybody in there or something
i'm sure jane will
yes
know
well she may know who are the architects are anyway
she i'm sure she will working with
mm
r c h
mm
i think i think that's a useful sort of line
yeah
erm
and also to find out more a bit more about the correspondence course
yes exactly you know what it is and
i mean clearly i don't think at the moment i'm in a position to apply for a taught course because i don't have the money
right
so that's out unless erm you know
oh that's i was going to say do you do you know about career development loans
no
well i mean either borrowing the money i'm afraid
yeah yes
but i mean you know they're what well there is a sort file out there on them somewhere
erm and basically what it is it's a government sponsored this er which erm well the rules may have changed cos they're always changing the rules of these things
erm er i think they're probably and they're putting more effort into getting the unemployed off being unemployed off being unemployed into course aren't they so probably the they may have improved things but anyway the basic erm idea of it was that you borrow money er you borrow erm money to finance a course which is going to get you a job
yeah
now you could claim that this work is it's obviously UNK isn't it
yeah
erm er and if you had done some UNK into the job opportunities and you could decide that then that would be good
erm and the limit was five thousand pounds for one year but i think they only pay half the fees or something of whatever course it is
and it only courses one year's UNK maximum one year
right yeah well most of these are one year anyway so
well that's fine then erm and what happens is that you do it through a bank but there are banks which i think UNK and the cooperative bank and maybe one or two others do it
and erm the erm scheme is that the government pays the interest while you're on the course
right yes
and then you have to start paying it back and paying the interest you know
yeah
so the idea is that you obviously need to get a job pretty quick
yeah
erm i mean obviously yo
yeah i mean i'd like to avoid really
going into debt like that if you could but you might use it to top up
yeah
you see if you can get a certain amount of money yes i mean take out two thousand or something
take out a small one thousand pounds short yeah
erm it might make a lot of difference to your sort of er
yes yeah
ability to survive the year in without serious UNK you know to have another
yeah
thousand quid or something
