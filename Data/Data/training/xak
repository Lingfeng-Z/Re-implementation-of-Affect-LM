erm and then of course there would be a i don't know what the rates of interest are or the UNK period but the erm of course the longer the UNK period the more it costs you in the end so
yes
but erm i imagine their rate of interest would be kept fairly low
yeah well i anyway i shall
mm
definitely look into that cos it could you know it it'd be a bit annoying if i was five hundred pounds a thousand pounds short at the end of the day
yeah sure you could just do it
and of course i suppose the advantage of that is too that erm if you needed the money to pay the course fees to get on the
mm
course well if you get it from them you just get the money and then
yeah
you could er
yeah
actually sort of shell it out erm
yeah
just i mean out of interest the reason why i didn't take sheffield
oh yes
one was because they er wanted you for four years for definite after that working in evaluation so basically you're committing yourself for five years
oh did they oh i see yeah
including the course time of course
yeah
you felt that was a bit long
so that's why i didn't take it
well it wasn't working in the field that i want to work in
no
and i thought you know and i think basically it'd be er sort of assessing the value of buildings for council tax and things like that which is yeah
oh it is yes entirely so i'm sure that's what it is basically
because it's actually part of the inland revenue so i mean that's what they're about
yes so they say you know there's all sorts of things you do farms and you get into the country and you do land as well but i reckon ninety eight percent of their people are doing houses so
well i suppose you see maybe what they're trying to do i mean as far as i know i mean previously the inland revenue or the valuation office part of the inland revenue they actually used to run a scheme where
right
worked for them and you qualified while you were working for them
yeah
and as far as i know that was the erm most erm sort of financially effective
mm
way of actually getting qualified because
yeah
they really did have a proper scheme and you were paid a sort of reasonable wage
yeah
and you were sort of given the time and er you know i'm sure they paid for the books or whatever you needed
yeah
and they paid the fees and so on whereas er anywhere else you just work for a firm of estate agents and they pay whether they pay you and the qualifications up to you go off and do it and you know
you don't really i mean i think i don't know maybe working for a UNK firm of chartered surveyors you have i mean it's the same system isn't working as a UNK and then maybe
yeah
finally working up and
yeah and
you have to do it over four years i think if you do it that way
oh do you
if i think you i mean you can go into it if you've erm i mean the minimum qualification they say is only g c s es
yeah
obviously it takes a lot longer to do
right
erm so perhaps with a degree it would only take maybe three years
well i think i think er from memory they the there is a UNK in the professional erm
yeah
you know qualifications which says that graduates can take it in two years
right
can sit the exams in two years
if you're working with a chartered surveyors company
i think that's probably true
yeah
i don i don you know erm and so there is a it is reduced
yeah
and maybe the correspondence slots into that
yeah
erm
and saying maybe you know i should look up see if i can find some
well that's another you know route really al although i think your architects
yes i think that's
if you could work with
yes
an architect who was using you er to survey and draw
that would be ideal
historical buildings and you just worked with him and you took the exams on the side as it were
yeah
erm
yeah
and he probably wouldn't mind that you were only going to be there for a year or two you know he's getting
yeah
a good deal out of it so
so i mean there might even be you know might even you might even
might stay on
his he might be able to get other people from where i've you know from the department here who are also interested in that
i'm sure there
mm
will be people who would
yeah
you know jump at the opportunity to get
mhm
to do that so
yeah well yes
right
right
mm
i shall erm
well does that is that about
yes
about it fine okay
i mean that's yeah
that's given you a bit more
yeah
food for
yes
thought and so on
yes and a sort of a bit of a way forward
well you sound pretty organized compared to some of them
erm and you do have a definite sort of track to look at
yeah i mean a few months ago i had absolutely no idea at all what
yeah
i was going to do so
yeah
erm i was slowly sort of pulling a few ideas out of thin air
and
yeah well it sounds as though it's possible you know you may have to i mean in the end you might have to sort of compromise it and actually do this valuation thing
yeah
you know if that was only way to get qualified
yeah
i mean i think i've already resigned myself to the fact that i'm going to have to do one maybe two years more before i get anything like
right
into the field that i want to be in you know i don't think it's possible to just walk straight in unless you're very lucky
it's no
it's erm
yeah the other thing you might keep an eye on is erm try to develop computing skills
yeah
you know as you go along i mean
yeah
if there's any or doing that in addition to something you know erm
yes i mean we do
you do some
some and i have done a little bit on UNK which is erm making maps and things
oh right
and you do UNK plans of buildings on it and that sort of thing as well
erm so i may sort of look into it a bit more maybe get a bit more experience
yes
and it's erm
i suppose of course in fact the that sort of computing is fairly erm specialized isn't it
mm
really in a way
but i think even if you're familiar with computers generally and have good keyboard skills that's
and also knowing what's available and you know how things work
well that's yeah
like or something
yeah
where you take a picture of a building and you
right
can see which
right
er parts are old and things like that and
yeah
all sorts of things which are available which if i just UNK up on so at least if i went to an interview i'd be able to talk about
and you could talk about it yes i think that's it
you've got to be able to put on a bit of an act
yeah
at the interview
if they subsequently discover that actually your knowledge is pretty UNK but at least you've got some well
yeah
you probably at least know enough to go off and get started
yeah
and then sort it out you know
mm great
okay well good luck with it anyway
oh right i'd better turn this thing off now erm
this weekend and the er that's
that's alright good
so saying today we'll give the give all the acids UNK and bases a bit of a rest
yes
erm look at some of the more general stuff
now is there anything you want to look at
er
particularly where you've more or less got the idea of it but you think you just want to sort of tidy up a few details an
i don't think nothing that to hand immediately no
one of the things we were talking about last time was UNK and UNK
yeah
erm it's an obvious one but it's easy to miss
how do you separate sand and salt
i mean they won't say sand and salt they'll say something which is UNK and give it a horrible chemical name
yeah
and something which is soluble with another horrible and you'll think er i don't know
but just think just
mix it in with water and then filter it out
yeah just like sand and salt
they might say how do you make sure it'd pure
well you wash then one that's not soluble
or they might say how would you get a sort of a clean dry version of it
so you know what to do for that
mm
wash it and dry it
erm i dunno
i mean things like that you're not gonna have any trouble with that are you
no
they represent different atoms
which ones are UNK an
er that one's erm n which one's UNK that's a mixture
that's well they're all the same
yeah
that's the black filled in version is one type of UNK and that's another
yeah
type of UNK so how many types of UNK are there in b
one
so what's is that a mixture of
er no it's a
no okay
element
right and this one
so
is
which ones are UNK then
er that one
okay
any others
just looking er can't th no there isn't
what about this one
it's a compound isn't it
cos they've UNK with each other
okay which diagram r represents a mixture of atoms
mm
that one that one so you have to be careful what they mean there
the following list of substances have a look at that
one point two
which metal is a liquid at room temperature and pressure
mercury
okay
name the two elements present in common salt
sodium and chlorine
great
name a non metal present in oil
eh
er carbon
that's an awkward one yeah good
which element is yellow in colour
sulphur
name the element used in street lighting
sodium
er name a compound
er s compound er
well what was
sodium chloride
great yeah
read this
name a mixture
yeah
the should ask for the two elements present in common salt and they say name a compound
name a mixture
er
presumably they mean out of this lot
yeah er carbon dioxide
mixture no
er water no that's a compound er
you keep saying the answer actually
oxygen
er
what do you keep saying while your thinking
air
yeah okay
and wh what is air a mixture of then
er
some of the things that are in it
er nitrogen oxygen carbon dioxide
yeah
nitrogen and oxygen are the two big they're the two main ones and then anything else you can put
carbon dioxide good and then you get all the funny little trace UNK
okay what's this then
erm
UNK you know
a liquid
so d
no
is
five
complete the following sentence
something is the process of UNK a liquid from UNK by pouring
er
so if you had a UNK full of sand with
mm
water on it
you're just pouring the water off
mm
carefully so that you didn't
oh
any of the sand
can
oh
you remember what it's called
no
it's a funny name
UNK
UNK
oh yeah
it's erm you don you don't come across it very
yeah
much so i wouldn't bother about it too much
it's used to separate cream from milk
again not too common
but this one what what's the thing that's left on the
d or e
c er c
what's the thing that's left on the filter paper
a something is the solid left on the filter er eh ah
which is the one that passes through the filter paper
er oh what is it i've
the no yeah
mm
maybe
they start they both start with er think of sort of UNK
i know it
UNK
UNK
it's what happens to half the answers
erm
right so what's left over
the residue
okay
and we're left with this UNK
the UNK is what goes through
there's an oil called UNK have you seen it
it's
no
quite an old fashioned erm been going for years
they've been going for years they've been making motor oils engine oil it's called UNK so that's the liquid
that maybe a way of remembering it
erm yeah that's those are the important ones the residue and the UNK and erm problem with that then
mm
UNK
what you what do you what are the important things about UNK
erm it can't
what is UNK
er erm
okay erm can you give do you know any anything which is UNK
uranium UNK which is made out of uranium
okay so they're reactive erm is this a good thing this UNK
no
not if you're standing close to it
definitely not
okay er why not
what's it do to you
erm it's UNK
causes cancer
erm
not a good idea
erm have you heard of half life
yeah
what does that mean
that that's how long it takes for half of the UNK to disappear
great yeah that's a wonderful definition
eh
okay so if start of with sort of UNK a year later you've got half a UNK
its half life is a year
then after another year from when you had half a UNK a year later how much would you have
er quarter of a UNK
yeah
each year it sort of goes down to half
okay
erm UNK is you have to sort of get into what's happening inside the nucleus to understand it
what sort of UNK have we got inside the nucleus
erm inside the nucleus
neutrons mm
okay neutrons
er UNK
and UNK
yeah
UNK neutrons and UNK
and UNK
and you get i mean it might be an idea if you could sort of handle this formula but it's not important really
a UNK it's a piece of uranium
it's the it
yeah
has to hit the uranium nucleus and breaks it up into two other UNK and it releases three neutrons
so if you think of the nucleus of uranium lots of UNK and lots of neutrons all UNK up together
er UNK ball if you like UNK into them a UNK hits them and UNK them and it forms into two big UNK the new elements two new elements and three odd UNK balls come flying out
okay
mm
now why is it important that we get when we sort of fire UNK in we get at least one UNK coming out
erm otherwise it would be a different element
mm
if it ha say you fired one in and one didn't come out it would have one extra
well yeah it is a different element because i mean the neutrons don't effect the chemical properties very much
uranium u two three five u two three eight the only difference is o ones got a few more neutrons than the other
but what happens here is that the nucleus itself breaks into two big lumps with a different number of UNK in now so you've got two new elements
so they don't use up all the UNK all the neutrons that the uranium had
three of them come out now what happens if there are right you fire this UNK ball into one uranium nucleus it splits off and then three UNK balls come flying out and there's more uranium about what's gonna happen
there's gonna be a
so if they hit if one of those hits another nucleus
mm
that one will break up as well
will break up an
and release another three neutrons which can then hit another nucleus
so on and so on and so on
and what do you call this
er a chain reaction
right okay so that's why it's important that we get i mean if we just got one UNK out then theoretically you could sustain a chain reaction but in practice it would be absorbed it wouldn't they wouldn't all hit some of them would miss but as long as we can get on average about one of those three hitting another one we can keep it going and we get this chain reaction going and th the heat really builds up then and that's what they use in a nuclear reaction reactor
okay
do you know about the different types of radiation
erm
alpha beta gamma radiation
er i think so yeah
sort of
s er i can't remember which is which
one of them
names what roughly what do they do
er some of them are at different se strength er
okay
one can only be blocked by lead
mhm
er we haven't really done much on it to
no
be honest
okay
i mean some you can stop 'em with a s sheet of thick paper or others will go through very solid objects and as you say you need a good sheet of lead to stop it
erm right
gamma radiation
we've got alpha beta gamma and gamma radiation is the stuff that stuff really takes some stopping
when they when these UNK sort of go into your body what do they do
er oh erm don't know
okay
erm well a lot of them are charged part i mean if you think of let's say the UNK it UNK into a uranium UNK which is a big really massive nucleus and splits it up
so if these neutrons come smashing into your body they could break up any of chemicals that are very important for your life for your body chemistry
one of the things they do tend to do is upset cells upset the way cells UNK which is why they start doing weird things and go off and get UNK
erm very common question is one the different types of radiation alpha beta and gamma
and this comes up so often
explain what is meant by the term half life
right three marks and then they say the half life of UNK one three one is eight days if you have a total mass initial mass of one UNK how much would you have left after eight days
okay
so you could do that one no problem
one naturally occurring UNK metal which is used in nuclear power stations
erm i said it before erm er
uranium
right watch out for that one
that you don't say UNK because that's not a naturally occurring
UNK yeah
i'm pretty sure about that
yeah that one's but i mean th if they say name one UNK metal in nuclear power stations then okay you can say UNK er uranium or UNK but if they want a naturally occurring one then you're not gonna get any marks for saying UNK
and then name one UNK metal which is made in a power station
okay
most of our electricity is obtained from nuclear power stations or by b or by burning UNK
two other sources of energy
which can be used to
water wind er
you alright
yeah
it's black with no sugar isn't it
that's lovely
thanks very much
coke
yeah i mean i think you're pretty good on those you know about alternative sources of energy and you've got a pretty good idea of nuclear power what it's about erm you know half life erm then this gets onto the technical bit
control rods in a nuclear reactor often contain UNK
give the electronic structure of a UNK one mark
well perhaps you wouldn't bother with that
erm what do the control rods do
er there's a nuclear reaction which inside the reactor and that UNK up water and the control rods is nuclear fuel is it
uranium they've just put into the reactor and it UNK with the other i don't know what exactly how it works but er
what do the control rods sound as if they're doing
they're controlling the reaction
right what would happen if you didn't have any control rods in your nuclear reactor
someone just pulled the control rods out
it wouldn't work
it would
it would work very well
ah
it would run away you'd get UNK
see these three UNK coming out every time one UNK goes in this chain UNK getting bigger and bigger
erm and all the uranium is UNK it's all splitting up it's generating immense quantities of heat
mm
and it'll UNK so the control rods are to absorb these extra neutrons
i mean if y if you put the control rods right in it won't run at all
no
because any if okay the odd couple of neutrons did get through they'd split up an UNK three more neutrons come out and they're immediately absorbed by the control rods
so when you run to get it started off you have all your uranium fuel rods in the reactor and you're control rods and it's shut down at that stage okay then you gradually start UNK the control rods and see what's happening
if the temperature starts going put 'em down a little bit more
yeah
and keep it so it's just ticking over so that on average you're UNK two of these neutrons say and just one is going on to st start another one and you just you know ju it's very fine control on the fuel rods
yeah
they usually run them at below peak efficiency they run the russian UNK they tend to run 'em at maximum efficiency which is you're very close to the critical level where it could run away with a little mistake and whoops you got chernobyl
okay so that's what the control rods do erm they're m also known as UNK the
mm
rods that go in there
erm another question on there UNK what's an UNK
erm is it it's not an UNK but it's you couldn't break say a piece of uranium or into an UNK but you could break it up into an UNK
an UNK is say several atoms put together
no
it's like a molecule is it
like a molecule
erm think of two types of uranium u two three five and u two three eight
they've got a different atomic weight cos they've got a different number of neutrons but they got the same number of UNK and they've got the same pattern of electrons and the pattern of those outer electrons is what decides its chemical properties
so if you did a few chemical test on u two three five u two three eight you wouldn't be able to tell the difference
same thing
and they're called UNK of the same element
the only difference in the UNK is one's got a few extra neutrons
so that's basically what an UNK is it's a an element that has
or UNK of an element they have the same chemical properties they have the same outer structure and very much the same inner structure apart from one's got a few extra neutrons
right
so that's an UNK
there are other UNK not just uranium
have you heard of erm carbon fourteen carbon twelve
yeah
do they use it for UNK
yeah
UNK finds and things well erm very often some of you'll find that some of the UNK are UNK and they break down into other things
so you need to know what an UNK is
erm now the UNK table we've looked at that before and it's the if you knew the UNK table and where everyone fitted in every all the elements fitted in or you if you had a copy you could very intelligent UNK
yeah
erm there's a new element here you've never heard of it before let's say carbon fif
well we do get a copy of the UNK table in the exams
yeah so they say what properties do you expect UNK to have you'll have a look at it and you'll say well it's sort of going to be the same as sodium and potassium rally
i mean you'll work out whether it's a bit more reactive or a bit less
and this is this is the UNK that we were thinking of as a couple of UNK or thinking of it as UNK charge
c can really this one is UNK going round with two extra electrons there that it wants to get rid of
yeah
and these two UNK are both saying oh i'd really this one's saying i'd love one extra UNK to go in there it just make up my set of eight same
yeah
for this one so they the three of them get together the one m g and the two UNK
and then they can all be turn then they're happy they this is sort of lent if you like they say UNK but think of it as lent it's lent its electrons to the UNK cos it wants to get rid of them and the UNK wanted to take them so it makes this nice bond
right here's one where they give you a little bit of the table this is a that's a fairly complicated sort of thing that they give on the table erm give you the UNK and the
a good guess
still there's quite a bit
UNK and reduction
what's do you know what that is
do you know what UNK is
er
right so what happens when a piece of paper burns or sugar burns or
it's
coal
it's reacting and taking up oxygen
okay yeah great
so that's the that's the big sort of main definition of UNK taking up oxygen
and the other on the other definition that we UNK use is if you take hydrogen from it
it's also UNK
and then there's this other one where i where it loses electrons that's sort of stretching it a bit
i mean it is it is genuinely part of the definition but the definition they had originally has got stretched and stretched so now it doesn't there's no obvious tie up with UNK meaning burning and taking up oxygen and reduction is the of opposite so if you get the oxygen out or you put hydrogen in or where it gains electrons
erm have you done anything on UNK or giant metal UNK
you seen any erm x ray UNK pictures
no
no
you can take x ray pictures of these UNK atoms like salt and the all because they all fit into a nice little pattern you know when we were sort of playing about with them as though they've go t UNK on
well they all make a pattern sort of UNK sodium chlorine sodium chlorine big block
this is all chemistry now can you remember those
i always and equations
it's not so much the equations
yeah the models
as the what that was all about
tell me what you remember that was about
erm
not the actual chemicals but just the sort of question that you'd get
er what is the UNK mass of say you had s erm
oh
twenty UNK of a substance
okay
er
oh pick a pick an equation that you know pretty well
mm an equation
mm like how do you make salt
er
how do you make common salt
sodium and chlorine
mhm
but we don't normally make it like that
yeah i know
er
i did say we'd keep away from acid plus alkali gives
yeah
gives what
er water and a salt
right so which acid and which alkali would you use to make n a c l
er chlorine yeah
yeah so which acid is that chlorine going to come from
er sodium chloride no that's salt
er
that's what we're making sodium
yeah
chloride so we're gonna get that chloride from one of the acids
yeah er oh
which acid has got a c l in its formula
don't worry about it
n a c l
er nitric acid
no
n a c oh fucking hell
it's gotta it's almost got a chlorine sound in its name
i can't think of it
we'll have we'll have a very short tiny little look at it even though it's almost a holiday right
what have we got we want to we want to finish up with sodium chloride
n a c l
n a and a c l
yeah
right
so we've got to get this
it's hydrogen chloride
right great okay right
oh i was thinking too hard
yeah okay so there's an h c l and we've got to get the n a from something that's the acid and now we need an alkali
an alkali with sodium in it and the one's we usually use are the UNK
yeah
so what's sodium hydroxide
erm n a er it's got hydrogen h n a o h
that's it good
n a o h
so there's the n a positive and the o h negative so that's where we get our sodium chloride from and the h positive and the o h mix what does the h positive and the o h give us
erm h two o
right water
and we get h two o there
so they'd say erm write down the i mean if you're lucky they'll give UNK perhaps on some questions they'll give it to you and on others they'll say write it down
write down the formula the equation for making sodium chloride and then they'd say how many we want to make say two tonnes of sodium chloride how many tonnes of hydrochloric acid is UNK going to use up
or maybe the don't often but they can say how many tonnes of hydrochloric acid and how many tonnes of n a o h would we need to make that
and they're not bothered about how much water you make
but that one as you saw from the past papers that's a usually quite a bit of marks go in for that
and it's a UNK really isn't it
yeah
they give they'll tell you erm they'll give you a list of the weights for c l
n a h all the rest of them
you just put them into the formula ad them up and then you do your well let's say fifty eight fifty eight tonnes of h c l gives say a hundred and twenty tonnes of n a c l
so how many tonnes would give one
er eight tonne will give one tonne of n a c l
erm
fifty eight tonnes will give us a hundred and twenty tonnes
er i'm n how much do we er how
let's say let's say we want to make
can you repeat the question i didn't quite
okay let's say fifty eight tonnes of h c l gives a hundred and twenty tonnes of n a c l
alright how many
and we want to make two hundred tonnes of n a c l
right can i give
so how much would you need
to make a hundred and twenty right
yep
you divide that by a hundred and twenty divide they cancel out so it's so to make one tonne of n a c l you use fifty eight over a hundred and twenty then you just times that by erm hundred and twenty times by two
got it
and that would be
brilliant
yep
and that's it so that's the key to it
well how much would i need to make one tonne
and then once you've got that it doesn't matter what it doesn't matter if they're asking to make fifty three point five or whatever
once you've worked out how much you need to make one to now that question is a gift really isn't it
yeah
there's bound to be something of alright if i say there's bound to be perhaps this year there won't but
yeah
going i it's on just about every year cos it's an important part of the chemistry
and it's not you know it's not really much chemistry in it especially if they don't ask you f for this er equation but they just give it to you
and they give you all the other information you need
so that's one to every now and again on your own just look through a couple of the papers and have a go at that so that when it does come up on the exam you're not kicking yourself
mm
and saying
i knew this i was doing it i was getting the right answer
put the light on
yeah put the light on it's getting a bit
dull
as if it's gonna pour out there isn't it
yeah
it really is
so on that wh not if but when that question comes up you should do very well on it i think
yeah
yeah
and that was very quick as well the way you worked it out it's not gonna take you long to pile up with quite a few marks on that
and leave more for the others have you done anything about gas volumes
no
p one v one t one doesn't mean anything to you
that's an interesting one
some of these
erm five point four which one of these just tell me about which one whether you think they're correctly
it's UNK
whether they're correctly or UNK go through it each bit at a time show me how you're checking it
it's got two on either side
yeah so that's good
so that's correctly balanced
er what about the c UNK
oh yeah it's got three c l two and that ones got
so how many c UNK all together in three c l two
erm there's six
yep okay
and in that one there's only three
ah are there
oh it's two
right think of think of it with the brackets on two times the whole compound and the
yeah
compound has got two
yeah
has got three c UNK in so you've got your two times three again so that one's okay
right
right
two h two plus o two
so there's two there's four hs on that side
right
plus two os
on this side no that's not because it's only yeah there is
two os
right
there
think of the whole compound
as UNK
two lots of h two o
you could write it as gives h two o plus h two o
yeah
been a bit long UNK doing that
right there's one z on z n on this side there's only one z n on this side
this c u there's only one here
mhm
there's only one here
the s o four yeah there's only one there and there's only one there so that's balanced
okay so that's okay
f e two o three and an f e two yeah there's two f e
right f es are okay what about the os
the os
how many os all together on this side
there's four os here
how many
four one two three
there's three from there and how many from this one
one two
right
there's five
think of think of the brackets right
there's five yeah
so it's sort of two
and there's six here
right so we've got five there three add two
and on that side we've got six so that one's not balanced
erm and what about is it balanced as far as the cs go
er
we don't really need to go any further because we've found it's not balanced but we just for UNK how many cs on this side
er there's two
yeah two cs from the two c os and how many cs on that side
three
three from the three so the cs aren't balanced either
right
what about this last one
there's one c u on that side
mhm
and on the other side there's one c u
yes so that's okay
the s o four there's one s o four on that side and on the other side there's one s o four
right that's good
yeah
there's two n a on this side and there's two n a on
mhm
that side
there's one two a o h on that side
good two o hs cos it's UNK around the whole lot
and then there's two o hs there
right so that's okay so it was just that one that wasn't
that's the sort of erm quick question that they give that if you know what you're doing again it's easy marks
so it's getting use to the notation the number that goes in front of the compound applies to everything in the compound
so if we had two n a two s o four that would be two times n a two you've got four n as and two times the s o four
okay that was good
i didn't think i mean there's any easy one here plot the graph
yeah
yeah
hate those questions because they take so much time
really
i find
i feel as though i'm not doing anything useful
you think though this is a UNK this is
mm
UNK
plot it away and draw the graph but it's you know
mm
w would have we got for this one say
see
mm
quite a few marks
oh yeah i'd do it i'm just saying i'm
so eight marks on it
erm again practice would help
before you draw it look for what they're going to ask you
because you might start from nought or something i mean they don't often do this but you might start from nought and then they ask you what is it at minus ten
and you've started at nought here and you can't work out
hi
where your
hi
everything okay
yeah
yes fine thanks
do you want to have a drink or have you had one
i've got one thanks
been
looked after
did anybody ring at all andy
no
okay well i won't disturb you in the study
okay
so before you decide on your end points on the graph just check where they're asking read the volume at twenty degrees c that's okay
so if you do your nought to hundred and draw your graph and just read off what it gets on twenty
so again erm a way of picking up a few marks quite a few
yeah
eight marks there for something that's not really chemistry
draw a graph
mm
if you can draw a graph you can you can get that
and all these are going to sort of pile up so that your the chemistry that you do know is going to you know
yeah
throw that in as well and you'll have a pass
have you done much on UNK
er a little bit yeah
mhm
copper UNK things and silver UNK them
er how they make aluminium
okay
mm
how they make aluminium
erm where do they make aluminium
er
who makes the kitchen UNK that you've probably got in your kitchen
don't know i've never looked
made in france
probably al probably UNK
yeah
aluminium canada
cos they've so much UNK though they've got the er but they've erm they're used to lots of UNK you need lots and lots of electricity and it's very expensive so there they've got big UNK schemes and they make it
and what'll happen when you pass when you pass a current through hydrochloric acid
well what's hydrochloric acid
what's the formula for it
h plus and c l negative so what UNK would you think would come off when you pass electricity through it
erm carbon dioxide
wh what was it again
i heard you wrong what did you say
we got we got hydrochloric acid
yeah
right
yeah
that's hydrochloric acid
yeah
but you think of it as if we move away slightly from the UNK
oh it'll be
in that they're UNK they really are electrical charges and somebody comes up with a big positive electrical pole of a battery
you're getting off hydrogen
okay so you get hydrogen
sorry i don't know what came over me
right you'll get off hydrogen there and
chlorine
and chlorine alright
erm yeah they used to have a lot of trouble in UNK and things as they had problems with their batteries flooding and then they start to UNK the sodium chloride the salt the sea water and getting chlorine given off
it's not nice thing
leave that
this is a similar sort of thing to passing current through but this time we're using it as a battery
yeah
so the z n something that'll conduct in dilute sulphuric acid almost any dilute will pure water won't conduct
everyone says well water you know really UNK electricity
mm
if it's absolutely pure
it won't
it's not a brilliant conductor at all but l there's always a little bit of UNK a
little bit acid say from
mm
carbon dioxide in the air enough to make it conduct
and it splits up so your z n double positive comes out of the zinc rod
double UNK are taken away making it negative and your h UNK go in here making it positive so you get a you get a little a little potential difference a little difference in voltage which gives a any two metals if you put them together and make them a bit damp or even if you don't make them damp you usually get a little a tiny voltage
so if we pick metals that have got a big difference in their electrical UNK we're gonna get a useful battery
the er this is this sort of cell you can call it a cell rather than a battery makes electricity
now a normal car battery called an UNK or battery rather than a cell doesn't actually make it stores it
right
right so you make it with your UNK or your UNK
yeah
and you sort of fill up the battery and then you can draw it off but the battery itself isn't making electricity it's just storing cells like the little cells in that the cells you get in your normal little batteries and when they've finished making it you chuck 'em away
they get to the stage where they've UNK themselves up with the by products so part of making a battery is trying to design it so it doesn't UNK itself up
so you don't finish up with a battery that as soon as you've used it for about a minute that's it can't get any more
mm
voltage out of it
erm yeah how is running water used for making electricity
running water
you said earlier running water might be one of the ways of the alternative methods of making electricity
erm you could use UNK or wave power but say
it's coming downhill when it UNK the
mm
clouds go up a mountain it UNK
yeah
it gets to the top
rain coming down usually come down in a stream so you have some kind of erm mill
what an UNK
water mill
right
and that turns your UNK generator whatever you want
okay right the old water mill used to turn the stones in the UNK mill really you could turn a generator
erm what do they normally have at the big UNK works
erm
is it just a little stream running along or what
no it's usually a water wall
yeah quite a high one so they have a big dam to give a good head water a good height of water and that water comes drops down through quite a quite a height and then they have a UNK sort of force it into a UNK with a UNK and it really UNK that UNK th that's joined top the UNK and makes the electricity
okay
what's a UNK
er it speeds up a reaction it isn't used in the reaction it just speeds it up
what do you mean by it isn't used in the reaction
erm it doesn't it's not necessarily needed for the reaction it the reaction will still happen without it
the reaction could happen slowly without it generally
yeah
but it's a it makes the reaction a whole lot faster
it's not used in great quantities in the reaction
right it's usually only a small quantity needed because although it is it's used it's continually sort of restored
so it's
yeah
erm i mean some people say quite wrongly that it's something that doesn't take any part in the reaction but speeds it up but how can it do that
it does take a part in the reaction but it keeps getting returned back to its original state
yeah
can you think of any UNK
er is it potassium UNK
what
UNK a duck UNK
pardon
a duck UNK
UNK
and it's not UNK it's sounds like a type of pen
UNK
right UNK
UNK is quite a common one in industrial UNK the other things are used
right er right it's how long it takes for a whole substance to react so it can't say you put two
put it in your own words
say you put two chemicals together
right okay
it's how long it takes for those to react together until they've stopped reacting
right okay so if we put this one if we put hydrochloric acid and UNK together they'd start reacting and after a while it would all be finished
yeah
yeah
this p this type of reaction goes pretty quickly
erm what do you think affects the rate at which the reaction goes
er what do you think affects the reaction er the amounts of
okay
it's the concentrations
of the UNK
heat
and heat is the big thing
how does heat affect the rate at which the reaction goes
usually the UNK it is the faster the reaction
right well nothing's happened here let's just stick a UNK under it warm it up a bit get it moving
mm
yeah so that's a graph there and this is the sort of graph that you're sometimes ask asked to draw to get it going okay
yeah
really black isn't it
gonna chuck it down any minute
it is it is
well it doesn't go dark till twenty to eight
i know it's going to go it's gonna be a good out there
what's a UNK reaction
erm it's a reaction say you put two chemicals together
mm
they're not stuck together you can separate them again it's the reaction can go both ways
right the reaction goes both ways
a lot of chemical reactions are actually UNK but the tend to be mainly going very much in one direction so we just say we just write it as though it only went in one direction
and what things could affect which direction it goes in
er heat again
yeah
er oxygen available to them
yeah if it's
er
one that uses oxygen that would affect it
erm what state
and
they were in to start with
whether they were together to start with or whether they were separate
okay and the other thing that you said for the first question to what affects what affects he rate of reaction normally in a normal reaction
er
what's the other thing
quantity
so the concentrations can affect it
as let's say you've got a reaction which is producing erm oxygen
as they oxygen concentration that's being produced gets very high it UNK it down it UNK it and it stops
now if we can take away UNK excess oxygen that's being produced it'll start going again
if we put more oxygen in it might start going back the other way
so by controlling the concentration of the UNK that will affect which way it goes and a lot of them are temperature sensitive we heat it up it goes one way cool it down it goes the other
so this on these general points like this you could pick up quite a few marks but a lot of the questions are not that technical erm and they're stuff that you do know
erm like the answers you're giving now these are all
yeah
good for picking up the marks
now i think you know quite about the atmosphere don't you
yeah
erm what causes the what's the greenhouse effect and what causes it
it's the build up of carbon dioxide er in the atmosphere
right why is it called a
and
greenhouse effect
the light comes in from the sun heat
right yeah
and it here's the rain
and it UNK it comes in through the atmosphere through all the UNK they can't leave again as it usually can
well part of it can leave again but as it is more is getting trapped inside so it's getting UNK
good
and the heat can't leave
right so more heat stays in than UNK back out of it
it's blocking it's acting like a bit of a UNK if you like
mm
erm in the same way as th the glass in a greenhouse works that it let's the UNK heat in but then it doesn't let so much out so the heat builds up
and what's the effect of this
of the
erm
isn't this a good idea because we'll all be nice and warm now
no because the UNK ice UNK will melt sea levels
okay
will rise
erm the hot places already like UNK and mid africa places on the UNK will
get too hot things will die
right
etcetera
and because the sea levels rise a lot of places could get flooded
mm
basically
so
less place to live
right
because anywhere that is it'll be too hot in places so people go to UNK places and cool places will be getting covered in water
good okay yeah great
erm also there could be th will cause other UNK changes so that people who don't normally get rain will get gallons and gallons of it
people who you think it's all UNK there'll be more wet about but there could well be more UNK and so there's quite a lot going on there
what sort of UNK do cars produce
lot's er carbon dioxide er is one
right
there's when the used UNK petrol lead
right
and so on er
yeah
what UNK
carbon monoxide
good carbon monoxide s when carbon is burnt from any of the UNK petrol and sort of the UNK burn them very efficiently and very completely you get carbon dioxide which isn't i mean it's not brilliant but it's not toxic
carbon monoxide is lethal
i actually i got a car magazine today er and UNK have actually built a car and you know they've got UNK now
yeah
it drives around and the air that comes out of its UNK is actually cleaner than when it comes in
is great
it's actually it's brilliant and they
put it into production
because
so they reckon
if you clean the air as you go
yeah
i mean it's
they reckon if everyone drove round this it up
so that's what else is it doing this new car then what else is it cleaning up
what
er
what about these other things that are in the air does it clean them up as well
erm
i mean th it's presumably it must be putting out UNK
yeah
when you've got an engine erm you let's say we've got an engine with a fixed amount of petrol going in all the time
now you've got to balance the air supply
yeah
so that
it burns the maximum
just as just all that oxygen is used up just to burn it erm but if you don't give it enough air what will happen
erm it'll die
it'll it won't fire properly
mm okay so let's
say we've got it just running on a very weak mixture erm
erm
and there's not much there's not much fuel at all but there is a lot of air going in would you expect it all to be burned
mm we c could get most of a
no
lean burn we could get close
yeah
to most of it and we wouldn't be producing too much UNK fuel coming out of the back you know
mm
when you start a car on UNK you can smell
yeah
the petrol being pumped out of the back that
yeah
hasn't been burnt
okay and you'd be getting carbon monoxide out cos you're not erm okay various things like that
now
yeah
what's that that's as you say it'll the UNK not gonna have any power
no
when there's hardly any petrol and it's very
so if you stick your foot down hard on the UNK you UNK a load of petrol in
yeah
and the air can't cope with that can't burn it all up so what happens then
when you've
erm
got a rich mixture
it'll the when there's not enough air and there's too much petrol
yeah
erm only part of it will burn and it'll go out through the UNK the
okay
rest of the petrol
so you've got UNK fuel going out erm
much more UNK though
and what else have we got going out
cos we hadn't got enough air to burn all the carbon in these UNK
so there'll be carbon monoxide
there'll be carbon monoxide coming out and there might even as you say be carbon with lumps of UNK
yeah
erm as well as that we get a little bit of sulphur dioxide and we get UNK of nitrogen which are pretty nasty those are the one's they et around UNK and the big UNK cities
erm nitric and UNK oxide
erm and the oxide of nitrogen
you remember when we were talking about making sulphuric acid remember how we made it
yeah
how do we make it
er sulphur hydrogen oxygen er
okay so we burnt the sulphur made sulphur dioxide
yeah
erm burned that again to get sulphur UNK and then effectively
mm
UNK water on it
mm
and so sulphur UNK add water makes UNK sulphuric acid
sulphuric acid
well we've got sulphur dioxide coming out here and the water will make UNK acid which is again pretty nasty and we've got UNK of nitrogen
coming out with the water they make UNK and nitric acids
yeah
so you can see why it's pretty nasty
yeah
er if it's a city with lots of cars running
yeah
okay what happens to metals
erm
why do why does iron rust for example
er it UNK with water and air
okay good
with water and air yeah that's the big point
erm okay
look at that one
tin UNK why does that stop iron from UNK
erm tin doesn't rust and it protects it from the air and water you get 'em
stops the air and water getting to it so it can't rust and then i mean this is pretty straight forward if the tin surface is then UNK it will rust why
because it can get into contact with the
right and why doesn't this happen with zinc UNK
erm it doesn't come off so easily
doesn't come off so easily and it sort goes into it a bit
yeah
a little bit down into the
suggest alternative materials because iron rust UNK alternative materials for a household bath what could you make it of instead of iron
erm doesn't rust steel
possibly
i'm sure that steel UNK
yeah erm
they do make 'em out of this
yeah
alternative substance
aluminium
no
be very it would be a very expensive cos it's an expensive
yeah
thing aluminium
be a g i mean it would be a nice bath it would be light and very strong
erm
mm
what about a coca cola can
that's aluminium
right aluminium yeah
yeah er i'm trying think steel or aluminium plastic
yep
okay
i was thinking
this is the this is it's so easy you think what's an alternative to steel oh it must be a metal how could i make a bath out of copper or what could it be
yeah i was thinking
and it's obvious once you've thought about it
yeah
plastic an you know UNK baths things like that
oh now we get on to the really difficult stuff
the most UNK gas in the air is
nitrogen
okay
liquid air UNK separated into its components by
er
how do they separate it
liquid air freezing it cooling it
now liquid air
oh
if the air is liquid what temperature is it going to be at
er don't know erm er
what sort of temperature is liquid nitrogen at
low
low
liquid oxygen
er low
low right
so liquid air
is separated
is low temperature
how do you separate it
how do you separate the oxygen ad the nitrogen out of liquid air
er burn something in it
no
you could do okay you could do that and then you would have used up all the oxygen and you'd just have nitrogen left but burning something in a liquid in liquid air is gonna be a bit awkward it couldn't be done
erm what will happen if you let the liquid air warm up a little bit
er one of them would melt
right one of them will not melt but
s er UNK
right boil off i's very low it's boiling but it is at low temperature when it's boiling
you let the temperature come up until it reaches the boiling point
yeah
of the first one to boil and boil all that off and then you're left with the other one
so it's quite a s a simple process the idea of it is a simple idea
erm the something or other is the process by which green plants UNK from carbon dioxide and water using UNK as a source of energy and UNK as a UNK
something is the process by which gr oh UNK
good yeah great
a UNK in the air which leads to the production of acid rain is ooh carbon dioxide isn't it
no
carbon dioxide does give a very slightly UNK
er
rain but it's that's not really
it's sulphur dioxide
good sulphur dioxide yeah we get UNK acids and sulphuric acids
UNK of diesel fuel produces a poisonous gas called
diesel fuel
well that's a tricky one
erm think of it as petrol
the UNK of petrol produces a poisonous gas called
called carbon monoxide
right and it's the same for diesel
right
it's just that they've probably got so tired of putting petrol in each year
mm
we'll fool them we'll put we'll say diesel
diesel
this year
yeah it's a UNK
it's got lots it's got hydrogen and it's got lots of carbons in and these carbons when they don't burn completely when they only sort of partly burn they form carbon monoxide instead of dioxide
okay ooh
now you know you're pretty well up on water supplies where it comes from what it does
yeah
erm you know the formula erm do you know the test for water
the test
mm
no you may not have come across it
you get white an
er
white UNK copper sulphate
oh yeah it turns blue
i knew that it turned blue but i didn't know that was the test
yeah
it turns blue and that's a good test for water
erm essential for life we're about two thirds water it UNK depends depending on which book you read how much of us is water but erm don't forget that it's an incredible UNK water
yeah
lot's and lot's of things will dissolve in water
you tend to think oh so many things don't dissolve in water but think of the other ways round
so many things
salt all the salts
mm
i mean what do washing each day if you want to if you want to clean the walls want to do
mhm
bit of cloth in water
all the UNK in your kitchen all the UNK in your bathroom
they're all stuff which dissolves in water
yeah
and if you get it's only when you get UNK that you think oh i'd better some UNK or
mm
a bit of petrol or something to try and get this off
so you pretty well up on water
water as a UNK you know all about that
rain coming down rain down to the sea UNK off again
erm now okay
what will happen there if you've got a shallow pool and a couple of deep UNK and the sun is shining on it
that one will UNK sooner
right
i wonder about the wa what about the water temperature
erm it will be UNK
right so a
er
little shallow pool down by the UNK will be warmer
yeah it'll be warmer near the top in these as well
mm
erm
er
m yeah it will be it will be warmer
they those would UNK at the same rates although that one would be gone sooner because there's less off it
yep
all looks good
chlorine is a poisonous gas
so why do they put it in household water
er it kills off it's
yep cos it's poisonous it kills off sort of virtually all life
yeah
and what they hope is that most it has sort of been has disappeared by the time it gets to us
mm
so it doesn't kill us off
but you can still sometimes you can smell it can't you
taste it in your water
oh yeah it's really bad in our water
yeah
it sometimes it really
especially if
UNK of UNK
yeah
with the UNK and the chlorine
if they've been changing the pipes or digging them up or something they often UNK it through with a load of chlorine the water of or b boil it erm as water UNK and something like sugar would you get would you find let's say you get a cup of cold water and you try and dissolve as much sugar as you can in it and then you try hot water try UNK
dissolve more in the hot water
okay
what about UNK
do they would you get more gas dissolved in hot or in cold water
more in cold wouldn't you
yeah as you as you heat up the water the UNK boil out of it so if wanted to get rid of the chlorine in your water boiling it gets rid of quite a lot it forces the chlorine t to boil out
ooh skip that
acids bases and UNK
erm i know you've probably had more than enough of that but keep having a little look
yeah
at those because you've i mean you've done so much work on the you're doing so well with them it would be a shame to just let it sort of slip out of your mind
yeah
erm you find that more and more constant repetition each time you go back to it there's less that you've forgotten less that seems new and more that seems obvious and you'll be saying to yourself sort of m you know of course yeah i don't need to read this UNK obvious that's obvious
whereas a few months ago it wasn't UNK obvious
because nothing is obvious until you
mm
until you've learnt it
metals can you think of any metals
erm any metals that what
erm
just any metals
erm oh iron aluminium brass copper steel erm magnesium sodium potassium calcium
great right
UNK er
one mentioned earlier as a UNK
er potassium UNK no
no
no UNK gold silver
right okay
lots of them
erm some properties of metals that most of the metals nearly all the metals have
conduct electricity
right and if they conduct electricity they also conduct
what else can they
erm
heat
right
heat
okay
i was thinking of something like electricity i'm saying have i missed something
right
erm they conduct heat and they conduct electricity
yeah
a one foot copper pipe and a one foot sort of piece of fairly thick wooden UNK and i'm going to stick a blow UNK on the end of each one which one would you
the UNK please
yeah
so th the copper will conduct very quickly it'll soon get hot and the wooden one will be a good UNK
erm metal UNK metal the UNK differences see this is the thing they're all sort of quite keen on so some of the important metals here
iron very important you know you can't there's can't be a house in the country that you go into and not find something made of iron
yeah
erm cars okay they're made of steel but the steel is made from the iron
aluminium pretty important also a very good conductor of electricity
erm which is metal is sort of one of the best conductors of electricity
er copper
yeah UNK a very good one
silver and gold are excellent conductors but they're a bit expensive so i
you know when
how about UNK
yes
is that even better
erm is it better
alright
i don't know actually i don't know
i'd imagine it is
yeah
so you've got me there on that one
mm
erm now differences between metals and non metals
what would you say the differences
between metals and non metals
er non metals don't conduct electricity er
and don't conduct
heat
heat as well
er
yeah so you can use them for UNK electrical UNK or heat UNK right
er metals erm they're always in solid or liquid form metals never a gas
generally okay apart from mercury they're
yeah
generally
a solid
a solid and erm what other things can you do with metals thinking if their physical properties
erm they're strong
yeah they're strong erm
erm they r they react quite often with water and air
yeah
with water
yes and
or air yeah
yeah
erm
what else about concentrating on their physical properties
erm
what could you do with lump of copper
there's a big s UNK of copper
melt it down
you good melt it mould it make shapes out of it
what else could you do with it
erm
think perhaps of a piece of UNK what could you do with that
it's heavy it protects against radiation
mhm
erm
yeah
there's lots of things you can do with it
okay so erm what would you make wire out of
copper
yeah
how do
make wire out of metal
er
you get your lump of metal and you stretch it you sort of pull it through a die through a tiny hole and you just st stretch it
big thick rod and you pull a little bit of it through a tiny hole and you stretch it out and you keep stretching it and you keep stretching it doesn't
aha
snap
so it's UNK
yeah
erm and it's UNK you can hammer it you can hammer it into shapes and panel beat it a car or bits of lead you could dress it you can tap it with a
mend your roof things like that
so metals
mhm
are usually erm they're pretty UNK they're UNK and UNK and erm the non metals usually can't do things like that
here's your UNK going down to town there's a big drop there they'd normally put it through the UNK and pick up some free electricity
mm
select from the list above the metal that UNK with cold water
erm sodium
okay
the metal used to make hot water pipes
copper
the metal that forms a protective oxide coat when exposed to air and is used in the manufacture of window frames
aluminium
right
er the metal that forms two different UNK solution react with sodium hydroxide solution to give UNK one coloured UNK brown the other green
erm iron
so you can work
yeah
that one out by what
yeah
what have we got left
erm in a UNK are the reason now you know about UNK of water
temporary UNK
temporary and permanent UNK
right now your UNK are
calcium chloride isn't it
well erm what does hard water do
erm it doesn't so you can't make soap in it
er
okay when you use soap you get a load of UNK with UNK what happens in your water tanks and water pipes in a hard water area
er you get UNK erm you get like hard calcium
right you get deposits of calcium something
yeah
it's your pipes get UNK up and the bore down the middle gets thinner and thinner so the water sort of hardly UNK through
so this is something which is UNK
yeah
something which seems to be soluble at some stage and the water gets hot and it's not soluble so we're looking for things here that are not soluble
it might be worth having a look at that cos there's near there's very often a question on UNK of water
erm be a good thing for you t cos you you're really good on all the rest of the
yeah
water and what it does it might be nice to just look at that to finish it off so that if
yeah
get a question on water which is very common you get sort of you get the full marks to it
so hard water doesn't readily form a UNK with soap right
yeah
erm this twelve point six the main reason for temporary UNK is that okay
twelve point just says b sorry
the calcium hydrogen carbonate or calcium UNK if you like
yeah
now what do you think calcium hydrogen carbonate looks like
it's got calcium hydrogen and carbon
so it's got
in it
calcium hydrogen and carbonate
c a h c o three something like that
we're not bothered about the UNK and whether it'll be two c as with one c o three or two c o threes with one c a or how the e but it'll be something like that
it's okay in cold water but when you heat it up it breaks down into the carbonate c a c o three
and the UNK is soluble but the carbonate calcium carbonate is just chalk
yeah
and it's not soluble so as soon as the water UNK up it comes out
so you get this in your hot water cylinder we can get it in UNK erm you get it in hot water pipes and it happens a lot in hard water areas scale will dissolve in the acid in the UNK of twelve point seven
ah here we are
this kettle is covered with scale now look see twelve point six is asking you which one of these is causing the problem
right
now
mm
twelve point seven because it's in hard water it's covered with scale calcium carbonate
so maybe you could sort of go back and think which one of these would possibly give me calcium carbonate well that good chance it might you know have a guess that this one
yeah
the calcium hydrogen carbonate was the one that
carbonates in it
right okay
so often you can get it through some related questions and just go back
yeah
through it all
have a have a guess you know
what is hard water
okay you've answered that one
dilute hydrochloric acid is put in your kettle to remove the scale
how did it what wou what would happen when you poured it in
erm
you've got calcium carbonate and you pour an acid on it
react with it and it UNK heat up
it would heat up yes and it would UNK up
and see any UNK any UNK
yeah
what gas would be coming off carbonate
hydrogen carbonate
er what's on the inside of the kettle
calcium carbonate so you've got acid
chlorine
acid plus carbonate
yeah
erm you'd be getting the chlorine off getting hydrogen actually
what happens when you put remember when we looked at acid and alkali
yeah
acid and base
yeah
and we also looked at acid and carbonate
erm
and that was the odd one
it gives an extra thing that UNK off and what comes out of
er it's a ga
it's a gas that comes out of a carbonate
carbon dioxide
that's it okay
mm
right
mm
okay so we get the carbon dioxide given off and name two products
yet another for that
explain why dilute hydrochloric acid not be remove used to remove the scale from aluminium UNK
erm it will react with the aluminium eat away at the aluminium
right it erm al aluminium is a very reactive element
although we use it cos it doesn't rust it does
it UNK so quickly and so sort of firmly it forms a very thin film of aluminium oxide on the surface
it takes something like ten or five or ten seconds when you made it
it's UNK on tight to the surface and it stops any more air getting and UNK the rest of the aluminium so we take that off with the acid and let the acid react with the aluminium nice hole in it
when we use it in school in when you've UNK some off the layer you can't touch otherwise your fingerprints will be all over it
right
until it's UNK
yeah
okay that's good
erm bit of UNK
ho any idea how you would UNK plate car UNK
no
i've always wanted
how would you how would you copper plate things
erm UNK
same thing for UNK
yeah
and when they silver plate things what they tend to do i mean first th the thing when you plate something erm it follows the shape
so if you've got something rough and you plate it erm you get a rough finish
if you want a nice shiny smooth finish you polish
polish
the thing you're going to plate first
and what they used to do is they say coat it with silver they might coat it with copper first
so get it smooth coat it with copper polish that up a bit so it's really nice and shiny and put a fine UNK of silver over it
yeah
and you're saving a bit
on the expense
same with gold UNK and stuff like that
quite often you use gold leaf though don't they
and
yeah
gold UNK
yes
er don't know which is more expensive actually
carbonates
why is carbon important
why do you think we might be interested in carbon
erm it's around it comes out of a lot of things
erm car UNK
etcetera when you burn things
yeah
what's the difference one good reason why we would be interested in it
what's the difference th one of the big difference between organic and UNK chemistry
the chemistry of sort of life organic chemistry how things grow and how we work
yeah er UNK in both of them
mm
a lot of we get the complicated carbon compounds in erm all the natural processes
so we gonna look at it in simple form first things like carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide and carbonates and then build up erm i think no
pardon me
erm why is carbon dioxide useful in a fire UNK
carbon dioxide
mm
erm it UNK the flames they can't get oxygen if there's carbon dioxide around
yep
UNK it
right how about some more some more did wh what's UNK
and what's diamond
they're all compounds they're UNK together
they're forms of carbon
oh right yeah
okay
UNK of carbon
erm a carbonate plus an acid gives
erm an acid
carbonate plus an acid
right like we poured stuff
salt and water
gives a salt and a water and
carbon dioxide
right okay and it gives you sort of three boxes to put things in there okay
great
so you get your full marks from that
few more things mm
nitrogen okay it's fairly important because of production of UNK and nitric acid and basis for the UNK chemical industry
here's the n here's the nitrogen cycle which i thing you're pretty good at okay on that
mm
aren't you
tell me tell me some of the bits in the nitrogen cycle then go on
what bits
the lot
lots of bits
the lot tell me he lot
i c i don't i don't think i can tell you the lot it's
tell me some bits then and work out could you draw a picture of
mm no
i don't think i know it that well
it's go it's a good you know
er
it's a fairly common question
i know erm
the nitrogen cycle
have a have a have a go at some of them
i don't know where to start hang on just need to
well okay where UNK you going to start
can't you just ask me about it
it's
well it this is more like what an
i don't i don't really know it well enough to tell you what a nitrogen cycle
erm where does it come from where does it go to who gives it out who takes it in
things like that
erm can't even remember what it is now
okay have look at the nitrogen cycle
yeah
sort of read through a bit about it and then when you've read it put the book away and leave it for half an hour or an hour or something and then try and draw a rough outline of some of the main points
some of them some of them give a lot of details i mean this gives a lot of detail there
you may not need as much as that but erm bacteria UNK in the soil and the plants taking up the UNK some of the plants
do you know any plants that put nitrogen back into the soil
no
no erm plants people tend to grow peas and beans and things cos they form little UNK round their roots and they're putting nitrogen they store nitrogen in that and they sort of when they've finished they put nitrogen back into the soil
right oxygen and sulphur
ooh got through got through nearly the whole syllabus there in one lesson
mm
the UNK do you know what they are
er UNK erm
okay good
erm
UNK ring a bell no nitrogen
chlorine
yeah
chlorine UNK
yeah
are the three main ones
that one that's gonna be
yeah
or just about it
what's happening in a blast furnace
erm draw your picture work out what happens
what you put in what you get out
why do they need coke
what's the UNK what does the coke do to the iron
heat
it's carbon it's not being used as a fuel it's just being chucked in to do something with the with the iron ore and why does it put UNK in it
so something to look at there
test
bar chart
can you read a bar chart
yeah oh no
yes you can
okay read that one then as you say as you claim you can't read it
oh right
that one is seventy
mhm
million tonnes
that one is seventy two million
good
tonnes
right
in nineteen eighty three the yearly consumption was found to be seventy six million tonnes so where would you mark that
so that one will be s that'll be seventy four so in nineteen
nineteen eighty three mark it on the chart
seventy
don't actually mark it on that but
yeah i won't
you can right so
i mean that's
yeah
it's isn't it
yeah
right
ooh
my maths papers are the worst for that
yeah
alright well the they give you the answer for those of you who couldn't do it
yeah
okay organic chemistry
now we did have a little bit of that i would say er leave it leave it till you've got the other stuff pretty well sorted out
yeah
erm pie chart
can you read a pie chart
how much how much is used for making and UNK and things
i mean so even something's like this on the organic you might not have a clue what UNK is or UNK or anything else but you can read the pie chart and work out what what's going on
so you could still pick up some what's the last hurdle
i'm interested in this what does it say
of test questions er yeah these are these are tricky where they give you something like they give you a UNK point and a boiling point whether it UNK electricity and a gas is given off which turns UNK
carbon dioxide
right so if it gives of if you heat it in er and it gives of carbon dioxide have a guess at what it is that we're heating
erm hydrochloric acid
acid er no
w we're not putting an acid with it
yeah
we're just heating this thing so
er
what's it got to contain if it
carbon and oxygen
so what compounds do you know that have carbon and oxygen in it
er
the ones that gave of carbon dioxide when we put an acid to them
er calcium er erm oh hydrogen carbonate
okay calcium carbonate yes
yeah
so the carbonates any of the carbonates heat them you get a good chance of getting the carbon dioxide given off
okay
so even these more awkward ones you can still you can still have a good guess at them just from what you know
nothing else
what about this one
erm acid in rain coming in again
from the chemicals listed below which one produces acid rain
carbon monoxide chlorine hydrogen plus sulphur dioxide
iron is obtained using a blast furnace
the raw materials that go in at the top are iron ore UNK and what else goes in there
okay
UNK and coke
right coke
although it might be a temptation to say hot air because you do put hot air in but it says goes in at the top of the furnace
yeah
so watch out for that one again people might think lime or something get it confused with UNK so it's really a bit tricky that
coke
right do you happen to know the erm three main ingredients of UNK
er sulphur UNK and UNK which is
very good
erm what is it
they use it in UNK as well
mhm
but can't remember its proper name
erm what is it
can't remember
tell you what salt peter is
mhm
salt peter is sodium UNK
yeah
and er nitrate mm a UNK
i it's very similar in properties to UNK and it comes from UNK
and we used to get it from UNK
and it's potassium instead of sodium
yeah
erm yeah very good
UNK is not used in rifles because it produces smoke an leaves a residue in the barrel
yeah
so there's the er equation
what happens when it burns or UNK so the okay the potassium nitrate and the carbon and the sulphur burn and they give quite a bit of er c o two
they also th these other things can all burn as well and you can get erm sulphur dioxide and you can get as well as nitrogen you can get UNK of nitrogen
and you get a lot you get a lot of gas formed which is why you get the big explosion
it's formed very quickly
and there's a slightly more complicated one what happens when UNK
but the big thing is okay you get a lot of water
lot of water which is going to come out as steam
mm
a lot of nitrogen as a gas i mean ten h two o as a gas
so you're gonna need air
bang
n yeah
you're gonna air t you need how much
we don't actually we've got it's got nine oxygen in it already right so this one doesn't actually need any air
we're not putting any oxygen in the UNK it's got nine UNK tied up with that already to make all these other things from so we've got a lot of volume of UNK there
mhm
six n twos an o two and ten h two os
yeah
bang
erm this one
good afternoon
the purpose of this UNK session is basically we're sort of looking at it from two UNK attacked
it's from the point of view of the risk management for the council's insurance because our new policy we are virtually self UNK
we have a ten thousand pound excess so we're looking at er trying to minimize those risks
but also more importantly we're looking at it from er an employee health and safety point of view because we feel it's just as important to have our employees aware that their
yes
can you just put it on there for me
thanks very much
the environment in the workplace or aids awareness or any of those kind of health and safety issues
it's a very informal session and will welcome any comments that
thanks
you have erm and he will also UNK as much of his knowledge as he can in the two hours to you
so please listen and enjoy
and i shall even join in on this one
thank you very much
thank you for that er introduction catherine
about the what's that the about the UNK time
er as you say now you're going to
going to ha have a listen to what it's all about
so hopefully
yes
er she keeps saying it's terribly interesting i hope she doesn't deny that at the end of the two hours
good afternoon
erm what i'd like to er start off with is to emphasize why you're here and erm the fact that i'm not going to UNK you as a driver
you're all competent sensible drivers i'm sure and erm no doubt that you feel quite happy with the manner in which you perform your functions on the road
but what i'd like you to do is to go with me during the next couple of hours have an open mind and erm if i say something which is in an in any way UNK question me if you want to cos that's what we're here for to communicate
anything you want to argue with er and discuss please do
not just the content of erm the two hours but anything else which you feel is pertinent to you as a group or indeed you as an individual
if you want an answer please ask
i shall be able to give to you
if i if i don't know the answer i'll find out in the interim period and let you know at the end of the session
but hopefully i shall know the answer
the erm the main constituents of the afternoon UNK around the awareness of erm you on the road and what you individually can do about other road users
how do you individually view other road users
UNK
who yes UNK
UNK
yeah
i often think
great
yes
they'll always do the un UNK
in fact some of the them are screaming UNK aren't they
mhm
you know they're not just basic UNK but they really do something erm which can be quite UNK and er there's no doubt everyone of you have been in a situation created by another road user
not of course created by any one of you
no
or w shall we say that may be said with a bit of a tongue in cheek
do you think that you are you can be sort of erm put behind the eight ball
you know you m you might be able be a little bit UNK in some instances
yes
mm
yes
yeah i think that's true isn't it
and i think what we've got to think about is what our general attitude is to ourselves and to our other road users that are around us
how do you er how do you therefore generate the knowledge before you start getting the attitude
because the attitude always comes in when you start getting more experienced don't you
i mean you d you don't really have an attitude problem when you first start to drive do you
other than UNK and fear
but erm generally you start getting the attitude problem when you think oh i don't need all this old rubbish the UNK taught me do i
cos i'm now a competent driver cos i've passed my test
haven't we
or do we
when did you last look at a book about driving
come on
come on when did you last look at a book about driving
anybody read one recently
no
only on france
when did you last look at the highway code
about five years ago
you only passed your test five years ago ten years ago
erm now driving is probably the most dangerous thing you do unless you UNK jump or UNK or do other daft well they're maybe not daft things to people who do them but certainly they're potentially dangerous
but erm if you do those sort of things somebody teaches you
and if you're a er UNK er you might go to the professional and say you know i'm miss i'm UNK you know can you show me how i can't do this
or if you're a bridge player you might go and ask advice or read books but what do you do about your driving
not a lot
when did you last read the highway code
a long time ago
do you remember that one
yes
mm
do you
you do
six p that cost
erm that's a long time that one came out
that one seventy five p fifty p sixty p and er last but not least that one
have you seen that one
mm
mm
no says sue
good god have a look at it
are pretty ancient
no i'm not
thank you
ninety nine pence
it's getting it's getting it up a bit isn't it
yeah
right
right
bit tight
bit tight
so it's er just out this one or it came out the end of er last year december january time
and er it's a good ninety nine p's worth
now as i say to every one of you er on these courses do when you go through w h smith pick one up and have a look at it
now you won't be able to read it whilst you're in there and save ninety nine p
but it's not really too much to ask is it
to a quid
eh
you can even put the penny in the poor box at the same time
but it's really a good UNK worth of l of er knowledge
and i don't think you really know it do you
do you
some pardon
yeah a fair bit of it
oh right
aha
right yeah
some of it
he'll pick on you now
a UNK better than any than a pressed man isn't it
stopping distances
yeah
well
i'll t
stopping distances
i
your UNK
i'll tell you what we're going to do then
er only a bit of fun this really it's not a it can be a serious exercise but it's not meant to put you under any pressure
but i'm going to give you a little piece of paper and on the piece of paper it's got ten questions
and all i want you to do is ring the answers
li like a UNK test where you just put the little ring round the a b or c or d
and er then at the end of it we'll talk it through
now it's not really for my information
it doesn't really worry me whether you know it or not
i'll be very impressed if one of you gets a hundred percent
but i want you to realize whether you know it or not
so when you go that door you'll have a little bit more knowledge than when you came in that door
and it's not only UNK around this of course it's about the other things that we're going to stimulate your interest with as we go through the afternoon
so would you all volunteer to er have a go at that with me then
and er all i want you to do is just ring the answers
only takes about five minutes
we'll quickly go through erm those again that'll take another five minutes or so and er i'll be surprised if you don't find it quite interesting
okay
have you all got a pen
no
cor
he told you to bring a pen john
i'll find you one
thank you
mm
oh okay
two there
you want one as well
sorry
beg your pardon
there you are UNK
thank you
okay
about five minutes then
okay
well i think we're all more or less there by now
erm what i'll ask UNK to do if she's still going on with it she'll be a little bit late just put a couple of plugs in your ears while i give the answer out
cos you've got a very honest face
thank you
so j just you just carry on with it
as i say the main idea is that when we get the answers to these er you know regardless of what you're actually telling me you know whether you them right or not
you can mark your own papers
so er you can UNK if you like it won't make any difference
you'll notice that they're geared to certain things on the on the question paper th the constituents really of what we're going to talk about this afternoon which will UNK mainly around thinking about things that you're doing i e good observation and concentration those two going hand in hand always organizing yourself in relation to a good separation distance so you can UNK what safety means to you
time equals safety
you can think about a UNK approach to problems whatever it is whether it's a roundabout or wh however you name a particular hazard
in other words a good mirror signal manoeuvre routine however you apply it but in a particular order which gives a discipline so that you're keeping yourselves out of the problems that other people may give you if you allow them to
so that's what how this is geared
so having said that if you'd like to get ready i'll give you the answer to all the questions
and erm if you UNK it just tick the answer as appropriate
hopefully they're are the same as the ring if not tick the other one
question one is a
question two is d question three is a four c five b
question six erm a should be lane markings and divisions that's the white b for green exit entry slip roads red c for the hard shoulder and d the UNK central reserve
number seven
you should have UNK the following
a b and d
i'll repeat that one
ring the following a b and d
question eight d
question nine a
and question ten you should have the word UNK and words to the effect should not have been in that position and not have assumed that the other driver was going to do what he eventually did do
words to that effect
UNK got it right obviously
great UNK at the back there
right are there any points then that you want to raise on that
or do you want to sit there and UNK a bit while you have a look see what you've got
are there any queries on e any of the particular questions
mm
any you find ambiguous or er doubtful
how about
the roundabout UNK very interesting
yes
erm a lot of people don't seem to know the rules at roundabouts and you cannot
you're right they don't
assume anything at a roundabout
no
no
and you have to be so careful now erm and y you get in the l the larger roundabouts and more and more lanes
and i d i don't think a lot of people actually know the rules when they get into a roundabout and
no
let's go through them then shall we
yeah
yeah let's just run through what we feel are appropriate
er quite right people don't know and if they do know they don't care some of them
er they think it's old hat to give signals
because they know what they're doing
mm
why should they bother about what other people want to do
and by UNK if they get through as quickly as possible they don't need signals anyway
cos peop
mm
people are not really gonna benefit they're going so quick
the main thing you've got to think about with roundabouts is that where does it where does it all start
does it start on the roundabout
or does it start on the approach side of the roundabout
where c
y sure
where can you gain the information on the approach side if you can't see the roundabout
the road markings
road markings
and the
sign
how often do people though erm UNK that information
do they take it in
do they UNK digest it
do they observe and concentrate
if the roundabout suggests that the road you're on is a fairly wide road and the road you're UNK on is a fairly narrow road it will normally indicate you're going from probably a UNK carriageway which you know you're on if you're already on it but the road you're entering might not be
so therefore your position and remember that the UNK thing with all driving is think correct position think correct speed think correct gear
position speed gear
so all the time you're thinking that
so the first thing you're always gonna think about is position
so as you come up to a roundabout you're thinking of the exit or UNK
it might be straightforward like that one
it might be an awkward one
some of them have got arms going off all over the place
so if you're if it's a strange area to you it's up to you to organize yourself
don't try and do it at too fast a speed
give yourself time
because if you don't give yourself time nobody else will
if you go rushing in and you're in a thirty and you're doing forty five they'll all rush in with you
and you're past the sign you're into the roundabout and you're not quite sure what you do so what do you do
take a chance
or do you keep going round until you've found the right exit that you want
and that's not so daft as it seems you know
if you get into a roundabout and you m and you make a mistake what's the best thing to do
take a late manoeuvre and UNK in
or go round and another look at it
go round have another look at it
don't be ever be frightened to do that
never make a rash move in conflicting traffic situations because you'll find yourself er they might UNK at you they might blow their horn at you they might say some very rude words that you've never heard before
or you could have accident or an incident
so always give yourself time
so as you come up on the approach side think position
now if we're going to exit on that side where's the best position that you would normally be in
position one or position two
two
two
one
anybody who said one
okay
so you're going to follow through in position one and erm if the situation allows it and there's not much traffic on the roundabout and you can see that the exit side is the same width as the entry side is there anything wrong in following round in that position
if you've got an exit like that
as opposed to following round like that
is there anything wrong in it
no
that the third exit you should be in that position
the preferable position i've got to say is the position two unless the circumstances allow you to be in position one
say for example er you come up and you might see that erm there is a parked vehicle there
there might be a lot of traffic sort of UNK out there or there might be a congestion there for some reason
if you think the position there is better well of course you can take that position
the highway code
mm
suggests that you take the easiest and UNK route through the roundabout
but what you've got to be very careful about is that if you go into a roundabout in that position and you get somebody in that position who is also going the same way and there's a pinch point there that's the danger
who has right of way at that point
who has right of way on a roundabout
so
you see we've got here a UNK of opinion immediately haven't we
now imagine then that we're all going round a roundabout
are we all of the same opinion
we're not are we
cos so therefore if there's any element of doubt keep yourself into position two
there are circumstances where you would adopt position one
if it's safe to go through in that position and then you can see that the exit side is clear okay there's nothing wrong with that
but the erm query that's put down on that little paper there suggested that there was a problem and a person who was coming in with you erm followed right the way round
and you often see them do that don't you
yeah sure
you often see them do that
so be aware of the possibility of anybody cutting across the lane that you're already in
and the only way of making sure they don't unless it's completely clear is to be in a safe positive lane on your way through the roundabout
you might get erm yeah i'll be with you in a sec
you might other roundabouts where they've got satellite roundabouts
er and those they're even more critical
they work very well as long as you take your time and you're always in the right position and anticipate who's gonna come through
yes
er position two is always for UNK for taking the first turning off the
no
no
it's er it is for that
yes
you're right i mean you would obviously be in that position if you were going to turn left but if you're if you're going to go down there by all means but it's safer if y say you're n car number two behind car number one in position two and he's UNK left
well alright he's gonna turn left er just pause let him clear and then follow the way t follow the way through
so you've got to have a little bit of patience in relation to what other road users may do
he may even change his mind mightn't he
they often do don't they
they're UNK oh i don't want to go that way i want the next one
so if y if you're UNK round him and he suddenly changes his mind we're UNK what he is actually doing by getting assuming that he's gonna do the right thing
so if you work on the presumption then that position is the preferable one bearing in mind that you know what you're doing but you don't know what other people are doing
any other points on that
can you just talk about indicators on roundabouts
cos that UNK me when i'm waiting to go onto a roundabout and i don't know where the other c i can't really read where the other cars are going
no
because very often people when they may not be sure themselves might they
you see you can't read into their minds
they might be total strangers and they think where
oh there's the there's the one i want to go
they've probably not read the sign or they might not give an indicator at all
so al don't ever take anything for granted
even when we're talking about the person who has right of way on a roundabout
now who normally has right of way on a roundabout
so you immediately all said the person on the right
you were all quite comfortable with that
have you ever gone onto a roundabout being the person on the right and somebody's come out straight in front of you
yes
so it doesn't always work does it
see we kn we know but does everybody else know
you're on a motorway
you're on the main part of the carriageway and coming in on the left there is this traffic coming down a slip road to join you
who has right of way
people on the motorway
people on the motorway
now we feel that that's correct
have you ever been on a motorway when somebody has pushed their way in front of you and caused you inconvenience made you brake
i'm sure you have
we all have haven't we
so you cannot take it for granted
you can work on a presumption a UNK of UNK or whatever but i mean what you cannot do is take it that it's absolutely fact that is going to happen
so always work out in your mind that nobody has right of way in those circumstances
if you keep that in your mind you won't get yourself drawn in on a f false premise that you must be okay
very often you will be
but you don't always judge purely on that
you look at the vehicle you look at the driver you look at the attitude of the vehicle
what's its speed
what's its position
that is if you're concentrating and UNK which is one of the UNK things i've already mentioned
erm UNK gone home
er she won't be coming back this afternoon
oh right
okay
okay
thank you very much indeed
so we've got to the situation then where erm we are making sure that nobody is gonna put us in a position whereby they can cause us problems
and if you work on that presumption and i'm not suggesting you creep around frightened of your own shadow going at a slow speed just wor working with UNK and making sure you move through the situation UNK but don't take anything for granted
now any other points on the er on the paper
stan just st still on the question of roundabouts and the UNK question of mini roundabouts you know these dots in the middle of the of UNK
yes
erm and you see people frequently charging across the middle or even to the right hand side of them because they don't believe that you know that they have to you know er be observed and gone round and erm whatever
erm they're the they're there for a purpose and their size is there for a purpose in terms of er of the UNK of the other road er UNK or whatever and obviously huge vehicles who just can't possibly manoeuvre without going over
i mean one assumes that's why the highway authority put them there at that size
what's the actual legal position about UNK onto that centre spot
mm
well you'll normally find ian that those erm roundabouts are put at points where there is there's a known problem in relation to access from minor
yeah
roads onto major roads and it's a cheap and easy way for local authorities
mm
to UNK traffic
and also of course i you can't always f em put in a big roundabout because there might be buildings there might be erm services there that they can't remove etcetera
so it's a temporary measure in many ways
they work quite effectively
but like everything else they'll only work with the UNK of the of the er UNK public
so always treat those in exactly the same way as you would a normal roundabout so that you're coming up and always assuming that people should give way etcetera in the manner in which they should unless the roundabout UNK otherwise
and erm should you go round them in such a way that erm is making it more difficult for you and more difficult for other people
the answer is no
erm as you say ian large vehicles they can't possibly go round them
erm i do a lot of er large goods vehicle training and if you get erm with a very large vehicle thirty eight tonnes you cannot even with an UNK which has got a very good UNK to get round you cannot do it
and therefore you've got to take the shortest route across
and these are just little UNK in the road you know
i'm not talking about those which are built round
but erm they are built in a such a way that they should cater for the largest vehicle that is likely to use that road
so use the normal rules on the approach side for those i e roundabout rules but going back onto the signals again on roundabouts like that don't give unnecessary signals
erm the point which i don't think i a quite adequately covered erm alan mentioned it did you not in relation to where you give a signal erm th the h new highway code makes a slight variation in relation to where you should give the signal when you're UNK on the roundabout
a lot of people are quite clear when they know they're gonna turn left like that
erm a lot of people aren't so clear when they're going straight ahead
they very often will signal right then signal left
and they're not gonna do that at all they're going straight ahead
so don't give a signal at all
you're just going straight through
if you give a signal left UNK think you're going there
if you give signal right they'll think you're going there
but when you're going to that exit there if you get to that position and you haven't give a UNK given a signal that's the point just after the junction there at the point of the junction to give a left hand indicator signal mainly for people waiting there
this is the point you meant alan wasn't it
yes
you're waiting and you're thinking er and this is particularly the case with a large goods vehicle you'll be sitting waiting to go and there's a lovely gap and you think can i
and yes i no i can't
cos he's given a signal too late and by the time you start to move there's another vehicle coming round the corner
and of course that's what encourages some of the chaps in the large goods vehicles to use their weight er to push their way through
a little bit UNK isn't it
but you can understand it's not UNK really but you can understand their UNK when people c consistently don't tell them what they're going to do
so indicate at that point that you're gonna exit there
if you're going all the way round indicate right
the only time you're gonna indicate right is that position there when you're going there
be careful about those sort of UNK
they're not always straight forward
so if you're gonna turn left don't give a signal there you're gonna turn left in there
you must reserve that signal till you get to that point there
don't give too many signals on a small roundabout
if you give too many by the time you go click you know they say what was that
it's too late
they don't know what you intend to do and what you've actually done
you must give other drivers and riders time to absorb the information that you're giving them
your signal is the only voice you've got apart from the horn is the only voice you've got at telling them what you intend to do
so you must give people time
and if you if they can't absorb the information what's the point in giving the signal in the first place
now we'll talk a bit more about signals because presently we're going to have a look at a little bit of video which is erm showing commentary
er i don't know whether you've ever er done commentary driving or heard commentary driving have you
and er the idea is to highlight the things that you feel are pertinent to you and what you're going to do about them
but we'll be coming onto that in about five minutes
now any other points about any of the other questions
stan can i just turn round the other way what you were talking about there
you said about the driver giving the left hand indication as he's about to leave the roundabout
if you're in the situation where you're waiting to come onto the roundabout you see somebody who's indicated left you assume they're gonna turn off so you pull onto the roundabout and they're not
who's in the wrong
you both are
yeah
if y i er when you see that you remember i said don't assume anything
you've been sitting in a side road waiting to come out and you see a vehicle coming along and it's got its left hand indicator on and you think oh lovely
i've been waiting here for ages
it's probably only a you know a matter of seconds but it seems a long time
you start to move and he comes he gives you a horn warning UNK around and carries on up the road
who's in the wrong
you
you both are
he for i indicating he's gonna turn left when he's not you for assuming he's going to turn left when he isn't
so you cannot assume anything
you've got to make sure absolutely certain that UNK gonna turn
wait till you see him start to slow down
see the UNK of the vehicle er the man inside the vehicle
have a look in the vehicle
don't just look at the vehicle look at the things attendant to the vehicle
the wheels
how he's got his hands on the wheel
if you're coming along and you see a stationary vehicle what's the driver doing
is he looking over his or her shoulder
or are they UNK down
are they likely to open the door
there are so many little bits and pieces that you can accommodate in you own mind if you want to
you can all do it
we know you can
you can all concentrate
can you concentrate a hundred percent all the time
anybody here think they can
i'd like to come and shake your hand if you because there ain't no such animal
you cannot do it
what you've got to do is reserve your concentration for those particular times when it's a particular need
and the other times your concentration will drop a little bit
so you've got to learn how to UNK your ability to UNK up the levels that you need when they're particularly UNK
anything else on roundabouts
cos we've spent an awful lot of time on it
i don't mind because if you've got the questions we'll certainly spend the time
good
any other points that erm you want to raise on any of the others then
i was a little bit surprised at the answer to nine
somewhere that you didn't need your UNK if there was street lighting
well you see it says a forty mile an hour limit that one
erm so if it's thirty it doesn't UNK but erm if it does if you're at or near a road junction even in a thirty
but ha are they enforced now
ha they're not are they
so therefore people like yourselves are UNK quite surprised oh i didn't realize that
what is the distance
i mean if you'd have been reported last week for it you would think yeah i'm damn sure that's right you know
what is the distance away from a from a corner
i mean is there UNK distance
yes there is
yes
what is that distance
ten metres
cos i well i frequently come across UNK on parking his car less than that distance
yeah
well yes it is an offence
but the thing is this
erm the police will only apply their resources to a matter which they feel is appropriate to the need of that particular problem
and er the need of this particular problem is unless there's an area whereby there is an accident risk they won't bother with it
they can't deal with everything can they
so therefore erm you've got to be aware of these things and consider the safety implications as we all do
we've actually got a situation outside where i live where a thirty mile an hour speed limit is erm finishes just in front of some of the houses and of course we've got no access to their the gardens so we just park on the road
so we're parking UNK but the police actually have UNK they've said they will turn a blind eye to it if providing that we all do it sensibly and without and face like in the line of the traffic
yes
yes that's right
and in fact it's less of a hazard at night than
mm
it is in the day
yeah probably is
so it's a question of using your common sense
and er you look at the needs of particular area and erm apply er th the rule of thumb to a certain extent
er i mentioned in the earlier session today about erm a situation that UNK when i was in the police at UNK
and erm the majority of people who do this sort of work are ex police officers and erm that's why w you know we have the training and we can re recall instances of bad driving that's why we're q quite UNK in our pursuit of safety procedures
cos you see the results unfortunately of the people who don't follow them
but one of the problems in the UNK area was parking on the footpath
now you might think to yourself well that's not a big problem
but this particular road was an a t an a road and it was round a very sharp bend up a l a gradient and in a thirty limit
people used to consistently park because they hadn't got garages
but round the corner there are side roads
but they would insist on parking on the footpath
so i said to my blokes on several occasions and they used to think i was a proper pain in the UNK i expect go up sort them out don't necessarily report them advise them if necessary if they consistently do it you'll have to use a fixed penalty ticket
it wasn't so much the fact that of parking on the footpath it was the consequences of parking on the footpath
i e you get a blind person come along
erm you get a woman with a UNK
now it's a fast road what have got to do
knock the bloke up and say can you come and move your car
out in the road round the round
one way street and they come UNK round there
much
faster than thirty
sorry
is that UNK
sorry
is that UNK
yes that's right
you know it do you
yeah
they still go through there at
i know
well funnily enough i went down there last week and i must admit i came round the corner and there was one particular vehicle still does it
and it's a UNK
and it's always parked on the footpath
and there was a traffic warden standing there doing a traffic er doing a fixed penalty ticket
and i must admit i th i sort of UNK him
not literally
i thought thank goodness for that
now that UNK not there any more
but for weeks you know it was parked there all day and very often at nighttime
now he appears to have got the message
i don't want to see people nicked but that was a danger
and erm you know that's sort of a d a difference to yours
mm
where they f they perceive the problem or they don't
sorry
yeah
can i just ask you this restrictions is it for forty mile an hour and above or is it just in the forty mile an hour
no and above
yeah
any other points
quite happy about the two second rule then
we're gonna deal with that a little bit more in a minute
no queries on that
erm lane markings and divisions
i saw a few sort of puzzled looks when
yeah
we went on to er the red and UNK
you probably got some of the others but it's the red and UNK that causes the problems isn't it
you think is it is the red on the right or is it on the left
now you might think to yourself well what the devil difference does it make whether we know whether it red or UNK
do you think it makes a difference
what do you reckon UNK
probably UNK
it's one of those things that you always take for granted till it's obviously taken away from you
right
if they were all the same colour you'd think but because you've become so used to seeing the green and UNK and the UNK
mm
so wh
you notice them
when could it be of particular use to you do you think
in fog
yeah
er in any adverse weather conditions particularly fog where you're travelling along and you suddenly see erm a red stud on your right hand side
where would you be
hard shoulder
going down a slip road
hard shoulder
yes
somebody said this morning on the wrong side of the carriageway which you probably
you probably would be
but you don't suddenly turn round and go the other way do you
but fog can come down very quickly
you know you're in a position where everything's UNK and all of a sudden you're in a bank of fog
and you do very quickly lose y lose track of where you are
so it can be very useful there
so a little knowledge can help you
this question of er UNK cross or UNK double solid lines
erm to pass a UNK
now how many of you here have been in situations where you've been behind a UNK and you've been tempted i'll not say you've done it but you've been tempted to go past
yes
yeah
qu i know i know
you all put your UNK the thing is you should never be tempted to do it
it might enter your head oh lord
have i got to sit behind this chap for ages
you can overtake on a double white line
what it says is you must not cross or UNK the line
so if you can overtake with safety there's no real problem is there
but can you overtake with safety
cos when they place these they're always in a zone of danger double white lines
they're very UNK enforced
and anybody here with the technical services department they would confirm that
but the main thing you've got to think about is if you start to overtake and the UNK who may be wearing his er UNK erm UNK fifth or some UNK music going on his is he aware of you around
probably not
he might come round a UNK cover just as you're about to pass him
you either stamp UNK up his right UNK or you go over the double white lines or you brake and somebody behind might be too close behind you
so you can't really take for granted can you that erm he may or may not do anything
how about the milk float
the old UNK going down the road reading the paper isn't he
er about five miles an hour
and er what have you got to do in a double white lines system
got to follow him
haven't you
erm if it's a UNK it's a little different isn't it
tha which is you know just an indication
it's not UNK by a solid line but it's just a normal UNK
it's like er a double white line with broken lines on your side
you can overtake if it's safe to do so and you can regain your UNK without danger or inconvenience to other vehicles coming the other way
but as far as a solid line is concerned don't do it because i it immediately if you if you o do UNK it'll mean penalty points if you're seen doing it regardless of the consequences of it
UNK
it's an UNK moving UNK traffic offence
any other things then on that before we move onto er UNK new
all quite happy
okay
if you'd like to just pass those along to the end of the line then we'll collect them all up
now you'll recall i said that we will we will try and UNK try and UNK throughout the afternoon those things which are going to be useful to you
erm
the end of the line
let's talk then about this question of observation and concentration
we're gonna have a little look at the video in a minute but before we do that i'd like to erm draw you attention to a situation this is a real one which erm was an accident that took place
now i'd like you to give me your opinions as to the whether is was UNK and whether it was UNK
and if it is UNK who is to blame
so i'll give you the scenario
excuse me
before you start on that do you mind if i turn off the UNK television screen
well i've left that on because i can't guarantee i'm gonna get me channel zero but
could we just turn it a bit perhaps into the side
erm
do you want me to push it round
is it really disturbing you
it is ac i could sit in a different place
no that's alright
thank you
that's great
sorry about that
even though she was late
right here's the scenario then
so thirty mile an hour road and busy day
and er quarter to eight er quarter to nine in the morning all the UNK are running around half asleep wish they'd got up a bit earlier but they didn't
here we have chap who er wants to buy a paper
here is a paper shop
he comes along oh
a paper shop
opens his door to get out his paper to get out to get the paper little boy on bike comes along knocks him off
didn't see the lad
should have done he's just UNK him
but he was selfish all he was concerned with was going and getting his paper
the little boy
he's about eight he falls on the ground he's not really hurt his legs are UNK up in his bike and he's trying to get up
now vehicle number one and vehicle number two is following him and vehicle number three is following him
now you can see that they're fairly close together aren't they
but in between vehicle two and vehicle one there's a reasonable distance and the distance is in fact seventy five feet
so what's the overall stopping distance at thirty miles an hour
seventy five foot
seventy five feet
so he should be able to stop this chap
and he does
and he stops just there no problems
number three he's not very far behind the other chap same distance when it all happens
any problem as far as he's concerned
as long as he's got his thinking distance
right
so where does he first see the problem
two brakes
his brake lights
yeah
that's it
when he he's erm done his UNK
now the UNK bearing in mind it takes you half a second to react anyway but hi his actual thinking distance is about thirty feet
and the forty five feet is needed for his UNK distance giving the overall of seventy five
so when he sees that
UNK
yes
sarah i've seen sarah
yeah
UNK
yeah
yes UNK
UNK
yes
claire over there UNK oh yeah does anybody know if UNK is still in hospital
she's she came out last week but i still think she's feeling a bit
jane
melanie here
kate here
UNK here sarah
haven't seen her yet she might be here
UNK
yes
UNK i've seen UNK not here yet is she
right shall we make a start because the time's pressing on
i've got some erm announcements for this morning vicky erm first of all i'd like to introduce you to anthony who comes from UNK why did why did you do that melanie
er cos i think you just told us that man you know
last count didn't we ask me
yes
good morning
hello
i'm from the evening news you're recording
oh good grief
sorry i've been all round the
yeah carry on
right
take a picture of the UNK
never mind
erm anthony is UNK he's in the college today he's UNK erm the sounds that we make the vocabulary that we use not for the content of our classes that's right isn't it
mm
but for the way we actually use and pronounce our english language
oh no
and
anthony and his anthony and his colleagues are going around is it just england or are you going to scotland and wales as well
the whole of great britain so northern ireland as well
the whole of british isles right erm in various sort of UNK different places you're going to a school aren't you tomorrow
mm
is that right
various other places too so they get a good idea of the english language as it's spoken in the nineteen nineties
this is for UNK
smile
UNK is that right
for the future for erm for record we've not been able in the past to know how people spoke only from books UNK and try to describe how people said things erm but this is a living record and i'm getting more and more embarrassed as the minutes go by and those of you who are doing drama this afternoon anybody doing drama
erm he's going to be recording UNK session
oh right
as well alright
okay
so that's that but he's not going to interfere with us talking let's carry on at about ten o'clock graham is coming who is i'm as you know i'm doing erm er a teaching course i'm not a teacher you see i'm a i'm a nurse he's coming to assess me on er this is a teaching practice for me alright so he will come in and i think he'll sit over there and we'll just get on
right last week we did erm cold injury in the new born didn't we
we'll just UNK briefly on what we did
thank you fine now this is
is that clear
yeah
right did we actually do the susceptible babies
yeah
alright jane
is that alright
i don't know it's engaged er UNK trying to phone the school as well and that's engaged so i don't know
the UNK the babies who are susceptible to getting this cold injury are what did we do last week
what did we cover
erm cold
what type of babies did they cover
low birth weight
pre term premature and small
babies there that are you alright kate
there are other reasons why babies might be susceptible and there are a list of things that you may well know about from babies you're looking after
where after they've been born they might have had delayed breathing not UNK immediately so that type of baby might be at risk
if the actual delivery or the birth of the baby had been difficult traumatic for example a UNK delivery or a very long labour where the baby and the mum got very tired and exhausted if there's any if there's any UNK amalgamation we can discuss it
we just have a UNK okay if there's any UNK amalgamation particularly in the central nervous system things like UNK problems like that and any underlying infection or feeding difficulties and the feeding difficulties could be cause or effect we've got a baby that's erm who's temperature is dropping it's getting more UNK and erm it's difficult to feed and if a baby's not feeding properly it won't be able to warm itself up
if you're if you're outside and you get really cold what do you do
warm yourself
more clothing
yeah what else might you do
you'd go inside and have what a hot
drink
yeah or a hot meal and that would really warm you up wouldn't it
so you can see that the last this is a vicious circle
kerry would you like to sort of sit over there or something
i can see it's okay
it's alright kerry it's just that graham has come to do to observe my teaching and he'll be wanting to sit there is that alright
yeah
kerry get a chair
oh erm could you leave that up cathy for a minute
we need to think that why new babies are so UNK to cold injury and a lot of the reasons can i take that down are very obvious if you think about them cold injury is the same as UNK
what other group of people get UNK
old people
old people that's right why do old people get UNK
because they don't move about very much
cathy did we write this last week or not
erm
this one
i don't think we did
right
i just want to go through it with you and UNK
old people because they don't move around what else don't they do
they perhaps don't eat much
what might be where they're living
it might be quite
cold
cold and damp
right their UNK cold babies actually have a very large surface area in relation to their weight
if you look at a baby they're totally out of proportion and they have huge heads don't they
compared to the rest of their body and they don't have much hair if any to keep them warm
they have very large bodies and little limbs so the heat lost from their heads and their bodies could be quite great
that makes sense to you
yeah
what does it say at the end in relation to what
weight w t
yeah that's what i thought
UNK weight
when babies are born erm what are they
er are they dry or
wet
wet
if you come out of a swimming pool and stand at the side what happens to you
you get cold
mm and UNK
right the body surface at birth is wet and therefore UNK quite rapidly so they've got big surface area and they're born wet and they have to be dried off
when they're when they're inside their mums do they have to control their temperature
no
because the mother does that for them
that's right well it's in a they're in a in a very warm environment aren't they
and it's con the temperature is constant it's like being in an UNK
body temperature is ninety eight point four isn't it
and it stays like that throughout so the baby does not use its mechanism to control the temperature it's kept at that constant degree of warmth and it's only when the baby comes out that it has to start looking after itself
so what i've written is babies prior to birth do not control their temperature they have the ability to control their temperature because that's a little space in the brain but they don't need to use it
they're kept warm when you saw those little babies last week that were born very premature apart from being very small if you looked at those arms and legs and their bodies what was the UNK different about them than a full term baby
colour of their skin
colour yeah something else
the way they breath breathing
what was that sarah
breathing
breathing no something to do about their physical appearance
they're really UNK up more than like a normal baby aren't they they're all sort of you know UNK position
no it's to do with
they don't have that much fat on them
a new born baby can be really quite UNK and these little premature babies have very little fat under their skin and fat UNK us doesn't it
it keeps us warm so pre term and small
babies have very little fat to UNK them therefore they're gonna get cold aren't they
and these are all reasons why these babies might get cold
if you come out of our out of a swimming pool and you're wet and you stand on the side and you're beginning to get cold what's your body reaction what do you do
UNK
UNK and you get UNK
UNK right
have you ever seen a baby UNK
no they can't UNK
they don't UNK
and they
babies actually can't UNK
they're unable to do it and UNK is a body reaction to being cold to make you warm up because it's rapid movement and babies can't do that this isn't very clear hang on that better
yeah
that's better top goes but right so babies cannot UNK which is a temperature raising or maintaining mechanism
we've said that when it's a baby inside its mum doesn't have to control its own temperature and in actual fact it's several days after birth after the baby's born that it can effectively produce its own heat and its UNK functions efficiently
UNK is the process by which you take in food use it and convert it into energy and heat er several days so there were several days after the baby's born when it's really very much at risk of getting cold injury
it's an enormous UNK that the baby has to make from being UNK inside its mum to actually living outside it has a whole host of new things to do it's gotta breath it's gotta eat it's erm it's UNK system has got to work bowels and bladder it's got to control its own temperature
when a baby's born er you wrap it up and you put it in its UNK and it's very UNK isn't it
they're not very active are they
no
and in the first day of life they tend to sleep an awful lot right so UNK tend to be UNK and UNK and the things that wake babies up and warm them are feeding crying limb movement
so within your very new born sleeping all the time it its body temperature can begin to drop without you knowing
the older the baby gets the less common it is to find the cold injury
can i take that down
no
move up
we're going to go on to the effects of UNK and what damage does that do
UNK
we did UNK yeah getting cold last year we did in your first aid course you did UNK didn't you
what's the normal body temperature can anybody remember
thirty seven degrees
or
ninety eight
ninety eight
thirty six
what is it in fahrenheit
ninety eight
thirty seven or ninety eight point four
oh
round about okay
if the body temperature falls to sorry we're not clear again are we
falls to thirty two degrees UNK or ninety degrees fahrenheit the following can occur and that's a big drop that's a drop of five degrees in this country we're very used to rapid temperature changes in our environment in the spring you can have frost in the morning and it can get really quite hot by the afternoon sometimes up to about seventy can't it
and then the temperature drops down rapidly again
right what do you think might happen if a baby's getting UNK what signs do you think might you notice
blue
cold to the touch
yeah cold to touch
blue
blue
yeah
crying
pale skin
pale skin right what about its behaviour
crying
they may not cry actually
something else that could be quite actually misleading might sleep be very UNK difficult to wake so if you've got the baby and you think your baby's due for a feed and it didn't take very much at the last feed you can't wake it up you shouldn't think oh well i'll have to wait for another four hours beginning to get worried so if the baby's difficult to wake if it's difficult to feed not UNK very well if the baby's cold to touch and then there's something which is very misleading these babies can have bright red UNK and bright red hands and feet and if you look at them you think oh they must be warm because they're red
don't be UNK by the healthy appearance
always touch a baby its hands and its feet and the feet are a better guide to my hands because UNK hands can often be cold
if you've got cold feet at night can you go to sleep
depends how tired i am
who if they've cold feet lies awake till they warm up
got socks
so that's very important because it can be very misleading and you could be UNK into thinking that there's nothing wrong with the baby then there'll also be swelling of the hands feet and the UNK might UNK up the medical word for that is UNK which you may well see in books which means swelling occasionally the UNK skin is
cathy
hard and these babies can look really UNK and peaceful so UNK and peaceful that next time you go they're not there any more well their body's there
okay got that down
UNK it means peaceful and calm erm treatment you should if you think back to your UNK what are the very simple practical things you can do if you find a baby that you think UNK got cold injury
give it hot oh not hot
a warm drink or
you have to warm it up
UNK it and
you may or may not be able to do that because it may have lost consciousness alright but we'll put down warm drink if possible
raise the temperature of the room
if it's unconscious you can't do that you'd UNK it
raise the temperature of the room
mouth to mouth don't you
and UNK the baby
you would give it mouth to mouth if it was dead if its heart had stopped beating
if you find a baby er you'd pick it up it's sort of very erm UNK you can't UNK it and it's got bright red UNK and feet and you realize that it's cold what are you going to do immediately
UNK it
UNK it right it's wrapped up in about six layers of erm whatever are you just going to pick it up and UNK it or are you going to do anything with all those layers
take
take into the room temperature and take the covers off
you've got a number of things here you would take off the outer layer and you would bring it close to your body if you if you just pick it up with lots of layers around it you're UNK it aren't you to keep it cold so you UNK it close to your body right and you remove outer layers of UNK melanie said something about room temperature right you raise the room temperature okay
what else would it be a good idea to do if you had something to do it with about the temperature
you'd want to know
take its temperature
yes take the ta baby's temperature that this way you know whether the UNK falling or going up don't you
and you can report that because this baby's going to need to go to hospital right so those are the three things you do you raise the room temperature erm you UNK the baby close to your own body which should be warm removing any excess layers you can then wrap a blanket around yourself and the baby if you can give it a warm drink but you may not be able to do that you take the baby's temperature and you seek medical advice right is that quite clear
that's very similar to the straightforward UNK that you'd might find in an old person or somebody who's in a in a UNK field all night have you all got that
yeah
but of course better than treatment we have prevention don't we
what can we do to prevent this situation from arising
quite a lot of things right melanie
what temperature would you like
about
shall we say seventy degrees fahrenheit
what's that in normal
what's that in
we're asking you
twenty five no
is twenty five a bit hot
yeah
no UNK
isn't it eighteen or twenty
yes i think you're right actually shall we put shall we put twenty
go on then
er it's important to keep that constant twenty four hours a day there's a danger area when new born babies are actually put into their own rooms particularly in the winter if they're in the room with their with their parents and the room temperature falls very low the parent's likely to notice and get cold themselves which means they'll pay attention to the baby if the baby is far end of the house up the north end where the UNK blowing right er what else can we do to keep the baby warm
blankets and clothing
right what about blankets and clothing
well not too much
right
not one big thing
yeah lots of small things
not one big thing lots of little layers
several layers lots of fairly thin layers why is that warmer than one thick layer
because it UNK the
it UNK air between each layer
it UNK the air between the layer the layer and air is a good UNK alright
so several UNK warmer than one thick one
what else about the UNK that you use
celia what about the UNK that you might use for a baby
which are the natural UNK
cotton
there's another one to keep very warm
silk
silk in actual fact UNK of UNK and natural UNK are very good because they give the warmth of the natural UNK plus the erm UNK properties of the UNK which wash and last well okay but natural UNK are much warmer
what else might you do
what should you do
what other things is the baby exposed to it might make it cold
UNK
UNK very good make sure the baby's not in a UNK can you think of anything else
damp
keep a baby in like a warm baby UNK
babies should have their nappies changed regularly because when they become wet they give off heat don't they
oh yeah
right the
the same way as when they UNK and they're maybe a little bit sick their clothing gets damp it acts as a conductor of warmth so it will cool them and it will make them sore as well so keep the baby dry as possible
now these are all things that you should be doing with the baby all the time anyway aren't they
yeah
the good care there's one other thing that we talked briefly about in the signs and symptoms and what happened that you could check for you look at a baby what else do you do
touch
right what would you touch
the feet
the feet
right so you touch its UNK and if you feel that its little feet are lovely and warm you know that it's alright okay
you touch the UNK the hands and feet you can keep the head covered as well particularly when you take the baby out
other things you can do when you put a baby into its bed you can make sure the UNK warm can't you
you could have UNK it up with a hot water bottle or a heat pad don't leave it there with the baby in it but you can certainly warm the bed first you can warm the baby's clothes keep them in the UNK cupboard or lots of houses around here have UNK don't they
you can warm them up on the UNK okay
obviously cold injury is far more common when would you expect cold injury to be common
in a temperature of maybe erm
er right what about seasonal
right winter babies are more susceptible and small
okay
do you want to pass a chair up sarah and UNK
sarah you'll need to get all this information from somebody else
right
are there any questions about that
does it worry anybody
we're going to go on to what used to be called club foot which is a fairly gross word right
how do you pronounce that UNK
UNK
UNK
the er main word for that is club foot what does that mean does anybody like to tell me
we saw it at the hospital
did you
right
what did melanie can you tell us what you did then
it's when the UNK twisted round it won't stay square
it can be it can be two types of what can it be do you know
it can either be fixed or it can be mobile we'll go on to that i've actually drawn you four pictures not very good pictures
UNK
there you are you think of that as your foot this one is where the foot erm goes UNK can you see
that one that's the big toe is where the foot actually is twisted UNK this one is where the foot is UNK under and that i've put in red because it's the most common sort very common that is where the foot is forced up and that one is where it looks as though it's standing on its toes
those are the more or less the five variations on a theme
what problems do you think club foot UNK might cause
shoes
delays walking doesn't it
can't walk
difficulty walking
delays growth and walking doesn't it
if you have sorry
delays growth and development and walking
certainly delays walking that earlier development
if you had this type you wouldn't actually be able to walk properly at all would you
wouldn't be able to walk
oh no
want to draw them all do you
oh yeah
no
yeah
can you quickly stick it up please
is a foot UNK present at birth right present at birth it doesn't happen afterwards it happens it's caused before the baby's born and it's more common in boys can be one or both foot feet
how do you think it might be caused
if the mother's had UNK or something
bad feet UNK in the stomach
UNK position yes what sort of UNK position
wow
breach
if it's been if the baby's sort of UNK
the feet have been bent up the feet have been UNK and bent up
so it's caused by UNK position and there's something that can make it worse you know the mother erm inside erm the womb there's a bag of fluid that the baby UNK in
yeah
right if there isn't very much of that fluid there's very little fluid there'll be more pressure on the baby won't there
because the fluid acts as a kind of UNK
so i've written too little UNK for them a wonderful word which is actually the proper word called UNK
that's wonderful
UNK fluid you all know what that is don't you
yeah
if i write this on the board i'll break it down for you because it's a word you may well see sorry about that
cathy
yeah
what does that say too little
UNK
pardon
you know that word
it's UNK
UNK yeah that's erm the fluid that the baby UNK in UNK fluid UNK
i've never heard of that
have you not heard it
no
pe if you haven't heard you've all heard of UNK fluid put that then
what's the other one
how do you spell that UNK
i was going to write it on the board for you
what's the other one
it's all one word but i'll write it
what one
UNK
that is water isn't it
hydro is water
yeah
UNK fluid and UNK means not much
oh
and that's the medical word for it draw write it in a line
not much UNK fluid
sorry i've left a bit out
that's what it means
can you see that
it's quite a common event in and it can be two types it can be either fixed or flexible if it's fixed it means the foot is in a position that you can't move out of if it's flexible it means that the baby has its foot like that but you can actually rotate it
UNK
but it will go back to the same position as that
yes would they go back to the same position quite right sarah
when do babies start to walk
it could be er
between what ages
nine to a year
nine months yeah to what
eighteen months or eighteen
behave
right if babies actually don't walk normally until they're between nine months or eighteen months to two years
when you walk you wait there for the first time don't you
yeah
until that time a baby won't hurt its feet in a walking position they'll be fairly mobile won't they if you think about it and how does a baby hold its feet when it's UNK
when a baby's UNK how does it hold its feet
like that
right they go out behind don't they
yeah
have any of you been on placements where mums have been really quite worried about their baby's feet and asked questions
no
no
lots of mums will ask about their baby's feet do you think there's anything wrong with this and they'll sort of be holding their feet sort of UNK them around doing this that and the other
that's disgusting innit
and they'll get very worried and it's quite a difficult area because you have to be on the look out for something that's not right but you don't want people to get er very worried because those feet are going to be very mobile and doing non walking thing until the child walks they're also very fat and UNK aren't they little UNK feet
and they have very short toes
UNK
what i would say if there's any doubt if a mother has any doubt about her baby's feet she should see the doctor and he will refer if he thinks necessary so most UNK feet can look quite odd at times and they will hold them in strange positions
what's pigeon UNK
pigeon UNK is where you actually walk with your toes like that isn't it
move over a bit i can't see
what would you do for pigeon toes kelly
do what
for pigeon toes
what's the best treatment for pigeon UNK
i had that and my mum sent me to ballet classes
that's the answer ballet classes
really yeah that's what my mum did
because er train trains them the girls and the boys to turn their toes out which is what we require in our society i believe
right keep notes er we're not talking about pigeon toes we're talking about club foot which is a real problem if we don't treat this the baby when it grows up it's gonna have difficulties in walking
what do you think the treatment might be
they
that's right that's one treatment
have physiotherapy done
if the foot melanie could you give us of the jenny in the plaster room
yeah
how old was the child
some of them were like babies the little babies
yeah some of them
and some of them are quite like about seven or
really that big
alright fair enough if the if the UNK is mobile that means you can move it you can actually do a lot of UNK and physiotherapy and that can work very well
what would happen is that the UNK would actually train the mother to do it she would show her what exercises need to be done and they have to be done almost constantly several times a day and whenever there's a spare moment so therefore it's not feasible for it to be done in a hospital is it
and then the mum would bring the child back up regularly for assessment to make sure that it was satisfactory
if it's fixed that means that you can't move it or it's very UNK it's not going right they do UNK and plaster of paris as some of you have seen
how do the children react to having these UNK put on their feet
some of them
they don't like it
coming off was the worse
they thought it was gonna cut through their leg
if for instance if extremely UNK or plaster of paris UNK are used and treatment should be started as soon as possible after birth so the sooner you notice these things the better you've all had your hospital experience has anybody not actually seen a child with erm club foot
you all seen one
i haven't
i don't think so
does anybody know whether they had one when they were a child
i had my foot was in that way
i had one that
what treatment did you have
it sort of sorted itself out did it
no i had a few things done but
you probably had the physiotherapy and the
your mum
i don't i'd have to ask her
well you wouldn't remember would you
can you take one of these each and just read it through
what does it say after
what does it say after what
as soon after birth as possible
cathy
right have you have you read that
no not yet
just read it through are there any question
right so that's looked for at birth what's the other thing they check for at birth
well they check a number of things but sarah do you know what they're looking for
erm where the ball isn't in the socket properly or it doesn't
UNK hips
right UNK hips right does anybody know what the proper name for it is
UNK
UNK of the hip
hip UNK
that means you're born with it right
you all know what UNK is of the hips and this is another condition which should be spotted at birth soon after
i've drawn some pictures just to show you what happens
are we gonna get a leaflet on this or not
cathy do we need to draw these
well if we UNK of the hips
cathy do we have to draw these pictures
erm i think i've got a picture for you no you needn't but you need
right thank you
you need to look carefully alright
liked to pull that down that's a normal hip joint this is your UNK with the socket joint right socket this is your leg bone the UNK with the head of the UNK at the top and it looks like that and they fit into one another and it forms a very good swinging joint you can do all sorts of things with your hip joint can't you
you can swing your leg round move it UNK it's a simple ball and socket joint and it's used in engineering quite a bit isn't it
is it
oh so the head of the UNK locks into this socket this UNK this UNK and it's held what's it held with
UNK
tissue
yeah what sort of tissue
well erm
UNK
muscles and what else
UNK
not really no it's held by muscles and UNK hello graham i have told them that you're coming this is graham
morning
right he's coming to learn about UNK hips so this is a normal hip joint and you can see that the socket is well into the UNK isn't it
yeah
right this red thing here is just the lining of the socket joint right is that clear
yeah
happy about that
the one underneath shows us what happens if the hip is UNK or loose
urgh
right got your socket joint the same but you can see the head of the UNK is not inside it is it
how does that happen
that's a very good question there's a number of reasons for it happening erm it might be that the UNK the socket bit is very shallow like a shallow tea cup and the hip the leg bone doesn't stay in it properly does that make sense to you
yeah
big one it might be that the muscles and UNK are weak
cathy surely if it's like you know said that would be too big to go in there anyway
no not
you said that was too shallow so it didn't fit in how can it be UNK
erm well what i what happens i think that's good it's act it's not it's not inside because it's UNK it's not inside because it's held in there by the socket joint if i draw you a picture it's not because the socket joint is so tight it can't fall out is that what you're saying to me
no you said that it was you said that because it was not always in there maybe because the UNK too shallow
so how can it be fixed if that's too small to put it in
so how can you put it back in if that's too shallow
because it would it would slide back in and it's actually held in by muscles and UNK right
so it doesn't matter that it's too shallow
it makes it easier for it to fall out when a woman is pregnant in the last few months of pregnancy she produces lots of UNK which relax the muscles in her body don't they
mm
do you remember doing this
muscle UNK during pregnancy these get into the baby as well and it relax the baby's muscles and they would relax these UNK and muscles around the hip joint which means that the hips can be not as they should be alright
so the causes are the socket might be too shallow or the UNK or muscles might be too loose
is there writing on the sheet as well
yes
should no do we have to write it
i would write it down if i were you yes right and things like a breach delivery what's a breach delivery
feet first
bum upwards
if you think about a baby coming out bottom first it can't do very much for its hips can it
really gives them a good old UNK and a push
ooh
and then somebody comes and UNK it by the legs and pulls it
ah
there are various types of breach delivery you can come out one foot first two feet first or you can come out with your legs actually up against your face in which case there's terrible UNK on the hips alright and all that will cause UNK so you can see the difference can't you
that socket inside of the hip joint held together nicely with er
muscles and UNK and this one not in at all properly
all it is where the head of the UNK is not correctly UNK in the hip socket and the proper name for the hip socket you'll see in your books is UNK this is definitely a condition which is familiar as a UNK a family tendency and if you think about it if you have a big hip socket your children are likely to have big hip UNK it's a family
family tendency it affects more girls than boys many more girls than boys having said that lord UNK had erm UNK hips
who's he
is he
it's about one in fifteen hundred
birth and as we've said before it is often found in UNK presentation like a breach bottom first
to spot this what procedure is carried out
examination and UNK
yeah
do you know what they do
they rotate the hips all babies are UNK examined at delivery and they'll find quite a number i would of babies with slightly UNK hips the reason for that is because of the UNK that have er are in the baby's body to relax all the muscles those will go away after a few days so when they're re checked at twelve days a number of the UNK they heard originally will no longer be there
and what they do i'm going to try and show you on this UNK in a minute the hips are UNK which means they're brought right up against the chest and then they're pulled round and they're UNK in the socket and you feel and listen for a click
what does it say in green cathy
feel and listen
no the above one
observe talk about that in a minute
there are other signs that might lead you to believe that there's things not as they might be the legs may not be equal length particularly if only one is UNK and that's fairly obvious isn't it because the ball UNK not in the socket and there's a bigger gap so the leg UNK down longer and you've all changed a baby haven't you and you see that they've got little UNK in the UNK of their legs and across their UNK and those UNK may not be a mirror matching they are normally so those are clues
can i turn that off
i've brought a UNK to show you if you'd like to see what they do when they rotate UNK hips would you all like to see that
yes
one UNK out of the cupboard
do you want to come up round
i'll explain it to you if you've got to stand in a circle because you can't see from over there you won't actually ever do this yourself but you may well see it being done in fact you probably will
people who do this are actually given a training this doesn't hurt the baby they don't mind their bones are very soft you'll look at your baby all of you can look at babies that you're caring for and you hold them and you see well is that leg longer than the other
i think this one is definitely longer than the other right so hold its legs down
you look for the UNK if you look at this UNK is UNK beautifully UNK and you can see that the UNK almost match each other you turn the baby over and there's lots of little UNK and they match can you all see that
can't see
right you then get your baby you'll see the UNK doing this you UNK the baby UNK because otherwise it will just sort of go all over the place won't it and this UNK is fairly fixed it's not a very soft thing like a baby and you with your hand you put your finger which is about the same length as the baby's finger isn't it
if you think about it you slide it into where the joint would be along the line of the UNK bone you bend the knee up and you pull it right up and you rotate it
UNK
and you bring it down and if there's anything wrong you'll feel it slowly so that it may click you do one side and then the other right the old fashioned treatment for erm UNK hip was double nappies er do you know what that
give it more support
you're actually UNK the legs out aren't you
right and if you UNK the legs out like that
UNK
you're actually
doing UNK there
you're actually pushing the head of the UNK back into the joint
and the modern treatment is they put babies in UNK they lay them on like frames from UNK and they're UNK into them and they stay in them from anything up to a year and babies don't mind but if you if you think about it if you do a double UNK
very UNK
you're actually putting a great thick wedge between the baby's legs
cor
and you're
got a bloody
innit
and you're actually partly doing that aren't you
my sister had it when she had
oh did she
what happened to your sister
oh she's alright she just had double nappies on for a very long time
and they weren't UNK were they
no they were UNK
right so the UNK are the best things any questions about that
you'll probably see that being done and you may well see some babies in a UNK
so the treatment is double UNK if it's not a very er serious one or if they notice a click just after delivery they would immediately put the baby in double nappies
if it's diagnosed as erm leaving treatment there's a variety of UNK that frames that you lie the baby on strap them in and they remain in that position with their legs
alright don't do it again cathy
like that
okay that's how they are
they're not uncomfortable they get used to it
used to it god
you all see six month old babies putting their feet in their mouths haven't you
they don't it doesn't bother them at all right they're used under
supervision and they're used until the head of the UNK right the head of the UNK is fixed back into the socket joint and the muscles and UNK have tightened up so that they hold the bone in place and treatment can go on until they're about a year the consequences of not treating this condition are quite severe the child will grow up with a very odd UNK
UNK
if you if you are standing like this and you pick up one foot you will slightly raise your UNK on the opposite side won't you
do you want to try that
no not particularly
stand up
pick up pick up your right foot what happens to your UNK does it go up a bit
yeah
right somebody with UNK of the hip the hip will UNK down it will cause them great difficulty and they have a UNK and they'll walk like this and if you look at african women a lot of them have UNK of the hip when they UNK
cathy
because it's not treated
what does erm that blue writing the third line down
last word
right
keep going
this is used until the UNK head of UNK head and the UNK which is that
socket joint have grown because they will grow they both get bigger and the muscles and UNK hold them firmly together right so that the hip no longer slides out of its joint
it's essential that that's treated
can we have another look at it please
you have a
sorry i've got a little handout for you with bits of information and there's also a picture of a breach presentation and this baby has got its feet right up into its high socket
can i take this down
yeah
are there any questions about that
is it quite clear what happens why and how it's treated
yeah
sorry i missed the whole what did she say
cathy when i was in hospital in er a physiotherapy bit where they where they brought children in erm there was this little girl and like she was riding round on a little bike you know so she's quite old and she had er in UNK but her legs were like out at the side and her feet were pointing down and they're pointing up i'm just a bit confused
well this is a fixed UNK isn't it
yeah well they would go down wouldn't they
and she might well hold her because but when you say quite old what do you mean
well she is
was she seven or was she
oh no about three something like that she wasn't a baby what i meant
she she's about three right fine okay she's got past UNK stage if you see if she was three and her feet were in UNK did she UNK she didn't wait there did she
no it was in er in was in like a plaster of paris thing
right so she couldn't actually walk
no she was riding a little bike
she could UNK
no she was had her feet on the ground
oh right
they were straight
her feet
her legs she couldn't bend the legs
her legs were out to the side like that
yes
and when she walked they were sort of
right so she was like a UNK
like that
oh no you're talking about
i can't describe it she had her legs were out to the side but they were pointing down like that
yes that's right well that's a baby that's a baby that will be like that but she's older so her legs would be she would be in that position wouldn't she
because she's an older child
but is it because they left it too late or something then
erm it sounds a bit UNK if she's three and she's in a hip plaster yes or a UNK
yeah it was a plaster it was a plaster
yeah but every case is different you don't i mean she might of been in some car accident or something like that you see mightn't she
mm she might of been i don't think she was but
there are you know there are yeah occasionally they aren't diagnosed very unfortunate
look at this position my rubber when about six days after baby's born they take erm blood erm don't they from the heel do you remember that
what's it called
the birth blood test
named after a person by the name of UNK it is initially used to diagnosed what
can you remember
do you know
brain damage or something
UNK isn't it
somebody mentioned this to me the other day
p k u
UNK
p k u have you all heard of p k u
yes
what is it
we're going to find out
i've said it about four times
what is it
the proper word is come from a very long word a real UNK known as p k u for short p u and mr UNK developed this test specifically to UNK this condition but in nineteen ninety two there are other conditions which they UNK at the same time with the same blood test do you know what they are
no that's obvious because this is after the baby's born
oh right
something that you may not notice at birth
is it brain damage
this will cause brain damage
oh that's right
another dis another disorder
UNK
an awful word which is used in the english language UNK have you heard of this awful word UNK
no it's horrible
UNK is used as a term of abuse isn't it
yeah
right in actual fact UNK is a medical condition where there's lack of UNK and this is found this is tested for at birth as well so we don't have any UNK in our society because they're all treated the other thing they check for do you know what it is
UNK you've all heard of that haven't you
yes
a very nasty disorder which causes
so after these tests and we did this last year check the p k u UNK and UNK we're going to look at p k u today right erm what it is rub that off
can i just can i just erm
that please write it rather
is that done at birth then that blood test is the blood test done at birth
it's done at six days
excuse me cathy excuse me
the proper name for UNK is UNK which means UNK is not enough as in UNK means UNK it's the three things they check for can i pull that down
yeah
does anybody know what p k u is caused by
don't know
has anybody got any idea
no
it's actually caused by an UNK in the UNK system to break down an essential food that we eat so there's one type of food that the body cannot use and this body this component this food substance turns to a poison and causes severe damage to the individual who's affected
do you remember doing your di UNK assignments last year
yes
and protein is made up of a number of what can you remember
amino acids
yes lovely amino acids right it's one particular amino acid there are eight essential amino acids and it's one of these and it's called UNK you don't have to remember that it's very difficult to remember
the body cannot use it
what was it
but it's essential to the body to have it
the result is a what a rise in it or
right this results in a rise
a rise
of the substance UNK it the level rises up in the blood it's a bit like UNK a jug if you have a quarter pint jug and you have a pint of milk when you get to the top you don't stop pouring it UNK out the edge and in the body it actually goes into the body UNK nowhere else to go and it causes a UNK result it causes UNK mental development it causes gross UNK
it causes UNK physical development now you've all seen a downs syndrome person haven't you
mm
and you know they have a very UNK characteristic don't they have round faces and they're short and they have slightly UNK eyes etcetera well these children have very marked physical erm appearance they're fair UNK and blue UNK the reason for that is that this substance UNK is responsible for the production of UNK so if that's UNK with they're going to be fair UNK and blue UNK they get UNK a lot they have small heads and they have very widely UNK teeth sorry down a bit is that what you want
no i thought you was you were reading them off as you
no i'm not i'm just telling you
oh right
so they their physical appearance is very marked they're fair UNK blue UNK erm they get UNK they have small heads and very widely UNK teeth a bit like a UNK and they have they have general ill health they're not very well people
oh excuse me
now when they're born there won't be any problems at all and that's to do with the way they feed before they're born how's a baby fed before it's born
from the UNK
it gets all its UNK all its oxygen etcetera through the UNK from its mother's circulation and the mother has no problem whatsoever in her body functions right otherwise she would be a UNK so the food is going straight into the baby it's like being drip fed there's no problem
when the baby is born what is the baby fed on
milk
milk after the baby is born the first time the baby actually has to digest its own food it has to process the food that it takes in what's in milk
what UNK substance
calcium
calcium
calcium protein
iron
fat right
fat
a lot of fat in milk so there's protein in milk and in protein you will find this amino acid that the baby can't UNK can't use
so it's only after several days that this will build up in the blood does that make sense to you do you realize now why tests is not done until six days
yeah
if you do it at birth you won't find anything wrong
cos it hasn't had a chance to
you do it after six days when the baby's been taking milk you may well find something wrong
if the baby's fed on water or for some reason does not take food normally you may not find the problem but a few days after milk feed this substance will begin to rise and it can be protected so the diagnosis is made by a test does anybody know how the UNK test is done
the heel
stab the heel and they drip the blood out onto a piece of UNK paper and it UNK and they send it to the laboratory and they punch it out and they examine it and they test it
right so diagnosis UNK blood test at six days when milk feeding is established
the incidence is one in ten thousand so it's pretty rare but UNK these children will grow up very seriously mentally UNK very poor quality of life and enormous stress on their families when they could of been nearly normal right so the cause is one of these essential amino acids which is UNK protein so what's the treatment
give them some
eh
give it to them the amino acid
give it to them give them what
whatever it is that they're UNK in
if this if this erm essential amino acid is found in all protein what foods do we have that have got protein in
fish
fish
vegetables
dairy products
dairy products
eggs dairy produce meat UNK right
if everything you give them that's got protein in and it's going to make their condition worse what have you got to do
don't give
don't give them anything with protein in
right no protein
how they gonna grow
what do they do then
how they gonna grow
yeah
with great difficulty
we've got a problem haven't we
eh
the aim of the treatment is to keep the blood levels of this substance UNK as low as we possible can
and the treatment is very simple it's by diet and if these children are given appropriate diet they will grow up entirely normal as UNK able as anybody else
so the diet is to restrict the protein
there is a problem because this amino acid is essential and it's necessary for life so you've actually got to have some of it but if they have too much it will cause severe damage
so the diet is quite simple
when these babies are diagnosed there's a mad panic everywhere i can tell you phone calls everywhere people rushing round
treatment has to be started as soon as possible between two e too much UNK si all id
mm
doesn't their immune system cope with it or
sorry sarah
doesn't their immune system cope with it or not
their immune system would be quite normal right if they're not given the protein they're actually going to run into problems aren't they but we have to overcome that by other ways
there's nothing wrong with their immune system they're perfectly normal they just can't UNK this one particular type of protein so they have no milk no fish no meat no cheese
oh
very boring isn't it
they're allowed to have UNK amounts of UNK
urgh
vegetables UNK and they have specially prepared flour UNK biscuits bread and this is all erm provided on prescription
what would happen is the prescription would be written and they'd either get it from the chemist who would constantly have a stock coming in or the hospital
UNK urgh
very costly business all this but it's UNK preferable than having a severely mentally UNK child
do they survive for a long time
yes they will grow up we will go onto this they grow up totally normally and when they stop growing when do we stop growing
twenty
sixteen to eighteen years they can actually have a normal diet and they can begin to eat all these wonderful things okay
so this has to be continued until maturity is reached sixteen or seventeen years
it seems to be that only during the period of very rapid growth
so they go on like this till they get to late UNK and then they can have a reasonably normal diet having said that they need constant monitoring and they would also be very used to a diet with not very much of milk egg fish and cheese etcetera
they wouldn't be able to have UNK either just put that in there
are they healthy enough then
are they happy
healthy
healthy oh yes perfectly healthy
it would be very carefully calculated and they'd be given the right amount of the UNK that they could use to grow because in the first years of life there's very rapid growth and development isn't there
body repair and then they're given minute UNK amounts of the essential amino acid which would otherwise poison them they're given really tiny amounts of it to keep them healthy
are there any questions about that
cathy if they got some disease like i dunno something like i dunno cancer or something like that would they be more ill than normal
susceptible yeah
not necessarily no
just as ill as anybody else
in the past in the past these children would be so severely mentally handicapped that they couldn't lead a normal life but if your able to control this disease and bring them up UNK normal so that they're like everybody else they're going to have the same life expectation and hopes and aspirations as the best that's the best of us and what do women do when they get to the
they have children don't they
do you think that these women can actually have children
yeah but they might pass onto what they had to the child
that's a good question and that's quite interesting yes they can actually if a girl has this and she becomes pregnant she has to go back on to her low protein diet while she's pregnant in case her baby is affected right
what does that say
in female
normal life i'll read out to you normal life is possible if diet during childhood is UNK to in the female if the female suffers when she becomes pregnant the protein intake has to be monitored so as not to affect her developing baby
now in the past any child with p k u would of grown up mentally handicapped and would not of UNK itself wouldn't have children
today although there's still a problem area it's not a straightforward pregnancy today the boys are able to father children and the girls are able to have children which means you're actually going to increase the incidence of p k u into the community isn't it
alright
does that make sense to you
is it not erm does the baby get all what that it should get from the mother
is it UNK cathy
yes it is and underneath here i've actually written down you alright
p k u is definitely an inherited genetic disorder do you understand these charts
have you seen these charts before
no
no
right not very complicated mum dad right mum and dad have got a normal gene and a p k u gene right normal gene and p k u gene which means that they are carriers they carry the disease but they don't actually have it
that makes sense
do you understand that
right who's got brown eyes here
yes
who's got brown eyes but has got a mum or dad with blue eyes
got one blue one and one green one
right okay what we're saying here is that the mum and the dad are normal people they don't have any problems but they have got each of them have got UNK gene and they're going to have a family the first baby that they have gets two normal genes one from each parent you only get one gene from each parent UNK so that makes two genes so the baby has two genes right the first baby gets two normal genes right and that baby is normal which is very clear right so here we have written this baby is not p k u affected and is normal and doesn't actually carry the gene any more does that make sense to you
right second baby has a p k u gene from his mum and a normal gene from his dad and he is not affected but he is a p k u carrier right third baby gets a normal gene from his mum and a p k u gene from his dad and he's the same or she's the same p k u carrier but not affected unfortunately the last baby gets a p k u gene from mum and a p k u gene from dad and this baby has got p k u and that is a simple sort of exercise of how genetic disorders sometimes appear and sometimes don't
can i just write that yeah you're not just gonna take that down
does that make sense to you
yeah
or is that just
ask her to start again
so having four children one of them will have p k u but all the others won't they will be normal
yeah but you can't say that because i know someone with six children and they've
you're right UNK it you could have really bad luck and have all four children with p k u or you could have really good luck and none of them have p k u or you could have half and half that's just an example with each UNK pregnancy you stand a one in four chance those are all the possibilities but like throwing the UNK it comes up at random
is that it then cathy
what do you mean is that it
we have a break now
oh fine yes then you go to is it
isn't it ten past on friday
ten past
i was going to do i was going to do UNK blood disease with you but we'll do that on friday
shall i turn that off
you are here still going out
no
you're not now oh right okay that's fine the er what i want you to do instead of writing i mean two hundred words is probably feel nothing but in fact because we want er it to be absolutely right what i'd like you to do this time is just write an appraisal the contents thing er that we had last time we had if you like content and appraisal and audience but audience was only er a sentence or two i'd simply like a an appraisal what your view of this is if you're writing that part of the review so we're only thinking in terms of a hundred words now er what i'd like you to do is to distribute yourselves over the laboratory erm go wherever you want but don't start talking with people it's not the not the UNK thing i just want to get on with the exercise that i'm concerned with and write your appraisal but obviously put your name on it and er if we meet back here thirty five minutes is that long enough for under a hundred words of excellent quality
between er the best the best end of the scale ones which i would of thought if they'd been submitted to something like a general
were almost erm okay just like that i mean there were one or two very good ones i think there was one that was just about like that with the odd word and when an editor receives something like you know it's usually going to be something he wants to change very slightly erm that those were the best ones there were in general however you haven't yet got used to the idea of editing
i when i took them back and looked at them there were lots and lots of re er errors if you like that if you had really looked at them you could of picked out yourself
i mean if you're honest a lot of these were really first or second draft erm UNK i think and er you really got to get if you're going to submit something like this it has to be er it has to be absolutely UNK and you have to say exactly what it is that you want to say erm some of the criticism i've i'm not gonna mention people's names but i'm just remind myself er a whole lot of you for some reason erm con construct things in sort of note form i suppose this being UNK that helps this and but you construct things with single sentence paragraphs so that actually you get a whole list of sentences without any linking between them and that is terribly UNK reading and with an account like that when you've finished reading it you sort of have to shake your head and think well what did the person actually say and when it's actually looking for er a little bit of UNK the in addition some of your con your sentences are in UNK complex you start off in a sentence and you actually lose your way in the middle of it i mean the simple UNK much the better thing i mean i seem to remember being told by subject object verb in a sentence they must have those things well very often you'll have a sentence which starts with er a particular noun and as a subject and then finishes up with the same no noun or subject or maybe it's become the object of the sentence at the very end or maybe the sentence has totally lost it's way
and these are the kind of things really that you should be able to pick out because they just if you like they just sound wrong forgetting about how poor our knowledge of grammar may become over the years
er use of UNK erm often comes into these er these things the sort of well UNK er referring to the video isn't such a bad one because it's in quite common use but an awful lot of UNK words erm that people introduce er maybe i'll come across some in a moment
erm thank goodness for er modern technology i got them please don't all fax them up to the department er these UNK are very hard to read
some of the sentences there are extremely long some of you use capital letters UNK every sort of fourth word they're in UNK i don't understand why that should be
one or two of the excellent ones was spent was UNK by a little bit of er need to erm edit very carefully UNK introduction of concepts you must be careful not to if you've got a couple of hundred words only but don't introduce er concepts diversity of design must of been er a phrase picked up from the video itself because it appeared in two or three of them but it's no use talking about diversity and divine is it de design as if as if it's a concept which everybody else is going to understand
the teacher that reads your review that wants to know shall i buy that review hi hire that video rather or what am i going to use it for my class they are going to er want that information and they don't want er concepts introduced which they don't understand what is meant by it so be careful in that er erm we have species of bird the UNK which i think is a pub in
rare bird
this is very UNK some of us when er
i put on large number of them more editing is needed i think probably now going back oh change of UNK obviously something you have to watch out for
anyway since editing is the main problem what we're going to do this afternoon is actually i'm going to show you another video and again it's a very controversial one again it's used in teaching situations again it has a biased point of view in the sense that it's produced by national power er clearly as a p r job for introduction into schools erm and i want you to do the same exercise but this time i want us to edit them among ourselves and what i'm going to do is to get you to UNK write your reviews and then we'll divide into small groups while you're watching it i'll co i'll count how however many people we've got here we'll copy the reviews and in the same groups i want you to edit one another 's reviews and then er discuss them within the groups once you've once you've marked them so we'll get into the small we'll do the review we'll write the review and then we will er i distribute the you can go and have a cup of coffee while we copy them then we'll distribute them you can mark them er individually on your own and then we'll get into a group and you can criticize one another 's reviews we'll take them one at a time we'll probably be in groups of four okay but i'll see i'll see how many what the most suitable number is okay so if you would you be kind enough to that
it's the UNK
the UNK
UNK is the word UNK
well if you'd put the sound quality was poor i thought it better than UNK when it was when it should of said UNK
UNK isn't that what old UNK did in the weekend
yeah
it didn't work very well did it stuart
what's that
that didn't come out
the UNK
er
the UNK
no it didn't work that well
no and er i mean i can do i could read it so er but i did
it's a bit poor
it's a bit UNK yeah
sorry you were given
what are you carry on doing today
i mean do you want us to hand another one in
no well you founded the projects but apart from anything which are
right
yeah i realized that er my handwriting may not be desirable but er pardon
okay are you ready then with whatever notes you want to take
what's the video called
okay the UNK called electric UNK it was actually produced by er the UNK er central electricity generating board which doesn't actually now exist it's become the national power and nuclear electric hasn't it
erm and what it says on the UNK on the cover is that the power stations of england and wales are surrounded by UNK large areas of land which are often remote UNK and UNK by man
electric UNK looks at the surprising variety of plants and animals that have co UNK this land and that the efforts that are made to monitor and foster this wild life
the running time is twenty six minutes we might as well get that right we had er several people commenting on the running time of the other video but er people had different of estimates anything from fifteen to twenty five minutes
sorry you
no i was about to ask how long it was
yeah er right
power stations produce electricity for our homes and industry they're surrounded by thousands of acres of wild land this wild land has developed into some of the UNK most remarkable nature reserves for seven days a week twenty four hour a day routine at the power station can provide unique and also surprising cover for all kinds of wild life
power station fitter bill
they're built in remote places so you've got all the er wild life around them and then you've got er UNK which uses UNK and stuff like which kills off the UNK life and to birds all young and stuff like that
erm by having know that the land grows the weeds and no UNK not disturbed there's no shooting they're never shot around here the birds can come in sheltered you know they they're just like a little nature reserve protected area game park you know nothing shot at just left and er they like it obviously i mean it's like anything once it UNK that er it's gonna be left alone it comes again and again
it's living in harmony i suppose will be the word you know the environment sort of moves in to the power station and doesn't get attacked everywhere else gets attacked you know people scrub up the weeds in the garden and things like that here they're allowed to grow the UNK come in UNK great you know just love it
and bill loves the UNK he's a dedicated bird UNK although he hardly looks like it when servicing the huge UNK that turn coal into a fine powder for burning
this UNK coal is the fuel for the power station
like great coffee beans these machines must wind fifteen thousand tons of coal each day
seventy five per cent of britain's electricity is generated by coal fired power stations
not for much longer
ash is produced when the coal is burnt and has proved to be something for the salvation for many plants and animals the ash is so fine that it has to be turned into a UNK and put into the to settle out these can be up to eight years during which time it becomes none the less but an artificial mud flat quickly UNK by weeds UNK crucial to the complex way of life in our natural world but for bird UNK it is the bird that attracted to these artificial mud flats that are the most exciting development within the boundaries of these power station nature reserves
it'll soon be better for the power station management bill has built a hide to monitor the bird population
the reason we built it on this particular spot is this is the ash UNK from the UNK from the bottom there of the er power station and er it's contents of UNK dried out dried out and graded well once nice and flat like this it gives the bird an ideal opportunity to at high tide and they can see around there's no UNK it's very bad ground and er that is load of UNK a good numbers of er UNK they don't sometimes which is really nice and so easy to count them now cos when the tide is out and you've got the mud flats of course they're spread out now they're nicely UNK down here so it's great little position for us you know that's all courtesy of the bottom of the boiler you know you know give us this nice
hardly the UNK isn't all that UNK about its UNK site
this one has found a UNK hole in an UNK covering a UNK pipe to an oil fired power centre
such UNK can often been spotted because to the birds and animals a power station is simply a UNK often borne UNK from a hostile world
when one of the changes i'm trying to do at night is to make the nature reserve more attractive to all species
if i if i get another species next year UNK that hasn't UNK before and i know it's because of the effort of putting in UNK trees whatever i've put in there we're trying to get to nest here if they nest that'll be really er that'll be a great thing because er they feed on the apple erm i thought somebody said er who said there was a hundred a seventy five here er a week ago and that'd be great to get them to nest be really good
as the ash UNK hard it is dug out for sale for the construction industry yet another UNK is created with the layers of rock UNK over millions of years this soft ash forms perfect artificial gifts for UNK animals like rabbits for this young fox what better place to practise digging than a soft cliff of ash watched UNK by potential lunch another UNK not necessarily fond of the ash but very keen on the animals that it attracts is the UNK ferret once used by UNK many of these UNK hunters are now wild and range freely over the rough ground near power stations in search of UNK round at the top of the ash are the nest UNK of one of britain's UNK bird the sand martin the monitor of this power station has UNK special in there so the birds can find ideal nest sites
he's even arranged for holes to be UNK into the ash to give the sand UNK a head start these days secured nest sites for these beautiful birds are increasingly rare
this artificial ash cliff is perhaps one of their last UNK have also found UNK around our fire stations protected from UNK feet and sheltered from chemical UNK these rare plants UNK in the damp UNK margins alongside the ash UNK all this within the boundaries with just a few of the country's coal fired power stations but the need for sea walls of other coastal stations merely intake pipes to the UNK system another world teams this is not a plant fan UNK have UNK mouth parts used to filter food from the sea water other UNK use just two UNK to catch food UNK over closely packed sea the delicate bodies of these printed UNK work as tiny water pumps pulling water in one hole and pumping it through the other here two UNK feed in the gentle flow of water over the cooling pipes from the station marine life quickly packs the UNK structures and is about to become too thick and sometimes affect the performance of the machinery UNK belong to the same family as UNK and UNK but being in their adult life standing on their head which is fixed to the concrete they use their feet to filter the water and kick food into their mouths but if they can't move how do they get there so quickly in the first place
the answer is that after mating they produce a tiny mobile UNK totally different to the adult this might drift for miles on ocean current before settling into the fixed adult form down UNK power station in north wales UNK the electricity by pump storage in off peak hours thousands of gallons of water are pumped from a lower lake to an upper lake when the demand for electricity is high bowels are opened and water falls back through UNK to the lower lake again this UNK the power to ensure that the lower lake would never flood the was diverted through mile long tunnel in the mountain side no one knew for certain how the salmon the UNK and even UNK that used to migrate up the old river would cope with the UNK pitch darkness and slow flowing water
to find out a new research programme was started fresh water UNK doctor UNK
a lot of people some people well you should of and er many other people say that this wouldn't go through particularly them the going through the tunnel
the research team have travelled two kilometres into the tunnel to net the fish close to the intake checking the catch is an exciting moment
oh there's a UNK there's a lovely UNK here these lovely UNK er actually spend most of the time in big cold UNK and they're a they're a population in they normally respond in december from about december the second to the fifteenth and they've probably been isolated since fourteen thousand years ago with that every population has gone slightly different to the next one
later the catches are UNK in detail
well here are UNK for example this is a female you see the white line on the UNK and the very pale pink spots this will actually get gradually more highly coloured until about december when they will be quite bright red and in my opinion not a question really but might be that some of these other ones are pretty nice as well here's quite a quite a dark little UNK probably been in the light for quite a long time right now nevertheless that's a female as well just a couple more famous small ones here that's a young salmon that's really a beauty
these little thumb print things along the along the sides are called the marks and the down to the sea those marks disappear and you get this UNK appearance so it's very plain if you've got these that the salmon has been up there just in the upper which is exactly we had hope we had happened
female UNK and then thirty
as part of doctor 's research the UNK is UNK before being released back into the lake
when in the future later UNK the tab will help scientists piece together the life history of these ice age UNK doctor is to find out whether the UNK salmon are actually producing young in the upper reaches of the river UNK
to do this doctor and his team use specially made apparatus that UNK the young fish the research programme is continuing but the results so far are UNK just how well the salmon co exist with the high tech world of electricity production
there's some that are going up at the moment to this pond they develop them for the next three years to spend their life in the fresh water feeding and what we're trying to do here is to see just how many there are in the river er as a total
well what we do is we patch up all we can't a hundred yard stretch
we then mark them and release them again because we the UNK thing doesn't harm them in any way
this UNK of warm water produced by the cooling towers of the power station is as close as we'd come in britain to a tropical UNK
it's a vital part of the process of generating electricity
the water is nearly gone from a local river and of course is UNK before it passes through the tower fish as UNK or eggs inevitably get through UNK in the warm oxygen rich pond under the tower
on the rare occasions when the cooling towers are for maintenance the staff wait UNK to see what the pond UNK
today the catch includes UNK and fish associated with clear oxygen rich water now moving towards the maintenance
eventually a time of fish will be landed so the UNK work of life moves itself into the most unlikely corners of our power stations
but when the time comes to close this delicate balance between UNK efficient machinery and the secret world of nature can UNK the man made now nature takes over UNK by schedules or the UNK hurry into the night shift it UNK into the bare workings of the place and then it's not the rest of the world within a world
now UNK of the great UNK has UNK and new a workforce starts to earn its living
soon find their way into the building and settle down to rear their young within the of pipes
the UNK they create will need to contact flies which in turn will be to the UNK whose garden of UNK will soon UNK the windows
the flat roof becomes like any piece of bad a potential home for UNK weeds and UNK
more UNK and a seed quickly becomes established in cracks on the UNK in future years even UNK trees will be in a UNK to these UNK power stations stands firm and proud as it slips and UNK into UNK
that's them go in there
but the circular life is the start of natural history as the years turn towards UNK birds will give a clue to the success of the UNK earlier in the year
this nest set up on the flat lands beyond the power stations on the south east coast will provide the evidence to bill and his bird watching colleagues it's not only the UNK that fly at night UNK will feed at any time but the rising tide will force them to leave the mud flats day or night
bird in the bag a hundred and nine take her out right ring UNK time
time now time is
ten past two what is it two at ten
ring number
er o five
yeah it's been there for quite a while
his job is so delicate that to ring birds like this bill has had to train for two years under the UNK eye of a UNK
well er a possibility innit
oh yeah
quite possible a wedding ring for the bird a hundred and thirty
this is quite a nice bird
yeah
and er a nice white UNK on it on the wing we'll put him back into the UNK shall we
with that we'll see if we've got any more it's er have to go down here which has got a bit of light still some birds moving around and the birds calling go and check the UNK now
we're gonna let this one go down the slide until it runs off there he goes the UNK gone
it was only now that appreciate what nature has known all along
the plants birds and animals here in UNK and stable environmental conditions to fly
do not care whether the pipes in our power stations help generate power to support human civilization
as far as they're concerned these places are a home safe and free of danger
okay well now what i would like you to do please er because we've only got a limited amount of time er incidentally some of you still haven't divide collecting er a small group going with peter i
we are still going
right coming in
thanks very much
okay we looked last time at the development of the kuomintang and nationalist china after the nineteen twenty five twenty seven revolution and i said then that the defeat of that revolution had a profound affect on the character of the kuomintang and the character of the nationalist china over which it UNK
exactly the same is true of the chinese communist party
the chinese communist party is totally UNK i think UNK out of all recognition and becomes a completely different kind of political organization as a result of what happens in nineteen twenty five to seven
and to understand that change i want to go back to the beginning and just to trace what has happened to the chinese communist party since it was formed in nineteen twenty one when it had a mere i hope everybody can see that it's not very large today and i don't think i can any better than that in nineteen twenty one when it was first founded it had a mere fifty seven members and it didn't grow very much for a number of years
by the middle of nineteen twenty three there were only three hundred members of the party
by the middle of nineteen twenty five only a thousand members
then of course the revolution UNK broke out originally in UNK with the main and thirtieth movement subsequently spreading to UNK and UNK kong and other major er cities in the south and east of china
and then the communist party began to grow very dramatically
by the end of the first year of revolution they had ten thousand members so they erm increased in size ten times in the space of about six months
by the middle of nineteen twenty six they had thirty thousand members and then they UNK in the early part of nineteen twenty seven with sixty thousand members
now that is actually a very large organization indeed given th the size of the chinese working class
something like think i've got it here yes something like fifty percent class of
the members are actually industrial workers
the rest of the members are UNK er and students primarily
now that means that at the peak the communist party has a working class membership of something like thirty thousand plus which is one in every hundred industrial workers in china at this time
that is a pretty substantial er party given that the communist party is essentially a party of working class UNK of shop stewards of trade union UNK and so on
that means it has really very substantial influence indeed inside the chinese working class
it controls many trade unions including some of the big UNK most UNK the UNK general labour union a sort of t u c really erm for don't know whether it would bear much relation to the modern t u c in britain the erm the sort of UNK all of the unions in UNK controlled by the communist party
and so were many other major unions and union UNK
this party is then very substantially er destroyed not completely but very largely destroyed by the nineteen twenty seven coup and the repression which follows it
there are large numbers of UNK lots of people are er taken off to prison many people in fear and despair and UNK drop out of the communist party it's particularly dangerous to be a communist party member in the major cities where the repression is most intense and where the security forces er are most numerous
but the destruction of the old communist party is completed by two policies that are adopted by the communists themselves both a response to the defeat they have suffered in nineteen twenty seven
first of all there is the adoption by the communist party in the years nineteen twenty seven to nineteen thirty of an UNK left policy
a policy which consists essentially of UNK that no major UNK has been suffered that the revolutionary movement is still going forward that there will be new major revolutionary UNK in the immediate future
and in pursuit of that perspective that outlook the communist party launched a series of what can only be described as ad UNK er attacks on the new kuomintang authorities
the autumn harvest UNK for example in the autumn of nineteen twenty seven which UNK of attempts to lead peasant UNK erm in various parts of the countryside particularly in the area er around here er UNK see and so on where the peasant associations had been particularly strong
such as the UNK where down here in er UNK perhaps the second major industrial city in china the communists rose in revolt erm and attempted to establish erm a kind of red base in the city of UNK
but they rose on their own with virtually no support at all amongst ordinary workers it was essentially a rising carried out exclusively by the communist party members themselves
such as the attack which they mounted from the countryside of the city of UNK which is also in this er in the same sort of area where the old er where the communist party had its main strength
all of these military UNK are UNK very quickly usually in a matter of days
large numbers of the communist party members who have risen almost in complete isolation against overwhelming odds large numbers of them are actually killed in the fighting many more of them are arrested and UNK and in this way the destruction of the communist party particularly in the major cities is to a very large extent completed by their own mistakes
instead of UNK instead of going underground instead of accepting that the situation had become extremely difficult and it was necessary to try and rebuild their organization and their influence gradually over a period of time they committed their UNK forces to further battles and more or less completed er their destruction
why
well for two reasons
one i think because the communist party in china itself was completely UNK by defeat
right up until the coup in nineteen twenty seven they had been following a policy dictated by moscow dictated by UNK which told them form UNK with the kuomintang work with the kuomintang first of all trust UNK then when UNK turned on them they were told to trust the left kuomintang leaders who were based in wo UNK in the middle UNK and then they turned on them a policy in other words that had proved absolutely disastrous
then confronted with the UNK of the defeat which the party had suffered many members were completely i incapable of understanding er what had gone on were UNK by the defeat they had suffered and were open to the argument the strategy was right all along the revolution is still going forward there are going to be new UNK by the masses and so on and so forth
a complete UNK among the ordinary membership
but into this situation there is the intervention again of moscow of UNK
UNK policy has changed dramatically
up until nineteen twenty seven he's been saying work with the kuomintang work with the UNK nationalists work with the parties to your right
at the end of the nineteen twenties the policy from moscow not just to the chinese communist party but actually to communist parties all over the world UNK dramatically to the left and UNK is arguing that there's there are going to be revolutionary UNK all over the world the communist party must UNK its own path it must put itself at the head of these UNK it must give a lead to the masses by launching UNK and so on and so forth
why has the policy changed
it's changed partly because UNK er strategy in china has been shown to be a disaster and UNK is trying to cover his tracks and most effective way of protecting himself against the criticism and the UNK which is likely to come from the failure is by UNK that the strategy was right all along and the revolution is about to UNK
he's also changing tack because in nineteen twenty nine in russia they begin the collectivization of agriculture the destruction of the UNK the rich peasants the adoption of the policy of forced industrialization
to justify this and UNK presents it as a revolutionary me measure as a shift to the left as the creation of socialism to justify it er UNK presents the argument that the whole world is moving forward to a new stage on the road to socialism it's all a lot of nonsense but the ideological needs of the regime in russia are determining the advice which is being given to er various communist parties
the second er factor which really by the UNK own decision completed the destruction of their organization in the cities and towns of er south and east china was the decision in the early nineteen thirties by large numbers of surviving communist UNK to leave the cover to er leave the cities and the towns where the repression was severe where it was very difficult to avoid being picked up er by the police
to escape that by UNK into the countryside very often into particularly backward and UNK areas of the countryside where they would be safe from the security forces and where they hoped they could begin to create a new base among the peasantry
so not only do we see a physical flight to the countryside but also a change in political outlook
an orientation now among many of these UNK no longer on the working class but on the peasantry and on developing the struggle of the peasantry as a way of creating a base a new base er for the communist party in the countryside
now at this point i want to sort of take a break from looking at the development of the communist party to looking briefly at the peasantry because although the peasantry have been in the background for much of the time we haven't actually looked in any detail so far at the condition of the peasantry in china
and their role is now absolutely crucial to the development of a new strategy by the communists and to the revolution of nineteen forty six to forty nine
the poverty of the chinese peasantry was i mean really for us i it's very difficult to imagine how appalling conditions were
there had been for one thing enormous population growth i'll put the figures up for you the population had roughly UNK er between seventeen hundred and eighteen fifty and then in the period we're primarily concerned with here the hundred years from eighteen fifty to nineteen fifty have increased from four hundred and thirty million up to five hundred and eighty million
now that meant that there was UNK increasing pressure on UNK land and there was growing UNK of the land and what was happening was that peasant families would of very often er produce two or three sons
could i just ask a question about that
what was the reason for the growth between eighteen hundred and eighteen fifty because they hadn't had sort of mass industrialization which had caused population growth in other countries so was there any particular reason why there's should have UNK in that time
i think that's a good question
and what's the answer
yes i mean i don't think anybody really knows
erm there are various er theories to explain it erm and i mean usually if there is a significant population increase and that is a very dramatic increase indeed it is associated with increases in productivity
and yet quite clearly there have been no significant increases in the productivity of chinese agriculture and certainly no large scale industrialization
so why the population should have been growing on this scale i think is er a question that we can't answer very easily
could it be that the statistics in seventeen hundred were wrong
that er well the kind of census
i suspect not
in seventeen hundred
erm and what makes me suspect not is that UNK chinese record keeping for many centuries had been very thorough of course because it's the basis of the imperial taxation system so my guess is that the figures are probably fairly reliable
were they receiving er more produce from their UNK parts of empire
you know w was there more agricultural er produce coming in to make er their food supply better
well t i mean to the extent that is happening that there is a development of trade on the sort of you know with the UNK of the empire and with erm areas outside the empire and that was certainly happening in this period i don't see why it should have a significant impact on the peasant population because there isn't really any evidence that it's in a sense UNK down and UNK the peasantry
there's no er evidence of a significant increase in the UNK standard of living quite the reverse in this period
so again it may be a factor but it's probably not the most significant
so by the peasantry we they represent purely the people in the UNK agricultural areas
the peasantry are excluded from the cities
mm
er and that was just primarily to the growth of the peasantry
yes
mm
yes
you would expect i if it was because of an improvement in their standard of living however slight you would actually of expected the population from eighteen fifty to nineteen fifty to have increased even more wouldn't you
if you could explain it by that because presumably their standard of living did change between eighteen fifty
yes
and nineteen fifty so you would've expected to see the same sort of increase
yes
cos i mean presumably they weren't between eighteen fifty and nineteen fifty they weren't practising excessive birth control to
yes
to keep it under
yeah that's right
is this roughly over the same area
is this
yes
roughly over the same area
yes the area's not changed
i was this UNK now i was wondering whether more areas became accessible between seventeen hundred and eighteen fifty for some reason or other therefore they could you know er UNK more people and count more people
well i mean not in the sense that
the UNK the chinese empire is actually growing but possibly in the sense that within chinese territory marginal land that hasn't previously been used for agriculture is being brought into use
but that in itself er certainly won't increase
no
erm productivity quite the opposite
i mean marginal land tends to be brought into use the less productive land precisely when there is a pre the pressure
yes but there could
of population
but there could be more people
it could support more people
yes
yes absolutely but the but the level at which those people
will exist will be that much lower presumably than the level of people who are in the more productive the more UNK er parts of the countryside which are already in use
could it have been the age old story of having more children to keep you when you get old
if life was becoming harder
what they say now
they have a lot of children
yes
to look after them when they get old
yes
i think that's again going to be part of it because that is certainly i mean a major reason why er a lot of peasant societies have large families but we'd still have to try and explain why it was that in this period presumably so very much more of those children were surviving than had been the case earlier
now usually we would explain that sort of things in terms of improved UNK improvements in the standard of living and so on but that's not really happening there's no evidence for that in the chinese countryside in this period
would the flight from the towns to the countryside in the early thirties of made any difference
you did say that er the communists
yeah it's very small numbers of people
pardon
it's very small numbers of people
i mean given the size of china i mean th there'd be
no i wondered how they sustained were sustained in the countryside if vast numbers were moving from the towns into the UNK countryside
we're talking about tens of thousands really
it's a problem isn't it
yes
i mean it is i mean how you explain it is erm by no means straightforward
but what we what is UNK true is that it does mean that there is growing UNK of UNK of peasant UNK which means that the average peasant now has a much smaller plot of land in which to try and support himself and his family than was the case earlier in chinese history
there is also a continuing UNK i think i probably mentioned right at the outset that in nineteen fifty india had six times as many UNK per acre in UNK as china did
now india was an extremely poor country in nineteen fifty and still is yet it had six times as many UNK per agricultural acre as china
britain incidentally had two thousand times as many but i mean that's the sort of contrast which perhaps you would expect
it's even the case that the iron plough apparently was comparatively rare in peasant china at this time
most people were still using wooden UNK er which not only di is it much more difficult to cut the sod with a er wooden plough but it also cuts only in to about half the depth of an iron plough so you can't sort of turn the soil over to anything like the same extent
there are of course virtually no chemical UNK
there aren't even animal UNK through most of the chinese countryside because er animals haven't replaced human labour power human labour power being so cheap and numerous generally speaking
human e UNK believe it or not was the most common form of UNK in the chinese countryside
so the UNK means that and the over population means that the soil is losing its UNK and there's absolutely no way of UNK it artificially by ploughing deeply and turning up er new soil or by re UNK it as it were by the use of artificial or natural UNK
and then on top of this there are major natural disasters
again a reflection of UNK because natural disasters can be controlled with a sufficient investment of resources china isn't able to do that there are UNK of UNK there is widespread flooding er there are also by contrast periods of severe UNK particularly up in the north china plain which is at the best of times erm a semi UNK region
and then there's the class structure
here's the peasants the gentry made up three percent of the population in the countryside
the rich peasants made up another seven percent i have to check to see i've got the UNK right the middle peasants twenty percent the poor peasants seventy percent
a rich peasant is a peasant who works his own land but will employ some wage labour as well because he has a large enough plot to be able to need to do that
a middle peasant is somebody who is more or less entirely self sufficient he doesn't hire any labour but nor does he have to work for anybody else his plot is big enough for him to be able to support himself and his family
a poor peasant who made up seventy percent of the population is a peasant who doesn't have a plot big enough to support himself and his family
he may be completely UNK or it may be that his plot isn't big enough and he has to spend part of his time or part of his family has to spend part of their time working for somebody else to get in some extra money or possibly UNK land from somebody else
now the distribution of land was that these two groups making up ten percent of the chinese countryside owned fifty percent of the land
the middle peasants owned twenty five percent which meant that the poor peasants making up seventy percent owned just twenty five percent of the land
so on top of the appalling poverty of chinese rural life there is a very UNK distribution of land which means that some people are desperately poor compared with others
and then in addition to that if you were a poor peasant who had to hire land from somebody else you would of course pay rent and in the nineteen thirties it's been estimated that the average rent paid by a poor peasant farming somebody else's land was forty five percent of the harvest
so virtually half of what you produced would go to the landlord
and then everybody would also pay taxes
taxes to the government taxes which were particularly high in this period because it's the period of the war lords the period of the civil wars the period of the war between the kuomintang and the communist party high levels of war taxation throughout this period
UNK very many peasants got into debt
it's been estimated again that almost half of all chinese peasants were in debt to the money UNK
the money UNK would very often be the gentry or the rich peasants but there were also merchants who specialized in lending money loan UNK
so er many would have in addition to paying their rent and their tax also regular interest payments to be made
and finally people er were subject to various forms of forced labour most obviously of course UNK into the armed forces but other kinds of forced labour as well repairing the UNK digging UNK and so on and so forth
i just want to read three UNK which and i mean i've given you sort of odd statistics and the advantage of UNK is that they actually put flesh on the bones i think and they really give you a sense of what it meant to be er a peasant in china in the nineteen thirties
a poor middle aged peasant couple of UNK in UNK were dependent for their subsistence on the wages of their only son who worked in a coal mine
when the couple who were in their forties UNK had a second son the UNK officers informed them that their older son would have to serve in the army since the law UNK only one son per family
the wife pleaded with them explained that they'd UNK to death if the older boy left
when the local authorities dismissed her UNK she went home and beat her baby on the ground until it was dead
another one the peasants up and down the valley lived and died in their special fashion
the father of one family died
since his wife had been failing and the family was very poor they decided not to bury him right away
perhaps the old woman would die too before really warm weather came and the old man began to smell when they could save by UNK both with one funeral
the old lady agreed
so they stored the coffin in their UNK room the old woman's sick room and UNK stones on its lid to keep the dogs out
last one this is the these are reports incidentally by er european doctors working in china at the time another desperate case that we treated for nothing was that of a young man who looked like a skeleton
one would have said there was nothing but skin on his bones
his family was so poor that they'd been obliged to sell him
he was accordingly sent to a family that had no sons
when six years later a son was finally born his new family simply threw him out and the poverty is so great in the region that one month spent begging and homeless brought him to UNK door
the extent of the poverty i think is very difficult for us to imagine
now this had already resulted between nineteen twenty five and twenty seven in a spontaneous explosion across much of the chinese countryside
essentially what we will see between nineteen forty six and nineteen forty nine is a controlled explosion when the chinese communist party quite UNK and deliberately UNK this vast pool of UNK and uses it to sweep away the kuomintang regime
that's essentially what we see happen
which brings us back to the communist party itself
what i've called the UNK turn the turn in programme the turn in strategy which is lead by er mao UNK and we have finally got erm to the stage in chinese history where mao UNK role becomes UNK important
the s he is one of these numerous communist party UNK who makes the move from the cities and the towns into the countryside in the late nineteen twenties early nineteen thirties
the strategy which he argues for in the early nineteen thirties and it subsequently becomes the dominant strategy of the party and mao becomes the er recognized leader of the communist party er really at the beginning of the second half of the nineteen thirties nineteen thirty five nineteen thirty six around that time it has become the dominant position
his strategy consists of essentially three things
UNK first of all not on a working class mass base but on a peasant mass base
secondly further to that the UNK on a strategy of UNK in place of the strategy er of strikes mass strikes armed UNK in the cities and the towns
and thirdly increasing emphasis not on the socialist politics of the communist party in the nineteen twenties but on the development of a nationalist ideology which could appeal to all classes in chinese society who were interested in getting the japanese out and who were UNK by the kuomintang government's UNK to stand up to the japanese
these were the three crucial elements which gives rise to this central question in all discussions really of the chinese revolution which is was this marxism
