was this a chinese UNK of er the doctrine of UNK marx a UNK of it if you like a chinese version with the essential ideas principles programme and so on of marxism retained or was it in effect an UNK of marxism
whatever the chinese leaders said whatever mao UNK said did it amount to a complete UNK of what UNK marx had been arguing for what er position which UNK claimed to stand in russia and so on
the answer to that question i think is that it was not marxism
and it was not marxism for a number of reasons and this is almost certainly going to be very controversial so i hope that it will feed discussion in the in the second half
it's not marxism because what we actually have now in a UNK communist party as it UNK in the course of the nineteen thirties is a leadership composed not of socialist working class UNK but of UNK whose prime motivation is that they are UNK nationalists
people who want to see a strong UNK modern industrial china created which is able to defend its UNK integrity its independence and stand up for itself er in the world
that's the prime motivation of the people who UNK the leadership of the party
come on hello ready
oh about
right well
ten minutes
erm we don't want to not get our tea and coffee
no but i mean he hasn't supposed to come and you know not really

i wouldn't mind
shall i finish off after the break
yes
mm well we'll have to we'll have to start
right
when shall we start again
ten minutes
ten minutes
right ten past then
ten past
well we don't we have our tea before we come and when we go home
it's a better cup of tea
yes it's
i certainly need one
oh yes
yes
sorry
you've got an easy day then
if it's been cancelled
well er very easy
you
yes
right
what i was erm doing was trying to identify the three er characteristics of the er UNK communist party as it emerged towards the end of the nineteen thirties which really UNK it i think from the label marxist means that it's a completely different type of organization to what the chinese communist party had been in the nineteen twenties
i talked about the leadership being essentially a leadership of UNK nationalist UNK
the rank and file by contrast is composed of peasants a mass membership is composed of peasants
primarily peasant UNK fighters people who were fighting in the red army and it draws its mass support the party members draw their mass support er from the peasants in the areas where they establish their authority
and this rank and file membership and the wider group of supporters are subject to leadership from above there is no real inner party democracy in the UNK communist party
policy is decided by the leadership and there are various er mechanisms for passing erm the UNK ideas on to the rank and file various systems of education some might say UNK and so on but no real inner party er democracy no real er involvement in the decision making processes by this mass membership of ordinary peasants
and thirdly the objective was no longer what marx had UNK the objective of er a party following his leadership should be no longer the objective which UNK in the russian revolution claimed was the objective for the russian UNK party not a workers' revolution which would then spread and become international worldwide
quite clearly the objective and you can reading between the lines of the propaganda which UNK out er of the chinese communist party for the late thirties onwards reading between the lines you can see it the objective is essentially chinese state power achieving power and using power to build er a national er UNK modern state
so the impact of nineteen twenty five to seven on the communist party and on the revolution which it made in nineteen forty nine is just as great as the impact had been on the kuomintang and nationalist china
let me just sum it up
what had been essentially a workers' party fifty percent of the membership workers based predominantly in the big cities and towns becomes a party of UNK and peasants
UNK er and professional UNK in the leadership a mass membership of peasants
a party which had been essentially urban becomes a party of the rural UNK and not just erm the countryside as a whole but particularly in the nineteen thirties at any rate the most backward parts of the chinese countryside the most UNK parts the least developed parts of the countryside
a party that had based er its strategy on strikes and urban armed UNK becomes a party of rural UNK a completely different kind of strategy for winning power
a party whose main base of support had been the unions and the er union UNK which grew up in industrial cities like UNK becomes a party whose main power base is its own red army its own army of peasant UNK which it itself has created
and finally a party which had seen itself as being part of a process of international socialist revolution linked with the russian revolution of nineteen seventeen becomes a party which is primarily a party of chinese nationalism
now if th this side the list on this side erm represents the sort of essential characteristics of a marxist political party and if that's a reasonable er summary and people might want to take issue with it argue that these aren't the essential characteristics that there are other essential characteristics or one other important er characteristic which i've ignored but if these are down this side the essential characteristics of a marxist party then mao's communist party in the late nineteen thirties cannot it seems to me by any stretch of the imagination qualify
the chinese communist party of the late nineteen thirties is a completely different kind of political organization to what had existed in mid nineteen twenties
is that a good thing
good question
perhaps we can talk about that
would you call mao himself one of the UNK
yes in the sense that although he comes from a peasant background originally it's a rich peasant background and he himself had er a reasonable education and subsequently erm built on the education that he was given becoming in part self taught
i would certainly UNK mao as an intellectual
yes
shall we arrange ourselves
yes
finished
well how long was the er the russian revolution a marxist revolution
it's another good question
i mean the marxism was the motivation just as it was for the chinese but er i don't think the russian revolution remained marxist revolution for very long but the achievement of revolution did make it possible for the success of revolution to be seen by the chinese because it had already been achieved
that's what gave them their
i yes i mean i
their drive you know
i don't want to sort of UNK in response to that i want other people to er
are you going to sit in the centre
are you going to sit in the centre
everybody finished with this
this part of a general UNK that erm marx banned communism
yes that's alright
of the industrial countries
countries which actually adopted it were found to er in this way
as i say i'm not going to respond immediately cos i think other people ought to
well i'd like to say to that er no marx didn't specifically erm look to britain or er germany only in the sense that they at the time most advanced and he UNK that er ideas of communism would spread only in the most advanced countries who in course of time would influence other countries
but initially there had to be a real genuine erm working class revolution and therefore marx looked first to england because we were the most advanced and we'd been in the business of running capitalism for s so much longer than any other country in the world
what we need is a definition of marxism of course
i know
oh dear
well one that we can at least discuss as to whether this was marxism or not
but that's precisely the problem because erm the definition which i would give to it is necessarily a definition which would UNK er regarding mao's party as a marxist party but then other people would say that my definition was er itself controversial
yes well if you tell us what your definition
i would s i would i would say it is that i it is the theory and the practise of international working class revolution
and i would say that all of those elements have to be there
it is a political theory but it's also an attempt to act on that political theory so it's practise as well
it's the idea that you can't have socialism in one country it has to be international it's the idea that it has to be based on the working class because the working class is the agent of socialism and it has to be by revolution because the ruling class won't give up its power and wealth UNK
i would say all of those five elements have to be in a definition of what marx meant by marxism
i would agree with that but i'll take it further to say that and if you read marx you'd find this very clear what he meant ultimately that the working class would achieve is a kind of a society where there was a common ownership of the means of life
no ruling class no working class just people producing wealth as they produced it consuming it that would be an efficient society where nobody would go hungry there would be no unemployment no poverty and er it's the ultimate objective of er the human race
but that isn't if we want to survive that is what we must achieve the common ownership of the means to survive
and it also means er obviously no classes therefore no wages or salaries no money no banks just people and the material resources of the earth
but you've got you've got to have leaders haven't you
and here they had the UNK as the leaders which they had got to have
i mean after all the working class wouldn't
on their own would they
yes
if they had
if they had the well because nobody came forward from the working class through it was the UNK that started it and gathered the
you're wrong you see
not even working class
no
surely once you have leaders then the whole things fall down
of course it does
yeah
be because leaders want power and they get power and so they want more power
that's it absolutely right
but then i nothing will work without leaders
mm see
marx didn't marx did not anticipate leaders
what he did say to the working class is this that the UNK of working class must be the work of the working class itself
that means an educated working class understanding the needs of socialism or communism and setting about the task of achieving it by getting rid of capitalism and introducing socialism or communism
which means the same thing to me
what happened what happened really in russia and china is er that they had a sort of UNK lower class who'd been used to a very authoritarian kind of rule so they were able to impose communism from above
because there doesn't seem to have been ever any er revolution that was initiated by working classes
victor UNK says there will be no revolution until the middle classes man the UNK er which they're beginning to do now
but who are the middle classes
who are they
you see
pass
here again here again you see in marx says that more and more and he said this in his day more and more is society spreading into two classes on the one hand the ruling class the owners of the means of life on the other hand the r vast majority of people today it's ninety percent of the population who don't own the means of l of life but ten percent do
and more and more said marx UNK splitting into these two groups
there can be no middle class with even those who are highly paid they are highly paid members of the working class they're not middle class
but after all marx himself was ma er middle class
no he wasn't
no he wasn't
yes but working class UNK to be middle class and very frequently represent themselves as middle class
well yeah
and middle class er wish to achieve upper class
it's the lower class that tends to stay where it is because it doesn't get the representation
because middle class will push the lower class down and be supported by the upper class
sounds
so they have to have
it sounds like
it sounds like sounds it sounds
yeah well it is UNK
a nonsense to me for this reason that there is in society the payers of wages and the UNK of wages
that's how UNK divided
we you know there are buyers and sellers and that's how you divide it
mm
you can't get away from that
that's capitalism and you so long as you've got buyers and sellers you get this UNK of interest between buyers and sellers
what would you have then
obviously the interests of buyers and sellers are UNK opposed to one another
mm well how do you get away from that then
that's this society
i think that when we discuss marxism erm we tend i mean looked at the
yes
philosophical side of marxism which is very interesting and there's a lot of very deep thoughts but what we've been given your definition is what i'd say is the political strategy that marx said er was necessary to achieve the philosophical ends
now you've er you've defined what you think is what you consider to be marxism which is the political aim the strategy and of course within your definition er it's so easy to er make a definition which suits your premise that er the chinese party was not marxist
i agree with you but it's very easily done isn't it
mm
if you want to prove a point well you give the answer first and say this is what erm what's it all about
however i er i can't see that er what happened with the c p falls within either UNK definition or your definition of marxism
perhaps you're both wrong i don't know
you did say that the communist party to state power
erm weren't they then following UNK
you see he moved away from communism as
that's right yeah
what we you know pure communism and just er adopted state power
and it seems to me that china was just doing the same as st UNK did
in fact mao himself said it
i've got it here in black and white mao said what we are after is the abolition of feudal ties to get rid of feudalism
not getting rid of capitalism get rid of feudalism
yes
the chinese communist pa the new chinese community party did it declare itself to be marxist
yes
mm
you see i mean er and this generally i mean ju just as when UNK claimed to be communist that claim has been accepted by the great majority of people writing about what was happening in russia in the west and in just the same way the chinese leadership er after nineteen forty nine claimed to be communist claimed to be standing in the tradition of marx and that claim generally speaking has been accepted
but there are all sorts of other claims that people make that we are very much more critical of
when margaret thatcher says the n h s is safe in her hands
we
we well at least we give that some thought we don't just accept it because she said it
no
and i mean there hasn't been i think that kind of critical investigation of the claims that have been made by UNK in russia and china and other states claiming to be communist
mm
that's right
which we would normally subject the claims of political leaders to
mm
see it's the question of a big lie isn't it
if you keep on saying a thing long enough communist everybody believes you even though it's the biggest lie on earth
it's a complete myth
there's never been any communism in russia communism in china
no but it
what has happened is
partially worked in russia
no it didn't
they'd introduced capitalism into china
into it yeah
they'd introduced capitalism into russia
yes
yes
but they at least did a half of it
good
i mean don't forget don't forget don't forget when everybody was wearing their UNK and UNK in this country they had UNK in russia
now can you
yes
credit UNK in a co so called communist country
that's right
because it's human nature people want to get better things
but aren't changes aren't these changes er in russia and in china forced upon them to a degree by circumstances by the fact that the outside world immediately UNK and UNK a rising of the people as a whole against the established government er i mean we've seen in recent times with UNK and so on haven't we
er public opinion didn't welcome the UNK of the UNK it was immediately horrified and everyone gathered together to er try and bring about a re establishment of the UNK
that's right
er i mean they had a family in er russia didn't they
i mean that must have what it c er millions died in that and er the same thing happened in china
and all of that makes it easier for those who are leading or in control to change the policies and get acceptance
yes but not to achieve communism
no oh no
because the cry of the UNK was at the time in nineteen seventeen the cry of the UNK was not for communism or socialism but their cry and they had it UNK on their UNK peace land and bread that's what they had there peace land and bread not communism
but er communism and politics are like religion they don't necessarily deliver the goods
they an interpretation don't they
which they
well
sell to the public
you see to put it back to marx it's the working class that have got to deliver the goods
it's in within their power now look at the working class ruling now
they're on erm local councils and members of the working class sit on their local councils
the working class can take over at any time when they wish when they have the knowledge when they are in the majority
well they're always in the majority aren't they
well of course
and southend returns a tory council
yeah
year a well
but they don't have to do that do they
they don't have
but it's them they do it
because if one stands out then they lose what they've got they lose their job
once they ever reach that position
i don't see that at all
and the it's perfectly it's all about it
er on television at the moment isn't it
i mean lunch time we were hearing how because they stood up for what was right it was over the killing of soldiers and that this man job and actually he more or less said that he was something wrong with his head didn't he
yes he was put into a mental institution
mental institution and having to give up his job because once they get that position if they speak out in any way for instance the civil service you can't speak out at all even if you can see something that you know is wrong
well
there is nothing that you can do about it
well
and even if you want to
erm
you have to side with
i think that's entirely wrong
entirely wrong
yes
because i've known civil servants who've been er members of my organization i belong to the socialist party of great britain the only socialist party in this country
we stand for
yes
communism as UNK by marx in his day
yes
and we have had in our ranks civil servants
yes but then they're but nevertheless they couldn't
i mean they're university UNK
publish anything however
but they do publish things
i can bring along the statements of these people who've said all sorts of things you can you know put down at once but they're not put down
there's a man steve stands up in UNK park every sunday er talking about communism and socialism
mm
erm i w i was going to say going back to china erm they're a bit frightened of china now in what was the soviet union i heard the other day were th were they a little bit anti UNK type of communism before er the soviet union fell or were they all UNK together
in the nineteen fifties
they recognized the difference in their types of communism
well it's certainly true that there were ideological differences but whether those were the reason for the split or not is a er is a is a UNK question and i suspect not
i suspect that ideological differences with the russians and the chinese UNK each other as counter UNK were sort of a cover really for the fact there were there were real conflicts of interest between the chinese and the russians which we will we will look at
but i mean through the nineteen fifties there is a reasonable measure of co operation between the russians and the chinese and then from the beginning of the nineteen sixties and onwards there is conflict between russia and china
and i mean there has been up until fairly recently it's only in the last few years that relations have tended to get a bit better
mm
you were saying about erm the west not questioning russian and china and you know accepting that they were communist
di did that not because erm as capitalist countries we would perceive anything communist as being the enemy and so it it's actually in our interests to lump them all together rather than question because
that's right
if you question you might actually find that there's some good thing or at least the people might find that there's some good things in it so it's then er it becomes more of a threat then to the capitalist world
that's right
than by just dumping them all together and
right
accepting it
or you could say erm that if communism can be UNK with secret police and the UNK
that's right
and forced labour schemes and so on and so forth then you've destroyed or you've very seriously undermined the appeal
mm
of radical ideas in the west
now i would suggest that is the prime motivation
yes
but the communists in russia were er th all this er UNK and secret police have been in existence in russia for hundreds of years before the com er communists came in
it was because the people were used to that kind of society with a secret police and er government inspectors and sending people out to UNK and putting
oh yes
under the UNK
your UNK in prison haven't they
i mean the UNK didn't change all that much as far as the ordinary people were concerned
but we've changed too here we've changed since the last century haven't we
look at the way they treated people years ago
yes but in russia they had this kind of framework before communism began
well that's true
mm
but it wasn't exclusive to russia of course in the land
oh no i
of the UNK the UNK dominated of course they did
they sent
yes i know i don't dis
people to prison they sent them into UNK
we know they ill treated them but so they did here
but i mean in russia they were use yes i know but
mm
they weren't didn't do this in this century so much here peasants did they
well eighteen twenty four
yes but that's not this century
but i think er you know in russia er they always had this kind of authoritarian regime
people always were sent to UNK before the communists came in
so it didn't really
well that's right
yeah alright
make much change to the ordinary people
what do others think about that
i mean do people think that if
that's a point
if there is a sort authoritarian political tradition
mm
that could be something which is quite difficult to break
yes china was
even more so in china where
yeah
they were used to an authoritarian er regime
i think it would be very relevant in china
and that's why i think erm the west is making an enormous mistake in thinking that eastern european countries can suddenly become cos they never have been and i can't see any democratic now
i think
UNK democracy
is there any de democracy anywhere
anywhere
well
there are some places were you i mean all democracy means is that you have a vote
yes
anything else
yes but you would pro see what they do after
yes mm
have they taken any notice of you
but at least you've got the chance haven't you
at least
that's right
you've got the chance whereas in these countries they haven't if you haven't got a democracy
you haven't got political democracy and you can't have democracy er as long as er some people have the control of other people
some people possess the means of product production and can do what they like to many other people they're the people
but isn't it the ignorance of the people because the people are UNK and they actually don't know what they're voting for
ah that's it yeah yes that's it yes
which is the main thing
they don't know what they're voting for
yeah that's right
but still it still comes to my point there is no democracy
well yes no but
but we can we can differentiate between two the two different sides still i think
i mean they they're all er some countries which we call UNK erm aren't the same as we are they're
yes well it's
and there are shades of democracy i mean UNK far more democratic than italy and so on
yeah
mm
er but they're still different from countries like UNK and russia and so on
yes mm
which have never had a an UNK of democracy
yes that's right
there's no likelihood of getting the same sort of regime that we've got which i know isn't democratic in that sense
but when we want to teach a democracy to er to er to a different er the countries of the east when it's a big UNK i think you can't teach them
yes
we can't teach them much
er what are we teaching them now
market forces
er market forces everywhere er you you'll see now it's all for the market forces and if you have market forces a few on the top and all the rest at the bottom
mm it's happened already
UNK being built in russia now
yes it is er
doesn't it take a long time to change people's attitude against authority
i mean i go back to
mm
i mean that was horrible police state
mm
but now and they have UNK with that a hundred years later and more than a hundred years
so it takes a long time think more UNK
cos it'd have to take a long time
no
yes most probably
no it's up to us
it doesn't have to take a long time it's up to us here and now
yes but i mean people don't give up what they have that's human nature
i'm actually very dubious about this idea indeed because i don't think that anybody actually likes being in a situation where they simply have to do what they're told
no
and they're not allowed to question anything
that's right
and they're not allowed to disagree and answer back and argue as i don't think anybody likes
nobody likes
being in that situation
people don't think great this is the this is the ideal sort of government
a really strong ruler who can tell me what to do so i know where i stand and so on
and there are moments in history when
when
when that sort of system suddenly gets blown away
i mean i think that's really what we've seen in eastern europe
yes
in sort of
mm
the UNK of nineteen eighty nine
and i don't think everybody's going around in eastern europe thinking oh what we need is to get back to the old UNK system where you know you had someone telling you what to do all the time
far from it
i think we do have to explain the re establishment of authoritarian forms of government more carefully we can't just assume that there's a kind of almost UNK after it among the mass of the population because i'm just not convinced by that at all
there have to be there are particular reasons why er after revolutionary UNK you very often get authoritarian forms of government and i would say in russia and i in a sense it's linked with UNK question as well about erm the chinese following a UNK model of economic UNK think what you've actually got in russia is not this sort of mass UNK after UNK but you've got a situation where the bureaucracy that controls a completely UNK backward economy which is what they've actually got in the early nineteen twenties where the working class democracy has just disappeared really with the with the economic collapse with the factories shutting down with all of the old communist party UNK going into the red army or getting UNK into the state bureaucracy with that sort of complete collapse really economically and socially and politically you've got a situation where the central priority of the leadership is to build up russian industry as quickly as possible so that russia has got the armed forces it needs
mm
to defend itself against foreign
that's right
foreign aggression
and that's the central UNK so the i ideas of socialism and you know international working class revolution goes out of the window
that's right
because there's er there's an absolute desperate er anxiety that UNK not gonna be able to defend itself unless it UNK very quickly it's
but surely
that gives rise to the UNK
surely that also suits the people at the bottom because i be because the government is producing work in effect it means that the people at the bottom have jobs and can earn money and so they're lot actually UNK
i mean th they might don't necessarily see why it's improving and what's behind it but their lot must improve if there's industrialization and weapons and things to be made that they have jobs and presumably have more money than they had before when they were just sort of not doing very much
in the long term there must be improvement as russia UNK but in the short term erm presumably we see the development of a of a sort of UNK precisely because the UNK are really being turned on people as much work is being got out of them as possible in order to accumulate capital and to build up basic industries and to divert i mean not just into heavy industries but to divert er resources into arms production as well
but what they're not doing is spending loads of money on hospitals and houses and schools and raising the general living standards they're spending it all on heavy industry and UNK
which is why i think the government is authoritarian why you have secret police and UNK and so on because they can't afford to tolerate large numbers of people saying this isn't what the revolution was supposed to be about
mm
but
is it because of the interference with one country to another then
if they were perhaps left on their own to sort out their own problems
yeah
wouldn't they do it better
they may look
if they looked inward instead of outward
but then they've always got the threat of er i mean at the moment there really isn't that threat is there
unless you'd er think of america but they've got so much problems there that they've got to look within themselves now haven't they
otherwise there's going to be chaos there if they don't stop now and look within themselves instead of all of this UNK in other countries which they've done in the past
america has got to do that russia is broken up so it's lesser than it is in fact it's going down if only they'd look but you see they can't do it now without outside help
without the outside help they can't build up there country
so it seems everybody's got their head against a brick wall at the moment because of in fact the whole world seems worse than it's ever been
i don't suppose it is but it seems like that to us because we know more about it now we see it on television
maybe we we're all more
well it ought to be said that the world today in this year nineteen ninety two is a different place from what it was a hundred years ago
yes
compared with then we're now a village not a worldwide any more
we can lift the telephone and speak to people in australia
the communications are such that it's like living in a village
so therefore we've got to look at it that way
we want to be a big village we want to be human beings living in a human society
yes of course
well of course i do know that the only answer to it of course is for the christian way but it's not what it that's going to happen
but that is the only answer the christian way
that is not the only if it's not gonna happen it's not the only answer is it
but it is er there's not going to be any other answer
that's that is a con that is a contradiction
but there isn't going to be any other answer because that is the only answer
but it isn't in that people have never lived er according to er christian philosophy or indeed
no
any other religious philosophy or even any UNK philosophy
i mean
no
i mean any of us really could sit down and draw up a list of er of things where if we you know a list of rules if e war for a very small subscription UNK many groups other and if everybody stuck by them everything would be wonderful
mm
but then of course the reality is that
no
has never happened and isn't happening now and it's
no
it's never going to happen
we have to
mm
actually look at the real social forces that cause people to act er in UNK of all of those very desirable philosophical principles
i'd like to take up your point about is it that erm after revolution and so on and break downs governments er countries say like russian china er some of these eastern european countries they're motivation goes to building their country up to resist occupation
erm that seems to be the main motivation but i don't think it is personally er it might be what is suggested to them because if they look like going socialist again then it is not what the majority of the capitalist wants or the major powers want
they haven't been fighting all these years to get rid of communism to see it re emerge again so you the confusion continues as it is in russia and then you UNK the idea that with the breakdown of social order and so on you must have a strong man you must have strong arms and that's where your UNK and your UNK and all these people come through in that little UNK in between of disorder
it's a dangerous time
but i don't think it's the will of the people it's sold to them
whereas the revolution usually comes from the straw that broke the UNK back
they've been UNK for years under the surface and then some thing happens that make it possible course the continued UNK have gone on through the world and because they've seen the success of a revolution in russia although we didn't know the full facts of it in the west it was it did establish a huge area in the wake of a revolution
how could it how could it be a success when it collapsed how could it be a success
i mean communism
ooh no i said the success of the revolution which swept away
see communism
the existing force that was there
i'm not saying that it achieved er a great victory
well it wasn't a success was it
but it completely changed the scene and established an entirely different system
not a good one but it established it
can i go back to er a question which you asked was it a good thing
mm
that there was this change of policy in the chinese communist party
mm
what do people think about it
chinese communist party
that they th they
yes that you said it er pat thought it seemed a good thing the way you were saying it
i wasn't meaning to suggest it was either good or bad i was to report it
well no i know but i thought well that doesn't seem to well that's better than what they had
there was no change in policy mao himself said he was there to do away with feudalism
i've got it here in black and white
yes
that was his object to do away with UNK not to introduce socialism do away with feudalism
do away with yes of course
which is what they done
mm
well it was a good idea in as much as it returned to the people's wishes didn't it
people had been UNK without a great deal of success over the years and it was seventy percent of the people who were disadvantaged wasn't it
well if they weren't represented in the kuomintang were they
but didn't the er the new communist party leadership simply UNK the UNK and use it to achieve their own political objectives rather than that UNK itself forming the basis of revolutionary change
i mean i rather suspect it was the former it wasn't th the driving force was not to be the needs of the mass of the population but the needs of the mass of the population could be used could be UNK to build the red army
mm
which would be capable of sweeping away the kuomintang and putting into power the leadership of the chinese communist party
yeah
and i suppose i mean if i was to answer the question was it a good thing i would have to say no
i mean i would have to say that turn by the chinese communist party meant that it was a turn away from the idea that it was the ordinary people themselves who should shape their own UNK
i think the communist party actually UNK to that idea in the nineteen twenties
nineteen twenties
didn't it have to survive first though
it had to first of all survive which is why it went on the long march wasn't it
and unless
yes
it could expand unless it could gather strength and produce an army er it was on the road to UNK which was their the course of erm UNK wasn't it
which UNK even through the march and so on
they had to first of all get a base from which to achieve unfortunately of course gaining the power and the growth of the power no doubt the ideals were UNK and it became what you are su suggesting it did it no longer represented the people
became ideological
yes well i mean you erm you posed the question whether it was a good or bad thing this change erm i can only the results of the change and what would have happened if the change had not taken place or try to er see what the change it would seem to me that the alternative er would have been a UNK of er possibly erm a kind of kuomintang erm type of policy which encouraged erm other UNK to develop china as beginning to happen now
whether that would have been at that time for the benefit of the mass of the chinese people we're talking about erm i don't think i rather think that the er turn that mao took probably in the long run in the long term was to the benefit of the mass of people erm the peasantry the workers in china because i think the alternative would have been erm international exploitation
which is what we've got now
you're ge you're beginning to get it now yes
erm
no we've had it all the time
well i i'm not sure of here again he's making another turn isn't he and er you're going back to as i say what would probably have been the lesser of two UNK
erm but erm er i mean there's been a double turn in fact
and what you're suggesting harold is that er he's going back now to er the erm er the idea of the i'd suggest that o w what would have been the alternative was erm international exploitation
i'm more interested in the kind of s so called philosophical erm ideas that have been raised as whether this you know these kind of ideas of a kind of ideal state are just possible
i have my doubts erm in that erm certainly not within one nation erm i agree with you entirely that it's UNK to marxism in that erm what happened in erm with mao was that erm he turned away from any UNK socialist concept
but erm and that presumably one could say that in the same way as UNK did but that erm UNK idea was much nearer to marx
but erm it's all very easy to say you can't have socialism or this ideal state whatever you might like to call it unless it's all er you know kind of international er it's got to be happen all over the world or it never will happen at all but erm first of all it's got to happen in your own country and it seems to me that we imagine that everybody the mass of the people that we do that er we want this ideal state
and i doubt as a result of the last general election whether people want that kind of state
i think that the mass of the people as far as i can see want the state where they can er well economic climate in which they can make money for themselves and get on top
and i think this has been proved you know that ask when people have changed their minds and said i don't know that this is what has happened in the last er ten to fifteen years erm and which makes me feel that once again i think that advances can only be UNK erm i think that erm i don't know if you anybody saw joseph UNK erm UNK story on the television
it finished up with one erm very relevant to this class quotation erm can't remember the last part of it though he was talking about the indian that he had a talking about it and saying UNK and then the next stage erm which i can't remember the word but in effect it meant co operation and you can't get that it seems to me unless you have a change of vision change in erm not just in society but in people because this is where it starts
and whether the erm the kind of ideology or the ideas are christian or marxist erm you've got to wait till the overwhelming mass of the people see that truth before er it can be effective
which is why
but you don't
i think that unfortunately with china erm you know the whole idea is going to collapse
it's not on the path to a UNK at all
mm
well you don't even get co operation like that within a single family unit do you
no
so i think you're right it's got to be a massive change for people
i think it'll come but well we're rather UNK i think when you look back over the past hundred years you see some massive erm changes which are quite UNK
nobody could dream that you know things that are in existence today a hundred years ago you know it was it seemed impossible
but people will probably only all co operate when they are all threatened by the same external
yes
yes
so that everybody's threatened by the same thing so that
lot of green little green men landing somewhere
the whole the whole world today whole world is threatened with pollution
don't you know that this planet is don't you
yes but people shut their eyes to it
don't you know that this planet is running down that time is short
we've gotta do something about it
we've got to we've got to do something about it
well that may be the answer that may be the answer
but at the moment people shut their eyes to it because
you see there's every there's every evidence to show there's every evidence to show that those who live by profits will never cure pollution
they will never er produce a healthy environment
but we've got to do it us people
we've got to see the damage
and then do something about it
yes but then you see greenpeace is going trying to do it and
you're always
there's very few of you here belong to it i can't see your UNK on we haven't got ours on at the moment and a lot of people don't even believe in greenpeace
if we put all put our UNK on we'd be weighed down
because it's not practical
so it it's not until something really happens
why don't they believe in it
well maybe they're UNK about we've heard people say i don't believe
in al any all of that maybe they are the UNK of the world for all we know the greenpeace people
maybe
we have advanced for a price
what
and we will not give up the good things in life for greenpeace and for a clean environment
but you won't you w i will you won't
because ah no
what is i mean what is being discussed it seems to me is a is a dilemma that has been debated ever since people became interested in social change
yeah
mm
the possibility of deliberate UNK social improvement and i think it's much more straightforward than people generally suggest
the
so do i
the implication is always erm that you've got to make some sort of choice between do we get the social change first which gives rise to a different kind of people better people or do we first of all change the people so that they're capable of making a better world and of course it's a catch twenty two isn't it
mm
the reality is
the reality is both change together
that is actually what happens if you look at processes of social change in history
that's right
that as peop that as a social crisis UNK people become interested in radical critical ideas and they start talking about how things can be improved
and the pressure for change builds up and as the changes begin to happen new values new attitudes become dominant which in turn affects how people see things so they become interested in yet greater changes
now that's what actually happens there's a there's a UNK interaction between people's ideas about what society should be like and the changes that are actually going on around them
it's not chicken and egg it's two things UNK that's how history actually operates
that's right
yo you're suggesting is what is happening now and so many of us he no he not just here but in population generally belong to all sorts of pressure groups erm whatever they may be like greenpeace and many others erm really it's a jolly hard UNK the point is that erm it the lid is on the kettle the whole time and it's only the only way that people can get anything done is by joining these organizations erm but it's a very slow business erm but there's no other way of doing anything because you can't change what happens at the top
everything is whether it's pollution or anything else erm you can't you can't change it
er n nothing ever happens up there that's why people are so UNK with politics altogether
i think er everything is in the people's hands really but people are so varied and so different aren't they
you speak to a person about one thing and they've got a totally opposite point of view from you and you think well i am surprised with all that they've gone through and yet they you know they don't see people don't s think along the same lines
they think so totally different and there's got to be a reason for that
is it to do with education
is it to do with the newspapers
a lot of it's to do with newspapers
a lot of people don't care one way or the other as long as they're alright
most people are quite happy if everything is fair if things are fair they think well it's fair
but there's so much that isn't fair
and really everything is in the people's hands if only they knew it
but people are different and want different things out of life
yes
yes but then there's got to be there's got to be
but i mean people are very kind on the whole
aren't they
greenpeace have a meeting somewhere i'm sure everyone goes there by car
yeah exactly that is what i'm sort of
yes of course
maybe there's no other way they can get there
if there was a proper a bus system that you could nip on easily they would do that but all those
that's right
things are taken away
i mean yes
yes
i mean there used to be a tram trams running along the UNK road
yes
you could nip on there for a
all of that's taken away from you
yes
these things have been taken away from you
that's right
and people have to have cars
by the by the same token you know
i mean i never went in a car when i was a child
i was going to say that UNK absolutely everyone is against war but not many people actually joined the united nations after the war for a very small subscription or not many groups of people have many members in it and of course because there were so few members in it they a they went one particular way which a lot of people that had joined didn't agree with and so they came out of it
i it it's oh no we don't want war we're all against war but nobody is prepared to bother actually to go to a meeting or pay a small subscription and then you w you could of had a very strong united nations now the same as after the first world war but it's the people that didn't do it
isn't it the government rather than the people
the amount of money put into the united nations by the governments
yes but it
not by the people
it's also the individual isn't it
i mean if the
if the individual sort of carried out UNK things and that sort of thing they rely on the individual
you've got a
but there's another pr sorry
it's alright i was only gonna say i think you've got a er erm strong battle to wage against the sort of natural freedom of people
mm
yes
and the fear of people for each other that lot might take away what i've got sort of thing
and also i think which is very strong and i think it does come out in the chinese communist party is the lust of power which can be even more dangerous when you convince yourself i'll do all you lot good but i can make you all members of the communist party whether you want to be or not doesn't really matter you know it's gonna be for the good of the country so you fall in with this trap of assuming that you want is for their good so it's sort of a dangerous thing
i think it does happen in china i think it happened in the early part of the russian revolution before UNK was and we had communism with
and i think these are very dangerous erm UNK that run through the society of er you know the international community where we live on this fear almost
we're frightened of what will happen and sometimes we have need to be frightened you know they are going to do very different things because they disagree UNK with us
and that's why your idea that i think it does have to be a very gradual process where we learn to trust each other we learn to live by our decisions that we make together rather than separate decisions
but i think there's a very strong argument chinese revolution and to a certain extent you can understand that people have to identify with something and the easiest thing to identify with is a king and a queen erm chinese communist leaders of various sorts UNK even UNK marx you know you can convince yourself that he had all the answers when of course really you must see these things as developing
and i think this is a very strong i think has to be taken into account whenever you're talking about history
can i just say do you think that erm there's a er within the last twenty years there's such a terrific change in society like people who know other UNK er other countries know each more through television
that's right
that's right
and within the last say twenty five years there's been a dramatic change in the young people's way of thinking maybe more of them have gone to university than they did the previous twenty five years and that there is such a difference now than there was that i mean for instance if there was a war there wouldn't there would be far more UNK objectors than there ever was before far more than erm young man saying no i'm going to fight for my country be UNK i don't think you would find for instance the youth of this country so UNK as they was in the last war your country needs you
and they would be a UNK for not going to war
well they wouldn't need them anyway
no
they wouldn't need them because of the this technology and that that's but nevertheless they do ha they would be UNK because they do have to have the ground troops of
that's right
prove that this technology wasn't so great as one would have thought it was without the ground troops
but that that's just one little part of it but and because there's been a lot of quite worldwide travel of young people not perhaps on a massive scale but at least the young people of each country are more thinking more of them
not only the young
more of them not only the young people of course not but i mean more of them i know there always were some of more than there was before it has changed every value even moral values and everything like that have changed a lot the last twenty to thirty years
that's that is
but that's not sorry
an element that could come into it
i was going to say that john's point about evolution it comes slowly because
yes
in nineteen forty
mm
they said exactly what you're saying it wasn't the last twenty years it was
no
it was continuous through the century
i mean
yes
in nineteen forty older people were saying don't go and volunteer and think what you're doing
well
more so than they did in nineteen fourteen it's
yes
a gradual evolution
the world gets smaller
but i you see mm now see i'm not i'm really not convinced by that at all i because i mean it's quite clear that right across europe in nineteen thirty nine nineteen forty er there was a real sense of oh no not again
yes
and it was because the generation whose sons were being sent to be UNK
in the first world
had gone through it themselves
and i'm sure that was the reason there i mean there are all sorts of er accounts of you know how people poured onto the streets waving their bloody UNK in nineteen fourteen and die in the UNK
and it didn't happen in thirty nine because remember how UNK it was
no that's what i'm saying
i think that's the key thing in thirty nine forty and
but now it's forty years
yeah exactly and
give it another twenty years and there won't be people left who remember
er that's and i and i'm thinking about the response to the UNK and the gulf
yeah mm
these were these were comparatively small er wars i mean the UNK was an absolute i mean UNK really it wasn't a serious
complicated and yet
i i've never heard anyone saying a word about the gulf war
what a UNK
i have ne
i have never heard anybody saying that it was er not the right thing to do
well i have
i stood amongst twenty thousand
ah but so did i and i did nothing but write during that time but i've never known and everything i've said about that is true has turned out to be true
i stood amongst twenty thousand people
it wasn't a war
it wasn't a war it was an attack
yes and
and it was a wicked UNK thing that ever happened
at the time virtually everybody
and eventually it will all have to come out
at the time virtually everybody supported it i mean
yes they did
yeah
everybody supported it
i wrote to everybody going in fact ev all over the world i should think all everybody in this country because that is how i felt about it
i knew that it was the most wrong and wicked thing to do
yeah
and the last UNK that happened which has never come out yet will eventually have to come out because there are soldiers now that are talking about it
the most UNK and yet everybody you spoke to s thought that was a good thing because they believed everything they saw on television right until the girl that was the UNK that cried on television and said he pulled the plugs out of the UNK for the babies and she was an UNK and yet that was head headline news
yeah it was
headline news
so have you have you have you now persuaded yourself that perhaps you're over optimistic about i mean cos you were suggesting that attitudes had changed
yes
fundamentally i mean i
no i am UNK at people i can't believe that people behave the w er take the attitude the way er
but they do
i can't believe that people would take this attitude
i have gone through it
mm
i have experienced
that's right
how people can behave
mm
my husband was jewish
yeah
and suddenly i mean people lived for centuries there
mm
suddenly i mean they were UNK
yeah
of every everybody threw them out concentration camps and all that sort of thing no
although the majority of the people didn't know i believe that came out after the war but people who were affected they knew exactly that their son or husband was in UNK
mm
and people believe they would believe this country although i'm very grateful to be here
mm
we've just gone through UNK day and i was and it's always made me feel there's something a little bit wrong about UNK it seemed more of a UNK in the way
yeah
it was presented
the first
yes
time we've had men who have been in war talking about the horror of war
mm
yeah
UNK it and i thought that was a significant step forward
but we can see the horror now we only need to look at television and yugoslavia
ah yes
we see horror now
yeah
mm
we see it but we see it again and we see it again and it becomes less and less of an impact
but at a time like that when i it's devoted to the fallen in a war and men who were the UNK of the war say it was disgusting you know and how they expressed themselves i thought was a very significant thing it made a very strong impression
and i think that people who will be watching those services and the UNK to it i think it will make an impression
i don't know whether any young people would have been watching because i don't know
there's
whether they focus to it
well i think
yeah there's a UNK th there's a museum at UNK in UNK i don't know if anyone's been there we went there last year and it it's a new museum a memorial museum and that's the most moving place i've ever been because it's actually designed to show how awful war is and that it shouldn't happen again it's not a museum UNK war it's a museum showing that it shouldn't happen we shouldn't let it happen and there's a erm there's a great big case as you go in which has er a statement from every country that took part in the war including germany and they're all there they're all there together saying that you shouldn't you shouldn't let it happen and i thought that was the sort o you know i it was very impressive because i it wasn't UNK anybody it wasn't saying we won the war you lost the war it was it was a coming together to say that it shouldn't happen
but you see er
mm don't think that's a new idea i think we were all brought up on that idea
and sure i i'm sure that the i mean th the UNK is more or less universal i mean virtually everybody is opposed to war and yet again and again and again the leaders who pay lip service
to these ideas launch another war but it's always a just war this time it's always justified
mm yeah
and they've got no alternative otherwise we're gonna get walked all over
but it's only it's only a few people that do it
oh yes it is
i mean are we all er
yes it is
something wrong with all the people that allow a few people to do this
i mean it's such a very small people isn't it
yeah
why don't they put all the leaders of all the countries up in the air
yes
i always used to think that why can't why can't they push mrs thatcher
john i think this is wh i think this ought to be the last contribution
i'm trying to sort out in my mind what is the difference between these national wars er with er the use of violence and the kind of civil wars for social change er you can call it or revolution er involves er a civil war involves violence
now you see i don't think that you can say i'm all against national war but you're in favour of a violent revolution
mm
to change things for the good
er i can't you know there seems to be an UNK in so many people who are against national wars but er would say that what we need is a revolutionary situation in order to change things for the better within society
is there a difference
well i think
not so violent as war surely
oh i don't know
i was going to suggest that this is er i mean i've made a note of this question that we ought to return to it next time
yeah
ready to go
this one's been brought back if anyone wanted to
this is the book he was talking about that's been brought back if anyone wants it
no
hello chris
we play games on it though
no
has anyone got a
i don't think it's i mean
good communication though
mm
try a two see if a two's on it
yeah absolutely nothing at all
what sort of resistance on that lot
UNK go to your lecture tomorrow
say again
ten o'clock drive down to north UNK with all speed
what's this
all speed
then you don't need to miss your lecture
oh no right
shame bad luck chris
can you drive over with either UNK or edward
yeah
where was that man that wanted
is he willing to pay for them
oh yeah UNK
UNK
oh well done UNK
oh i just wanted to ask you how to work the machine but it's done now
oh right
good
UNK and climate it's not currents it's UNK and climate
who
we're missing out currents
i might have to steal some more paper later on
mm
but i'll give it you back
can i switch the lights on
yeah
the highly productive waters off once supported one of the most UNK in the world but in nineteen eighty three the which produced the fish failed and the UNK
deprived of the which they the marine UNK of the UNK to death
UNK islands were UNK by UNK but their sea bird populations disappeared
had returned
the UNK known as UNK seemed to occur every two to ten years
the nineteen eighty two to three event was one of the most severe on record and its affects were felt around the world
large parts of africa india and australia were UNK by UNK while the west coast of the UNK was UNK by UNK and UNK rain
the nineteen eighty two to three event was also the most UNK observed so far
the changing patterns of sea surface temperature were recorded by satellite mounted UNK and they showed a region of UNK warm water travelling across the pacific
but why did this happen
at the time a number of UNK were UNK along the UNK and were sending back information about the wind and sea conditions
in addition large numbers of UNK were launched into the ocean off UNK and for several months they were UNK via the UNK satellite as they UNK with the surface currents
you can see the UNK of the UNK looking like UNK tails thin arrows centred on the UNK show wind direction while the UNK arrows show current direction
watch the UNK drifting UNK just north of the UNK as it approaches one of the UNK it suddenly changes direction with the current
normally we'd expect these UNK to move west in the south UNK current under the influence of the south UNK trade winds but during UNK winds become weak and UNK and UNK putting off the coast of UNK seemed to wander about UNK
other UNK previously moving UNK now changed direction
so it seems that the UNK of the trade winds allowed more surface water normally UNK up in the western pacific to flow back UNK across the ocean
but it's not as simple as that
sea surface temperature affects processes in the atmosphere ocean and atmosphere form one system
our work proceeds by trying to model this ocean atmosphere system and initially we made these models to develop an understanding but it turned out that the models worked pretty well to make predictions
now in order to make a prediction of what say what's going to happen this year i would have to know the state of the system of the ocean and the atmosphere on january first and in order to do that in an ideal world i would have a tremendous amount of data about the ocean and about the atmosphere and be able to put it into this model but this data by and large doesn't exist
what we do have are some relatively UNK observations of the surface movements over the tropical pacific based on volunteer UNK on merchant ships
we need the winds everywhere and we rely on people in UNK state to take these very UNK observations and turn them into a map which covers the whole surface of the tropical pacific
we then take those kind of and use it in an ocean to create the state of the ocean
now we have the ocean and the atmosphere and we can go and we go forward and in a good year if we're lucky the way the model UNK with the ocean driving the atmosphere and the atmosphere driving the ocean UNK what happens in the real world and so we can make a prediction
predictions have value of course because these are things which affect climate and affect people's lives but also making a prediction is a way of trying to UNK whether the understanding that we think we have about how the system works can actually be translated into equations which are put on a computer and then when you let this go it in fact s does indeed do what the real world does
with increasing success at modelling changes in the tropical UNK are now aiming to predict global changes in the world ocean circulation experiment w o c e for short
in this experiment we would be making measurements of the entire world ocean looking at essentially a UNK view of the behaviour of the ocean during a five year period
crucial to these observations are UNK have the ability to make measurements at least of the surface layer of the ocean on a nearly daily basis
also the observations in all parts of the global ocean from ships from UNK from UNK on the surface of the ocean and UNK in the interior of the ocean
this data set coupled with extensive satellite observations will give us for the first time a essentially a UNK view of the behaviour of the ocean
understanding how the global ocean works is important if we're to forecast UNK change
pollution of our planet may already be UNK the atmosphere and there's rising concern about what will happen at the UNK
the UNK regions of the ocean play a very crucial role in the global climate system
it's in these areas that the ocean heat is lost or UNK to the atmosphere as this heat UNK was carried into the ocean in the lower UNK
in UNK regions as the heat is lost to the atmosphere the surface water naturally gets UNK and it UNK and it UNK at some level in the ocean into the rest of the world ocean
even under the UNK if you go deep enough you'll enter water masses that were formed in the UNK regions
this has an effect of cooling the deep waters of the world ocean and it also has an important UNK effect in removing excess c o two from the atmosphere
the north atlantic in particular is important in removing excess er carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
perhaps half of the carbon dioxide introduced to the atmosphere has been removed by the ocean primarily occurring in the northern UNK in the production of north atlantic deep water
the southern UNK region may play a smaller role in carbon dioxide balance but it is primarily responsible for cooling the deep ocean
until the UNK of UNK in the nineteen seventies we knew very little about the sea ice cover around UNK other than the northern UNK
the UNK revealed a rather remarkable feature in the UNK sea ice in that there are persistent open water areas even in the middle of winter when the area should be frozen over the atmosphere is cold enough to freeze the ocean and yet in these areas the ice does not form
these are called UNK there are two kinds of UNK one occurs along the UNK of UNK and is essentially formed as the strong winds blowing off UNK just remove the ice UNK the ocean and the ice forms in this now exposed ocean very rapidly and then it's removed by the wind
within these coastal UNK an enormous amount of sea ice could form and then is removed to the north dumping enormous amounts of salt into the shelf water making it very dense and setting up the stage for the deep UNK associated with UNK
the ocean er UNK were also revealed by the satellite images and these were even more remarkable and perhaps more unexpected
in these areas the surface water is UNK deep into the ocean and deep water then comes up to replace it
now the UNK cells which carry the heat of the deep ocean into the surface layer and prevent the formation of ice
these are called sensible heat UNK in that they're maintained by the sensible heat of the ocean
the most remarkable of the ocean or sensible heat occurred in the mid nineteen seventies what's referred to as the UNK an area of about three hundred thousand square kilometres was ice free for each winter for three UNK years
the amount of ocean heat that was lost to the atmosphere during the UNK events in the mid nineteen seventies was absolutely enormous
we have temperature measurements before the UNK event and we have temperature measurements of the ocean after
the ocean UNK by about one degree down to depths of three thousand metres an enormous amount of heat was extracted from the ocean
however although the UNK event is associated with cooling of the ocean it may not have had a very large impact on the carbon dioxide balance
the speed of the UNK does not allow er an equilibrium to be reached between the ocean and the atmosphere c o two content and this is probably true throughout the southern ocean
it appears that the main UNK of excess c o two of the atmosphere is UNK in the northern UNK associated with the north atlantic deep water
and then the southern UNK primary role in a global climate system is to very significantly cool the ocean
so how fast do the deep water masses carry heat and carbon dioxide through the UNK
fall out from nuclear UNK has provided useful for water masses especially as the radio active UNK are effectively time coded
another group of artificial substances which can be used to track water masses are the UNK c f cs or UNK for short
water collected from the deep ocean contains UNK dissolved in it when it was last at the surface and the relative proportion of these UNK depends on their UNK and their concentrations in the atmosphere
denise has used a ratio of two c f cs UNK eleven and UNK twelve to work out where water several kilometres deep in the ocean was last at the surface
the concentrations of UNK eleven and UNK twelve dissolved in surface waters have both increased dramatically since nineteen fifty but not by the same amount and so measuring their ratio in a sea water sample will tell us how old the water is
this equipment can measure UNK concentrations down to just a few parts per UNK
UNK gas through the sample UNK the UNK which are UNK in a UNK
when all the c f c gas has been collected the cooling UNK around this UNK is replaced with one containing boiling water
the UNK quickly UNK and are analyzed by a gas UNK
these twin UNK on the UNK are directly in proportion to the amount of UNK eleven and UNK twelve in the water sample
if we analyze lots of water samples taken at different depths at the same we can then plot a graph of concentration versus depth and get a profile that looks something like this
this profile is for samples that i just north of south UNK in the south atlantic in nineteen eighty six
the red line represents UNK eleven and the green line UNK twelve
there are high concentrations in the top fifteen inches but when we get below the next layer the concentrations become very much less and the ratio of the two concentrations doesn't change very much
as we go deeper there is a slight variation at three thousand metres which we know UNK to UNK intermediate water
as we go even deeper to five thousand metres the concentrations begin to right again and the ratio begins to change
if we now look at the curve which shows the UNK ratios in surface water and look for a ratio of two and lining this up with the nought degree curve because we're working with UNK water which of course is very cold we can see that a ratio of two UNK to the year nineteen fifty nine
these samples were collected in nineteen eighty six so we can calculate that the water is seventeen years old
now we know that UNK bottom water is formed here in the UNK sea and the samples that i've been talking about were taken here in the south UNK so we can see that it has taken seventeen years for the water to travel from here to here
it's not just water UNK into the deep ocean that carries information about conditions on the surface
the tiny UNK in the spring forming enormous UNK blues
on death their placed as UNK and rain down onto the sea floor where they dissolve if the water is deep enough
but scientists at the university of bristol have discovered that even where UNK contain no UNK remains two rather special organic are being preserved UNK if you like
they're very similar except that one has an extra double bond
how we UNK on this was that when we grew some of these UNK at plymouth with our colleagues there we found that when we grew them at one temperature then these two UNK were present in a certain ratio but when we changed the water temperature then the er ratio changed
so we then wondered could this actually be a sort of UNK for the water temperature
and we were absolutely amazed when in going round the ocean floors we found that indeed these UNK in the UNK showed a relationship to the surface temperatures above them at the present day
and what we've done now and with colleagues from germany is to take UNK off north west africa say about twenty metres down into the UNK we sample them in the lab here and took the small amounts of UNK and examined them for these long chain compounds and we were extremely excited to see that as we went down this core back through the last few hundred thousand years we could see our signal on sea surface temperature UNK about roughly in the same way that er has been found with other methods of getting at the past history of the climate
for example where the last ice age was taking place in europe then you can see the signal of the lower temperatures in the UNK off north west africa in the form of this UNK signal
well so much for the sea surface temperatures of the past but we've been looking at our records of the compounds in the UNK even more carefully and what we've seen in there are UNK fingerprints which do not match those of the marine organisms
so where are they coming from
well we've fortunately been able to track them down to the UNK which er occur on land so what we're seeing here is a an input from the land carried on the UNK which are blown in the winds from the UNK and other regions out into the atlantic ocean
so this indeed looks a very exciting new development for us
but anyway the whole problem we face now is how to do more samples because we're only looking at UNK in the UNK of say a thousand or two thousand year UNK we've got to get down to a few hundred year UNK to really see some of the changes in climate that we know have gone on
how are we gonna do this
well the only way we can see is to turn to the to the UNK and the computer experts and to remove the chemical steps from our UNK scheme and use the speed and precision of the UNK types of UNK we already use auto UNK for gas UNK but now we need to bypass chemical steps
one device we are testing is an advanced UNK system with three small UNK coupled together in a series
this device should give us a single analysis in about five minutes rather than ninety as at present as we don't need to separate the UNK we can do the analysis directly
really detailed UNK records at a UNK of a hundred years or less will be necessary to predict the climate change in the future and we'll really need that information if we're going to live safely on this planet
now UNK have a UNK that the present is the key to the past but what we need to do is to use the past to predict the future
in the tropical UNK reef building UNK have been responding to UNK changes for hundreds of years
they act as living tape UNK of the past
when we five and a half years of life of the coral from UNK island in the UNK the remarkable thing about this coral record is that it represents nearly three hundred and eighty years of continuous coral growth
now UNK grow under the sea but we didn't collect this particular UNK there
this UNK came from a reef that was UNK virtually overnight in nineteen fifty four during UNK
this photograph taken several years before the UNK shows the dark UNK to the left and the grey UNK land to the right
the has a small beach
this photograph taken several years after the UNK shows the beach now one UNK from the present day shore line
this UNK brought with it many large UNK of UNK one of which this massive UNK of we UNK and brought back to the lab
so what can we learn about the UNK from this coral UNK
if we look at them carefully we see a faint band in it but we can't count the bands this way we can see them much better with x rays
we placed the coral UNK on film UNK with them with x rays and when we develop the film you see band patterns like this
the UNK light and dark bands form as coral growth UNK to seasonal changes in the water temperature and cloud cover
each band here represents one year we can age the coral by counting its bands just as trees can be UNK by counting
we know very precisely the age at the top of the coral when it was UNK and died and what we've done is counted these bands back through hundreds of years back to the time when the coral first started growing and that was in the year fifteen eighty three
now in the bottom part of this coral the bands are quite widely UNK and are very regular
now UNK are very sensitive to changes in water temperature and these regular bands tell us that the water temperatures didn't change very much
now if we look forward through time we see regular bands like this occurring through the mid sixteen hundred to sixteen forty on up into sixteen sixty sixteen eighty still broad regular bands conditions very UNK to coral growth and in the early seventeen hundreds on up into the mid seventeen hundreds one can see a remarkable change in the character of the growth bands
if you look carefully at this level you'll see two dark bands and in between the growth
at this point the coral was extremely stressed in fact large parts of this UNK died at that time
this tells us water temperatures were changing and we believe this represents a major UNK event which occurred in the year seventeen forty seven
well so far we've just been looking at the record of growth bands in this coral skeleton but we can acquire a great deal of additional information by UNK the skeleton and we sample the skeleton using a small drill and we can analyze the UNK that we collect for the UNK of oxygen
the oxygen UNK ratios of the coral tell us the water temperature at the time the coral was growing
now remember this coral is from the western side of UNK island and at this location water temperatures are primarily controlled by the of cold deep water as the trade winds blow from east to west across the islands
if you look at the oxygen results and plot them against the year of coral growth we see UNK water temperatures and hence stronger trade winds during the little ice age prior to nineteen hundred
the UNK water temperatures occur near seventeen hundred and eighteen hundred a d which also UNK to periods of
the period between eighteen sixty and nineteen hundred is especially important
this was a time of very rapid UNK at the end of a little ice age and if we can understand how the climate changed at this time we're much better able to predict future UNK as the earth UNK up due to the addition of greenhouse UNK
a rise in sea surface temperature will lead to an increase in the frequency and UNK of tropical UNK
parts of the world now outside the UNK belt may soon experience their destructive power
there will be more UNK events in the pacific
UNK in general will become more frequent and more severe
there will be more floods and more UNK
all these inter related events result from the powerful UNK between ocean and atmosphere which controls our climate
we need you in a UNK and the best way to do that is to push your chairs roughly around that grey line
there's a nice UNK one
erm you pass those round in either direction from now on it's bandage time
denise is going to do UNK and i'm going to do UNK and so are you so you have these packs and these packs if you'd like to take one pack each i don't know if there's a pin in them you might find a pin in there
please look after them and bring them back each day you'll find a bandage and a roll of bandage in there and so their your own properties
in your text book you've got quite a lot of information in there about UNK what we're going to do in the practical session and it's always a help i think when you have a lot of the thrown at you to know that you can just put it up and there it is if you get a bit confusing or can't remember what's what so on page one six nine it starts telling you all about nursing and bandages and general hygiene which we've already talked quite a lot about but it's very useful for you to know you can go there and look and if you just go through the pages from there on one seventy one seven one seven two one seven three and then on one seven four it's got the general rules for applying bandages apply bandages when the casualty is sitting or lying down you always sit your casualty down and you work from the front of i say why do you work from the front of the thing
so you can keep
so you can see how they're looking see if they're going pale a bit or if they're going to fall off their chair and talk and reassure them
that's right erm always make sure that the injured parts are well supported bandages should be firm enough to do the job and large enough to cover the wound all of this is the sort of thing which you need to be referring back to if you're in any doubt
on page one seven five you've got how to check the circulation after you've put the bandage on to make sure it's not too tight it's not stopping all the blood supply press a UNK if there's only a finger nail and the it should go white of course if you press it then the blood should go back and it goes back pink again or an area of er skin always check your circulation after you've put your bandage on
now when you've actually opened your pack you'll find what you got your UNK bandage here
now i'm going to show you now how you going to put it away again fold it afterwards opening it up
alright everyone open their bandage up
now when it's opened it's useful as a sling two sorts of UNK we're going to do high sling and the low sling but also if you fold it it's very useful as a bandage too if you put it across your knee then you bring the point up towards you like that and then again fold it the base up to the top again
and again face up to the top and there you've got a bandage okay
one stage before that you've got a very broad bandage which is helpful for supporting things we'll learn about how to use that later
when you've got it to the final fold there you've got your ordinary
fold bandage and if you want pack it away like that you bring the end in the centre there so and again the ends in to the centre just so that they meet like this like this the centre just so that they meet there again start like this ends just to meet in the centre don't overlap them too much and again bend into the centre and you've got a nice little pad if you ever need a pad for UNK on a wound quickly there you've got a pad or putting against an ear or anything you want it for and you open it up quickly and you've got a bandage two of those and you've got a
but it's a very handy way to keep
when you've got your bandage in your pack i've explained to you before you open it up in the first aid kit it's UNK yeah you open it up by the
one hand goes one way one hand goes the other break it open put the cardboard away and you need to be ready to try before you pull the next bit off don't you because as soon as you've opened that it's not UNK any more so you open that up and you find UNK it
UNK it as i showed you before with the first aid kit
comes out first and then you see how the UNK because this UNK is UNK onto the back and the front is the bit you put against the wound and you put it straight against the would without
or touching it and that pad should be big enough to cover the wound so you should something UNK alright and then if you find if you UNK the roll a little bit further you don't want to UNK it completely your see that if while you're using it in practice you need to roll it up again backwards towards the back of the bandage like so we'll roll it up again backwards and when you get to the bandage you just fold the bandage up around the long end and wind the short end round it firmly and there it's ready for use again in practice you wouldn't of course do that for real would you
put away use another one
so that's how you look after your bandages and all these things that we're going to show you you'll find in those little sections in your first aid book so if you get confused or why you've only got to look up in the book
let's do the sling first
i thought we'd do the sling first high sling because it's very important to get it high and not pull it everyone anyone gets asked to do the high sling in their exam and if you can put a good high sling on you're halfway to passing
mm
and from that it can't be bad can it
so i'll be the casualty and at the moment we won't worry about all the various things you use a high sling for we just want to make sure that you can actually do it okay
can you just come back a little further and then they'll be able to see better if all round the side
okay
right now then be like this i'll pretend that i've done something that needs to be a high sling to support me in this fashion
and i i'm going to be working from behind denise because you all need to see but you would be working from the front as i've already talked about so you need your UNK bandage alright and there's your long edge and there's your point as we call it a sort of elbow shaped think of that as elbow shaped because it always goes towards the injured elbow
now that when you arrange your sling in the first place it's crucial to the success and ease of which you UNK the bit round the elbow
you arrange it so that this long side is UNK up and down the body right in that direction
don't let it come across like that the temptation is to think that you've got to have all this bit up here now you don't want this up here because it's very difficult to cope with once you've tied it round to get it round the elbow you want the least amount that you can get just cover the arm and then it makes it much easier to deal with at the end
the amount at the top that you need is just enough to tie a reef knot oh i've forgot to show you a reef knot didn't i
tie a reef knot
we all use a reef knot in erm first aid and again it is in the book a very good illustration in the book
reef knot and then nobody knows how to do it i will show you in a bit but that's enough to do a knot the knot comes on just above the fingers in the UNK of the neck okay
so that's how you arrange it like that the first thing you then do is to tuck the spare bit under the hand cos the hand then there UNK it for you
okay
and the hand doesn't UNK out afterwards and starts popping out and then it's useless then the rest of all this stuff you just get it out of the way under the arm it's all gone right this bit comes up between the two shoulder UNK don't make the mistake of bringing it across there a lot of people do that won't do you have to come round the back and between these two shoulder UNK to get maximum support you've got to hold this elbow up and then you tie it near the hand now i recommend that you tie it and talk to your casualty half tie it and say is that supporting you enough
it feels okay thanks yeah
cos then you can draw it up a little UNK if it's too loose if it's like that and most people do it too loose is that tight enough
no it isn't
right i'll just draw it up a little bit UNK is that UNK for you
better
and now i'll do the other half of my reef knot right and tuck the ends in immediately they don't like seeing ends because they're considered dangerous in first aid so don't forget to do it do the knot tuck it in all in one movement and then it's done okay how does that feel
that's fine
of course you're UNK all the time as you do this
mm
got a bit that's fall down
hello we haven't finished yet haven't finished
now you're gonna want a pin these are rather small pins i recommend that peop people who have got large hands try and fit their first aid kit out with large pins they're much easier to handle but firstly they do not put pins in their mouths for obvious reasons either have it on the table open ready or just pop it in the front of shirt while you do this bit okay
so you're going to fold this around the elbow to give support to the arm and in this one you're gonna fold first of all forward and then back can you see that little neat envelope
a neat little envelope that's supporting quite firm that's supporting the elbow now pin it again now you can see how important it is not to have lots and lots of bandage up here cos what will you do with it then
it's too much if you ever have too much you can just fold a bit down if you have a big bandage you can fold either of those edges down first if you've got too much and then you fold it forward and back now your pin sticks in but all the material and out of all the material and it goes in a straight upward direction again it must go in that direction so that if per chance it comes UNK it falls out and drops on the floor whereas if it was sideways or downwards it would open and stick in your casualty so that's why we have it done that way
would you like to see that again or do you think you could manage it now
see it again
see it again right i'll just do it this time without talking it through and you can just watch
yeah
and i tell you what we shall do we shall change arms
we'll change arms as well
you'll need to practise on both arms
and there's no use getting in the exam on thursday and say ah well i'm afraid i've not done it on that arm so erm lost
okay so there you are you see you're a first UNK and you come up to the person and you hold it the way you did last time and you think ah now that's the wrong way round of course there's my elbow point there's my injured elbow so i have to be that way round mm so you turn it round the other way right your elbow shape goes to the injured elbow and your long line goes straight up and down the line of the body you arrange it so that you only just covering the UNK there with just enough above the hand to tie your reef knot that would be too little and that would be too much just enough above the hands to tie your reef knot the first thing you do is to tuck nice big bit of material right under the hand and anchor it into position just keep that resting there and all the rest of this goes under the arm up between the shoulder UNK there and you tie your first half of the reef knot just above the fingers in the UNK of the neck here now that's important because round the back here if you press on that bit of muscle there there's a big band of muscle if you've got a knot on that it gives a great deal of UNK very quickly so you want to get the knots round in the UNK here that doesn't hurt your casualty there draw it up half the knot is that tight enough
it feels fine
yeah
that feels fine
and then do your other half of knot reef knot and tuck it in straight away you get your pin ready have it on either on the table or ready like that now if you've got too much material ever you just fold that down there if that's too much which isn't too much with denise because it's the right size sling sometimes you have to UNK and then you fold if forward and back firmly take the pin and put it put your two fingers down between the casualty so that your fingers are apart and there's a space between your fingers so you can stick the pin in and out again without any danger if you put the fingers apart like that if you do stick the pin in yourself and draw blood would you please throw the pin away as a matter of automatic hygiene it mustn't be used again once it's been stuck into somebody
or in your casualty
or in your casualty it must be thrown away
do it up UNK it
alright
get another one from the box
would you please make sure that all through these practices that you deal with different people all the time cos in the exam and for real afterwards you'll have to bandage all different shape people and if you just get work in pairs you don't get that sort of practice by all means start of with somebody next door to you but each time you do one go across the room and find somebody you haven't done before
and if the gentleman having to put bandages on a lady and you want to put your hand underneath there just excuse me a moment alright because in the exam one row of you will certainly going to have a lady bandage okay put UNK on and to bandage so it's just as well not to get to you know used to UNK up great big chaps and then you'll find you've got some little tiny five foot two or five foot nothing lady UNK in exam alright so swap around so get yourselves so you've got a partner and use your bandages and let's just see you do the high sling to start
all got safety pins by the way
yeah they had them in the little packs okay
right
how many people know how to do a reef knot for sure
no
right so i'm not wasting my time
a reef knot then
if you look in your books page one seven you'll see a beautifully illustrated instruction on how to do it which you can refer to yourself this evening or later on in the course if you forget but i'm now gonna show you how to do one as well you if you want to know it's there for you to look up you take the bandage and fold it into your narrow fold band and put it round your leg you've got something to tie a reef knot round okay if you know how to do a reef knot already fine just do it if you don't follow instructions
narrow fold bandage you've done it correctly then
the
doing it the same way each time and a reef knot is the opposite way each time alright undo it once again just once again to make sure you know are you ready
once again now it doesn't matter which way round you start you can start left over right or right over left but the second time you do it opposite to the first time so the first time i put the left one over first and the right one over that and then tuck it through just like tying a shoe lace really okay
and the next pick the ends up i put the right one down first and the left one across it and then put that one through and then that's a reef knot no that's a granny over there anyone not sure
that that's the one you have to remember which one you put on which that was the left on top of the right now the right on top of the left yes come on
which one did you do first
that's the right on top of the left okay right on top of the left now you've crossed over again left on top of the right put that through there okay yeah
all okay i think
mm yes all okay now right
i bang my head i cut my UNK yeah everybody i bang my head i cut my UNK not massive bleeding none of the bandages we're doing this morning are to do with massive bleeding they're all to do with what we call minor UNK right so small cut but it needs attention okay so i cut my UNK
cor
okay so i've got my pad
it's a bit tender
alright so i'm going to ask my casualty to hold my nice clean UNK pad that i've got folded ready over the wound there gently okay
yep
then i'm going to take another UNK bandage and i'm going to open it up and make just a little fold this is going to go on her UNK and that little fold just helps with keeping it firm and stopping the bandage slip now just put it around the UNK like that okay
cross it over round the back and back up to the front again do a reef knot here and tuck your ends in straight away of course like so and then this little bit can just be UNK up where you've crossed the two ends and make it look UNK with no ends hanging out no that all that does is keep the dressing secure keep infection out okay
the difficult part about this one is that people all have odd shaped heads now and you find that if you put them on too high they UNK off like that and you've got to think of UNK an egg basically if you had an egg with a little hole in one end and you've got to put a bandage round you'd have to put it very carefully round the UNK bit wouldn't you for it to stay firm and that's the secret everyone's heads different and as you put it round you've got to see where you can get it where sometimes it's over the ears sometimes it's above the ears according to the UNK shaped different shaped heads everyone's different anything else
okay have a go at it and we'll come round and correct what you're doing as you're doing it alright so you want to pad over the wound to keep infection out and then try to get your bandage on top of that to keep the dressing in place
right well we want to make sure that you can get out to lunch sort of by that's running a bit fast that clock we'd like to get you out to lunch by about half past twelve otherwise you'll end up being late don't you with all the other people
right
right okay what now erm roller bandages so you can put those UNK ones away for a minute can't you
let's do the elbow
and we'll do the elbow and knee okay elbow and knee then using the roller bandage
and again here it is two pages further on in your book if you forget how to do it just look up okay
roller bandages
well i fell over slipped over in the car park out there all UNK and UNK out there and i UNK my elbow and i've got a nasty UNK all on the elbow and it's all full of UNK and muck help
come and sit down here my dear
help
let's give us a little
now if we've got a tap handy probably the best thing would be to run it under the cold tap and that hopefully would take away any dirt and extra bits and pieces that are stuck around it
if there's anything UNK in it like UNK or something and it doesn't come away easily you mustn't it comes under the categories of what you call foreign bodies which first UNK is not at liberty to UNK about you must leave foreign bodies that don't come away easily where they are and bandage them round and send them off to hospital or a doctor but assuming it's just a little clean UNK if i haven't got a tap to put it under then i must use little bits of UNK to wash put in a bowl of water and just wipe yeah and you always wipe obviously from the centre of a wound towards the outside otherwise if you start to wipe across the whole thing you take dirt from one side of the wound across and drop it off in the middle somewhere so you wipe from the centre out and throw that piece away and you take another piece and wipe from the centre out and so on until you feel happy quite happy
i mean well if you haven't got UNK in your first aid box but you could have something like a UNK or you might be able to use open up your bandage and you can use you know several pieces of this just keep going down the bandage and then you know clean it and get rid of that bit okay another clean bit okay so you can adapt with whatever you've got in your first aid box yes and you won't necessarily have UNK to hand so you'll have to do whatever you've got and the little UNK are very useful for that but don't use one UNK for seventy five UNK okay one UNK for one wipe and then UNK okay
okay so i'm going to open up my UNK dressing now
so i actually put my arm out straight for you now
do you think it'd be better if you had it bent cos it'll be easier for you after i've UNK it
it's better bent is it
yes
okay alright
it would be better if you can manage
alright
to bend if it's not too uncomfortable
so i can bend it i can bend it like that then
right you can only bend you can only put the arm in the position that your casualty will let you of course but it is more comfortable to have it UNK in that position than having it like that
so you open it up and you find which is your UNK bit and you put that over the point of the elbow and you can bring that once around and you can ask her to hold it for you if you like
it goes in there
right
yes
and then you take your long end and you wind above covering the edge and UNK and then the low then covering the edge and UNK there and again you keep working your way up and down a figure of eight until you get to the end of your bandage then tie away from the body in your reef knot either you tuck your ends in or if that's awkward you can just put a sticking plaster over the ends to get them out of the way like that so just tuck the ends in and i don't think your UNK going to need a sling for a little UNK like that
right and so that she can still move
and as the same thing applies to the knee exactly the same thing wound there you keep the knee bent a little bit and you can do exactly the same bandage like a figure of eight okay
so one person will do the bandage on the elbow and the other person with the good looking knees you'll be the casualty for where you've got to put the knee bandage on cos you won't if you don't roll your trousers up a bit you're not going to have much bandage to do much UNK with on the knee okay so decide amongst yourselves who's got the good looking knee
everybody okay now
yeah
yeah
excuse me i've got a circulation problem
now
all okay then
yeah
a couple more to show you then you can practise these when you have a bit more practice time so we can get you out to lunch on time
if you have to bandage a hand for example okay
somebody's slipped over and they've got all the UNK in their UNK in the part of their UNK and you want to bandage the hand or there's a cut on the hand even on the palm we can do that one later when it's really when it's really a UNK blood we can do this afternoon i repeat again none of these which you've done this morning will control severe bleeding get it into your heads this is just to cover to keep infection out alright these are not to control severe bleeding just covering a minor wound or a UNK right
so she's got her UNK you've UNK it put it into a drop of water ra or else we've used the UNK or the end of the bandage okay now we just cover it okay so it goes over can you just UNK out your hand for me it goes over the wound okay and you can take this one that she can hold it for you just up there right now the rest of this just winds round the only thing you really need to do is to just make sure that you leave the thumb out cover up the bottom right and then come up towards the wrist cover up the top of the pad come back down again leave the thumb out all the time got the idea
right cover up again come up towards the wrist if you've got any more bandage go round perhaps one more time okay and just make sure at the end of the day that you don't tie too tightly round the wrist why not
stop circulation
absolutely so really we want to tie away from this pulse point here towards the back of the hand good enough
yeah
right tie it off in a reef knot if you've got bits that are left UNK they're too long and you can't go round again because it's gonna make it too tight you can either tuck them in or else you can fold them down a nice clean plaster and put it right over the top okay
now that would do that would do whether the whether the UNK were hurt or it was just a minor cut in the palm of the hand there that would do and you can use the same type of bandage on the foot alright so that's if the hand was damaged now supposing we didn't have the hand damaged but we had instead a cut up here okay again clean it and if you clean it with lots of water always remember to dry off around the wound because bugs love a UNK skin to grow in dry the wound before you apply the dressing okay if you can dry it off the best you can and then you're going to place that over the cut remember you want the pad to be long enough big enough okay now she can hold this for you again she can hold it above where the wound is and now when you bandage this one you always bandage from the narrow part to the fat part of the limb you always bandage from the narrow to the fat so you take the bandage down
why
because that way it stays on if you do it the other way it'll drop off it's as simple as that okay cover the pad and as you UNK up the arm all you need to do is to cover about two thirds of what you've just done before just like a UNK you find the bandages the more you use those roller bandages of yours the worse they get to control because they lose their you know nice and UNK so you just do cover up the pad at the top tie always on the top of the arm never underneath here
check with your casualty that it's comfortable yes
and does it feel quite firm for you
not too tight though
no
and those bits again either tuck them in out of the way or better still fold them over and put a big plaster over the top to get them right out the way so no ends are left UNK remember for most people you're doing this for they'll probably be returning to their place of work okay so they need to be safe to return to work everybody okay on that lot
so let's just UNK on the ones you've done this morning you've done a high sling yes
mm
you've used a UNK bandage to cover a wound in the UNK it's not a UNK block wound right it's not the UNK in its wound right it's just a minor wound in the UNK yes and that came round and tied at the front UNK at the back you used these roller bandages to cover a UNK or a wound on the end of an elbow or a knee or the hand foot and then a straight one up the arm okay so a lot of your UNK is using these little roller bandages with the UNK pad and don't forget when you get into the exam do it don't do it the wrong way round remember that you look at your bandage and you put the UNK onto the wound not the other way round right yeah you put the UNK face down onto the wound okay
any questions of anything we've done
all alright on that yes
we get time to practise these again before the exam
oh yes now if by any UNK chance you do have a question in the exam where you're asked you know instead of the wound being on top of the UNK some clever so and so decides that you're good at UNK and you've got a wound over the top of the eyebrow the UNK split okay so there wouldn't be much good of me going a minute pull that there trying like this round there
right okay it's not really in the best interest of the casualty is it right now what dressing would you apply to that do you think
a plaster
plaster
an eye plaster an eye pad
a an eye pad won't really UNK up blood will it
a roller plaster
one of them of course you will you use a roller bandage won't you again
in this instance you can put it across the eyebrow right across the eyebrow ask them to hold it and if you're doing a bandage like this the way to keep it on is to have one part of the bandage going above the ear and the next time you go round go below the ear right go above the ear and the next time you go round go below the ear okay and then finally just tie it off get the idea
okay so they may ask you to use something which you haven't necessarily had to do before so that they're really all that the UNK testing is that you've got a little bit of UNK a little bit of UNK and with what you've got available you can UNK a dressing or use the dressing in a sensible manner so that your UNK comfortable and you're doing the best you can for them okay
lovely
anything else to add UNK
no that's fine
everyone alright then okay it's time for grub isn't it
yes it is quarter past one please
quarter past one back here okay
anyone want coffee
anyone staying here and want a cup of coffee
yes please
yeah we'll do one in a minute for you then
so you have the heart of the centre of it two pumps back to back yes the major pump or the stronger pump on the left hand side why
that's where the blood leads by okay on that side of the heart the left hand side of the heart it's being pumped and therefore the muscle is a bigger muscle that's doing the contracting the blood push out and it UNK back again and that allows the blood to be UNK back down into the heart okay and the next time it's shh that goes out and then it UNK down again and the blood UNK back down into the heart okay so that's what it does all the muscle can do is that muscle can only UNK and then it UNK contract and then it UNK that's what the heart's doing all the time how many beats a minute
sixty to eighty
sixty to eighty you can feel it at pulse point can't you here we'll show you so more in a minute okay
so you know how to check whether the UNK system is working because if it's working you'll be able to find a pulse UNK away yes that's how you check it you know the UNK working because if you want to check it what do you want to look for
rise and fall
rise and fall of chest breath on your hand or your cheek UNK system working pulse okay
and that's what you're checking the other side of the heart the right hand side of the heart with a smaller pump where's that pumping
blood out
the lungs
back up to the lungs okay now in that little system there there's just one thing that's interesting to note when you spoke about UNK system this morning or yesterday rather with UNK you spoke about the blood being always leaving the heart yes via the arteries yes
yes
and always coming back to the heart
by the veins
by the veins there's always an exception to every rule and the exception to that rule in the case of the heart and the lung connection is the UNK artery and the UNK vein you may not get asked anything about this but just in case you do it's as well to know in that instance the flow is reversed in other words the UNK vein takes blood away from the heart and up to the lungs and the UNK artery brings the UNK blood back down to the heart from the lungs if you want to have a look at the diagrams for that and look at it yourself later on there's no need for you to get concerned or confused about this at all there's no need
you'll find the little diagram showing you where the UNK vein and the UNK artery are on page eleven page eleven if you want to refer to it right if you want to look at it in a closer detail tonight that's fine and if you want to see what i'm saying now in a UNK form look on page thirteen now if you look at that you'll see some the blue vein blood vessels it's coming out of the right hand side of the heart and if you look at the direction of the arrows okay they're going away from the heart do you agree with me
they come out of the heart and branch like a UNK one to each lung do you see that now the arrow direction is away from the heart and that's a vein and you'd expect that to be coming back to the heart wouldn't you
and that's the only time you're going to find it when you're linking the heart and the lungs now look at those two areas where you've got blood coming back down into the heart can you see those two UNK there coming back down into the heart do you see where i mean yes
now those are arteries that's the UNK artery but it's coming back to the heart okay that's the only time you're going to find the rule reversed arteries leave the heart veins come back to the heart and the only time that rule is reversed is when you're linking the heart and the lungs through the UNK vein and the UNK artery however they are still carrying the arteries are still carrying oxygen charged blood yes because it's come fresh from the lungs so it's still carrying nice red lovely UNK blood yes even though it's coming back into the heart that is because it's come fresh from the lungs and the vein although it's going in the opposite direction the way you normally expect it is still carrying the old rotten you know used up blood because it's going back to the lungs to be UNK do you understand it alright
that's the only time it'll be reversed
can you just say that bit about the UNK in the vein and the UNK in the wee artery again please
the UNK artery comes back into the heart the UNK vein goes away from the heart
vein goes home
back up to the lungs they are linking the heart and the lungs
yeah i've written that down
alright and if you look at the diagram on page thirteen and you look at the little arrow diagram you'll see that it gives it quite nice and clearly there is that alright
just wanted to clarify that little point so you know the organs that make up the UNK system you know how to check it you know the one slight difference than what you normally expect veins and arteries to be doing okay
now we need to talk a little bit about what happens when the veins or the arteries or the UNK for that matter the veins the arteries or the UNK have a UNK in them they become broken now you already know that the UNK system is a closed system and that the blood can only do its job if it's being transported within that system once the blood comes outside of that system then it's lost the circulation and it cannot perform its proper function any more in other words the body's losing its blood okay what condition do we call it when the UNK system stops working properly
shock
shock do you understand the difference between the loss of pressure and loss of volume would be when liquid was UNK out coming out of the blood vessels okay pressure would be when the heart itself the pump itself had failed or was not working properly failed completely or was not working properly do you understand the difference
obviously eventually if people keep on UNK blood their pressure will fall but you could have a situation where there's not a single drop of blood yet lost to the system and yet the person's in shock because the UNK not being circulated properly off the heart not a drop of blood lost to the system but insufficient pressure so shock can be caused by either of those two things failure of the UNK system because the pressure of the volume drops UNK low okay you did a lot of work on what the person looks like yes you as the UNK you as the first UNK will see this person in front of you what will they be like
what will their face look like
let's start there
pale
very pale very cold and UNK
cold and UNK
okay don't say blue because otherwise you'll get it mixed up with UNK
put
very pale if you saw somebody in a hospital bed who'd just suffered shock they'd be the same colour as the sheet they're lying on their face is absolutely white okay very pale very cold and very UNK now supposing the doctor asks you why are they cold and UNK
why are they cold
because they've lost blood
no blood near the skin no blood near the skin okay why no blood near the skin
mm
guarding er the vital organs
right because the body is acting in order to protect its vital organs and it's drawing the blood vessels near the skin shut down you're not needed there you're needed here in the core of the body because your blood is what UNK your skin up it's taken away from the skin then the skin feels cold and UNK yeah UNK because of course if there's no heat we sweat all the time and especially if somebody's had an accident or is seriously ill they will be sweating yes then there's nothing to dry the sweat off okay what happens when we sweat UNK in the summer time
UNK
you get wet UNK but there's nothing to dry the sweat off not sweating and drying off so they feel UNK okay so we've looked at their colour and we've felt their skin and we've felt that it's horrible and UNK and cold what about their pulse we've gone down to the pulse now
it becomes rapid
fast
faster
fast anything else about it
weak
weak so why is it fast
the arteries are pumping harder
the heart is having to pump harder why
try to get more air into the arteries
is trying to get more blood round the system
it's trying to do the same work with the smaller amount of blood as it did with the full amount ten pints perhaps reduced down to seven got to keep pump because that little bit of blood has got to get round and do a lot more work now okay so the UNK rushing round and the heart is pushing faster because it's having to because it's not enough of the not so much pressure there that's why it feels weak and fast okay
we haven't got much blood now it's working away like mad so now what are you lacking
oxygen
so when you hear people who are in shock they'll be okay and that's how they are they're UNK breath right very fast and very shallow they're not calm they're UNK for breath all the time okay so that's how you see them
what are they going to tell you
how will they feel
want a drink
bloody awful in an awful in a word now qualified how they bloody awful tell me
sick
sick could feel sick
could have a headache
stress
cold
light headed
faint
cold
faint
UNK to talk to
UNK
mm
okay all of those things what are you going to do for them
lay them down
you've stood and looked at them you've listened to what they've told you now what can you do
lay them down and raise their legs
if it's UNK possible lay them down raise the legs how about if they're UNK
maintain their body heat
supposing they start sweating
remove
take some off
okay you want the body temperature kept at an even level don't have it too high don't have it too low cos if you UNK you make use of muscles and then the muscles will call on oxygen and then you'll UNK you don't want them there you want the blood in here if you make them sweat you'll bring the blood to the surface of the skin again to lose heat and that's again precisely where you don't need you want it in the core of the body so you maintain an even body temperature
shall we give them a nice sweet hot cup of coffee
no
nothing by mouth at all no UNK
no
nothing by mouth what else can you do for them
reassure them
reassure them time's going by
check
get help
ambulance
ambulance thank goodness someone's remembered UNK this person's hand and putting blankets on and UNK them telling them everything's alright and blood all over the floor thank god someone's gone to get the ambulance
stem the bleeding
right and stem the bleeding if you can see where it's coming from attempt to stem the bleeding bung the hole up okay
right so now we've got round to what we can do for the casualty let's have a look and see what the body's trying to do here and then we'll say how you'll help them a bit more
if the person's bleeding not just a little tiny cut now not like the UNK this morning this is real this is serious bleeding okay
first of all you've got the blood pressure falls the body does that automatically for itself mm the body does that for itself how can we help it
falls partly because it's shutting down the ends of the arteries the arteries themselves can actually contract because they're UNK yes the arteries can contract and that tends to shut down and reduce the pressure slightly in that area right and also the body itself is gonna divert that blood isn't it to the core of the body taking it away from other areas damaged areas so how can we help to reduce the pressure any more
supposing i've got a cut right across my wrist here or someone has
direct pressure
UNK it
hold it up now you're reducing the pressure to the area because the heart's got to pump harder to get it up there okay so we hold the hand or the limb higher than the heart and that will reduce the pressure still further the ends of the blood vessels contract so how can we help them to contract even more
direct pressure
direct pressure over the wound not your hand but the UNK if they're still conscious blood UNK yes what's helping it to UNK is a special process in the blood
UNK
not UNK
UNK
UNK right it's the UNK that help UNK okay so how can we help it to UNK even more
UNK
a better put a UNK pad over it so a pad pressure directly over the wound initially that's the first treatment done see to casualty put pressure immediately over the wound and raise the limb higher than the heart then the first aid equipment that you'll need is a UNK pad to bind over it to keep the pressure on
pad pressure and elevation in most instances will stem severe external bleeding pad pressure and UNK okay let's just reinforce that for you pad pressure and UNK right and that should control a severe external bleeding
how will you know if the blood is coming from er an artery that's cut
pumping yes if i somebody had UNK me here okay blood from my
artery it's probably quite easy the television set then after that it'll drop off obviously because the body is pulling the pressure down all the time it does okay but if it was a vein
blue UNK
and it'll flow out okay now we know that's the difference in colour and i've already told you that the arteries have got muscles in their walls what's the difference in between the wall of the muscle UNK wall let's put my teeth back in the UNK wall of the artery and the wall of the vein
the vein has got the valve to it but only the veins in these parts the UNK you see the lower UNK and legs arms you don't find those veins everywhere
is that because of the distance they have to travel
with the UNK with the valves in everywhere yes it's because they've got to somehow or other you've got to somehow or other get the blood back up to the heart again it's not under pressure is it any more cos it's lost a lot of its pressure and the way it gets back to the heart of course that is it's lying alongside the bones and the arteries and as you're walking around okay the arteries are still having the pressure working the muscles are still working and the vein lies next to it and the blood is able to be UNK up it's UNK back up to a non return valve that UNK off and it can't drop back down any further and the next bit does the next bit up okay and then that UNK off and eventually it gets back to the heart and the UNK what will that look like when it's bleeding
their bleeding UNK
bright red
UNK
UNK not bright red but mixed it's mixed bleeding really you've got from UNK and very often in any injury you'll get mixed bleeding but are you going to be too concerned and analyze too carefully whether it's blood from a vein or blood from an artery if it's pouring out
no
it's blood that's being lost at a high rate it's dangerous whatever ver UNK it's coming from so you will stop it by pad pressure and elevation you will attempt to reduce the loss of blood and assist the formation of a UNK once you've assisted in the formation of a UNK by putting the pad on it would it be sensible to have a little peak to see how it's doing
no
it would not would it so leave it in position and if you need to put another pad over the top then do that more pressure and a bigger pad never take the original one off okay leave it on otherwise you'll open up the wound again and you'll have all that problem over again so pad pressure and UNK what if it don't work
why don't you put say another pad on top more pressure it's still not working and you've tried it again and it's still not working
pressure point
then you can go to indirect pressure and try to control the flow of bleeding by using indeed direct pressure away from the wound but where an artery okay is running near a bone so you can UNK the artery against the bone squash it hard and for the arm you'd use this one under here called the breaking now press move your UNK muscle away and press underneath there you can perhaps try to feel it for yourself did you do that this morning or not
or yesterday
i did do it yes
mm okay
feel the pulse
so you felt that and that pulse point there if you press on it hard enough you can actually stop the one in the wrist and of course that is controlling the flow of blood to the rest of the arm and you leave a pressure point closed off like that for no more than ten minutes because if you left it on for too long that it means not sufficient UNK getting to the rest of the limbs and the limb must have its blood supply so you leave the pressure on for ten minutes and then release it say for ten seconds just so say that the hand comes back UNK again and if it's not slowing down back on with the pressure again for another ten minutes and that's how you use it tap off ten minutes at the most tap on for a little while if it's UNK again UNK ten minutes at the most tap on again okay and that's how you'll control it so if you do have a sit a situation where the bleeding was bad cos you've got a limb UNK you couldn't perhaps put sufficient direct pressure over that limb this done right to control the bleeding then you could use indirect pressure here breaking or here right in the no playing now please no trying to find this one right now do this one tonight in bed and the old lady said now what are you doing to me never you mind go to sleep
find time
say they just going for a walk yeah and you come across this say this young kid has been climbing up the trees and hurt his leg you're the only person around so you you've got to get help yeah cos he's losing a lot of blood but you've got to stop his blood same time as you've got to get help yeah so what's the priority you just stay
stop the blood
you just stay with him
mm eventually hopefully somebody will come along or hopefully the blood will the blood will slow down enough
to slow it off
will UNK
yeah that's what i mean could you put a UNK on just for ten minutes to try and get help
you don't put the UNK on at all don't mention UNK in first aid work it's a no area
say if it's in such a UNK place you know if you're gonna be there for twenty er for days there's no help
well if he was there and you came along well that's two people so it's not that UNK okay so we have to look on the positive side if at the end of the day you're going to get to a situation where okay you can see that the ordinary erm true blue course of events is just not gonna work then it's down to you have then got to make up your own mind what you're going to do for the casualty and your own safety okay if somebody had been bleeding that long and you couldn't of got help for them what would your priority now probably be
what do you think they'd be like by now
dead
they'd probably be unconscious and they may of stopped breathing okay so you know your priority changes as your time scale changes and you have to be aware of what to do and what is possible to do next okay
if you decide at the end of the day the thing to do is to pick up this kid and run like hell for somewhere you can gain wave for help or put him in the car and drive like mad to the hospital then you might just do that even though it breaks all the golden rules of first aid
that's what i mean because if i guarantee if someone was put in a situation with blood everywhere and that with being the first UNK they've got to stay calm but i i'd say fifty per cent of all people would pick that kid up and run like hell
right they probably would especially if you could
it's just a natural reaction you know
but i mean how about little UNK wouldn't pick him up
it'd break him
start digging
you'll be needing a UNK won't you
seeing as you didn't buy me a pint today
yeah you might just do that as i say all we can do is tell you what is possible okay there are going to be in
your own UNK about what is the sensible thing to do and the right thing to do in that incident and take charge and you will just get on and do the very best that you can you know what you need to do you need to stop the bleeding you know what the person needs he needs medical aid quickly okay
but if you're in a situation where that's not possible then you'll do the very best you can but you're always going to be on the look out for the priorities as they change cos once the person stops breathing they become unconscious they stop breathing their heart stops then everything else has to wait and you have to try and get on with that okay
yeah
so indirect pressure that one then is the UNK and that's the breaking they're the only two we worry about okay the UNK and if they ask where it is don't sort of put two hands over and hang on to your UNK like mad because that isn't really where the UNK artery is
okay it is where the UNK meets the line of the UNK and it's skin deep okay so you'll pushing onto it you'd probably have to put your two fingers and a pad and your UNK right in there alright and you'll feel it yourself best when you're lying down and your knee just up like that that's when you can feel it best because you can push in harder then cos you've relaxed your stomach and that's another tip for putting pressure on it when you've got somebody who needs that you need to relax the stomach muscle but you manage to put pressure up there okay
UNK the UNK muscles not the stomach muscles
right everyone okay so far then
alright so we've done all that lot and you've got your external bleeding under control you've used indirect pressure and direct pressure UNK another UNK there's always is isn't there
you can see the person is in shock there's no sign of any blood
internal bleeding
internal bleeding right so the internal bleeding sometimes shows itself UNK for example if i had damage to my lungs or severe damage to the inside of my lungs i'd cough up blood and that's in what do you think
what colour
UNK red
very red and UNK colour blood okay supposing i had er damaged the lining of the stomach or perhaps i've had an UNK that i've UNK and i was coughing up blood from the stomach what colour might that be
mm the UNK gran UNK
UNK coffee
coffee
colour UNK that's from the stomach okay
supposing that the damage to the UNK was further down in gut area here okay and there was bleeding in the gut
motions
motions right black and UNK okay and according to how the different colour of the motion be there or the different colour of the UNK were there would give an indication of how long UNK been going on or how far up the gut it was and the damage was okay
supposing then that there was water with UNK in it when somebody went to the toilet urine pass their urine where would the damage be then do you think
bladder
bladder or the
UNK
UNK so it'd come out in there okay so those are the areas where damage int internal organs but yet you still have some sign eventually of blood loss but there are still some organs in the body where there is no UNK nowhere at all an UNK the liver and the UNK particularly round here and the liver and UNK have no UNK in outside
if they're damaged and they UNK internally you will see the person as you say going into shock okay and there may be eventually not immediately UNK and swelling and UNK round the area UNK is only internal bleeding showing itself yes so what can you do with that person
hospital
before they get to hospital
yes all the treatment for shock nil by mouth all the treatment for shock and urgent need of aid how else might you suspect that there was internal damage and possible bleeding going on
high blood pressure
well i'm thinking more of
the patient might tell you
the patient might tell you what if the casualty was still able to talk they might be able to give you the history of how they became like they were received a blow got kicked fell onto something hard okay and so on and so on they might be able to tell you themselves give some indication right you would remove and UNK off all tight clothing okay UNK off the clothing for them and then treat them for shock and then refer them to urgent medical attention nil by mouth on any account okay
any questions
just one point you said er passing water through the UNK er blood through the urine is two things er
it could be the bladder
it could be the bladder or what
it could be the UNK okay are there any questions there is there anything that you want to ask
no don't forget again all the things that you recognize from somebody who was suffering from shock right don't forget how we treat them okay and we'll run a film for you now erm no perhaps we won't we'll deal with the severe bleeding on the palm of the hand and get that out of the way
yes okay
we'll show you now how to put on a pressure bandage for severe bleeding and then we'll put the film on and you can see the whole lot again okay so just be in the room if you just push and push and push on the window and er the hand has gone through the window right and there's no glass UNK but it's cut right across the palm and the reason that we show you this one is because the artery that UNK all these fingers comes and the thumb comes up in an arch like that okay so the artery comes down up in an arch across the palm of the hand so the fingers and thumb all get a blood supply so when you cut the palm of your hand there is a lot of blood pumping out okay so what's the first thing i'd tell her to do
UNK
yeah what else could she do
put her hand on top
pressure on
have i touched her blood at all
no
and i have not and i wouldn't want to unless she was in such a condition can you manage to sit there like that for a moment while i'll manage to go and get a pad
you okay at the moment
so then i'll need to go and get my pads and my bandages so that i can put this right you'll need two of these for this bandage the first one you open out so that the pad is going to go into the palm of her hand and that over the top and she is going to grab hold of the other one like that okay now we've got the UNK in there and she's hanging on to it but it was the UNK part of the bandage as i UNK it that went on to the wound there is no time for dressing here is there
no okay so now we're going to actually put this bandage sorry have i got that round the right way
no think it goes round the bottom
no haven't sorry
thank you now we're going to bind this up you take the long edge sorry that goes down the long edge comes first of all over the two fingers and round the base of the thumb
excuse me we can't see
can i can we ask you to can i move you forward that way or would you like to stand up stand up and come round
perhaps if you would like to go round the
come round yeah
stand at the back or something
yeah come round and have a look if you want to come and stand up here close if you want to
okay round the base of your thumb basically what we want to do is we want to clamp these fingers in so they can't come un UNK we want to push them together because she can't keep them shut like that but the next thing is that you come round to the back where the little finger is the next time you come round here you're gonna come round to about the first thumb joint okay and then you're gonna go over the top okay and if you come round again the little thumb by the little finger you come round again to the thumb joint okay come over the top again round we're just making really like the figure of eight but all the time we're keeping off of this wrist here and i'm keeping her fingers in are you alright still
yes
yes okay and we're still coming round yet again and the last one cos she's got quite a large UNK i'll take it over the top round the back and this one now i can tie it off sorry tie it off on the back of her hand now i don't want to tie it off on the front cos in a minute i want to put this into a sling not too tight
how are your fingers
alright
i've left one thing showing this if you you'd got you tuck it in at the top there if you've got some room right i've left her thumb out so that if this is too tight i can check the circulation if the pink comes back it's okay can you get your fingers out
no they're all UNK well in now she needs it still to be up here right so what's the best thing that we can do to make sure it stays up in the high position
high sling
a high sling now we can put on a high sling for her okay that goes up there and now are you still alright
still okay
we're just gonna put a sling on for you and if the blood comes pumping through that what will i do
put another one on
a bigger pad over the top there's the sling and towards your casualty and place it on the body down the straight and the elbow and the point at the same side tuck this hand under and tuck all this underneath the arm and bring the rest of it round the back tie it up as close to the fingers as you can and try to remember how to do a reef knot at least always make sure it's firm is that alright for you
comfortable and firm
once you've done the knot put the ends out of the way straight away and then last of all just finish off this corner here if you've got too much material okay tuck it out of the way you don't want it UNK there out the way and how does this one go
could you also for your UNK just note the following information
country of issue whether it's a five or ten year UNK date and your UNK numbers
again we can we use that information when we go through various customs and border points
if we can give the lists in it just makes it easier
so if i could ask you just to complete that
forms
yes
er there's some more over here they're on their way round
right has everybody got one now
are there any spare green forms anywhere
here
thank you
can you if you can let simply let me have those in at the end of the session or if you can give them to UNK at the end of the session
right
okay wh what er i'll give you time to fill that in at the end
erm what we're gonna do for the second part of the morning is to look if you like at the tourism application for the UNK of demand
i'm gonna start by going back to that graph we looked at first thing this morning which is trying to explain what had been happening to the pattern of tourism both visitors to this country and visitors moving away from this country in the period nineteen seventy eight to nineteen eighty two
and if you wanna look at this graph the period we're talking about is indicated with these dotted lines and you can see the green line here representing u k residents UNK abroad
you've got a very sharp increase and then after nineteen eighty two it UNK a little bit
er it moves up again in eighty five to eighty six and the general trend you can see is still upwards though it's certainly not repeating the growth in this period
at the same time you can see the domestic holidays the UNK less clear but certainly there doesn't appear to have been any growth
now what i want to do is look at what was happening at that time and then try and explain using the UNK of demand what the patterns actually were
and so if we look at what happened generally between nineteen seventy eight and nineteen eighty two the general picture is that the number of total holidays taken actually fell by three percent
and the number of u k holidays taken domestic holidays in this country that figure fell by seventeen percent and yet we can see here that holidays actually taken abroad by u k residents rose a UNK fifty seven percent over the four year period
so clearly in this period the u k UNK moved from being someone who primarily took their holidays in the u k very definitely into someone who was now taking their holidays abroad
now furthermore if we look at what was happening to the population itself remember that under the economic basis of looking at UNK of demand we saw that income was a crucial factor
and so if we look at what was happening to income at that time we find that the UNK income meaning the amount of money we have to spend on other things after we've bought UNK that figure rose by only one and a half percent throughout this period
however holiday expenditure rose by twenty four percent and spending on overseas trips rose by fifty percent
so quite clearly we were experiencing a major change in tourism patterns in this country
now the other thing we should remember is that between nineteen seventy eight and nineteen eighty two certainly in the early nineteen eighties eighty one we were in the midst of a recession and so that should tell us that really people should have less money to spend on holidays
at the same time we know that unemployment in this period was rising rapidly
and so if people had less money in their pockets and they were losing their jobs what factors can explain why more and more people were actually going on holiday abroad
it doesn't if you like make sense and the key year as i say is nineteen seventy eight because that was the first time that spending on overseas holidays exceeded the spending on u k holidays
so from nineteen seventy seven seventy eight the u k UNK now became an overseas UNK in the main
and we can conclude that some form of revolution had taken place in overseas holiday participation despite the high unemployment and the recession
what we're gonna try and answer now is the reasons why this happened
because on the basis of the economic models and the way which we look at UNK of demand in economics this shouldn't have happened we should have had the reverse we should have had fewer holidays being taken and certainly fewer overseas holidays
can anybody s like to suggest what reasons could possibly explain why so many overseas holidays were being taken
or where the money was coming from to actually pay for these holidays
is it to do with the package industry revolution
right
er certainly within package holiday companies itself competition was intense during this period and price being the major factor in UNK of demand all the tour operators try to keep price down to a minimum and over this period you would find the average price for a package holiday would barely have changed one year to the next
in fact if you look at the average price of a package holiday since nineteen seventy eight the increase in prices has been absolutely marginal
certainly well below the rate of inflation
an illustration if you like of how competitive the package holiday industry became
so in fact prices were good
where would people have got the money from
any ideas
okay people could well have been using savings
redundancy
right good
it's thought that a lot of the spending money for these would have come from redundancy payments when people lost their jobs
and that might seem a rather odd way to actually spend some of your redundancy money but perhaps this leads us on to another area influencing the demand and that's to do with if you like psychology
er making yourself feel good even if it's only for a short time
if you can imagine someone losing their job the depression that actually causes perhaps both within them and with their family the idea of being able to take them away for a holiday to forget about things might be a good thing at the end of the day
the other thing is that of course going back to the competition with price these holidays weren't that expensive
we're not talking about vast sums of money necessarily here
are there any other factors which can explain the taking of these holidays
the rising cost of holidays in the u k
er okay it could be the rising cost of holidays in the u k
possibly not so much the cost what other factors in the list of UNK could come into play now
weather
right climate is always a major consideration
er in nineteen seventy six for example we had the long hot summer as people call it
i think we had something like eight and a half months without rain and there's the feeling quite often that when we get a good summer in this country people assume that the next summer will be just as good
and so you can imagine all the people in nineteen seventy six thinking well you know there's definitely been a UNK change we're gonna holiday in the u k in nineteen seventy seven
nineteen seventy UNK summer was a total UNK and that would tend to push people perhaps more towards guaranteed sunshine in the UNK
so climate is a key factor
anything else
okay well let's look at some of the main possible reasons for this in more detail
the reasons i'm gonna give you were supplied by a guy called tony
tony is actually a consultant
he used to be the marketing director of UNK and obviously these trends were important to him when he was at UNK because UNK was actually losing the market
so the reasons why
the first thing we can say is definitely the strength of the pound
the pound sterling was very strong against the dollar and relatively strong against UNK like the UNK
now bearing in mind what we were saying about exchange rates before the break if the pound was strong that obviously implied that people wanted to buy sterling but what goods did they want to buy off us
what major good were we producing or did we start producing around nineteen seventy seven
which brought a lot of money into the country
one major good
output
okay it begins with o oil
okay
very good
north sea oil
north sea oil came on board and suddenly we had a product which people wanted to buy
in order to buy the oil off us they had to pay sterling and so hence the demand for sterling goes up and suddenly we were UNK as a very rich economy
ironically the price of sterling went up so high that it made it very difficult for us to sell our other manufactured goods and many people are now of the belief that because of the north sea oil price rises this had an adverse affect on our economy making it more difficult for us to sell manufacturing goods because the pound was very strong against other UNK
so the strength of the pound caused through north sea oil was a major factor
it meant it was very cheap for us to go to places like UNK for our holidays
secondly there was relatively low inflation abroad certainly in the main holiday UNK in europe
prices were not going up too fast and again this made it economical for us to visit
there was also a decline in real air transport cost
and by this we mean in terms of things like the cost of fuel although it did go up again in nineteen seventy nine but also with respect to new services being offered
er UNK with his UNK the people's express we had a lot of new airline operations starting up which offered cheap seats so that the relative cost of flying was coming down
and the net result of all of these things together is that it UNK the cost value differentials between u k and overseas holidays
overseas holidays now started to look cheaper than actually going abroad
sorry than actually UNK in britain
right the second factor which tony outlined was what was happening in the population and again we've already talked about this
basically there's a decline in the number of children during this period people under the age of sixteen by around about eleven percent
at the same time there was a growth in the age group between sixteen and twenty four of about seven percent
and finally again we've already talked about the elderly er age groups there was a growth in the sixty plus age group of about five per cent
sir is that children
yeah
yeah sixteen under sixteen then sixteen to twenty four and then sixty plus
now in this particular period if you were looking at these figures just like this what would be your automatic reaction in terms of the type of holidays we ought to be providing
what sort of holidays should we now start providing during this period
which age group
right sixteen to twenty four
so can you think of any er brochures or any companies which were around at that time to take advantage
probably the most famous one
right club eighteen to thirty
okay so club eighteen to thirty was doing good business around this period because of this situation
now what we have to do however is look at it in more in more detail than just simply the age of people
we're also gonna look at where they live remember what they're income is etcetera and the important thing is because of these increases here and because of the recession in general it dictated to us that there were gonna be more one and two person households
households without children in other words
and this implies greater mobility both physically and financially
if you picture a for example a typical couple perhaps living in london erm the price of property is such that you maybe start with an apartment
if you want to have children you've gotta offset that against for example having a car or a new stereo things which affect your lifestyle
so the pattern would have been perhaps towards UNK later or certainly having children later and then perhaps moving out of london
so this in a sense tends to reinforce the idea of these households with just one and two people living in them
as the UNK gone on through the eighties and enters the nineties we can see that the number of single households with just one person is increasing rapidly
it's a major market and the tourism industry has really been very slow to wake up to this factor
because if you look in any package holiday brochure you'll still see that in order to get a room you need two people
if you if any of you probably haven't seen any brochures specifically geared towards single people
very few
and yet that's a major growing part of the market
a third area will be social factors and here you've already mentioned the weather
climate obviously is a major UNK of demand attracting people to if you like the guaranteed sunshine
ironically now we're probably moving into a new era where sunshine is actually seen as something harmful giving things like skin cancer er certainly in the australia market it's the case at the moment
and so ironically although climate will be a factor in er this century and into the next century it could be well to escape the sun
the direct reverse if you like of this period here
the second factor is of is the whole question of holiday UNK
the number of weeks paid holiday that a worker will get is increasing rapidly so as today we have the norm of twenty days plus public bank holidays giving more time if you like to engage in a package holiday abroad
another social factor is the whole thing about foreign holidays being seen as somehow superior
remember we keep talking about tourism as being fashionable it's fashionable to say you've been to certain UNK
saying you've been to those UNK in the u k doesn't actually hold the same appeal or esteem
so the foreign holidays because you're guaranteed sunshine cheap alcohol everything else somehow being seen as better than the traditional british holiday
at this time remember the traditional british holiday was seen as staying in a boarding house with a UNK
you had to be in at a certain time you know you had very standard UNK it was it had become if you like UNK in jokes and things of this nature
and yeah another one connected to this whole lifestyle UNK argument the image the brochures give us of a couple si sitting on a terrace with you know you can almost hear the music in the background the sun setting over the sea
if you like giving us the UNK image that we can live that lifestyle for two weeks
very difficult to imagine british UNK somehow trying to UNK that
i mean you simply can't you can't guarantee the UNK for one thing
a fourth factor education
er around this period we have the widespread use of things like colour television which has now started to appear in everybody's homes and the UNK of various holiday programmes
so that again once a week you have a visual image of what different UNK look like but this time in colour
and again we talked last week about the use of colour in photographs in brochures and things if you like to reinforce the sunshine element when you're sat in the snow in the winter watching wish you were here or one of the holiday programmes
video is probably also an important factor
a lot of travel companies starting to introduce video
very UNK today go in to thomas UNK there'll be a video running continually with one destination or another or an activity holiday etcetera
and a fourth factor third factor rather school trips
now again i mentioned this last week the idea of introducing UNK at a very young age to different countries and different cultures so that in fact when they come to go on holiday on their own or with a partner it holds no fear for them unlike if you like senior citizens might do
and it's plain that this in fact is one of the major reasons explaining why more and more people are actually travelling overseas now
the final thing is to do with marketing and here we've got in particular the convenience of the its remember the inclusive tours
you go to a travel agent you pay a cheque and that will cover your accommodation your meals your transport your insurance it can even cover your entertainment
very easy to purchase
if you contrast that with UNK in britain even today relatively few people will be a buy a package holiday in britain because somehow we think we can do it better ourselves
we don't need to buy a package we can simply lift up the telephone book our own accommodation use our own car
and obviously that you can do but it takes time it's quicker just to walk into a travel agent and pick up a cheap bargain
ease of purchase
again the fact that you buy a single package very often when you go overseas
the tour operators recognizing that people had different demands at this period were developing specialist markets
club eighteen thirty activity based holidays to UNK
and with these UNK you can u use strong promotion
if you go past any travel UNK window during the winter look at what they've got on display
invariably it will have palm trees and sunshine
it has maximum impact when we're UNK through the snow and the rain
and the final thing a factor we've already mentioned price competition
now these are the reasons that why tony claims the revolution would have taken place around this period
and these are all re really valid but what i want to do now is start looking more into how a visitor actually thinks
what influences them inside their heads to actually go for a certain destination
and how do we actually use this in marketing
now we started the morning by looking at the UNK of demand
and what i want to do now is to look at two elements
i'm gonna split the UNK into two
on the one hand i'm gonna say you've got the enabling factors these are things which enable you to actually participate in taking a holiday overseas
and then here we've got the motivating factors
if you like the psychological influences
so we might in fact UNK this by saying these are the enabling factors if you like to leave home these are the motivating factors pulling us to a certain destination
and go through the enabling factors first they're very straightforward it's the motivating factors which are more complex
so what are the things which enable you to leave home
firstly if you've got a supply of holiday products on offer
if you've got travel agents round every street corner then it's very easy simply to walk into them and buy a package on the spot
you don't need for example months of preparation and planning in terms of perhaps where you're gonna go
this is particularly true in recent years because more and more people nowadays book holidays at the last minute
very often it's to try and take advantage of price deals but also it's because we now know there perhaps isn't the urgency to buy a holiday in february because we know there'll be plenty around still in june or july
increasingly as well many people are making their own holiday arrangements
er some of you i suspect are already into things like UNK flights
how many how many people are aware of UNK flights
tried it
well not necessarily tried it but you're aware that they exist
yes well it's a few people
these are very cheap discounted tickets er usually using what we might call the UNK carriers of the world not necessarily those which have got a bad safety records or crash records but where the UNK isn't quite as good on board or you don't get an UNK movie
erm just to UNK you've got well known airlines er such as UNK of UNK where you can get cheap flights with them virtually anywhere except ironically to UNK
erm you've got other airlines erm such as erm er UNK of UNK er UNK of UNK there's a whole sequence of them
and if you wanna go somewhere in south east UNK you can pick up flights which are very cheap
less than half the price of for example a standard british air apex ticket
so the supply available is very important
likewise when we go to a country we need somewhere to stay and over the last decade there have been more and more hotels built in virtually every place in the world
secondly you need UNK income obviously
a third factor concerns if you like the demographic situation if you've got children erm if you've got elderly relatives to look after that will obviously determine whether you're enabled to travel and perhaps where to
you've also got geographical factors the journey time
again last week we talked about the feasibility of going to australia for a week and the impact it would have on you after things like UNK
you've got things like UNK cultural factors in terms of paid holidays
how many paid holidays do you get a year and when are you likely to be able to take them
for example many people have four weeks' holiday a year but not many people can take that four weeks all in one go there are usually restrictions that you can only take maybe a maximum of two weeks
hence the UNK cultural factors are important erm and another important one at the end of the day is your own personal mobility
your own health and fitness
now this can become an increasingly important factor because of all the activity holidays around today
for example if you go for a peter UNK activity holiday you have to have a medical first
erm unless you've got a doctor's note saying that you've passed the medical they won't allow you to actually go on the activity holiday
now that's a UNK in many respects but it's also if you er think about it a very good selling point
it makes it sound really challenging and UNK before you've even bought the package the mere fact that you have to go through that beforehand
motivating factors are more complex and the sort of things we'll be talking about here something we call income elasticity
and in fact we'll come back to look at this and bob will also be looking at er with you environmental analysis as well
erm the whole question here is if you have more money in a sense what do you spend it on
in general we find that for a very small increase in for example wages we tend to spend a lot more UNK on holidays
it's almost as if we think UNK well we've got that little bit extra let's go for it
even though in effect you're using more of your income UNK than you would have been doing before
the other thing about holidays and elasticity is the question of what happens when the price of a holiday goes up
now we looked at the graphs and that should dictate in general that demand will go down
but it doesn't seem to work like that
in general even if the price of a holiday goes up UNK the number of people going overseas tends to stay about the same
w we haven't noticed if you like a very big change in it
if you at the statistics over the last three to four years you'll find the number of u k people travelling abroad has always stayed round about the thirty million mark despite what's happened to the prices
a second factor motivating people again it's the demographic situation the fact that if you haven't got children you're free to do what you want
you don't have any if you like responsibilities as such
geographical factors can be a motivating factor er we've talked about the sun and the influence of the sun
you can also have geographical factors again as we said last week to do with things like UNK and obviously geographical factors are very important if we consider UNK er with the UNK of the UNK between difficult and suit UNK
or the UNK as we call them
UNK cultural factors these relate to things like our UNK and UNK and our aspirations
but probably the key one here is the belief that somehow if we go on holiday we're gonna come back totally UNK
again we talked about this last week fifty weeks of the year you UNK and you look forward to your holiday months in advance you then take your holiday and somehow it UNK your batteries so that you're ready to do battle again for the next fifty weeks
it's claimed by many people that we live in a cycle where if you like we struggle to get through fifty weeks of the year to live for holidays UNK the batteries then you go into it again
incidentally on this one you've got the lifestyle aspirations
if you think of what you do on a holiday it's a totally different lifestyle to when you're normally working and obviously people desire to have that sort of experience more and more and you've got the rise of things like short breaks
so again the trend today is towards people having at least one overseas trip a year and possibly two or three short break weekends as well
er increasingly we're also looking at a new market which has a holiday in the summer overseas and in winter goes UNK
again trying to get more of this lifestyle into their day to day existence
comparative prices are gonna be a motivating factor
competition the price of alternatives etcetera and then you only have to look in any travel UNK window to see that that's an important factor today
windows covered in prices lots of talk about discounts UNK all sorts of things to try and get you to part with your money
personal mobility
here by the main we're talking about the motor car
the UNK of the private car has made a greater percentage of the population mobile we can reach many different areas today by private car
and then we've got some factors which i wasn't sure where to put government regulations erm again you'll come on to this later in the year deregulation of the airlines allowing free competition between airlines and low prices
issuing of UNK currency exchange controls these can be both enabling and motivating factors
and finally the big one the impact of the mass media
everything from newspapers to television UNK the lot
and so while these things here enable us to leave home if you like these things are UNK round in our head and in marketing these are things we have to look at in order to we have to be able to make product and then try and assess how will the tourist or potential tourist respond to this
what will they think about it
and so just gonna do a diagram now just look at buying influences
what are the things which actually are going through someone's head when they buy a product
you don't need to list all of these just the headings are fine
we've got both if you like cultural UNK in our head
cultural UNK values and UNK
say at the top
er that's just buying behaviour
patterns of buying behaviour
so the first things going through a buyer's head or that will influence them will be the sort of lifestyle they're actually looking for
the value they're UNK to this holiday is it an important element for them
is it the one thing in the year for them
are they just doing it quickly as a one off
what do they expect to get out of the holiday
now so far we've talked about things like UNK the batteries
what other things is people likely to get out of a holiday though
imagine when you go on holiday what other things are you hoping to get as a result of it
a sun tan
right a sun tan
well you're probably only doing that though in order to impress people when you go back
so you're looking for attention probably more than anything
so attention UNK one thing
have a good time
sorry
to have a good time
okay you could what would you be hoping to achieve during that good time
have a few UNK what else though
what other things do you hope or do you think might happen shall we say
to meet some nice people to go on holiday with
right meeting people
things like UNK are very important with holidays
i mean you all know about the image the UNK have with wealthy UNK and things like that
the club eighteen thirty idea is much along similar lines and if you look at a club eighteen thirty brochure the sort of activities people do together bringing people together
so this is all an important element
UNK
right UNK could be an important motivating factor
er basically UNK yourself to excess for two weeks
drinking yourself to excess for two weeks for UNK
again that would be something
but in general the people who are doing some of those things a lot of it's probably UNK certain type complete break from their work
what other things do you think you would hope to get as a result of your holiday
time to relax
right
okay time to perhaps to relax to reflect
see various water sports
okay so you can improve your UNK at UNK
and certainly there's the fitness activity side that can be an important motivating thing
what else will you do on holiday
all we've talked about so far is drinking and lying on a beach
sorry
UNK
right UNK
so what do you hope to get out of UNK
increase your knowledge
right increase your knowledge
see different cultures
right see different cultures
anything else
take photographs
sorry
okay
look at nature get back to nature
certainly that's the appeal of central UNK
anything else
see how it feels the way that they live there
okay well that would again tie perhaps more in with culture
i mean you can you're starting to get if you like a big list now of motivating factors
er for example all of us in this room if we went to one destination we'd probably all come away with a different combination of things that we'd actually got from it
it might be education it might be knowledge interest can be another one er relaxation UNK having a good time there are a whole se sequence of different reasons
there are other reasons as well things like peace and UNK er time to reflect er and yeah there are other UNK as well which you if you like are kind of negative
for example the desire to escape your UNK existence back here er the desire to escape the family er to have someone UNK at you continually these are all important factors which add on
so in effect there are kind of like negative motivating factors which is basically all to do about escape where you don't care where you go as long as you get away from here
and then there are the things you get when you actually go to a destination
so again if we look at all of these things across the top we've got other things influencing across here when you go on holiday you each of you in this room you'll probably have some idea beforehand of what you want to get out of that holiday
for example if you go on an UNK trip UNK in erm south america you're clearly looking for something totally different than the person who goes on the sort of typical club eighteen to thirty type holiday
other things which will influence it's claimed are things like social class er again used ex er extensively by marketing people in this country
now you'll be doing this before christmas and what it is there are lots of different categories we can use but the standard one is dividing the population into six distinct categories
by and large it's according to people's UNK and you start with a which will be professional people UNK solicitors etcetera
you have b which are managers
c one which would be office workers
c two skilled workers
d UNK workers and e that would be everybody else
okay
and as students you're in e
so this will actually influence you because you'll be able to look through the brochures and see which of those groups it's being targeted at
erm to give you an example let me show you this brochure here this is page and UNK high prices and clearly that is aimed at a and b
looking at this one you can see that the whole UNK totally different like the UNK on the front and the layout
and that who would you say that was aimed at
well it's young people what sort of UNK
would it appeal to you
do you think
er there
mm yeah i think it would
yeah
so we're probably thinking perhaps partly students
er because people in this age group haven't yet become managers and certainly not professional we're probably thinking more in terms of the es and students and perhaps c twos c ones
these are not cheap holidays so it probably rules out the d category
so the social class structure is important
it's also the question of mixing between these groups as well
it's claimed that people feel uncomfortable if they're UNK into a group of people who are perhaps from a different social class or background say
in particular in this country and it's also the same in france and germany
we tend to be fairly what we might call UNK meaning we like to stay with people of our own type
people speaking our own language people who do similar things to ourselves
the final one here again simply economic
again we're back to price and things of that nature
and then we have the individual psychological factors which go through our heads
and the things that actually go through our heads we refer very often to as UNK
UNK
our thought processes
for example if you went to UNK one of your UNK for going there might be to UNK or relax and that would be a UNK
it's something you would know within your own head
we have the various learning processes how do we learn
that's quite an interesting one if you consider as students how do you learn erm in general you probably don't learn that much in lectures because for example we know from experiments that we all have a limited attention span
basically you will listen for maybe seven minutes then you switch off for two minutes then you switch on again and then you try and think well what was i listening to seven UNK well you know three minutes ago what was probably said in the last two minutes
by the time you've UNK that out you've missed another five minutes your brain gets confused so you then switch off again for another three minutes and try and clear everything
and you're doing this the whole time
but how do we actually learn
taking information through your senses
okay you take in right reading listening
from experience
from experience and there are also the occasions very often when you're if you like force fed
when you've got exams you have to learn
you have to be able to hold it up there and perhaps put it down on paper or apply it
we also learn from things like television
most of you here a great deal of your knowledge probably comes from watching television
possibly more nowadays than for example from reading as would have been the case in the past
this is an interesting one the UNK response
how do you UNK with people when you go abroad
are you the type who wants to go up to you're on holiday in spain go up to a UNK go UNK
you know and actually try and hold a conversation with them
are you the type who thinks god there's someone from spain over there oh it's alright there's a load of people from my UNK in the bar and stick with them
are you looking for the interaction where you learn something about the culture from talking to the people or do you want minimal interaction where simply you visit a place and you stay in your little UNK or UNK with people of your own tour company you do everything together and you never come into contact with local people
erm two if you like extremes and there's a lot of things in between
it doesn't incidentally mean that one is good and the other is bad
er a lot of people give the impression that we should all be more UNK that we should go abroad and speak languages to many of these people but the people you come into contact with when you go on holiday in spain the only spanish people are likely to be the UNK who served you and he's serving you as part of his job
his job is also to be friendly to you to smile at you know when you want it so it's not really an equal relationship
it's very difficult if you like to develop a true friendship and exchange of ideas
the UNK very often will tell you what you want to hear
yes
if you think about that it's a very difficult situation
attitudes are important what attitudes do you hold
in particular what prejudices
do you have a prejudice against for example eating UNK food
do you have a prejudice against the french
which a lot of english people do
erm prejudices come from all sorts of things some of them are historical some of them are generated out of things like football and arguments in the evening about good teams
prejudices we're all born with them they're if you like perceptions which are only changed very often through experience
we've then got general UNK themselves which we listed
it's cheap price good deal that sort of thing
and finally perhaps your own personality as well
are you an extrovert person outgoing willing to take a chance willing to take a risk or are you more UNK perhaps
what is UNK
UNK means characteristics
just to show you how this has developed you don't need to copy this down it's something that you'll do in the second year of your course but we mentioned in particular here how you UNK with people and what goes through your head
and this has actually been UNK into two tables and by they claim that you can define different types of tourists according to firstly the way in which they UNK with the local people
so at one extreme you've got the UNK who simply goes off into the unknown
the last thing the UNK wants on holiday is to meet people from their own country
th they wanna get far away from it
they don't really like being called a tourist in many places
many of them will use the term UNK because somehow it's less UNK it sounds more impressive
and these people here will learn languages they will eat the local food they will do anything the locals do they will dress like them the lot in order to try and get as full a experience as possible
at the other end you have what we call the charter tourist
the person who goes there and basically they want to take their home with them
in the case of an UNK they'll want to take their beer UNK and chips everything over to simply a hot climate and they live in their UNK
so you have these two extremes
in between you have UNK unusual mass and so on but they all lie somewhere between these extremes in terms of totally UNK and totally ignoring in many cases
the second type is the cognitive UNK
in other words defining tourists according to what's actually going through their heads
and here for example you might have the UNK mind healthy mind and body the UNK the person who as much as anything may be looking for an experience based on UNK er religion this sort of thing
er you've got also down here experimental the person who experiments if you like with different cultures trying to think of a different way who's interested in religions
now you may think that the number of people in this category here is very minimal but there's increasing numbers of people around the world travelling now who are motivated by things like this
you only have to look at the number of visitors going to places such as UNK er to see the increase there to see how important this connection be
now for our purposes the kind of thing we're gonna do is look at a much simpler breakdown of tourists
and this is gonna introduce you to a new word called UNK and UNK you think you've got you can break it in two you've got the psychological aspects and the UNK or mapping the mapping of the psychology
and this has been translated by a gentleman by the name of UNK
but we don't usually refer to it as UNK theory or anything like that
and UNK identifies four different types of tourist and these are the main ones which we're gonna use
two of them you'll of heard before i'm sure
the first one you won't have done
UNK are the first one
if you're a UNK tourist you're the type of person who's self inhibited
you're perhaps a little nervous of change you haven't got really a desire for UNK or anything too challenging
you prefer well UNK routine holidays in popular tourism UNK and you're looking at the three UNK or four UNK we should say
so you're looking at a package holiday resort in spain in the main
okay UNK
again like to be in the crowds
the alternative are what we call UNK these are outgoing people with varied interests
they're keen to explore to find new things and they're likely to want independence
and in between these two we also have something called UNK who do bits of both but these are the two extremes
so all of you in this room are either a UNK or probably an UNK
the type of person who goes on this holiday is almost certainly gonna be a UNK
the type of person who goes on this holiday to UNK for example want somewhere unusual perhaps to india is more likely to be an UNK person cos they're getting away from the crowds
okay so UNK and UNK
so this is what UNK produced now we're gonna add two more to this two that you're all familiar with i'm sure firstly UNK people
people who chase the sun beach holidays and there's a lust for a tan
so for example w i can't remember your name who's the girl next to you
UNK
UNK is obviously a UNK person in that respect and depending on whether she goes to a main package resort in spain or perhaps a beach in india she can either be a UNK person or an UNK person
and the alternative to this is UNK
the person who wants to explore keep on the move and UNK by some form of UNK holiday
okay so now whenever you look at a package holiday brochure you should be able to identify the market just using two words UNK and so on
so if you're looking at a UNK holiday in europe it's UNK probably and if it's an a coach tour round europe it's almost certain to be UNK
if you're looking for a tour around UNK and UNK that's away from the crowds so we can say it's an UNK
so it's a very simple way if you like for us to define markets fairly accurately
okay can everybody understand that
UNK and UNK
right well you'll be doing a lot more of this in your marketing
er i've got two handouts which i want you to pick up er now
one is something sp specifically written on the demand for the tourism product after nineteen ninety one
try to highlight those factors or the UNK of demand which were gonna be important in buying the tourism products in nineteen ninety two
and the second is something on tourism decision making
this simply gives you it's only a two page handout it gives you some idea of the sort of UNK from what people have written about them
what i also want you to do on this is if you can refer to adrian UNK book the economics of travel and tourism and just go through the relevant chapter on demand
born in church street i was only one there were no brothers or sisters which for the record i regret because all around me i had cousins dozens of them and erm the families round me was big families and it was the there was er times when it was bad weather or something like that and you couldn't UNK outside you'd go to somebody's house are you coming
no i'm stopping in with our kid you know and you couldn't impose on so er if there was UNK falling out i'll fetch our kid i'll fetch our UNK i mean there we you used to honestly and UNK you used to feel it you know erm because when there was any trouble problems or like that there was always somebody to share it well it had the advantages in some ways perhaps you was er had a little bit more UNK than the f bigger family but i in my mind that didn't make up for the UNK of brothers and sisters no b that that's w how i put it anyway
where did you go to school
well i started school at the erm national school in the high street by the fountain
erm nineteen twenty one
erm i UNK erm y you used to erm take have to take exams and if you passed the exams you could go to UNK green secondary school
well i was t taking piano lessons studying for the exams i went over the top i had to give it up and i didn't go to school then for another eighteen months
well when i started to school i went to back to school er i was eleven or er ten or eleven then and i went to field road school that er what er UNK is it was it school
what's the name now
but anyway field road schools and that's
that's where er that's where i finished with school
i finished school when i was fourteen there erm then
what work did you do when you left school
when i left school which was in nineteen thirty it was a bad time for employment there was a lot of UNK unemployed people and i tried and tried and eventually i was offered a job at the bloxwich lock and UNK company in bell lane UNK works it was er UNK were er it's a family er concern and erm it was the first offer i'd had for employment so i took it
me mother wasn't very pleased with me going to work there but i said well it's a start so i stopped
and why wasn't she pleased
anyway to finish that story about stopping and starting i stopped there for fifty years and me mother was still alive when er when i at ninety three and when i retired in nineteen seventy nine nineteen eighty i told me mum that i was finishing and she looked at me i told you that job wouldn't last and i mean i'd done fifty years all but a few months
why didn't she want you to work there
well er it hadn't well i dunno whether i should record this it hadn't very good reputation for pay and employment but anyway
she thought you could do better than that
yeah
anyway i that's what happened i was there i started
mind you er i started and finished there but erm
we was engaged oh i have talked to other people but we was engaged in making locks but most of the locks well they did do a er wardrobe locks small cabinet locks lever locks but one of the biggest kind of locks we di er made was the locks for car cars and vans which in them days was fantastic because most of the car bodies was of wood the framework was wood so erm the locks er were three or four by five er seven by eight and UNK on them fourteen inches long er bolts er the bolt mechanism would be anything from five UNK to an inch in di er square with a radius on the end erm th there was er there was the UNK locks which were smaller erm that was the sort of locks they made
now in the lock museum i've taken some locks th that i collected and took them over there they used to do speed locks UNK locks UNK locks er then as the motor trade changed from all wood frames to metal frames other types of locks i took there but this is what is amazing me they at the lock museum they highlight all the UNK locks which are the UNK which are locks er wardrobe locks cabinet locks and all the smaller type of locks but there was the biggest industry i mean walsall locks are still in existence now they made er locks for cars the bloxwich lock that was their biggest trade was er was er the bigger locks
there d they don't seem to be no mention of th this side of the lock industry
were there any other lock manufacturers in bloxwich itself
pardon
were there any other lock manufacturers in bloxwich itself
not as er erm UNK er well i don't think they er UNK that's i in where works
by the gardens
by the gardens in the corner they made er parts but i mean i've never been in the factory in their factory but i do know that they made erm things for the motor industry
one of their products was erm you when you see in the cars th that they can er make them open top and they close the backs down there's a bracket on the side that er hinges up and well they used to special you know it had come from the UNK of the horse drawn vehicle the same sort of thing well they used to UNK in that and they used to make some kind of locks but i'm i have never talked to anybody that worked there so i don't know but that's the only other one as i as i'm aware of er was the was UNK and er bloxwich lock
mm
so you were at bloxwich lock in nineteen thirty nine when the second world war broke out then
that's right yes
what impact did that have on what impact did that have on the factory
did they
well we cha er
move over to war work
yes we changed to war work and er one of the something we made a lock which was a very heavy duty was the lock for the tanks
oh it was er it was about six pound in weight when you put it together anyway and erm used to make parts for aircraft and parts for the dropping of the bombs which we called drop bars
this was a bar that er went under the bomb like that when they UNK them up and then when they dropped the bombs this bar was in a clip like where me finger is i in a clip so when they released them it dropped out of this clip the bar went as well of course down that went down went the bomb drop bars with it used to be make them day and night and things like that and er of course there was er bloxwich lock and UNK we used to do odd UNK odd UNK and things li and er that was other part of the war work
but it was then it was from er shop floor that i that the when the call went out for volunteers for the armed forces which initially was called land defence volunteers l d v which eventually was broken down to look duck and UNK army
that was before it was nominated as the home guard that's what it originally was the land defence volunteers
well when it was started up the first unit that i was with was from the shop floor at bloxwich lock and UNK and erm it took the nucleus of people off the shop floor and then after we'd finished our ten hour shift during the summer or when we could we started foot drill training in the yard of the factory
that's when major who was on the photo he was major in the army of nineteen fourteen eighteen m c major m c military cross well he took charge and er a chap off the shop floor well he was an old UNK of the nineteen fourteen to eighteen war name of bert he was made sergeant because he was only one who had got any military experience and he started with us on the shop floor in doing foot drill
unfortunately one day when it was earlier on he got his commands mixed up and we was m UNK down the yard and the drive and we was UNK towards the factory up and down and right wheel and about turn left wheel basic foot drill you know it had been going for about ten minutes and all and we was going down towards the factory and erm we kept on going we was getting close to the factory and he forgot his words forgot what er command he wanted to give and he shouted stop you'll be in the bloody factory in a minute instead of sa shouting halt you know he got UNK
oh
were you issued with any UNK
the first er things we had was arm bands which had l d v on that was the first UNK type of anything we had for recognition was them
and then we had the er the UNK was issued the UNK and erm we was had our head headquarters were started the headquarters were started in an office at one of the office rooms at the at the bloxwich lock and UNK company by the top offices we used to call them by the gates we had one of the rooms there for and it eventually became the UNK when we got some equipment because rifles etcetera was in very short supply after UNK so eventually we had a few rifles and er when the er we got a few rifles and er the UNK went it was the practice at the beginning when the UNK went in this area for everything to stop and everyone down the shelter but it happened four or five times everybody realized how non productive this was that the time that was lost and there was nothing happening in this area so it was decided by the r t b that we the people off the shop floor wouldn't stop work until the attack was really UNK or it had started because if this was happening all over the midlands area and of course if you if you multiply that by the number of people at work you can imagine how much production was lost erm and also when the UNK went major at the factory used to get the UNK out from off the shop floor get the few rifles we'd got take we in to king george's playing fields there was a brook running across king george's playing fields then it hadn't and a UNK which was extended to stop er aircraft from landing in king george's cos it was just a big open space
well when the UNK went at the beginning what few rifles we'd got he'd er take us out and string we out along this brook a rifle every so often and facing one way and looking round to see when anything goes up and in case anybody come over or anything come over and er that was the initial start
but afterwards as things got there was erm a look out post built on the flat roof of one of the buildings at the factory and then er there used to be when the UNK went there'd be look outs in this er observation post on top of the factory
well
so how did that work then if the look out could spot some aircraft
er they could er we er ring a UNK in the factory ring the UNK in the factory then the factory UNK would go then
and then production stopped did it
and they went down the shelter
was the factory UNK in any way
no it wasn't
no
i mean it stuck out like a sore thumb i mean er by king george's playing fields erm cos of the they hadn't the th the s other story for that was as i said was we they sent er some of us to a class in walsall for er aircraft recognition and er the days i went to this class cos i went as er both for the factory and for the home guard so that i could cover both the factory and when i were on duty home guard and we was at a building on the corner of corporation street and west and we was taking classes in there
then we was taken out of there into the corporation street where the fair used to be held and we had UNK of different aircraft on UNK and holding them up and we er so as we could recognize them
we came back from there back into the rooms that we having instructions in and continued with our lessons
then when we finished and come out we er there was such a UNK in the street while we were in there taking aircraft spotting a german aircraft had come over and it had dropped a bomb on the UNK had the plane and we had known nothing about it
fortunately though this bomb didn't UNK else i we should of known about it
but when i got back to work the people that was in the observation post on the factory they saw this aircraft it came down low over the king george's playing fields and they could see the markings on it and they'd sounded the alarm but course the aircraft went straight over
but that was well i was at aircraft spotting class when that happened
did you have any special instruction in first aid or fire fighting
no
no none at all
we had a basic training for the for the arms for weapons drill and erm course none of us had ever er had a rifle in our hands until this never mind fired one
well after er we things be begin to get more organized people from outside the factory was drafted into the unit so i it began to be build up on that
UNK off the shop floor were called up so they gradually less from the factory cos er there was less male employees in the factory they went in the UNK so outside UNK outside people as had volunteered and got their names down that things got organized the unit was from all over bloxwich then
but that w that was how it was started was at the lock at bloxwich lock
so the whole of bloxwich home guard really started
yeah
at the bloxwich lock
yeah that's right
and then it
that was the first
it gradually became bloxwich home
first unit yeah
guard
course eventually the i mean there was er there was sergeant who was a butcher out the high street there was alf was a UNK out of the high street there was er frank he was another butcher out of the high street there was er miners er teachers i mean there was quite a mixture of UNK in the in the home guard
how did you get on together alright
yes
we was i can't recall any falling out you know what i mean
er there was good UNK good UNK amongst everybody
erm course the first guard duties guard unit was at the bloxwich lock in the office that was allow er allocated to us
it became the UNK then and er we used to do guard duty on the UNK every night there was someone on guard duty
one night major UNK as he was known came down to inspect and the young UNK who was on guard he challenged him properly er before he allowed him to advance towards him but after he'd advanced UNK him and he'd been recognized major says is the rifle alright
and he says yes he said can i have a look
and he gives it to him
anyway that i mean lack of experience lack of knowledge and put that down to probably but that's just another story
well then as the unit got bigger as i said the room at the offices in the lock wasn't big enough so we moved from there to UNK green infant school that's the school now they used for all kinds of social activities during the day and th on that side by the car park
well we had a r a sch classroom in the infants school there for our headquarters and er storing cos we used to make use we had a UNK on the floor for when we was on night duty erm but i can never understand why we had our he headquarters over there but we had to do guard duties over in the UNK school on th school on the other side because that was the only one that had got a telephone and we had to man the telephones from the brigade headquarters or the to be able to phone to should they want us to be called out and so we had to do the guard duty over there but we slept in the when we was off duty we was in er UNK green school and that was there and then the we moved from there eventually and th the longest part of our life of the home guard the headquarters was at the cottage i've been trying to think what the name of the cottage is it ha it has a name it's the cottage next door to the sir robert peel public house in bell lane
it's the er cottage that's still the other buildings all around it have gone it's the cottage that er next to the sir robert peel that was the that became the that house became the headquarters er
how many men would be in the home guard after you moved your head
eh
how many men were there actually in the bloxwich home guard
well i mean that photo
when you
that i've got that was the complete unit for the company
i've been trying to think what we what the n whether it was d company or c company but i can't recall that was the company that was i just d company of the er south UNK of the whole walsall area you see that was d company
i er
did you ever join forces with any other companies for training
oh yes i can yes
well er i was saying er we went to the cottage by the sir robert peel and that was our final headquarters that was where we was until the home guard was stood down
because they they'd got UNK in that cottage so that the UNK became the ar UNK and there was erm UNK and everything in there and the back of there which was the garden we could use as parade area so it was it was very central and that's where we finished up as headquarters for i'll say d company for bloxwich
yes we was we got out with others
i remember once we was called out on the actual called out for actual UNK of s there was supposed to have been some activity over er UNK so we was all called out and the assembly point was at UNK works in green lane and we UNK er in the at UNK and then we was sent out as search groups er from there right across UNK
now when you say right across i mean you you've ta seen the photos of er shell UNK ground with the nineteen fourteen eighteen war well that's how UNK was then cos it had been UNK for coal and nineteen twenty six strike everybody got it all out cos there was a lot of top surface coal course it was just left there was a lot of mole holes stuff from the UNK when they tip tipped the slag it was up and down and there was buttons brook wasn't it buttons brook across there called buttons brook there was a pool across there called leg of lamb but i mean it er you can imagine what i'm trying to say what the ground was like to go over in pitch black night to go over there and we went out and course we was issued with er UNK which was one of the o only times i can remember when we went really out prepared with live UNK and er we UNK and UNK till UNK and we didn't find nothing
then when we come back to stand down we came back to UNK well we was in UNK so the UNK canteen staff got some hot prepared some hot drinks and so when we come back we was able to have a hot drink and erm it was the duty of er the sergeants to see that the rifles were empty free no am no there wasn't er there wasn't one up the UNK one bullet left in the in the rifle and er sergeant the UNK was checking our rifles anyway he was check and er alright he UNK one and pulled the trigger and there was a bullet through the roof in the in the he was holding it up or otherwise there'd have been somebody on the floor but er he missed this one bullet through the canteen roof
and then we used to do erm exercises with er from different areas they'd come and attack our area or we'd come and try and in UNK in their area and er we had we had a night exercise and we was erm went out saturday afternoon we was out all saturday night and sunday and on the sunday mid day we was still er out and we was in the UNK at the farm at end of UNK lane by bell lane off bell lane UNK lane right at other end we was in their UNK and their outer buildings and we was UNK put out on guard duty from the UNK road to broad lane and we was protecting that area they were supposed to be coming from the UNK area towards us and er we was in the in the UNK and course the m muck and stuff and all that out of the UNK was there and the UNK was UNK in it
anyhow we was supposed to they set a field kitchen up in the UNK to as part of the exercise to feed us er and er they handed out some meat pies you know we just had one ta oh taste and well
you never UNK anything like it in all anyway nobody would eat them the UNK
well they were they was rolling in all the muck in the UNK but they went to the pies just put their UNK round them and turned them over and then they s and true as god made little apples they started walking round these pies and they left them and they were still there when we went away
but they wouldn't they wouldn't eat them
that was our first attempt at a field kitchen we erm when we got back to s be stood down we was told by the er UNK that was stationed there that our headquarters had been wiped out
they'd come from the other way from er UNK lane not broad lane they'd come up from they'd come farther round and come in th in round the back sort of thing and we we'd got no headquarters any more
so we'd had a we'd been out all night and all day and achieved nothing but it was course it was exercises
but erm
tell me something of the hours you used to work at that time
pardon
how many hours a week did you use to work at your job
oh we used to work er f er six days a week er all day saturdays erm eight to eight and er eight till eight at n at er eight till seven at night or er or eight till eight at erm most shifts was early they used to have a an hour er an hour break of a dinner time er sometimes they only used to have half an hour at night because i mean well once you've got er y you was there once you get you shift done it was no good sitting there doing for an hour and er it varies on what production what was wanted and how far advanced you was or how far behind you was you know but er the average hours was as i say was ten hours a shift that was working shift you worked ten hours and then a break in between ten minutes half an hour
and what hours did you have to put in for your home guard duty
you used to have to do er all night from seven till seven erm you was on called out for er on weekends you had to parade every sunday morning
see th this is what i'm saying you'd done all them hours and then you was at it again on the weekend
you'd g had to parade on the sunday erm for weapon training and one sunday we earlier on we hadn't fired a rifle so it was arranged for us to fire a rifle at a rifle range
so we was er called out at nine o'clock on the sunday morning transport was laid on and we was taken over to fire in woods at UNK the other side of UNK
we was there till six o'clock in the afternoon and it took us from the er ten o'clock in the morning say about ten when we got there it took us from ten till six to fire five rounds of UNK because there was that many there and you had to wait your turn
while they went into the firing UNK to fire your rounds and you all you was allowed to fire was five and then you had to wait take your turn course everybody had got to go in they'd got to check them as everybody got had fired their five there weren't one left up the UNK like there was before course it took time see and it took us a day i would say a day to fire five rounds of UNK
and that was the only time that i've fired a rifle cos well actually i went got rose to a UNK i was a UNK when they finished and erm i was in er made cor UNK and then i was er with a heavy UNK machine gun that's the one with the has water UNK on it the big heavy one you see and i was with that team
then when i took er you'd you could take a UNK test which was held at your company headquarters by a visiting officer and erm i then we'd by then we'd had some american weapons come one was the UNK automatic which is a very good er weapon you could r fire single shots or rapid shots
it was the american equivalent to the UNK gun only it was more like a rifle it hadn't got a stand you know more like a rifle UNK you know
and i was issued with that and er i took lessons on it up at head at headquarters and then when i took me UNK test i was asked questions on the UNK automatic and other UNK things UNK to the army and i passed me UNK test
that's the certificate which i regret now is with south UNK museum at UNK
also a photo of all the officers of walsall that i saw in a second hand shop and i went and bought it for a few pence
and i'd got them here and i thought well i don't know what to do with them and i b interested in i'm interested in going back in time i'll go anywhere where i can see something and i'd been over there and they'd got some home guard stuff in a case only a small show and i asked them if they'd like it and they said yes
well i've took that i took that some years ago but i've never seen it on show you know
and i mean i've r now that we UNK got their own department i wish i'd of kept on to it it'd of been interesting
but that's
where it is
and me UNK c certificate i took that as well and they had that as well
and so you i had stepped up a bit in rank i'm a but erm there was being on the social side course being next to the sir robert peel when we went down there it was quite handy although i'm not a drinking man i never have been i'll go and UNK and i'll have half a pint or two halves but i'd never i've never been one to go out drinking
and of course when you was er wasn't on guard duty at the f early evening course there used to be used to pop into the peel and have a couple of halves or some would have a pint and there was a chap in the home guard he used to be able to play the piano so we used to have a UNK in there for a social you know
but erm the UNK there i mean you very often see UNK now i d know them from the home guard but otherwise i shouldn't have known them
you were telling me erm a little while back that erm you were made to go and work at UNK
yeah
can you tell me about that
well this was a UNK board that came round and they was UNK erm what people were doing in the particular factory at and if they thought you'd be more useful somewhere else then they'd direct you to another factory
so this is what they did directed me to UNK at UNK which i er stayed at until the war finished
er it was ooh all female labour
there's some of them was irish
some of the labourers the male labourers was italian prisoners of war and the things that they used to make in their spare time well some of them was very clever you know
such as
they used to make like UNK out of scrap things you know oh they was alright they used to bring them in a lorry used to bring them er in a morning then collect them at night you know
and they used to not make anything but they used to do the UNK movement of work and all like that
they didn't make things but they was responsible for moving things about
where did they come from
where were they kept
i don't know where they was actually somewhere on the chase i think but i'm not sure where i'm not sure where they come from
what did they actually make at UNK during the war years
during the war they made er UNK bomb UNK
erm fifty pound bigger bomb UNK the er the UNK
you've seen the er round say th looking fro on the top of the bomb i it's round and then there's UNK down to the bomb itself er you follow me
well we used to make those rings and put the UNK on rivet them on and the bombs the rings was erm UNK on a UNK that you two w wheels which were UNK driven and the power was put through them and you overlap the two UNK like that and it as the wheels went round it'd UNK them straight along they was about eight inches deep UNK them right down
er UNK bombs they used to UNK the UNK on that do those on stitch UNK they'd go up and down similar to these things you see now
it was the beginning of these UNK you've seen these photos on the on the television where these UNK come down and they go in like this well these was the beginning of that sort of thing because it was worked with a motor and a UNK which er the UNK went round and it'd lift the arm up and when it was went past the UNK it'd drop down and the speed you them out or the speed you sent them out how fast the arm would go up and down and that was stitch UNK
another was spot UNK and they used to make er different containers for the army
we still made a certain amount of buckets and bins and things like that which was their stock in trade but mostly it was erm was erm bomb UNK and UNK bombs aerial bombs erm er and er things like er UNK for bombs like that
but they still did do a certain amount of er the stock in trade course the bins for g for UNK stuff in and all like that
they had there was a small section still made UNK during the war cos i mean UNK wore out wear out just the same you've still got to have a kettle or a bucket but erm that's like everything else there was only a small section so they was in short supply
but erm i stopped there till the war was finished and then er i went back to the lock and as asked them if th there was any chance of coming back to work there you know cos and er they said oh yes as long as you like
so the first opportunity i had i left UNK and went back to the lock so it'd been war direction war service we asked and it counted as me service with the lock that i hadn't UNK me service being as i was directed so that's how i say i had fifty years at the lock
i've got the watch upstairs for twenty six years when i did twenty six years
erm but er when the war finished when the war finished and the home guard stood down i can't remember who was the mayor of walsall at the time but they had a reception in the town hall for the home guard and everyone that was in the home guard was invited before we hand before we st handed our UNK in was invited to attend and i must say with great pride that i was can still remember it now that the wife and i went to the reception and i was in the uniform and it'd be the UNK i presume that was at the door and he asked your name and er rank and he shouted out your name and rank when you went in and you was UNK by the mayor and UNK inside the UNK the hall of the town hall and erm i mean er quite proud to be UNK and mrs you know and it i mean everyone that went i mean their rank and name and who was with them you know was it was quite a er quite a something of to look back to of interest that was you know when we stood down
was there a UNK parade to mark the standing down of the home guard
yes we m yes there was
