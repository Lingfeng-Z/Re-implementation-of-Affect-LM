this was be this was er there was a UNK parade when we stood down but this was er erm something that like that the town in recognition of the home guard cos when the home guard was stood down it was a national er a national standing down so everybody all over the country er everybody in the country there'd be a er a parade of some sort but this was for the walsall UNK of the south UNK home guard that was invited to the town hall for er a reception it was quite it stood in re er i still can remember about it quite something to look back on that was really
did they parade through bloxwich
no
well the parade was er a er in walsall erm in front of the town hall where they normally when they have a military parade or a parade of that sort you know is at the front of the town hall
it was there UNK street isn't it
yeah
yes no we er all the see it was all the units
we did once ha er have er exhibition i er for the bloxwich people erm one saturday
we put on a display of UNK or and er UNK we'd got in king george's playing fields and er talk about the weapons er br brings to mind we had a weapon that was a anti tank weapon and it was a robin UNK heath er UNK made up of a tube cast iron tube on a three UNK with er a UNK ring on the one end which had a UNK for a cap and a trigger to fire this cap
now it was a anti tank weapon only you put a bottle in the tube or a container that had got a i a liquid i've been trying to think what it is can you tell me a liquid that UNK into UNK flame when it's exposed
er it was like a UNK co bo UNK a thing like that and you put it in the in the tube and you put a UNK of cotton gun cotton behind it closed the flap at the back onto er just a UNK like a door a gate UNK which locked it then fired the cap which fired the gun cotton which sent the well then we we're trying this out on the waste ground where the that was then where the UNK offices are now in green lane well there that was at that time that was a glue factory that was the glue factory there ooh
well we was in that area trying this gun out in one of the mole holes that was over there and we'd fired one that was alright
we fired another one but the container broke and the UNK stuff it was UNK er with the explosion UNK on to us and it burnt
fortunately w the UNK was close to we all er rushed to the UNK and wash our hands in the UNK and wash our face cos the UNK had gone on to us
that was the UNK that was another UNK
also when we was giving this demonstration for the people in bloxwich for the our unit in king george's playing fields we'd got all our UNK on show what we'd got UNK machine gun the UNK rifles this anti tank bomb anti tank tube whatever you li gun whatever you like to call it but also we'd got what was termed a bucket bomb
it was a big UNK on a cross with er UNK like cross like a cross
and inside was what tha in the middle was like a bucket container like er it was a kind of a UNK and you fired this UNK with a er a charge and it fired
this was a anti tank and it fired a bomb and of course we put a demonstration on firing this and then we was up the bell lane end and right at the top by UNK farm there was a row of seats benches along the walk there and of course the demonstration was we'd show them imagine those seats are tanks course we never thought in the world we should ever even get near one anyway we hit one and broke it cos they i mean they was only UNK they weren't i mean there was no UNK just the dummy shell you know and we was quite pleased with ourselves being as we'd got an audience
yeah
were there any UNK batteries or anything of that nature in bloxwich
there were UNK but not attached to us
we had them about that
before i left the lock and i was on nights the UNK went one night and this was before they stopped going down the shelter we went down the air raid shelter that is now is the cellar to the club at bloxwich UNK club
it was the air raid shelter then and we went down there and we was in the shelter and er we'd been down there ten minutes to quarter of an hour oh there was such a bang outside we thought this is it you know all the bits and stones and rubbish and er that was stuck on the ceiling was disturbed you know and it down it on top of us you know all bits and plaster and water th it was er UNK close
course UNK out up to the steps look out the shelter oh the UNK still here anyway
wonder wh well what's that you know be a bang so close well it wasn't till some time after we found out that they'd stationed a naval gun somewhere UNK way and they'd f fired this gun to as a practice
course that was only time it was ever fired because it was it had caused that much UNK and disruption with the gun
i don't know what size gun it was you know or any details but that's what we found out what the bang was and it moved on to somewhere else they didn't fire it again
it was while the air raid UNK was o air raid was alert was still on
but there was no aircraft but it was just a practice fire you know
course everybody was er in looking UNK wondering where the what had happened
but the UNK part about it was in king george's playing fields where the cricket club is at the beginning of the war that was a r p assembly point for the a r p UNK
when we eventually came out when the UNK er all clear went we came out look at that there in the a r p UNK er in the a r p's UNK the cricket UNK there was a UNK there was no UNK to it was there UNK of light the a r p had caught us
where was the UNK battery in bloxwich then
you say it wasn't by the lock
i really don't know i can't say as er as i ever seen a unit in this area at all
course though they had the bombs drop down the road here they had a bomb drop just down the road here
there was a bomb
where was that
eh
where was that then
when
where
just down the road here it was just down in howard street
in mm
yeah
yes they had one down there
i mean they weren't badly me father at th er at the beginning of the war he worked he worked at the grove pit down the mine at the grove and he used to be on afternoons
and of course when he was coming home in the middle of the night from afternoons UNK it and the one night they came he was coming home you know the finger post at UNK
UNK road is it
from there to the UNK street where the grove pit used to be straight the way along go over the railway bridge you know it's the turn well grove pit was right in there
well he was well he was coming from the grove to the finger post to come along wolverhampton road UNK road to come home to church street
the UNK on each side of the road was on fire from UNK
yeah
and for soon after that me father had to give up the mine be because of his health and he went to work at the depot er were the bus depot and he worked in the battery house where they made all the batteries up charged the batteries for the buses looked after the electrical side there was electrician he weren't me father weren't electrician but he was working with electrician but his main job was charging the batteries putting them on in groups in the in the er battery house and charging house to keep all the batteries charged up for all the buses petrol buses tr and trolley buses
and er th they used to make some of the batteries up the cells the used to er i don't know if you've ever seen a cell in a battery it's usually made up of er wood er lead and wood
well they used to if a battery couldn't be you can charge it up but if it breaks through from one cell to the other a across with UNK in the bottom so it gaps that cell and that cell so you can charge it forever because the one's UNK the other with the UNK that's arrested in the bottom cos i it's like putting a connection across so it never actually charges
so things like you know and erm he worked there from till he was sixty seven you know in er erm so that's where he finished up were there
but do you only deal with history or have you had anything to do with this exhibition as to the trams and trolley buses here
er
er where the bus depot
i'll be available
gentlemen i'll take apologies for absence
i have alan
yeah
and ken
are there any others
john
john
can i just say about alan apparently alan has been in hospital
oh
had a slight operation and er i didn't know about it until today so erm er paul 's going to offer him our good wishes and we're going to be i'm told he's home again and it's only quite a minor operation and he's quite well and that er hopefully will be back again next week
er we have in fact two non UNK visitors as far as i'm aware there are no UNK visitors am i correct in that
can i then introduce to you i'll introduce the speaker in a few moments quite formally but michael who's the guest of roy
and john who's the guest of UNK
are there any visits away
silence is golden
there are no erm UNK this week so it's now
there is
my pleasure to ah
are there any announcements by committee chairman
any urgent announcements
john
thank you president
just to remind members of the club service committee that there is a meeting tonight at the green man hotel at six fifteen
the same about community service wednesday er seven fifteen at my place
thank you michael
any other announcements gents
right
well it's now my pleasure to introduce
no
our speaker donald who's from the engineering council and is here to speak on engineering
he was UNK as a UNK at UNK and has been thirty five years as the college lecturer at colchester institute
including a an exchange the united states of america and prior to his retirement was dean of studies
donald
good afternoon ladies and gentlemen
it's nice to be able to say that isn't it really
anyway what i really want to talk about is engineering for our future in a way because i mean most of you er listen to the UNK and UNK and all the ni all the er kind of statistics we've seen that come out of the engineering prize federation the c b i wish somebody for a change would put a little bit of UNK on it instead of actually bringing up the statistics which show how badly we're doing
but anyway talking about engineering as a whole quite obviously it's interesting to go back a bit because i'm always interested in the way the institutions actually started because er there's a lovely story about er the UNK brothers and tho ju having just come down from scarborough on a mini holiday we stopped at york and i went over a great big museum there and quite obviously seeing the marvellous UNK you realise that george UNK had er a lot to do with that
the interesting thing of course was his ro his brother robert was a civil engineer and the story goes of course they UNK so much that in the end george said okay robert you can have the civil engineers i'll start with mechanical engineers
so during the er eighteen hundreds of course you've got these two major institutions started up and then of course we got the er UNK when electrical started up and they got the UNK
so you really got the big three institutions but unfortunately like everything else they grew and grew and grew and grew and there's forty five engineering institutions
i bought along this brochure you can have a copy if you like but i mean at the back there are forty five institutions all virtually UNK their own UNK
so quite obviously everybody got a bit concerned because erm anybody involved in engineering at all and you go to careers UNK has everybody got a stand up
it's always a case of who gets there first gets the best position and things like that
but er the government a long while ago actually decided they ought to do something about knocking the UNK heads together and they drew up a plan called the council of engineering UNK where the idea was we get a little of coordination across the entire patch
otherwise everybody as i say were pushing away and discipline itself
well the council of engineering UNK didn't work very well
and then that famous man who died just recently UNK was asked to er present a report to the government about ten years ago in which he was going to knock the heads together again and try to get some kind of er organisation which would actually get the institutions to cooperate and coordinate their activities and that was the beginning of the engineering council
unfortunately the engineering council ran into trouble with the fact that they did want to put some UNK clauses in whereby engineers were responsible for a lot of their actions
you probably realise there are loads of problems from a legal point of view you've only gotta think of the piper alpha and most of the major disasters which do occur
it's very difficult indeed to pin people down quite rightly so i mean you don't immediately want to see a UNK or something like that
but if we had bought in some sort of UNK clause then i mean firms might be inclined to look very critically at the qualifications their engineers have got
we know some of the major organisations in the country actually do look for chartered engineers with the disciplines of civil mechanical electrical er gas engineers chemical engineers energy engineers as the case may be
so the idea was that UNK bought out this report which would then form another UNK over the institutions and form the engineering council of which i happen to be a member
but unfortunately again we're UNK going back history wise the UNK and the UNK and UNK and you've only gotta go to london and see what UNK places they got just virtually adjacent to the houses of parliament you'll find mechanical engineers and also the civil engineers in bird cage walk
and you've only gotta go if you go in the UNK hotel and just turn slightly left and you'll find electrical headquarters there as well and quite obviously they are very powerful organisations
UNK a hundred and thirty thousand strong mechanical somewhere about eighty thousand strong UNK about sixty thousand strong
so when you realise it's somewhere about three hundred and fifty thousand chartered engineers in th u k as a whole you'll see most of them belong to the three major organisations
great progress was made
we did have committees and we began to coordinate activities and er careers UNK suddenly UNK engineering council's UNK and the people all got together again under these UNK and we went to these careers UNK and tried to obviously put across the image of engineering itself
but as i say this is about ten years ago but we're now run into another problem whereby the erm institutions are beginning go back again and want to project their own images right the way through
so as i say that's what i call the erm negative side of the engineering council whereby we've still got problems with trying to er coordinate the institutions
i suppose in a way it's a bit like the tail UNK the dog to a certain extent whereby the er larger institutions rather want to get their two pence worth er rather than let the engineering council take over
but when we look at the positive side and that's where we've got a plan a UNK plan if you watch black UNK at all
a UNK plan to do something about organising the UNK
and this is where we've decided that what we really need is young engineers in other words er people who have just entered the profession itself to talk to the school children
in other words i mean i'm retired and i mean the point is that my erm experience goes back into the er into the dark ages i can almost say because in these days you probably realise i mean if anybody buys a video you don't ask you don't look for the book of instructions you ask about a five year old UNK how to programme it
cos i don't think there's many people in this room could probably programme a video itself
so technology has advanced considerably and what we've done is to UNK on the younger engineers and we've introduced another phase called neighbourhood engineers and this is where we rely on the er UNK of the firms to actually sa let their seconder engineers sometimes but certainly let them out into the er into the schools careers convention work places to talk to the actual UNK itself
it works like this you get the schools involved and realise i don't know how many have read the national curriculum bit like the UNK treaty i suppose to a certain extent
but the national curriculum quite honestly is quite wide and also UNK over primary secondary and also higher education as well
and what we've tried to do is to look at the national curriculum and try to identify young engineers who could go in and help with design and technology and quite obviously practice what they UNK
so we er schools can approach us as the engineering council and say we'd like some help and quite obviously they all want some help when they look at the actual syllabus of a design and technology itself
and er we get a panel of young engineers and a panel of school teachers and they actually erm go to a school they sit down look at the national curriculum and decide which parts they can actually participate in and it's been so successful at the moment realise the trouble is we're somewhere about five thousand six hundred secondary schools in the u k you realise it's a UNK task
you want somewhere in the region of about four engineers to each school so work it out yourself it's quite a job to actually get the ratio right
but in this area of east anglia which of course includes this part of essex itself we have got quite a tidy ratio at the moment of these panels of school teachers and panels of young engineers to actually look at a national curriculum and work out some kind of erm time cycle when a young engineer could come in and actually cross the t's and dot the i's on parts which obviously the teachers don't know about
let me give you one or two specific examples i'm always interested having been in a college for thirty five years in adult education i'm interested in the primary schools and i must admit i get more job satisfaction the moment we go in a primary schools than ever i had when i was in the college itself
and i was in a ca er school over the summer holidays and er we were looking at the design and technology and the point was that they gotta design and make some components and realise i'm talking about you know six seven eight year old mixed girls and boys theirselves and it was ra rather heart UNK to see where the way these youngsters react
i must admit some of you probably were brought up on UNK and certainly not in the mo more sophisticated technology we've got at the moment but the point is a lot of these haven't really seen this part of what i call the basic technology itself and er it was interesting because we were trying to build up some kind of game for their summer fair and the game was quite obviously er you know er UNK a UNK into a er series of slots with er bit like UNK to a certain extent where you can actually er give prizes for the various holes you could actually UNK and things like that
and it was interesting because er we were talking about UNK talking about all types of er mechanics and sciences and the way they'd write up a report at the end which is part of the english part of it and one of the youngsters said to me he said can i go home mr
i said i don't think you can
he said well i only live next door you know in a in a village school quite obviously they all lived nearby and he was only gone about two or three minutes and he came back and once again the young lady will know but erm men might not know i know skirt UNK you know skirt UNK they're on springs aren't they
a the UNK expression round here is fantastic
anyway skirt UNK are on springs and it was rather interesting because he came back with a skirt UNK and also a er kitchen roll tube itself he said i've got an idea mr
and he drew it out actually remember he's only six seven years old and what he'd done was to put this spring loaded UNK into the back of the tube and he'd made a kind of trigger with a little plastic UNK and he said here's your gun
and as pulled the UNK the spring went out and the ball went like that
now that's really great to me because i mean you're really UNK the youngsters at that age and quite obviously i could tell you loads of stories the way this neighbourhood engineers er scheme works at the moment but as i say we are embarrassed at the moment because quite obviously loads of school want us to participate but we got a very shortage of engineers
you see going back in my own experience and er did mention that i was apprentice with UNK realise UNK re pe recruited three thousand apprentices
three thousand apprentices those days
and they knew full well that they didn't really need the three thousand apprentices but those large firms trained no note my word for the country's needs not the company's needs
in other words i c i UNK a e i all the big firms all the er coal mines all the british rail well british rail in those days and these large firms trained large numbers of apprentices and then after the five years they tipped you out i'm sorry i'm going back a long while into what they call an UNK status and then you could either come back to the firm or you could go stay where you were
as it happened as i say i was apprentice at UNK and i moved on quite obviously to another firm who were looking for people like this
and quite obviously adjacent to harlow was one of the largest training schools ever anybody trained at a ford training school was made
in other words i mean that was a basic kind of training you could get as a mechanical engineer
now i mean i'm talking about UNK three thousand let's get back to er my particular home base colchester
colchester was an engineering base there's no doubt about that there was david UNK you must all about the great big diesel firm they did some lovely er diesel engines for the high speed trains which of course obviously been UNK by UNK they used to employ three thousand people and when i started in college we didn't UNK their apprentices on the college site we went to UNK and we UNK one hundred apprentices every year on a five year course that mean they had a five hundred apprentices in a pool didn't they just like that
you guess how many recruited this year can't you
they've gone from three thousand down to eight hundred and th they've actually recruited five
but as i say and then er the other one which i can tell you was which is absolute disaster
colchester UNK company was started in colchester they just sold their site to UNK
so once again i'm on the UNK and UNK to a certain extent but it does worry me because you see somewhere down the line ladies and gentlemen we shall need this skill we shall need this pool of skilled people and at the moment they're just not there at all
cos i say when you've got a pool of skilled people who can move about quite obviously other firms are gonna be very interested and gonna take them up
so at the moment we are really in a bit of a problem about the number of er apprentices being trained or shall we say trainees being trained across the u k at the time a at all
but once again let me be on the positive side because i mean there's no doubt about it there are firms which are doing extremely well in spite of recession at the moment and they are training people as well but they're not training in numbers we really need when we go across the patch as a whole
so what the engineering council is trying to do is to stimulate interest
in a way i'm interested at the engineering prize federation and c b i have also began to realise that we can't survive and i'm sorry if you're retailers can't survive on the service in this country we gotta survive on a manufacturing industry in this country and the only way you can do that is by having really a pool of trained people
but this kind of stimulus neighbourhood he engineers point of view is actually extremely interesting and give you a hell of a lot of job satisfaction because you are getting the youngsters really involved in what it's all about
and i mean we quite obviously we get them involved with er school trips as a matter of fact i've just organised a er thing i've got here at the moment organised a er trip must be a good one mustn't it
UNK b i mean you all heard of UNK we're quite near our UNK
at the moment they've a very good training plant for UNK b they show you the old erm UNK station but they also the pressure water reactor station and course also we've got the very old one down at UNK if you know about down on the me west merseyside we got the old power station down there
but firms are beginning to open up and give us an opportunity actually to take youngsters in and see what it's all about
and really UNK b is really a UNK because it gives you an idea what the UNK like and how we're on top of that new technology itself
so at the moment the engineering council with the institutions at the moment are doing their best to stimulate interest into er engineering across the schools
and at the same time lady and gentlemen to improve the image cos you'll still get the problem you know i'm an engineer what do you do
i repair cars something like that
when you realise of course that there's a hell of a lot of erm scope for well trained well qualified engineers
and perhaps the biggest draw back we've got at the moment that to ge become a chartered UNK engineer you've gotta have a degree
and of course at the moment there's hardly anybody taking the a levels necessary to go into the engineering stream throughout the university itself
so gentlemen what i'm really doing is to show you a bit of the background and the fact that it's not all UNK and UNK there is a hell of a light at the tunnel and in matter of fact we got another lecture on the channel tunnel in a few days time
in other words there are marvellous projects going on which really stimulate the interest of everybody and it's the engineering council's still trying to push them along into the twenty first century itself
thank you very much indeed gentlemen
thank you donald
could i ask er UNK alan to give us a vote of thanks
oh i beg your pardon
any questions
would anybody like to ask any questions
i'm sure somebody would
yes go gordon
yeah
i was interested in you saying about the UNK and UNK which is
yeah
always spread a and i was listening to or during a programme and it said er we're always told how firms are going down the shoot
no one ever says some have been created and all the time they say there are lots of firms which have been created but they never give that publicity at all
no
at a matter of fact it's rather interesting that because somebody actually had a go at peter about this he's a b c er and we er we shouldn't enter into politics about this but you know the background of peter
but anyway the point is he does actually bring UNK and UNK
and you're
yes
quite right the statistics he was actually talking about and somebody actually pulled him up on th up on this and said okay you're talking about the number of firms who went to the wall but what about new firms being created
and of course the trouble is and once again i'm back into a UNK effort of mine is the financial aspect if you actually examine the japanese philosophy then their loan system is totally different ours when it comes to UNK the manufacturing industry
i mean their loan periods are somewhere about twenty five years whereby you probably realise in this country if a young er person wants to start a firm and he's go to the bank they're not gonna give him much scope at all
but it's no doubt about it you're dead right
the number of people who are UNK firms is quite interesting
and also remember the firms which as i say were dying on their feet in any case and i me i did quote the colchester UNK because i felt so personally about that cos it was colchester itself they have actually moved their division up to leicester itself
but i still say it seems a shame that they are prepared to make money by selling it to a UNK of all people to er really make money so they can move somewhere else
which no doubt there are people are UNK theirselves and once again talking locally again of course realise UNK are in a bad way but they have got some marvellous er new stuff coming along but the point is er obviously in the defence industry in the er UNK works quite obviously you're not getting that kind of demand
but on the other side what we call space communications and UNK have got a marvellous new product it's well into the twenty first century
but they don't need the number of people they did before
but you're dead right
okay
john
president i happen to be going on saturday to the national final of the rotary young UNK of the years' er convention this
ooh
yes
mm
weekend
i just wanted to ask our speaker if he's heard of it
oh yes i have heard it oh yes indeed yeah
erm because i was rather sad i tried to UNK the rotary club in the district in taking part or encouraging their
mm
local schools
mm
to take part and sadly there weren't very many
and i think from memory there was no one in the colchester area so quite
oh well
sad but er
i must get in touch with er
well i can give you some names to start with
well you know who
the ex president of colchester rotary is the principle of the college isn't he
you know john
yes well i have met him yeah
yes i'll have a word with john about that
it's very er th er if you like rotary is trying to do a bit
yes that's right
yes i did know about it
and i'll have a go at john
thank you
yes
alan
do you think there are enough places in the universities for engineers
enough places
yes
well that's quite an interesting point because there are enough the only trouble at the moment is not enough people taking the necessary a levels to go into these places
i mean my own al local university is essex and they UNK in er what we call electronic systems theory and also in basic UNK
but i was talking to a UNK up there the other day the actual a level do you know it's pathetic really i mean when you're talking about law degrees you want about threes a's at a and now even accepting c's a level c's for engineering itself
there are enough places but we haven't got the qualified people unfortunately
perhaps some of those erm five and six year olds i was talking about will get there eventually
any further questions
er further to what john said about the er young UNK we were fortunate enough last year to have er our competitor or we had a we held a competition locally
mm
which i think there were four competitors one of whom got through to the district final and eventually to the national final that john is going to on saturday
ooh that's good yeah
erm we
mm
wrote to all the same places again this year and the response we got back from the schools was that this particular year they've got nobody coming forward who they consider would
no
be suitable but
mm
do apply again next year because
yeah that's right
that's right
there are pupils who will probably
yeah
make it next year
that's right
so
there's hope for the future
ah
yes
michael
mr er speaker erm finance always to a certain extent and i wonder about finance in your organisation
no doubt all the companies pay money into their chartered unit and you they pay money to your council
yeah
to run the organisation
yeah
you mentioned about training
yes
and the lack of training do you not feel that the government should put more money into the company to allow apprenticeship to take place rather than of thinking the company's gotta foot the bill every time
oh he's got me a on a good band wagon now
because the trouble is i can go back to nineteen sixty four industrial relations act which i thought was one of the best things ever bought out whereby er the erm terms were UNK to do so much training
the only trouble is it's UNK so many i think they got about twenty eight industrial groups
but the major ones i mean the engineer ones used to levy all firms two and half percent and therefore there is an incentive to do a certain amount of training itself and the finance obviously was self generation itself
now of course we got problems now where they've all been abolished and is virtually on a voluntary basis and i say it'll be rather interesting to see whether UNK actually is going to release some more money cos you probably realise at the moment they're cutting back on that particular budget
but i mean one of the major problems is a fact these youth training programmes or y UNK as they call them are alright but they're not really getting down to the basic er training we need
and as i say you can't really beat what i call the basic training apprenticeships which you're to come through
there's no doubt about it the government should do a lot more and i'm sorry to leave on this kind of basic note the thing what really got was when they were talking about the coal miners and i mean i know that particular area quite well where they said we'll put some money in for training
training for what
cos i wa i was directly involved when i did a hell of a lot of work for UNK they sent me up to UNK cos they got a micro er electronics factory up there doing micro chips and one of the big coal mines up there had just been closed down and they said well there's no doubt about it you know wha what we gotta do is re train the miners
but unfortunately of course with that type of work their wives could do it but the miners couldn't do it
it's a different philosophy altogether
but i agree with you more money should be made available and we won't go into how much money they lost on trying to save the pound
gentlemen
i will now ask er UNK alan to propose a vote of thanks
mr president er mr speaker donald
mm
thank you very much indeed for a very informative talk erm i am actually myself er a chartered structural engineer so what you
had to say was of deep interest to me
unfortunately i'm rather pessimistic about the situation obviously at the moment
erm i think er your idea of getting the ins professional institutions together
mm
to work for a common goal is UNK
but i do suspect that erm i think we're all probably guilty of guarding our own
that's right
very
mhm
very UNK but none the less i think er it's UNK that er you're attempting to do this
erm again you say that you're going round to all the schools and what have you and again this can only be extremely good because after all this is where
the future engineers ar are going to be coming from
erm ha
regarding the current situation recession i it's really hitting particularly my er my er business
mm
yeah
in the construction side
mm
erm er and one wonders after all the training where the future jobs are gonna come
that's right
from
aha
to be absolutely honest
i think that er quite honestly if so if something doesn't happen shortly we'll all be making UNK
UNK ball
erm and i think sadly as well the problem is that if this recession does go on for any length of time then we will be losing many of our
mm
erm manufacturing
that's right
skills
you will indeed
and which we will never get back
mm

i call for the report on the panel on doctrine on page one hundred and eighty five to be presented by dr stuart
dr
moderator i have the honour to present this report on behalf of the panel
our report this year covers four matters though to the first there's really only passing reference
the working party on the UNK of marriage is finding its task UNK but UNK and it will surprise no one that it's taking a long time
we hope however to report to next year's general assembly
the second matter covered in the report is UNK for infant baptism
commissioners will recall that the story here begins with the UNK of UNK with the act currently governing UNK for infant baptism
this is act seventeen nineteen sixty three which basically requires that parents one or both of a child to be UNK be or be prepared to become full UNK members of the church
UNK tried to convince the assembly that this act was bad and was being UNK by many
they also held that where it was observed it was unduly restrictive
the UNK of UNK proposed solution was a UNK of the nineteen sixty three act and a UNK to the nineteen thirty three act which required from parents only a profession of faith
the assembly of nineteen ninety could not agree on an immediate response to the UNK of UNK and UNK the matter to the panel
the panel brought to last year's assembly a modest am amendment of the nineteen sixty three act which it believed was UNK sound UNK sensitive and which would provide a degree of flexibility
our report on this matter was sent to the presbyteries under the act but it failed to win acceptance
in the comments that came from some sixteen of the presbyteries who were against the amendment two things are significant as our report points out
the first is the lack of any UNK in the reactions to our report
this suggests to us that there's probably no advantage to be gained from further UNK with the law
the second significant thing in the comments is the absence of any desire to follow UNK advice and revert to the nineteen thirty three act
the panel recognizes however that there was substance in the UNK of UNK claim that the nineteen sixty three law can cause UNK problems
ministers can experience difficulty when they find themselves in a situation where refusing the baptism is their only option and parents can take grave offence
we therefore ask the assembly today to UNK the panel to prepare a leaflet explaining the UNK position to parents who are not UNK members and who are not willing to become such but who UNK s still which baptism for their child
we have permission to incur the cost of such a leaflet if the assembly UNK
the third matter on which we er report is the place and purpose of confirmation
last year's assembly UNK to us the task of working out the consequences for the service known as confirmation if children are admitted to the sacrament of the lord's supper
after all the title of the service in the book of common order is confirmation held admission to the lord's supper
to be fair to the youth education committee they had already gone some way in answering the questions raised
for example they distinguished between a response of faith from a child seeking admission to the lord's supper and a profession of faith
the first the response of faith from a child would be identified in private consultation involving minister parents and child
the second profession of faith would as now be public and UNK by a course of instruction
the panel has however UNK to UNK to fulfil its remit by analyzing the whole confirmation service in the book of common order and we come to the conclusion that really the admission of children to the sacrament of the lord's supper would UNK only minor adjustments to the service as we now know it
that's because admission to the sacrament of the lord's supper is one element only in the service
there are three other elements which have as we say their own very considerable spiritual and UNK validity purpose and UNK
these other UNK elements are profession public profession of faith after instruction in a class prayer for UNK and commitment to service
instruction in the faith given in late teens or early twenties is essential for young people both those who've received communion in earlier years and those who have not
prayer for strength is appropriate at any stage of our lives and might well be made daily but that does not UNK the UNK of marking one day in our life when someone UNK over us in public and asks that out of the UNK of his glory god may grant you strength and power through his spirit in your inner being that through faith cast may dwell in your hearts in love
commitment offering UNK to the lord in the service of the church and the world is the third and quite prominent element in the service of confirmation as we have it and as we say in a day when emphasis is being laid on the ministry of the whole people of god there is surely value in a definite act of commitment on a definite day
an a an act of commitment and commissioning to that ministry
all in all therefore the service would not be UNK were the element of admission to the lord's supper to be removed from it or were adjustments to be necessary to cover some in a class who had UNK in earlier years
finally this year we report on the statement of christian faith
in our report tribute is paid to dr sheila for her work in UNK the results of discussion in forty presbyteries and four hundred and sixty four kirk sessions
and that tribute is well justified and well deserved
the assembly will note that we propose to drop the commentary which did not prove as useful as we had hoped it might
happily the statement of faith does seem to have UNK itself to a much larger number of presbyteries and kirk sessions and many indeed hundreds took the trouble to offer amendments and improvements to it
note has been taken of these and some of them appear in the panel's revision
the interest shown in the UNK by the church in the statement of faith UNK us to ask the assembly to UNK publication of the UNK statement for use in worship and teaching in confirmation classes study groups and so on
what is envisaged is a simple card and the possibility of inclusion in the new book of common order
again permission has been given to the panel to incur the expense if the assembly UNK the relevant deliverance
it has been UNK to learn that the panel's work UNK so much discussion and presbyteries and sessions have been generous in their acknowledgement of this
the panel hopes now that this statement of faith can be seen as a useful and fairly accessible indicator to UNK as to what the faith is all about and at the same time as a ring of words which at least the majority of us within the church can happily UNK
moderator i present the report and must ask the clerk to move the deliverance as i am the corresponding member
the deliverance
is it seconded
thank you
questions to the convenor
ian number three two six eh question relating to eh a mention in the report eh in connection with the statement of faith the panel say in the report on page one eight nine that they recognize the statement does not fully satisfy the concern for a modern confession of faith which was the background to the remit given by the assembly of nineteen eighty six
eh my question is three parts does the panel propose to bring er a future er report to an assembly with a relating to this er matter
if so does it actually propose to bring a confession of faith er in modern terms and if so can the panel give any idea what form that might take
dr
moderator that's a helpful question i i'm sure
but i must er be UNK in my answer to it
i think we will see how things go
see how this if the statement is approved today erm er if the publication of it is approved we'll see how it er is received in the church as a whole how it used in practice er and we'll have to s see when the time is right to bring forward any confession of faith
as you know there have been the history of it is well known to most commissioners i'm sure there have been m there has been more than one attempt in the recent in the last decade to bring something to the assembly er along these lines
and there is no doubt that a confession of faith perhaps is needed sometimes
we're UNK about what exactly we believe in the church of scotland we say you know recognizing liberty of opinion always and such things as do not enter into the substance of the faith and then we don't say what the substance of the faith is
er so we are UNK and maybe the time will be will come when we really must put it all down
but i think we must be given freedom to choose the time and not commit ourselves to any timetable
the statement just as a as a useful instrument will er i hope it will be a useful instrument er is a step in probably the right direction and we just wait and see
any other questions
are you accepting questions on the statement of faith at this point
we're taking questions on any aspect of the report from the panel on doctrine
i accept almost entirely the oh two six two
i accept almost entirely the statement of faith except for one phrase accepting that god is love i have difficulty in UNK he who created the universe who is love with the UNK the UNK the great white UNK and the UNK
could the convenor of the panel on doctrine help me with this one
thank you moderator
i'm glad i'm moderator now and no longer a convenor
the panel on doctrine is the fountain of all wisdom of course
the problem of evil i who am i to er start embark on an explanation of the problem of evil and el elements of chaos in the universe
all i can say is that the yes of god's love is stronger than the no of his judgment and that i do believe that despite all the UNK and elements of chaos in the world in the universe and in life god's love is stronger and he is a god of love
any other questions
sorry
come moment thank you
er four hundred and ninety
erm would the convenor say erm what he understands from the statement of faith and the statement of faith alone erm to be the teaching on the UNK that is wh what are we taught about the UNK from the statement of faith
moderator the beauty of the statement of faith er the beauty of a statement of faith that wins support or can be accepted as useful in many quarters is that it doesn't er try to be too specific perhaps
and er this has always been the UNK of UNK words that they pointed to the truth without being too definitive about the truth
and therefore people with different UNK of opinion could er unite in UNK these words which point to the truth
and so i wouldn't want to be er asked to interpret any one line of this in particular or to put any particular UNK on it because then you would say aha but that's not what we believe
er if there is a sufficient er indication in these words an indication a UNK as i say if there's a UNK in these words which enables us to see through to the truth then our UNK of it doesn't matter all that much
and then as you know no statement our christian truth can never be UNK in any one statement
another way of putting that is you'll never please everybody but
but less UNK it is a fact that christian truth is not to be UNK with our UNK of it and we must always satisfy ourselves with UNK to it
and i think what the UNK was asking for is probably adequately covered in the UNK section where we talk of giving hope and UNK forgiveness of sin
and i would not want to be pushed further
thank you
question from the young lady
moderator one five eight
moderator between the UNK of infant UNK fo infant baptism and the confirmation service i find myself unclear what do we do with children who are UNK say between the ages of three and twelve whose parents are not ba themselves church members and who are not prepared to take the promises for them
i myself my previous have had this case er where an eight year old wanted UNK and in the event the parent was prepared though not herself a member of the church to take the promises
who takes the promises of a child of UNK years and yet erm UNK
i find i don't know what to do in this situation between the two
er moderator i'm sorry i i've not quite caught the question there
could i be er helped could the s speaker just repeat the question
mrs
thank you
sorry
case given you have a child who to ask for baptism him or herself
the parents are not church members the child is not UNK but wants UNK who makes the promises
and that i have personally already found a problem
if there's a legal question here i'll happily field it to the
i if i if it's a UNK problem i think probably the child er should take er such UNK as they can
but i place great er importance on the job of the elder
the job of the elder to stand by that child and see to its christian UNK thereafter
and i think we these er
can i ask which promises
is it the promises merely for baptism or the promises for confirmation in that the child is UNK and intelligent enough to answer
it must surely be the promises for baptism
just for baptism
as far as
which
you know as far as they're
now UNK to the sacrament
yes
thank you
moderator nine hundred and ten a question concerning the statement of faith
and again perhaps to follow up a previous question and the question is this that in the first draft of the statement of faith which was presented two years ago there was a very clear statement which said that christ died for our sin in connection with the cross and i was wondering what the reasoning was which took away that very specific meaning of the death of the christ into a much more general and ambiguous one in the statement before us today
doctor
er again that's a very specific question to which i can't give a specific answer
you know we have had as you saw hundreds and hundreds of amendments and the thing has gone through an enormous process of er consideration
erm so i don't honestly remember at what point the line that er mr UNK refers to er was removed or was UNK into what we have here
er it became by his death on the cross and has UNK over evil
it's a question of we were told always to be brief it has to be brief you can't say everything
erm and again we must rest our case that we've done our best with it
er the christ died for our sins UNK over evil is er i is our effort at covering v many aspects of that great event
moderator can i ask a second question
if it's in a different subject from what you've asked already
er no it isn't
any other questions
moderator one six nine
i have a UNK here cos i'm not quite sure whether i should be asking a question or proposing something against the deliverance but i have attended and er listened to a number of debates arising out of this matter of er the baptism of children and time and again it's struck me that it starts off about baptism but it turns out to be a discussion about the parents
now i don't detect in the work of the er panel on doctrine up to the present time anything which UNK
i'm sorry but i want to be fair to everybody yeah and i also want to be fair to the debate that's still to come later this afternoon but i've called for questions and i'd like everybody to start their statement with the question which they're going to put to the convenor
it gives him
well
it gives him in fairness time to think out the answer rather than hearing the question at the very end
and therefore i'd like everybody to
well the
UNK their statement with a question
there's ample opportunity in the debate to make contributions
just questions
the question is this moderator
thank you
erm has the panel on doctrine really tackled the question per se what is the theological position of children from their birth onwards and put that in a concrete UNK statement or are they intending to do so
we believe moderator that the statement in last year's blue book did really cover that pretty adequately that's our response to mr
any other questions
i then move to the UNK on page one hundred and eighty five
number one approved
of course certainly
bishop of newcastle
moderator i one two eight six i wondered whether a word from south of the border might be in order because in recent years in the church of england we've been busy discussing the theological foundations and the practical discipline in respect of several matters which fall under the general heading of christian UNK and indeed we have been UNK a bit here and there
erm
and these matters relate to sections two and three of the panel's report and indeed to yesterday's debate
there are three points which i should wish to make
first with regard to infant baptism and its general availability
our general UNK has been reminded of two thorough reports produced by the church of scotland on the subject of baptism in i think nineteen fifty five and nineteen sixty two with their clear emphasis are that the person of christ and the work of christ are central to the understanding of baptism
indeed the UNK is important but it is christ who holds the key to the understanding of baptism and i thought that you would like to hear how your work has helped us to see our way in this respect
and then second er the meaning and practice of confirmation has been much debated among us
there's an UNK consensus nowadays surely that it is by faith and baptism that one is made a christian or becomes a christian and we've also inherited many of us another rite with its origins in the new testament valuable in the making of a christian and the three UNK in confirmation set out in the report before us would certainly be owned by all of us
but our house of UNK has decided that we should UNK to the order traditional for us of baptism of confirmation first communion and our general UNK has endorsed this decision
we treasure confirmation and we fear that any alteration in the pattern might lead to confirmation UNK to be observed
and we also had a fear that with different disciplines and different UNK and parishes that could be a recipe for chaos and confusion
there will therefore be no further experimental schemes in UNK and parishes whereby children are admitted to communion before confirmation
the UNK will be prepared to confirm children at a rather younger age so that they may be admitted earlier to the UNK life
as a consequence the note of UNK commitment will be less prominent in the confirmation of these candidates
and this leads to the third point namely that we have asked for various new UNK to be prepared
UNK which can be offered and used when occasion demands
for instance a rite of UNK commitment for adults or of young people on the verge of adult life who have been confirmed at an earlier age
a rite of UNK made at baptism and at confirmation a rite particularly intended for those who have subsequently experienced some sort of dramatic renewal of their christian life which makes their previous experience of it seem as nothing
and then a rite of reconciliation for those who've UNK from church membership or from the practice of their religion and want to start again in a UNK manner
i mention this variety of UNK which are in process of preparation because the main route whereby people are introduced to and grow in the light of the church baptism as infants confirmation in early teens leading to faithful UNK life that route is no longer followed by quite a number in our fellowship
the scene is much more complex than it was say a generation or two ago and moderator we in the church of england should be much interested to learn in due course whether you too will feel a need to make UNK revision for these various UNK to faith
number one approved
number two
moderator four five nine moderator i welcome the number two in the deliverance but i would make a plea to the er panel that this leaflet be a very simple leaflet and it not be brief but in fact be quite lengthy
my reasons for eh urging the eh panel to do this are that many areas of our church are in deprived areas
many er areas of our church are in areas where the education educational standards are not as high in other areas and a lot of the leaflets that we bring out are quite er unable to be understood by many people in these areas
so i am pleading that the panel really take a great deal of effort in this leaflet so that it is going to be easily understood by even the people who are less well educated than some of us
for instance most of this debate would not have been understood by many people in my parish
and i would urge the panel to send out their proposed leaflet to the ministers in various areas where the educational standards are not very high that they may look at them and put forward suggestions so that the leaflet that eventually comes out will be understood by the whole of our people and not just by the most educated
thank you moderator
mr
moderator two seven eight
moderator i have a counter motion to deliverance two in the following terms
instruct the panel on doctrine and the board of practice and procedure to hold area conferences with presbyteries to see if there is a need for new legislation on UNK for infant baptism
moderator i am not convinced that in rejecting the legislation that went down under the barrier act presbyteries were merely UNK the status quo
i suspect from what i heard in conversation from others in other presbyteries is that many of them were in favour of change but simply did not feel that what was proposed was an improvement to what we have already
and i fear therefore that we're in precisely the same position as we were when the UNK of UNK brought their UNK to us
and because i fear that is the position i cannot help but feel that before long we will have yet another attempt to amend act seventeen nineteen sixty three and that we will go round the circuit the same circuit once again with i fear the same result
my hope and at this stage it can only be a hope is that if consultations are held with presbyteries a consensus will emerge as to the nature of the changes to act seventeen that are required and that consensus will enable the act to be successfully amended
moderator i would simply UNK as an example of what i have in mind the conferences organized by the assembly council which successfully resolved the problem of necessary buildings
moderator i move
mr before we can ask for a seconder on it i'd ask the clerk to make a de definition about expenditure that has not necessarily been UNK beforehand
yes moderator i think it was mr who drew my attention yesterday
to standing or order nineteen fifty four about new or additional expenditure which says that any proposal which involves new or additional expenditure etcetera must be in the hands of commissioners and printed in proper form
now the board of practice and procedure has a budget and w which we have already negotiated and we're hoping to be able to hold our UNK clerks conference but there is nothing in the budget that could possibly cope with these additional conferences and these would therefore be new and additional expenditure and this motion cannot therefore be treated as competent
UNK with one's own UNK
you may make a comment dr
yes number two is still before the assembly
moderator it is said that a passion for consistency is the mark of a small mind which probably explains why i have a passion for consistency
it seems to me that we are UNK to be very inconsistent in regard to two matters which have recently been very much before us
in the when we dealt with the matter of children and communion we based the whole case upon the doctrine that nothing must be allowed to stand in the way of the grace of god being available for all and UNK
nothing must be allowed to stand in the way of that
children if they mu must be allowed to come forward and share in that grace at the lord's table and so on
when we come to deal with infant baptism we take the view that the failure of parents to measure up to certain standards is to be allowed to stand in the way of the grace of god being available for their children
this is particularly difficult in view of the fact that it is just their children who are probably far more in need of that grace of god just because of the attitude of their parents than those of parents who measure up to all the standards that we impose
now i'm aware that many parents bring their children for baptism from reasons of UNK or custom or anything you like i'm reminded of a certain tax UNK who UNK by sheer idle UNK a tree UNK maybe took him up the tree but it was the grace of god that brought him down
and i care not what may be the motive of the parents who bring their children and want them offered to christ in the sacrament of baptism it is the grace of god that is available for them there and i think we should be very UNK about these matters and try to take up either one position or the other
either the grace should be available to all or there should be a right to impose restrictions
thank you
this gentleman thank you
one six one six seven
erm it's with a view to in fact er dr 's point that i want to speak
erm this whole problem does give ministers erm a great deal of tension and heart searching erm and er we're in the throws of looking for a leaflet that's gonna help ministers faced with er parents who come and have to be turned away because we feel embarrassed we feel erm the weight of our turning away people and our UNK to minister the grace of god to them although i'd of thought gravity of but er anyway erm er but we have this problem and erm it seems to me that one way out of it is to pick up on what our brother from the church of england said and look at new UNK and new ways in which we can open our arms to a public out there which is desperately in need of UNK of passage
and the only erm body with any integrity and any standing in the eyes of the people of scotland is the church of scotland
we have the UNK of passage and the public out there whether they are UNK or christian want UNK of passage
unfortunately our UNK of passage are specifically designated for christians and that is quite clear
and you look at the er the UNK in the in the order er the book of common order for baptism and it is designated for christian people that particular rite of passage
the rite of passage of marriage is not interestingly enough if one looks at it carefully but baptism certainly is
erm and er what i would like to see and i've long wanted to see this coming out of the church is a rite of passage that i with integrity can offer to any parents who come to me with a lovely little baby in their arms saying to me parish minister can you give us something that would satisfy us and they're not saying it like this but they want a rite of passage
i would erm love to be able to offer them something that had the UNK of the whole church and the weight of the church behind it erm which could satisfy the UNK for me to do this
erm and i would see that in terms of a service of UNK some kind of service of UNK where i could pray with them we could pray for the child in their arms in the face of the congregation and ask god's blessing on the life of that child and see that as a celebration of UNK and a prayer of blessing for that child
and we would not be asking the parents to say things they didn't believe or make promises that they had no intention of fulfilling
erm and we could offer this to the whole er t to anyone who came to us and therefore be seen to be a church which was very accepting and outward going and missionary minded because all too often we hear ministers talking about erm using UNK baptism as an UNK tool er c talk which i greatly resent and resist
so erm the point of my remarks is to add to number two the following er the following words erm and urge the panel to bring forward suggestions for a rite celebrating the gift of new birth
and i so move
is that
is that seconded
thank you
any discussion on this new er on this amendment
on this addendum
moderator i tell you what the convenor would say six four o is it for the panel to bring forward a rite or is it for the er committee on worship to bring forward UNK
erm i think we're asking the panel on doctrine to do something that is not really within their remit at the moment
this is not your summing up this is only answering mr 's point dr
er i think mr is probably right correct er that UNK
er this is probably a job for the panel on worship
nevertheless in case i seem to be just er avoiding the question er i would have to say that this has been asked for before and we have UNK time and again that's the history of the matter on the grounds that what these parents are really asking for is baptism and it's our opportunity to er to speak in these terms er and it's a gold golden opportunity if they actually come to us
one o six five
i would resist that addition to the er paragraph in the deliverance
it seems to me that the new testament says very clearly that many people came to jesus asking for a sign and he pointed to himself
we are a christian church and we should be speaking of things of christ
thank you
seven one seven
moderator i too would want to resist th the addendum that has been proposed for number two because it seems to me that we're concerned as a church with the issue of baptism and UNK and we want to keep our mind and our ideas firmly fixed on that however unpleasant and uncomfortable it is
it seems to me that however attractive this addendum is it's taking us away from the real issue which is about the baptism one which the bishop er also kind of brought up er and which we've been exercising ourselves over
sadly mr 's proposal fell on a UNK but i think he put his finger on something which i felt the assembly was responding to that we are not finished with this issue and although it fell on a UNK about money perhaps without making any UNK and motions we might er refuse this addendum and keep our minds on the baptism issue and hope that the board of practice and procedure and the panel on doctrine will pick up the substance and the essence of what mr was asking for and pursue this matter until as a church we can get it sorted out to the satisfaction of all the groups within the church
let's not go down a side road however as it were appealing it may be let's stick to the main difficult one and keep UNK it until we can get an answer
i hope that the assembly will not take this addendum and then i hope the two boards concerned will take on the issue as mr suggested
thank you
er one two three five
i feel that not a enough emphasis has been put on the UNK that er parents take and the responsibility the minister has in UNK those UNK and therefore i support er the new amendment because of this that it offers er a form of UNK without the risk of having the parents taking UNK that they do not er that they cannot keep
moderator might i ask a question
i'm sorry but that lady
j a one six one
erm i would like to formally second mr because i followed a situation where the previous minister had UNK anyone and when i arrived i discussed with the session what our policy on baptism was and we UNK that we should follow the nineteen sixty three law but apply it under grace and with the spirit of god in mind and we had some very difficult situations when people said to me no i have no time for god in my life but i want you to UNK my baby
and they could not understand why i refused to UNK their baby
we need something else that we can give people that still shows them the love of god
sh that th the people were willing to make promises that they did not wish to keep that they would not keep and i in all UNK could not let them do that and they went away extremely hurt and that particular situation unfortunately became extremely tragic later on
i don't wish that to happen again
thank you
mr
moderator might i ask a question er perhaps a supplementary
is there any reason why the conference which is budgeted for might not be used to reflect the mind of presbyteries on the proposal that mr was putting forward
and in the event of that answer being yes will it be done
i think mr you've anticipated a statement that was going to be given shortly by mr
yes i think so
er moderator er there isn't any reason in principle why this sh shouldn't happen that er this subject couldn't come up at the UNK clerks conference
it has to be said however that the UNK clerks er write their own agenda for these meetings er for these conferences and er it would be up to presbyteries to instruct their clerks that had to go on their agenda
mr is a UNK clerk so i think your point will be well answered
four seven
unless i have missed it earlier in this debate i think there may be a point of clarification which may need to be made er with the result of yesterday's decision and that is that section two which we're now discussing speaks of the position of parents who are not UNK members
do i take it now to mean that means parents who have not been UNK
because it is the grace of baptism UNK to an infant which allows them to receive the grace of communion and therefore they are in essential as well as being universal members of the church they're UNK they're UNK members of the church
and therefore the requirement is simply for a parent asking for baptism for their child to have been UNK
is that
moderator the erm UNK which we passed into an act er in the last sentence of section three says the names of such children that's those children who have been admitted to erm communion as children shall be admitted to the communion roll of the congregation when they have made public profession of their faith that is when they reach the point at which they make that normal statement and the my understanding would be people whose names are on the communion roll
would it be the will of the general assembly that we take a vote on the amendment that has been the addendum that has been made to number two at this stage
are you UNK your addendum then
moderator er listening er three double three listening to mr 's point er about bringing this in conjunction with the section on baptism erm i think we're in agreement that it would be more appropriate to raise this as a new section
mr you're UNK your addendum then to number two
i'm sorry i'm asking for an answer really yes or no
yes
and er you can't i i'm not asking er i can't allow you to again
well i think i think i'll stick i'll stick by the issue then yes
you're staying you're s
i i'll stay with it
aha
you're staying with your addendum
that's fine
could i
moderator c could i ask is this really in order
i mean should it not belong on the panel on worship
well this is
it might i was going to suggest moderator that if the thing were amended to delete the word rite er and perhaps have you know the whole issue rather than th the rite it could perhaps go to the panel on doctrine and be perfectly in order
yes mo moderator the precise words are ask the panel to bring forward suggestions for a rite celebrating the gift of new birth
er it is not asking the panel to n you know to draft a rite that would used and i would interpret this to mean that it's asking the panel to look up the theological UNK if you like of such a rite and bring forward suggestions which would then be passed for implementation if so decided to the panel on worship
i if that is understood and that is accepted that would meet mr 's point in that it is it is in fact in order and is not UNK with another panel's responsibilities
therefore i ask the assembly now to vote o sorry yes dr you have the right to reply of course you have
moderator i feel i'd still want to resist this and hope the assembly would not accept it
i think it's significant that on page one eight six of our of the blue book we report four UNK for er lines from the top two presbyteries expressed a desire for the whole practice of infant baptism to be re examined only two presbyteries
er i th i doubt if really we need to go into all this matter again
we have really answered these questions in the course of our work and er i think any rite any consideration of a rite of passage such as was er asked for is in a sense UNK from the significance of holy baptism and i doubt if there's any future in this
could i then ask the clerk to read the words that have been proposed to be added to number two as it stands on page one eight five
and we are only voting on whether we will accept to add these words or not we're not voting at this stage on deliverance number two
moderator to add at the end of er that deliverance these words urge the panel to bring forward suggestions for a rite celebrating the gift of new birth
those who wish to vote for the addition of these words to deliverance number two would you please stand
thank you
those wishing to vote against please stand
i declare it's been carried against and so we come back to deliverance number two as it is in the print
moderator
yes
one eight nine
moderator the convenor in his introduction and in the deliverance says that the UNK position is that it offers baptism to parents who are not er who is seeking to explain the UNK position to parents who are not UNK members or intending members of the church
i think i should say that the current law of the church offers baptism to those who are UNK members or intending members of the church or who are UNK
and an UNK of the church is understood in the UNK region the largest single local government area in the european community to be someone who UNK worship regularly
there are a great number of UNK in the UNK
there are also a large number of UNK er to my knowledge in edinburgh people who have moved from the UNK for work
i think of a lady who now seventy has attended her parish church in edinburgh regularly year by year for forty years
she is not a UNK member because she doesn't find herself worthy to come to the lord's table
this is a traditional and most unfortunate UNK practice but nevertheless it is something that is currently accepted by the church and i would hope that the convenor in drawing up or the panel in drawing up the leaflet would take account of this
otherwise i would wish to move that the word o UNK or intending members be added to the deliverance
dr could you give clarification or confirmation please
yes certainly confirmation
we undoubtedly respect the position of the of the UNK as you describe them undoubtedly
this was really just shorthand i suppose but we undoubtedly er respect
could i now put number deliverance number two to the general assembly
is it approved
thank you
deliverance number three
approved
sorry you wish to
you wish to make a comment to it
yes please come
thank you
moderator two hundred and fifty five
i found this section number three of particular interest because surely it's dealing with the very UNK of our relationship to what we call in language that ought to be so real and preserved from UNK the body of christ membership UNK whatever you want to call it if whether you take your figure from john fifteen or from the apostle
it seems to me that this is something on which er not en UNK but within the flow of his report dr stuart mentioned something of great importance and i was UNK down for myself by way of UNK membership UNK ministry of the whole people of god three UNK as it were
the reason is that erm the question of membership seems to me to relate essentially to the ministry of the whole people of god
and therefore i would like to tell you an experience i had in UNK because it's one of the things that will be in my memory on my UNK
i visited a college there in that offshore island in the indian ocean and met the principal of that theological college and i said to him i asked him how the college was going and he gave the same UNK to his answer as to my question and then he said of his theological college we are still training an UNK for the church and ensuring the UNK of the people of god
and i had to say inside myself that's awful like the kirk
cos in a very profound sense this is true and i was so glad that it was i think a very serious part of the flow of dr stuart 's report that he mentioned that the er s sense of the ministry of the whole people of god as being much more than a distant objective for us but something of absolutely essential vital importance to the whole life and service and UNK of the church
and what worries me if i may say so in this matter is that i find er in my retirement a sensitivity among some of my fellow ministers about something that one of them described as a threat to status a feeling that there must be a protection of UNK
and it seems to me that this is so UNK tragic because surely if we talk about the body of christ there is not only a relationship of every limb and member to the head but of every limb and member to every other limb and member
and my plea would be that we do everything we possibly can and that's why i found the quotation from scripture in this section so UNK that we do everything we possibly can in grace and love and truth to help people to enter into a commitment to the ministry of the whole people of god
and not to that kind of UNK that was UNK up by the UNK principal of the theological college er with the word UNK
there is a profound UNK and part of that in many places surely with it there is a profound UNK on another matter dr stuart referred to in an answering a question he said i would see this as the role of the elder
can we not do more even than we're doing at the moment to restore to the centre of the life of the church the glorious concept of a team of UNK care and a high command of power strategy in which dominance by ministers will be reduced to the minimum in order that together we may be ready to let the UNK of christ flow through us in such a way that we will be better able to welcome the twenty first century in his name
may i bring the assembly back to deliverance number three
is that approved
number three before we come to number four the business convenor please
i simply wanted just to intervene at this point moderator er there before we get into a debate on section four just to remind the assembly that we have a heavy volume of business still ahead of us this afternoon
we do hope to take the board of social responsibility report this afternoon as well and that people might just keep that in mind er because we have still three notices of motion on the panel on doctrine before we reach that
thank you
when we come to number four i notice a notice of motion in the light blue papers this morning on page sixty five there is an addendum to this in the name of mr
would it be the mind of the assembly we hear mr now and we deal with this addendum
mr
moderator one six two
the panel on doctrine are to be UNK on their wise handling of the response of presbyteries and kirk sessions to the proposed new statement of faith
however i would like to UNK comment in my name in terms of my amendment on page sixty five of the blue paper to deliverance four on what seems to me their very seriously limited expression of the work of the holy spirit as UNK us only in our understanding of the bible
while one takes into account the concern of UNK and the UNK for the balance between the light of scripture and the inner light and direction given to individuals an experience UNK for UNK times in both the old and new UNK also remembering our lord's own use of silence in prayer and i believe the increasing use of silence in modern worship and may i also say how very impressed i was by dr 's prayer at the opening of this assembly in which he asked for the guidance of god and indeed your own equally UNK prayer on sunday evening moderator open to the UNK and leading and UNK of god's spirit
and my comment would be that the spirit guides us in our understanding of the bible needs to be augmented by the words and in our daily lives before the words UNK us in the UNK and calls us to serve god in the world
and i would move accordingly
i haven't arranged for a secondary
thank you mr is this seconded
thank you
any comments or discussion on this amendment or this addendum
could i then ask the convenor to respond to it please
moderator it may seem a little strange to resist this er addendum but i do so really because er it's never a good idea to er to be UNK what is in a sense a UNK piece of work on the floor of the house
also more particularly because this particular bit of work has had such thorough examination by the presbyteries that it doesn't seem to er justify further UNK with it at this stage
er i don't think there's any UNK set in our statement on the work of the holy spirit
he UNK us to christ he gives life he UNK us he calls us to serve i think these are all variations on the theme that mr has in mind and so i would resist this and hope the assembly will
thank you
we come now to vote on this addendum to deliverance n number four and since it is in print we don't need to ask the clerk to read it out for us so therefore as ask those who wish to vote for this addendum would you please stand
the addendum to deliverance four
thank you
those who wish to vote against this addendum would you please stand
thank you very much
we now come back to deliverance four as in print
yes certainly
four eight two
moderator i should like to move that a full stop be placed after the word commentary and that the remainder of the words in the deliverance be deleted
moderator when the general assembly of nineteen ninety sent down the draft statement of faith i and others were unhappy with it on a number of counts
it did not teach that men and women are made in the image of god
it excluded any mention of the virgin birth
it did not say anything about the fall
it did not UNK the UNK of christ
it did not do justice to the UNK doctrine of UNK
there was no clear teaching on faith and UNK
it did not define the authority of the bible in relation to the life of the church
it was weak in its doctrine of the holy spirit and perhaps UNK in arguing that UNK was by means of UNK
it did not properly highlight the nature of the church or the UNK mission to the world
on the doctrine of the last things it seemed to imply UNK
after two years of debate in the church during which and many other points such as these have been raised i confess to being deeply disappointed with the statement before us today
the statement before us is UNK in almost exactly the same points as the draft statement with only marginal improvements in these areas
indeed i think we can say that it is worse than the draft statement because some of the good points in the original have been removed
for example reference to god's creation by his eternal word and spirit removed
the idea that god UNK the universe removed
the notion that the UNK was to fulfil the promise to israel and to UNK the world with god removed
the fact that jesus was UNK to the father's will removed
the fact that jesus bore the sin of the world removed
the teaching that jesus UNK over all the powers of evil removed
the UNK and UNK of christ removed
the reference to justification removed
the reference to the UNK of scripture removed
the promise that jesus will return in power and glory removed
as we stood to say the UNK creed during the communion service yesterday a statement of faith which we share with every part of the christian church throughout the world i concluded that this statement was unnecessary
not only do we already have such a statement in the UNK creed but theological it's in a different realm
not only so but i believe this statement to be deeply UNK inadequate and that various points to be at variance both with scripture and with the westminster confession of faith the standard and the principle UNK standard of this church
moderator we are in a day of theological confusion and disagreement
that surely has been UNK to today when the very convenor of the panel on doctrine UNK that he doesn't want the statements to be too clear so that they can be understood and used by people of UNK different UNK
if we do not know what we believe and cannot agree on what we believe then is it not better to wait until we can and do
i urge the assembly to accept this amendment to depart from this statement to commend to our churches the use of the UNK creed and to wait for a day of broad theological agreement which in the UNK of god and by the work of the holy spirit will surely come and then agree upon a statement of faith which we shall all agree and be able to commend UNK to the church but until then to depart from this one
thank you moderator
is that seconded
seconded
now mr you called what you have just s spoken to an amendment
i have had my own opinion confirmed with the advice from the business convenor and the vice convenor and that is that we determine that this is in fact a counter motion that you have spoken to because it is against the spirit of the deliverance
and since it is a counter motion i will take it at the very end with any other counter motions and therefore i am not asking the convenor to reply to it because if we had a vote on it at this stage we'd either be we would therefore be UNK completely this deliverance number four as it stands
and so therefore if anybody has amendments that they wish to make to the deliverance as it is we will take them if necessary one by one and vote for them as they are presented to us and then we'll come to any other counter motions that may be on hand
and you've been very kindly waiting there come forward
amendments or UNK to number four
thank you moderator
nine hundred and ten
i have i think it's an addendum erm to rewrite a particular phrase in the statement to become he died on the cross for the sins of the world and by his resurrection as already in print
i'd like to i'd like to thank the panel for the work which they have done on this very difficult issue and although the convenor has said that it is perhaps a difficult thing to alter the text of such a document on the floor of the house i think we also have to point out that this is our only opportunity to comment upon this particular draft which will become a definitive draft if passed by the general assembly today
one which is going to be published and placed in the hands of people at large for their help in understanding the faith
and therefore it is only because i believe this particular phrase is quite literally to do with the very UNK the very cross of our christian understanding that i bring it before the general assembly
in the communion service we state quite clearly that jesus died for the sins of the world
not just because of not just because certain men at a certain place were sinful and crucified him UNK not just because of sin but he died for the sin of the world taking our sin in our place
a significant change has taken place in the wording of the statement on this particular issue from the original nineteen ninety draft of which was produced by the working party of which i was convenor
in nineteen ninety as indeed mr has pointed out there was a clear statement a sta a clear phrase which said that christ died for our sin
in the version here in nineteen ninety two the death of christ is coupled with the resurrection and all that is said in this connection is that he UNK evil
now this to my mind is just not clear enough on the very central feature of our faith
is this referring to a moral UNK over injustice
is it referring just to a UNK idea of UNK in which everything is just alright in the end
what we have to see is that christ died not just as a self sacrifice not just because of injustice but he died as the UNK to pay the price for our sin
the statement does have a phrase in it in which it says that jesus declared the forgiveness of sins but there is an immense difference between UNK forgiveness and making forgiveness
an immense difference indeed
it was not just enough for god to declare forgiveness but god had to do something in christ for that forgiveness to come to be
if i could illustrate from two medieval UNK the two traditions following them in the UNK tradition righteousness and the moral law of god is seeing is seen as being part of the very being of god himself
in the scottish tradition following upon our scottish UNK although not representing him properly it says that righteousness and moral items are just to do with the will of god
god just decides that such and such is correct or such and such is wrong
and on the scottish understanding it is very easy for somebody to come along and say well jo god just now UNK that we are forgiven
but we have a much deeper understanding than that
god had to do something on the cross in christ in order that his love which he has for us as sinners might become forgiveness for us in reality
paul in second UNK said that christ became sin for us a glorious exchange took place something happened on the cross which was necessary
and this is the real reason why i feel that we must include a specific connection between the death on the cross and the sins of the world
i remember once the late professor g s stuart reminding us that in relation to the death of jesus on the cross we do not know how deep were the waters crossed or how dark was the night that the lord passed through UNK he found the sheep that was lost
we do not have any neat theory of the UNK but we know this that on the cross christ died for our sins and for the UNK of the world
mr that's mr 's addendum is seconded
thank you
any discussion on this particular addendum
can i ask the convenor then to reply please
moderator i as before i'm UNK this
i think the statement should really just be judged on its merits today as it stands
it's been through the presbyteries it's been discussed and we report on what the balance of opinion is
er i would prefer not to be involved in elaborate discussion of the UNK of involved
er remember the UNK it is a statement a statement
a reform church should constantly be producing statements
it's not in any way in competition with ni with er UNK creed or anything else it's a quite different er animal
it's er the UNK creed ha has erm er is erm out of a different background and
uses now the reason we need not just nuclear power of course but all other sources of energy er is erm illustrated by these next couple of slides erm i'm sure you've seen data like this before growth in the world's population over the last er few hundred years erm over the middle ages the er world's population was fairly stable although the birth rate was high er the death rate was equally high because of things like UNK and UNK and UNK and other things that used to kill people off in large numbers
but mainly these diseases have now been er controlled if not completely UNK and as a result the world's population is er is likely to UNK up as you can see right off the top end of the of the graph and we're expecting something like eight billion people er and still rising at the end of the of the century and it'll be some time way into the next century before the world's population actually starts to er to level out
so more people means more resources in the context of today's talk more energy resources so we're particularly keen to find all the energy resources that we er that we can
and to show you what the situation is er the world's energy demand is very likely i is almost certain to increase er because of development in the world and also because of the growing population er that arrow is some sort of guess as to how the world er the demand for energy worldwide is likely to increase when you set that against the curves at the bottom which show the likely projections for oil and natural gas as you can see as we get into the next century those er UNK which we've been using with gay abandon for many decades will start to into er decline
now i often gives in schools and i particularly show that slide because as you can see it goes up to the year twenty forty er now i shall be a hundred and four in the year twenty forty i won't ask you to calculate what age you will be in the year twenty forty it might be quite large erm
some of you are a lot younger than me of course it could be a lot smaller but er showing this to teenagers if you work out what age a UNK will be in the year twenty forty they'll be about er in their mid sixties so this period of time basically is the time over which our present er generation of UNK will have their adult life
so these basically are the problems that they're gonna have to er have to face
now uranium erm is er a non UNK resource like UNK oil and coal and gas but there's an awful lot of it in the world and this is erm the reserves of the energy they can give are compared to the remaining reserves of coal or and er gas you can see it's one of the largest energy resources on earth
to take advantage of that large amount of fuel we have to develop what are there is the fast UNK and this is britain's fast reactor a fast reactor erm uses energy erm about sixty time uses uranium about sixty times more efficiently than the present type of UNK not sixty percent but sixty times so it obviously has tremendous implications for uranium resources
erm so quite clearly this is the erm er reactor of the future
er you must therefore ask yourselves the question why is it therefore the government has decided to er re remove the funding er for this particular project erm never mind they said er we now know how to build fast UNK look there's one we've already built a UNK we have th the er the th the UNK the drawings for a full scale version and when we actually need the fast UNK in say the year two thousand and ten or thereabouts we'll just get the UNK out of the filing cabinet and we will build them
er i'm sure they didn't i'm sure he didn't believe it either
what is likely to happen of course is that er in the year two thousand and ten when we do need these fast UNK we'll be buying in french or japanese technology as we've done in many other areas which is all rather sad really
erm the erm th this shows britain's UNK of uranium this is actually UNK uranium which can be used in the fast reactor but can't be used in the present type of er UNK but what you see there is virtually the er all of it th it's erm stored at a place called erm er UNK in UNK on the UNK erm and erm there's a few UNK off the edge as you can see but basically that's er that's it and what you see there in energy terms represents erm the equivalent of our entire coal reserves
you don't have to it doesn't have to be UNK we don't have to import it from any UNK it's ours we own it and it gives us that amount of energy but only if we develop the fast er UNK
if we don't develop the fast UNK that just becomes rather embarrassing waste and has to be UNK of
now of course there are other er forms of erm er o of fuel er there's coal erm and we have large stocks of coal in this country er enough for about two hundred er years er again you ask the question well why therefore is the is the government coal cl closing down er a large part of the coal industry
erm a again the answer is it's cheaper to import it from er overseas
erm one wonders whether that's erm wise in the long term because once you've closed down a coal mine of course you can't er re open it very easily because the roof falls in and it floods and effectively you have to start again from er from scratch
erm UNK er coal does have its problems of course erm er it does produce an awful lot of pollution
we have a large UNK power station near where i live er in UNK er at a place called UNK which is also a railway er junction erm roughly halfway between UNK where we invented er nuclear power and UNK where they're working on nuclear UNK which is a different kind of nuclear power roughly halfway between the government decides to build the largest UNK power station in the country
erm of which there of course is erm UNK logic er you might think well there aren't any coal mines in UNK which of course there aren't but UNK is actually a railway junction as i mentioned and in fact it's on the main line from the midlands erm and they can get coal in from the midlands very easily er it's on the main line er also from south wales and they're getting co getting coal from er south wales in the days when they built UNK power station they still had coal m mines in south wales so this was an obvious place to locate a large UNK power station
erm the fact it's now burning australian coal does tend to undermine the arguments er but nevertheless it does have a good rail connection down to the coast the p ports on the south coast where it can er take the stuff in from the er from the ports
erm well coal er is quite a dirty fuel when it's burnt erm d UNK power station er this is the sort of pollution you get from UNK power station it doesn't give the time on there er you might be surprised to realize that's actually er per day erm that's the amount of pollution you get per day from a large UNK power station
the c o two UNK erm UNK to er the greenhouse effect er the s o two sulphur dioxide UNK to acid rain er the dust and the ash are basically just er an inconvenience
erm another s source of energy we've been considering is th is a UNK across the severn and erm you probably recognize this as a as a map of the severn estuary er and if you didn't it says the severn estuary in big letters er across the er the bottom
er the proposal is to put er a UNK roughly across there erm i've shown er linking those two erm islands in the middle flat UNK and steep UNK
that er if built would provide us with about ten percent of our electricity at current rates of use
erm it's er would take about er twenty years to build would cost about ten billion pounds but of course once you've built it er the running costs are very er small
we ha we have to look at the environmental consequences you stick a UNK that size across erm a large er river system you've got to ask what happens UNK erm and of course bristol for example is a port how to get the ships in and out is another problem but er these are being considered at the moment and there's quite a lot of mo money going into studies but no commitment yet as to actually to actually build it
of course that's the only big site that we've got so once you've built that one well that's more or less er it
the other source of energy we've been considering is wind power
erm er there's various parts of the country where this is er suitable this is a UNK in er orkney a place called bungay hill er that provides electricity for most of the main island
erm but of course to provide erm electricity on a larger scale you can't put these things too close together you need about er a thousand of those to for example to replace say a power station like UNK and er and a thousand of these UNK would o occupy about three hundred square miles and this is what three hundred square miles looks like er it's the major part of central l you wouldn't put them in central london of course but erm gives you some idea of the sort of area you'd have to UNK to wind farms if you were to use this particular type of er of energy
erm so there are these other forms of energy as well erm nuclear power er will take its place along those alongside those i'm sure in the future er it does have its problems the main problem is the possibility of er major accidents and many of you will remember the accident at chernobyl in the what was then the soviet union it's now the now the er UNK erm when in nineteen eighty six the there was a very serious accident and the er roof er blew off and er UNK was pumped into the er atmosphere
very serious accident indeed er two people died from falling UNK er in fact one of the bodies is still in there somewhere they haven't found him yet and twenty nine people died from large UNK of radiation erm and others will die UNK because of the large radiation dose that they got mainly the emergency workers who went in to erm sort out the er the problem
erm what's happened to that
there we go
ra radiation is potentially harmful er particularly in large UNK
erm this shows the er affect of radiation against er dose er ten thousand units is er fairly le is lethal you'd die within minutes if you got that sort of dose of radiation
down at about a thousand units erm you er b between ten thousand and a thousand units er you'd suffer the symptoms of radiation sickness erm your hair would drop out and your teeth would drop out and you'd UNK and your skin would turn a funny shade of green and you'd be very ill erm but you you'd probably recover er you might not but you i mean people have actually had those sort of UNK of radiation and have actually recovered er from it
so there's a chance you'd recover in that in that range though you will be ill for a while
lower than a thousand units er there's no immediate affect and one's tempted to think that erm the er it's that UNK therefore safe below that level and that's not strictly true because there is the possibility of a long term affect it can actually cause cancer in the long term but with very low er ra er levels of risk cos you can see down at the levels where people actually get radiation UNK er like erm members of the public or erm from the actual background of people who work in nuclear power stations you're talking about very low levels but the levels those sort of levels i mean one in three hundred thousand one in three million that sort of thing you can't actually measure in real er populations because there er any effects that there are can be UNK by other ways of getting er of getting cancer
er in fact most of the radiation we get in fact is not from nuclear power it's from erm man made UNK it's from natural sources eighty seven percent of the population as an average comes from our natural environment a lot comes from UNK gas erm a small amount of UNK in our food erm we were discussing at er lunch in fact the benefits of eating er low sodium salt is meant to be bad for you so the health er UNK say and it's the sodium therefore you should buy low sodium salt which is calcium chloride rather than sodium chloride what they forget to tell you of course is that potassium er sorry it's potassium chloride rather than er than s than sodium chloride what they forget to tell you of course is that potassium is slightly UNK it contains erm a small amount of a naturally occurring UNK potassium so you get a small dose of radiation er to compensate for the fact you aren't eating any sodium
erm a small amount of erm radiation from UNK rays from outer space and from building materials and so on er eighty seven percent in total of average
of the man made er sources of radiation twelve of the thirteen percent you see are from medical uses from x rays that kind of thing and only one percent comes from all the others of which point one percent comes from nuclear er UNK
so erm er erm by n by no means er could you call one point one percent of something that can vary by factors of three in cornwall the natural radiation is three times what it is in essex erm er but they seem to be quite er healthy nevertheless in cornwall erm so point one percent is er varies by factors of three obviously can't be considered to be erm er a major political er a major erm er environmental hazard
the problem of course arises as i've said earlier when things go wrong things like chernobyl accidents and so on so we've gotta use nuclear power obviously we have to erm er make sure that we don't have accidents like that
i'll just finish with a er a small UNK to show erm the relative affects of radiation compared to other things
you you've all UNK heard of marie UNK famous erm scientist who UNK a lot of the work on UNK in the early part of this century and the last part of the last century she in fact was polish lived in paris married a french man called UNK er hence she's known as marie UNK well UNK was also a scientist and he was er UNK by the affect that th the fact that there didn't seem to be any biological affects er certainly the UNK of radiation that they were they were getting they'd handled tons and tons of UNK that's UNK ore they extracted several UNK of UNK from it they'd been handling stuff for years they weren't ill they obviously hadn't died and so on
so he thought he'd do an experiment er he took a small piece of UNK which he'd extracted from several tons of UNK and he put this bit of UNK on his UNK and put a bandage round to hold it in place and left it there for a week and said right i'll see what happens
so after a week he takes away the bandage UNK the bit of UNK sure enough there's a bright red radiation burn on his UNK but apart from that he feels fine he doesn't feel ill he obviously hasn't died er so he said well i'll leave that for a few weeks and monitor my health and see if there's any long term affects from this exposure to radiation
but we shall never know the results of that experiment because the very next week he was run over and killed by a bus erm
which all goes to show that yes you know in large UNK radiation can be harmful to you er but in the sort the sort of levels that you and i are likely to come across er almost certainly something else will get you first
thank you gentlemen
gentlemen i'm sure there must be questions
would anybody like to start the ball
don
yes a after chernobyl there was a certain amount of alarm about erm about hill farms UNK and so forth and it's all gone quiet now can you update us on what exactly
yeah
yes what er happened th there was erm er the UNK cloud that came up was swept by the winds around the world and in fact as it went over the united kingdom er it happened to rain on er UNK and north wales so some of this UNK was brought down it settled on the grass and got into the soil
erm and the hill er farmers who UNK their sheep up there are very strict regulations about the amount of UNK that you're allowed to have in any meat and in sheep it's erm er about ten thousand units er per UNK
that's the internationally approved level
well in britain we decided we'd be on the safe side we'll reduce that to a thousand we put another factor of ten in and what's more i if one sheep in a whole flock is more than a thousand units er then we will condemn the whole flock
so it's pretty it's pretty er and in fact some of these UNK who were UNK at the er w where just above that er that limit only just but just slightly above it so but in fact i if the farmers er UNK their sheep er further down the UNK er then in fact the er the level dropped very rapidly and the sheep were then erm so it was a commercial decision as to whether to keep your sheep up on the hills to eat UNK grass and get the compensation or to UNK your sheep further down and actually the lamb the UNK for the market
erm s so er because obviously these hill farmers were UNK for the loss of sales
as far as i know er the levels have now dropped and i don't think there are any further restrictions as far as i know
but it was just on the on the margin er o of something that was already a large factor below the international limit so it was er there were very large safety factors involved in that in fact
er frank
yes thank you mr president erm we worry about our stations though i don't think we've got very many in fact but within reach within twenty five miles across the channel there are probably ten or twenty french power stations that could cause just as much trouble as any of ours surely
and any UNK from them would affect most of the southern half of england i think is this true
yeah er the french erm have a very large nuclear programme er for a good erm logical UNK reasons i mean they've got no oil they've got no gas they've got no coal so they decided oh years and years ago in the nineteen fifties to have a very large nuclear programme
seventy five percent of their electricity comes from nuclear power in france
and that will rise to ninety percent early in the next century
er so they actually got themselves organized and they erm have factories that er mass produce the components and they're producing nuclear power stations at the rate of about one every six months
and erm because it's all mass produced er they can actually build a nuclear power station for half the price that we can that obviously has an effect on the economics
and when they UNK their power stations they decided erm again for good economic reasons to site them er along the channel coast and actually down the down the UNK most of the power stations are er th they have power stations elsewhere but a lot of the power stations are in these areas here and the reason for that was by putting it near to their borders they were able to export electricity to their neighbours
er they were banking on the fact that there'd be problems for other countries because of you know public perception etcetera you know the french had decided almost all of them decided they'd have a nuclear programme anyway so they were er o okay
er so a lot of their power stations are actually built near borders for that reason they're they make a lot of money by exporting nuclear electricity across the border to germany into UNK to belgium to holland and of course through this the these couple of UNK under the channel to britain
so in fact five percent of our electricity comes from french nuclear power stations in fact at the present time
er but yes wh what happens if there's er an accident
erm the french erm safety record is extremely good
erm we've had a major accident in nineteen fifty er ninety fifty seven one of the UNK small UNK at UNK caught fire er the americans had an accident at three mile island which erm w was UNK as far as the reactor was concerned but the safety devices prevented any UNK the russians have had their three mile i er their erm chernobyl accident which was UNK
er the french despite the size of their programme erm haven't had any serious incidents at all in fact they they're very well run er stations
so erm yes there is the risk that the french one of the french power stations could go wrong and it would affect southern england
erm but er certainly the record to date has been that these power stations are erm extremely erm well run and that they ha they've had no major incidents at all
yes there's always the possibility that it might
but then of course france is a is a is a separate country and we can't actually tell the french what to do
er we could refuse to buy their electricity off them i suppose but it wouldn't be have much affect
but if you can actually influence the french let us know because or let the government know because they they've been trying for years ever since UNK day to try and do something
i mean we UNK and take him down to the i suppose see if that'll do any good but erm
erm you know the each i mean basically we are we are a world of a hundred or so independent sovereign states and each sovereign state can do what it wishes within its territory with the exception of iraq of course
er for other reasons
but i mean erm er which means basically that er if a country wants to build a nuclear power programme er they ha they can do so
and most countries with nuclear power programmes are pa er are UNK to the international atomic energy agency which sets international standards er and they have inspectors who er check these standards are being observed
er and of course france is a member we're a member in fact all the nuclear c countries with nuclear power st er programmes are members
which er gives some sort of erm er comfort that in fact the international standards are being maintained
the french are a fairly responsible people after all er with reason a reasonable standard of technology
and certainly they're record to date has been better than ours so erm maybe we should
gentlemen i'll just take one last question gordon
yeah in today's press it says that er the government are going to UNK now the coal industry something like seven hundred millions due to the miners' UNK which is going to mean between five and ten pounds subsidy per ton
now it also goes on to say that's going to affect electricity prices which will rise now how will that compensate with nuclear electricity
erm well it depends erm the economics of power production are extremely erm er complex and t to a certain extent arbitrary erm and erm i mean there are various ways that the government can actually get out of this fix because obviously it's caused a lot of concern to close the mines and one is actually to UNK the mines and put the price on to electricity bills er the other is to UNK the mines er but pay for it out of the out of er out of taxes so it's a basic instead of paying for it on your electricity bill you pay for it on your tax bill yeah
a and the justification for doing this would be that in the long term we will need the coal therefore it's ne it's necessary to keep er a viable coal industry going
er th that's a fairly logical argument in fact
erm it's one that is er different from the normal philosophy of this government which tends to er work on er relatively short term economic forces let the market sort things out is generally their philosophy
so it would mean actually going against their philosophy
erm the nuclear industry also has erm er a subsidy it's known as the nuclear levy erm and there is reasons for that erm one is that erm some money has to be put aside to UNK nuclear power stations in the future erm now the s c g b before it was broken up had been actually putting some money aside year by year yeah ou out of the money that was generated fr er from selling electricity nuclear power stations some was put to one side UNK o on the accounts f for a future UNK
now when the c g b was broken up that money just disappeared
i mean nobody pinched it er actually just went into the general UNK pot
so that national er budget that had been UNK over twenty thirty years just basically UNK
er so that had to be that had to be re UNK essentially with other money
erm so erm th the cheapest er fuel at the moment is gas you know that's why er a lot of the erm er generators are now moving to towards gas er erm er generation er wh which is fine for as long as the gas exists but you know another give it another ten fifteen years and our north sea gas will have gone you see so erm you have to ask well how much do you weight do you put on market forces and how much in say in the energy business ought you to be thinking longer term
and that's really a political question
thank you ian
could i ask UNK jeff please to propose a vote of thanks
right erm regarding being a UNK i think the er the main for coming down to the south is probably where you are today i mean cricket is the great game that we all follow here
no doubt you've come down to watch some decent cricket
i won't say too much about the football cos manchester united are on top
erm ironically i was one of those that went from essex to manchester and i did live up there for a couple of years but er decided to come back
erm personally er on the nuclear er atomic side we we're very involved with our own company with b n f l at UNK with the er manufacture of the UNK concrete and i know what it means in terms of the safety incurred in the design because it is quite erm er UNK the things we have to go through
i'm going back to the erm controversial UNK subject of atomic power i suppose as you said earlier the atomic bomb and erm i suppose the most worrying thing for er for everybody was when erm the cuba crisis was on and everybody was just waiting for these UNK to appear over london because we all thought we were gonna be bombed at any time but er obviously the other thing that sort of worries people is other things that you said about chernobyl and three mile island but on the other side obviously the erm the low cost of atomic power must be the advantage for the future
obviously not being aware that there's er a population of eight billion forecast for the year two thousand and erm obviously with the natural resources of erm gas and coal running out and the pollution problems you've got with coal and obviously the great efficiency of sixty times more efficient than other forms of power
er other areas that probably worried people er i is this storage and distribution and how it's gonna affect us and goodness knows what but i think that's been gone into in great depth and i'm sure it moves around with great safety
erm obviously other forms of power er the water UNK in the severn erm estuary and the wind power is something but obviously er the thing with this atomic power situation it's got to be something for the future
erm i think that's about all i've got to say and i i'd just like the club to er thank ian in erm the usual way please
thank you mr president
next week we have UNK the district foundation chairman and the UNK are alan and mike
thank you gentlemen i will now close the m meeting by asking you to join me in the erm
final
the final UNK
the UNK is to rotary the world over
to rotary the world over
i thank you
thank you ian that was
you're welcome
obviously very well received and it's very nice to have met
number twenty two
you er you need to tell the assembly thank you
one four nine moderator is it possible or legal at all to insert a completely new twenty two
simply in light of the vote that we've just been held
i'd like simply to ask the assembly to simply UNK that we are indeed a christian church a christian UNK church to father son and holy ghost the gods whom we UNK why do we sing this every time if there are a number of members in this assembly who are no longer able to completely agree with such a UNK moderator
i move that the
mr i think it's implicit in our own nature and in our own character and a known fact that we are UNK here as a general assembly and we indeed UNK to that and i don't think we need to UNK it on a lower level of what is in fact the very standard of our existence here er in a general assembly
i can assure you of that
number twenty two approved
number twenty three thank you yes bishop please come forward
i'm delighted to welcome you i'm sure you'll be at home with one accord being sung on sunday night
one two eight nine
i have arrived i have been given a number by the church of scotland
i might suggest that you too have arrived i have answered your roll call
and indeed it's a sign of the times that i speak not with a UNK upon my head but perhaps the UNK of the UNK of the central council of acts and therefore i am in part your servant here
and it really is to promote a couple of the initiatives of your instrument that i stand here
first of all i would like to bring to your attention the regional UNK teams
at every stage of the UNK process we were hearing voices saying to us it is not sufficient that there should be fellowship agreement UNK cooperation at the highest levels but it had to be found at every level it had to be found at grass roots level
and the meeting of the UNK central council has recently had a report from its local and regional unity er committee proposing that a network of regional UNK teams should be established throughout scotland to further the cooperation and joint commitment of UNK and church members in each area
this proposal was UNK approved by the central council of acts and has been well received by member churches which are appointing local representatives for each of the forty six areas
these areas as you might recognize are the UNK areas of scotland as these areas seem to be most closely allied to natural and civic boundaries
now the UNK church as the church of scotland enjoys a unique place in scottish life and its structures it has a privileged place but i would suggest to you it has also therefore a number of responsibilities and one i would suggest in this case is to try and ensure that these local regional teams are in place
i think it would be most appropriate for the local representatives of the church of scotland since the areas are presbyteries to take the initiative or to give that encouragement without which these local teams will not find a place
the second thing that i would like to recommend to you on behalf of the instrument acts is the scottish christian gathering which will take place this year from friday the twenty sixth of june to sunday the twenty eighth of june at saint andrew's college
it is according to the book which is our sort of bible on the matter for celebration and vision for fellowship exploration and UNK of opportunities and tasks with broad participation from all member churches and others to UNK and strengthen the whole movement of acts
you will notice it is a yellow card also er it is somewhat larger than the other one which was UNK earlier before us and the good news is that you've got each one of you a copy of this in your UNK
could i just conclude moderator by saying that those who are engaged in acts the churches which are participating members of this action of churches together in scotland are engaged in a journey together
the UNK of each church and indeed s of the several members perhaps shape differently the goal that lies ahead
but we must be sure that however shaped in our imagination that goal is it must be UNK by our lord's own will for his church praying that his disciples would be one as he and the father are one
and it seems to me that UNK that unity is UNK in character
it is based on the holy spirit
and it is for us surely to open ourselves without prejudice to the shape that it will take in the future
i think we can say that if it is UNK in character the shape will be organic
for the moment we move forward believing that we are going in a direction to which we have already been prompted and in the confidence that the holy spirit is working among us
thank you
i'm delighted bishop you took the opportunity to so address us and it UNK our benefit in being able to have our delegates participate in our debates and discussions
thank you for your contribution
i put to the assembly deliverance number twenty three approved
deliverance number twenty four thank you
three five
i am s one that has just been recently appointed to one of these er regional UNK teams and at a meeting that was held for the three UNK areas in the sort of west coast of scotland around the UNK area erm it was it became apparent that all these people who are being appointed er through their churches are in the main UNK and the convenor of the local committee himself a ruling elder of the church of scotland expressed concern about this that there is no real er and i would just put it to the to the assembly there is there is no need for these members to be members of the UNK in fact it would be good if presbyteries remembered when making a nomination eh that it er it needn't be it could be a an elder or indeed er a lay person holding no particular office within the church
that would sustain what eh bishop has just referred to the grass roots of this movement
twenty four approved then
thank you
twenty five local involvement number twenty six twenty seven yes
reverend eleven twenty six
i've read number twenty seven says draw attention to the possibilities for church members to take part in overseas and exchange visits and i would simply like to do that
yesterday a minister from an urban priority area er while er welcoming the thought of a an urban priority area fund or urban and rural priority area fund said that people were at least as important as money in many situations
none of us can doubt the economic plight of many of the countries where our mission partners work but the relationship of people is every bit as important and visits play a large part in that
a small group er from my own parish went to india two and a half years ago to visit our missionary partner
she had visited us many times over a UNK number of years and said it was our turn to visit her and we just laughed
us go to UNK
but eventually she persuaded us she meant it and we went and it was an invaluable experience meeting not only our missionary partner but the people among whom she lives and works and has done for many years
the warmth of the welcome from the girls in the school UNK would have UNK anyone's heart
they were not well off and they didn't welcome us because we had brought gifts they simply welcomed us because we had the interest to go and see them and talk to them
we enjoyed their music and shared their worship and we came back changed and UNK and i commend number twenty seven to everyone's attention
thank you moderator
number twenty seven approved
thank you
number twenty eight approved
i've got a new number twenty nine and you'll find that on the pale blue papers page number sixty five the first notice of i put number twenty nine to the general assembly is that approved
number thirty approved
number thirty one approved the deliverance as a whole and as amended approved
now before we move further i'd like to take this opportunity of expressing on your behalf our thanks to hugh here for the service that he's UNK our church to this point in time but particularly as the convenor of the board of world mission and unity
hugh you've been minister of the parish of UNK here in edinburgh for the past seventeen years and i understand you were one of the very first vice UNK of the board when it was set up eight years ago having already served the church on the former UNK relations committee
you were born in india on the mission field and through your family's experience and your own you've brought to the UNK of the board a great personal interest in the overseas church and in international affairs
for several years here in edinburgh you have been the UNK world mission and unity convenor and then you became the convenor of the board's local involvement committee which links our UNK to people who work overseas in churches there with whom they serve
as the convenor of the board since nineteen eighty eight you have visited the european work of the board in UNK in paris in UNK and in UNK also in israel and egypt and you have represented the board at meetings of the world alliance of UNK churches
hugh you have shown throughout all of your work a deep concern for the people working abroad for our partner churches and for our UNK relations and the need to keep these matters to the fore of the church and also of our country
hugh you and i share the gift of a very unusual christian name
i understand it's the only way in which these letters are arranged in the UNK language and is often used as an example of such
it's a very difficult name at times to live up to i'm sure because the word hugh literally means mind or soul and it is important that we seek indeed to live up to what our names mean
you have certainly applied your mind to the work of the board and you have encouraged its vision and its direction through your intellectual gifts and perceptions and UNK
and you've also brought your soul to bear on the work of the board and the work of the church
within the assembly council i personally valued your contributions the very UNK and UNK way in which you presented these and the courage with which you expressed at times the stand that you had to take for the interest of the board
and yet above that and beyond that what you were seeking to do was not just to serve the board of world mission and unity it was to serve what you believed was the good and right for the church of god which you have sought to serve and to support and to take further
for that contribution and for that depth of UNK within yourself which you have brought to bear for the benefit of the work of this board and for that of our whole church we want to thank you very much indeed this morning
i'm delighted and i'm sure you'll be delighted to hear the advice of the business convenor that we UNK at this point in time
and we UNK we come back to continue our meeting at two o'clock this afternoon
we adjourn until two o'clock
shall we start from the beginning
yes
right mm completely fresh start
yes please
i was born in UNK in the year nineteen hundred and six my father was a UNK one of my earliest UNK is of the dock strike of nineteen hundred and eleven in which i played a part lining up at the soup kitchens to get soup for the family
my father died when i was quite young and at ten years of age i went into a poor old UNK where i stayed four years
i came out of the UNK to go and live with my mother and i found myself one of the family of six living in one room the house was a four UNK house plus a UNK
each room was occupied by a separate family there was one cold water tap for the whole of the four families and one outside toilet
conditions such as those were quite common to many thousands of people and i think it was those conditions which helped to UNK and develop my political thinking
when i was eighteen i came in contact with the catholic UNK which was a rather left wing christian socialist organization and i found that their attitude to problems contained the answers for which i had been searching for a good many years tell me when you want me to raise something
yeah i'd like you to tell me about erm what the house was that you left before you came to harlow and why you came to harlow
yes if we skip all the intermediate years with after the war i came back from the army to find we'd been bombed out and were living in UNK accommodation after a time the we were moved into a new flat over some shops
my wife was working for UNK the electronic company and they moved to harlow and er it in order for her to retain her job we had to move to harlow as well
this proved very difficult because between the time of the decision being taken to move UNK to harlow and the time that my wife my wife's department actually went the development corporation had changed their policy and would not have married women as tenants
this resulted in a great deal of correspondence between myself and the development corporation and at the end of it i told my wife the best thing to do was to hand her notice in as there was no chance of us ever getting a house in harlow fortunately her services were much more seriously in demand then we imagined and the company nominated us for one a house which is allocated to one of their executives the house that we're living in now and have lived in ever since nineteen sixty three
the vast difference between UNK green road UNK and harlow
for one thing harlow is the sort of town which i'd been UNK for both before and after the war whenever i was speaking on behalf of the labour party both at street corners and at public meetings on the type of life we vis envisaged for a normal person in the land
to leave UNK to leave UNK green road to leave a flat which was over a shop UNK a main shopping centre UNK a completely noisy main through road to come to harlow was a difference between chalk and cheese
the accommodation UNK in one respect and that was that in the flat we were on one floor we had one bedroom we moved into a house with two toilets separate bathroom and three bedrooms which enabled us to spread our furniture around enabled us to have visitors to receive members of the family
i think this is one of the UNK in harlow and something that people should not forget that is that although there is a great deal of criticism possibly of the standard of building that went on over the years of the development corporation compared with what most people came from there was a very great elevation both in quality and in ideas
perhaps today the general public take too much for granted the as a local councillor i have to interview many people who come to me with housing problems to be as patient as one can is essential as a politician but after the UNK has gone one is very conscious of the fact that their problem is so minute it is hardly worth mentioning
but nevertheless that's human nature and perhaps it's also a reason why life should not stand still whatever progress we make both in housing and in quality of housing and the quality of life once people are used to that to that they expect more and this is what progress what forward thinking is all about
could you tell me about the house of which you were bombed out
was it were you married at the time
yes i think that over the course of our married life we had a number of moves for various reasons generally to improve the accommodation erm as standard of life increased so the desire to have a better house to live in or rather in those days a house was out of the question we generally had rooms in a house erm they the flat for instance that we were bombed out from was a basement flat erm according to the estate agents it was a garden flat erm and it meant that you had access to the front garden and the back garden but as for being a garden flat it was below the level of the garden in the front and at the back it was on the level with the erm green grass at the back of the house it was also along side of the trolley bus depot so there it was considerably noisy nevertheless it was a self contained flat the first one we'd had no the second one we'd had and we were perfectly happy there although of course it did have minor difficulties the fact that you used the front door with people who had flats on the other remaining three floors but nevertheless it did involve you in a certain amount of community living you were aware of your neighbours you had to be very conscious of them and they were very conscious of you
that i think perhaps is one of the striking differences between that and living in a house in harlow where you may or may not know your immediate neighbours
perhaps you know them over the garden wall to speak to you might even know their children by name and you know their christian name but beyond that i think it's true to say even making allowance of generation gaps that you don't know your neighbours in the same way that you knew your neighbours in london
whereabouts was the basement flat was it in UNK
no that was in UNK but it was in the district called UNK
oh yes i know it well
mm
UNK gardens
UNK gardens is the UNK oh of course it's not there
it's not there mm yeah
if it was bombed out yes
you were in the army weren't you
oh i was yes i was
army
i was enjoying life in the army while my wife was enjoying the bombing
she was actually in the house when the bomb dropped on the other side of the road and she was UNK down two flights of stairs and the piano on the other side of the room here bears the UNK of the bombing
and that curtain went from the window right across the room and pinned itself into the piano pinned the curtains into the piano
and it also managed to chip some of the woodwork curious to think that i was offered as war damage compensation five pounds to re case the piano you couldn't of had it UNK for five pounds but thinking was working class people shouldn't have UNK i'm certain that was at the back of the gentleman whose job it was to evaluate war damage he certainly raised his UNK every time we told him what either a piece of furniture or UNK or UNK which had been destroyed had cost and he was so foolish after er the house had been almost UNK as de demand bills as proof of evidence that your figures were correct
mm so when you left your when you came back you said that you went into a UNK property
yes erm we found ourselves in rather to go back
after the bombing my wife was housed with an with another family
who had been bombed
in the top flat they were UNK in a flat in a block of mansion flats and when i came out of the army this was the accommodation i found available er for me and i objected strongly and after a great deal of fuss erm the UNK borough council's housing department found us rooms on the first floor in a victoria victorian villa in UNK gardens which erm were comfortable
not UNK gardens
er not erm
was that
UNK road
UNK road
UNK road
UNK road and erm it were it was good accommodation we had our own bathroom and toilet er but again accommodation was UNK we had no spare room
and we weren't proud there was people came
and er the people in the flat above us had to pass our door to get to them in the same way that we had to pass the people tenants below doors to get to their accommodation
erm from there we went into this purpose built flat above a UNK shop it was meant for the manager of the UNK shop but he had better sense and so the flat became available for letting to the borough council who at the UNK of the owners of the house we were in erm were anxious to get their property back and so we found ourselves in a brand new flat the first tenants although this was not very highly to be recommended you approached your flat up er stone staircase er from the outside so you exposed to the elements er you then walked across the roof flat roof over the shops until you came to your flat door erm UNK at that time was just beginning the to see the UNK of UNK from the UNK as they were in those days and er they in turn created much heavier demand on what little vacant property there was so that the district rapidly deteriorated and for many people who were not in the fortunate position that we were found it necessary or desirable to leave because they were sharing rooms or sharing houses with people whose ways of life were different from theirs and this is something i think that housing authorities learnt to appreciate over the years that the differences between people's ways of life are one of the major causes of social distress
what year was that when you moved into erm UNK road
we moved into UNK road in nineteen forty five and we moved into erm UNK green road
fifty three
somewhere about nineteen fifty three yes
in our town house
and we left UNK road in sixty three to come to harlow
so you've only been in harlow since nineteen sixty three
twenty years yes
yes
it'll be twenty years next march
mhm
could you explain to me a little bit more when you said that erm a married woman couldn't be a tenant
yes erm when harlow was designed it was appreciated that its the its purpose was to house workers in the factories and the offices and also to act as an UNK from london and in nineteen sixty when UNK were bringing their workers by the hundreds
fifty eight
fifty eight was it
when in nineteen fifty eight when co UNK were bringing started bringing their workers here the development corporation were very anxious to let houses and so that it didn't matter whether the worker was male or female he or she was accepted as a tenant by the time we came to move in harlow in nineteen sixty three the development corporation UNK on its promise to house my wife
at that time erm i was a commercial UNK and harlow was part of my district and they UNK accepted the fact that because i was a commercial UNK working in harlow that i actually did work in harlow which was stretching a point but i really think that the development UNK officials were getting a little tired of my being able to talk their own language and to write letters in the same vein as they could write they weren't used to this and at any rate as i said earlier we got here
we were offered some awful things though in the first place
erm i've always been interested in housing and it did appear to me that however delightful harlow may be when the architects were designing properties they designed a property without any consideration for the people who were to live in them
we were offered a flat which would of UNK if we'd of accepted it would of meant we would have to of sold every stick of furniture because the rooms were not large enough
can you tell me the name of the block of flats or the address of it
that was er a flat in UNK we were offered a flat on the first floor and when we examined the kitchen it was extremely obvious to me that our gas cooker wouldn't fit in the place where it was designed to fit when i asked where do we put the washing machine i was informed that most tenants kept the washing machine on the UNK when i said well where do we put the UNK well most people keep the UNK either in the hall or rather not a hall it was a UNK in the UNK or in the living room now it does seem to me with hindsight that if that's planning i to use an old fashion london phrase i'm a UNK
was the living room a com a com combined sitting and dining room
combined everything except bedroom there was one separate bedroom
only one bedroom
yes erm it was very obvious from the word go that they didn't want us
it was for a single person really wasn't it there
well i would of thought so although today it must be admitted that single people don't get offered one bedroom flats but then in those days there wasn't the shortage of accommodation that there is today
next question
erm could you tell me erm something about how you felt about the change of coming to this house you know whether you enjoyed it
well i suppose at the one of the best things best examples of the difference was that my wife when she saw this house knew that it was a house in which she could be happy in which her UNK and could spread themselves erm rather than her UNK having to be UNK by lack of space and lack of accommodation erm the fact that i had a garage which was essential er next to my house instead of some er quarter or twenty UNK walk away from where i lived as happened in london also made a terrific difference to comfort erm the fact that there was a garden instead of a few UNK and a couple of tubs all these things i think made one appreciate the fact that you'd come not only into a new town but into a new way of life probably the fact that we had a staircase inside the house which was the first time that we'd had a staircase between our bedrooms and our living rooms
mm
so in all UNK in always the fact that you'd come into this house made one realize that there'd been a distinct change in one's circumstances
and did you feel that it affected your lifestyle
that you could do you mention that you could now entertain
erm
your friends
well we always had UNK friends but we'd never been in a position to put them up so that erm most of our friendly visits were from people who didn't live very far from us it meant that families UNK etcetera were difficult to accommodate because they had to sleep on a UNK or a UNK in the living room with all its UNK difficulties especially when it meant in the morning for breakfast you had to get them up and dressed before you could start thinking about breakfast and i think that those sort of things are things that er people ought to take into consideration when thinking about new housing
one of the UNK i have about accommodation for elderly people is the fact that by that the purpose built very excellent bungalows and flats for elderly citizens are restricted to one bedroom which to which but is by government UNK to keep the cost down but it does seem to me to be very UNK because elderly people's children are unable to come and stay with them except to the great deal of UNK and perhaps as society grows a little more UNK for the fact that the percentage of elderly people will get even greater as the years go on then they should make allowance and provide them for the facilities to enable them to be visited by their children and grandchildren
did you erm leave family behind when you came away from london
no we never had a family so we were entirely foot free and foot loose
but apart from children i meant sisters or brothers
oh yes
or parents or
yes erm my wife came from the midlands from coventry and her family roots were in coventry at the midlands in fact there she still has numerous UNK and UNK and great UNK and great UNK there to this day my with the exception of a sister who moved who to UNK erm i have two brothers and er they still live in london still live in east ham er the distance is not too great erm and but obviously as we get older the amount of visiting we do will be UNK by the difficulties of getting from harlow to east ham especially when one is UNK to stop driving a motor car
did you bring furniture with you when like when you moved into harlow
oh yes we the we had an extremely large rooms i don't know went what went wrong the architect but we had two enormous rooms which could of been quite easily divided into three but we could of had two bedrooms instead of one and the UNK
er sorry to interrupt you are you speaking about this house
no the flat
the flat right
the flat in london the flat we came from and so we had UNK a little more furniture than one would usually have in two rooms and the kitchen and we got here and were allowed to spread ourselves if there's one criticism that one could say about this house is that the size of the rooms UNK you to what you put in them they're square that the division between the living room and the dining room is through a pair of glass doors where perhaps that could of been arranged with either sliding doors or some other feature so as not to separate it yet again into two square boxes and erm
are you in favour of open plan
er it depends on one's own UNK i personally don't like the open planned that i've seen in very modern houses where erm i don't quite know how to express it but it does seem to me odd to be on one floor level and then two feet up you're on another level and er that's one aspect of the open plan that doesn't appeal to me and i don't quite understand why it's necessary to have everything that's going on in one room with pieces of furniture designed to act as barriers between the different functions or purposes for which you give parts of the room
so how do you how do you see the ideal way of arranging a room
the ideal way of arranging a room as i see it would be that you could have your separate rooms but have sliding doors after all there's nothing new in sliding doors er but doors opening and closing erm are restrictive that's only my own personal view my wife doesn't necessarily share that view ideally if i was planning a house the main room the main living room would be much larger than the one we live in it would certainly be a different shape erm when we had our golden wedding erm our visitors were so numerous that they were standing shoulder to shoulder in these two rooms and the kitchen whereas if it had been a reasonably designed house maybe we could of spread them around a little more but they're minor UNK that are not really serious
i think today that if someone was designing a house one would incorporate all the modern additions which have suddenly become fashionable such as double UNK and er UNK windows i think that these things are perhaps a development from in the same way as this house is a development from the rooms and the flats we lived in london so that the modern UNK of the things i've mentioned could be incorporated as normal in the house certainly would be cheaper to incorporate them when building the house than adding them on
when was this house built
well i don't know the exact date but i believe this house is some thirty years old so it was built about nineteen fifty three fifty two fifty three
does it have central heating
does it have central heating
no it has central heating now but it didn't when we moved in
did you own the house
no
erm did the council put the central heating in
council put the central heating in when we got advanced in years and when it became necessary in the doctor's opinion for me to have central heating because i had a heart complaint
so it's the council doesn't install central heating as a matter of course only if it's a special case
the council has a policy now of bringing all its properties up to date but priority because they're bringing the houses up to date will take some eight years priority is given to elderly citizens and people with medical needs
do you like the orientation of the house
do you feel that it's pointing the right way bringing the sun in through the right windows at the right time of day
that's a little difficult to answer if you're watching television the sun can be a nuisance
yes of course
when it comes in UNK in those the house faces west er consequently although it's very pleasant in the afternoon and evenings when you're not watching television erm it has its UNK on the other hand the garden is most unfortunately orientated alright
i think that's a minor problem but perhaps architects now pay a little more attention to and that is that in the afternoon when you like to sit in the evening when you like to sit in the garden in the sunshine you are sitting in the shadow because the house er is between the sun and the garden
i can't think of any more questions for the moment
alright
so do you think i could ask you something about what you please tell
no we're alright
please tell me when you want me to go because
yeah
if i over st don't let me over stay
no
er i liked to ask you erm about if you if you think that harlow lives up to the ideal of the new town
it could be asked what is disappointing about harlow and i suppose that the first thing that strikes one is the design fault so far is the road work the road network is concerned and er and the UNK of the road for roads for modern traffic
very obviously when this town was designed and laid out and nobody UNK the growth of the private motor car er today private motor car is accepted but in a town which was built perhaps the idea that one in twenty would own a motor car and we're now faced with the probably one in three have a motor car we're now faced with a problem which can only UNK from life in the town also the fact that huge lorries are passing through what were envisaged as quiet residential UNK with a UNK breaking of UNK and of paving stones where the lorries are UNK to mount the UNK in order to get round parked cars and things of that nature it UNK from the life in harlow i do i think a considerable extent erm the other factor is that there's become a lack of pride in the town by the people who live in it this is seen from the amount of rubbish and refuse that is dropped from the minor vandalism that goes on the UNK er particularly in UNK where people are walking to the town centre and that those are the things where the town has lost its way when we first came here you never saw bits of paper and packages from sweets and cigarettes and things perhaps maybe because the package industry has developed over the years and that er whereas whenever we had responsibility for taking a small child out if it had sweets it was encouraged to put the UNK in its pocket until it got home now of course it's encouraged to drop it just where it wants to and er this not only applies to children some of the worst UNK are the adults who leave the leave the public houses with a can of beer to drink on the way home and drop it just when they've finished the last drop of beer or the fish and chip UNK just dropped
i think this is UNK i think it's UNK it certainly shows a lack of respect for one's neighbours or indeed for the town one lives in and yet very often i'm fully aware of the fact that the people who do the dropping are the first to complain that the council doesn't keep the town clean
what do you think that there's any connection between what you mentioned before about when you claimed for er bomb damage erm that working class people about being supposed to have a piano do you think there's a connection between that sort of idea and the idea of people that lived in harlow in council houses shouldn't have cars
no i don't think that had a great deal to do with it erm it was question that when the town was designed the there hadn't been this sudden burst in living standards
if you compare when we first came to harlow which is only twenty years ago the possession of a television set erm was only just becoming the normal thing
mm
the possession of the motor car was just becoming the norm but the town had been designed fifteen years earlier
and what do you think of the idea of ways that the that the way the house types were graded the fact that some of them were in fact meant to be executive or managerial classes and others were meant to be for people with less income do you think that this is again UNK this sort of class system within the planning of the town
i think that what we've got is the acceptance by the UNK and the planners of the class system that they knew
mm
they had no vision of a classless society erm personally while i've no desire to see UNK i see no UNK reason why some people because they have a lower income should be UNK to live in inferior and perhaps UNK conditions whereas the man with five or six or seven times their income can choose a larger house in a much more delightful district and i think it is things like that make the difference between what i as a young socialist UNK was advocating and what we find today
i find too that circumstances UNK a socialist council like harlow to be constrained and UNK when building there are too many laws and regulations which are based on the fact that for instance today's government thinks that people who rent houses are second class citizens
can you give an example when you say that the law is designed
yes erm let us take one little factor this question of the UNK the media and the today and that is the reduction in interest charges
now when interest charges fall the person who is buying the house benefits from the reduction in interest charges but the person who is UNK a house in local authority and then in this case nobody else in harlow to rent it from is faced with not with a decreased monthly UNK but with an ever increasing one because as more and more council houses are sold the cost of maintaining that there the UNK of the town the cost of maintaining council houses goes on increasing and so the burden is laid on the tenants and the tenant can find will find himself that pound for pound increasing his rent while the house owner is decreasing his mortgage charges and at the end of the day the tenant is paying increased rent increased rate and with nothing to show for it erm i've always been in favour of a sale of property er owner occupiers but not at the expense of the people who cannot afford to be owner occupiers ah to my mind the present housing system is designed to maintain the existing class structure because even with the large discounts that one gets and nobody's ever yet convinced me that why you should get a discount because you buy a council house but if you buy one privately owned you can't get a discount and it there's this is so utter nonsense but it is throwing a much heavier burden every time a house is sold on the remaining houses which are for rent and so you that although the idea is to make it a classless this society with more and more people UNK their own properties the mo the mere fact that the majority of people in the town cannot afford to buy even the reduced priced council house is an example that the system the class system a division by income still exists
yeah may i ask mrs some more questions
would you mind answering some questions
well she's a bit shy but i'll help her
i wanted to ask you about the furniture
can you hold it if you just hold it about like that yes
erm do you mind answering some questions about your furniture
oh well what do you want to know
erm you seem to like modern furniture
yes
why did you choose modern furniture
well
or the open university
yeah but the open university ones cover all of the material and they're what i actually wrote the lectures from erm but there's six of them which is why the o the only advantage of the other one is that it's one not six and so but i mean the material is all covered text of which there are three copies of most of them in the library one on short loan and one on sort of a general loan so you
yeah
what's the other one like
the
tha that's quite good for the biological stuff it doesn't really contain much sort of useful for the last three or four lectures it doesn't contain much on sort of ocean circulation and the physics you know but it covers the biology UNK quite well
and also it's quite useful for the
right then we we'll leave some of the physics and stuff that we've been doing behind now and just spend one lecture looking at some chemistry which i know will be equally popular
oh good
most of the ninety two naturally occurring elements that's leaving aside the elements that have been created artificially in UNK and things have been found in sea water and it's quite likely that those that haven't yet been recorded from sea water will be recorded as our UNK er as our UNK techniques get better
so basically you can consider sea water as being a solution containing salts of all of the naturally occurring elements
can you just copy that down
would i would i do that to you
mhm
you will probably be relieved to hear that you're not expected to UNK that table and to UNK it in the exam
what you should be aware of though is which elements are the most common in sea water and you'll not be too surprised to learn that sodium and chlorine as in sodium chloride as in common salt are in fact the two most elements in sea water followed by magnesium sulphur and calcium
now there is UNK a problem in carrying out any chemical analysis of sea water and that is the fact that sea water contains lots of UNK bits
these UNK this particular matter is generally given the sort of UNK term UNK some of those UNK are mineral UNK some of them are UNK as the iron tends iron ions tend to come together to form UNK in solution and some of them are UNK of biological origin
so there are a whole range of different origins to these UNK but they're all floating around in the sea water
so if you come to try and analyze sea water you first of all have to separate the er UNK base and those things in solution from this particular material
for no real reason other than tradition samples are normally passed through a forty five mu UNK or membrane filter
is that UNK or UNK
UNK t o n so sea water analysis then is carried out on the water which passes through the forty five mu filter
typically in the open ocean situation sea water contains thirty fives parts per thousand of salt usually expressed as that symbol sometimes you'll see it written as parts per thousand p t and what that means is that there are thirty five grams of salt per UNK of water and that's usually given the symbol s and is referred to as the salinity
we can divide the components of sea water into three erm categories firstly those things which we can consider to be major constituents these are substances which are present are concentrations greater than one part per million
so if you look down your table you've got your concentrations here in parts per million and you can see that everything above UNK would be a major constituent and everything below it would be a minor constituent
major constituents account for ninety nine point nine percent of the material dissolved
minor or the trace constituents then are present in concentrations less than one part per million they obviously count for less than point one percent of the total salts they are useful as chemical UNK of particular waters
if we know a water has a particular site of origin then we can often use minor trace constituents as a marker of that water to follow its fate and its path through the ocean okay
so minor constituents are often useful as chemical UNK
our third category then is substances which are nutrients and this is nutrients in the UNK sense
these cut across the major and minor boundaries in that some of them are in concentrations greater and some lesser one part per million
these are substances which have biological significance
the principal ones are nitrogen which is present as nitrate UNK and various UNK of nitrogen UNK which is present as UNK present as UNK which requires UNK
and carbon present as carbonate which is used in UNK material or as carbonate or c o two or h c o three minus which are all used as UNK for UNK
because these are UNK active compounds they don't follow the simple chemical processes of the other elements in the water their concentration at any given time or place is a function of the biological activity and history of the water
so for example in a region of high productivity you may find very low concentrations of carbonate because it's been stripped out and converted to UNK material being used in UNK
substances whose concentrations are not affected by biological activity you'll often see described as bio UNK compounds so you might come across that in your reading
right
so that's substances whose UNK is not influenced by biological activity okay
so that's the opposite if you like of those nutrients
in addition to salts ocean water contains dissolved UNK
all of the UNK present in the atmosphere are also present in surface waters
that occurs simply by physical processes primarily gas being trapped as UNK under the action of breaking waves
carbon dioxide is the most soluble of the UNK because as it dissolves it doesn't just go through a physical solution it goes through a chemical conversion such that carbon dioxide UNK in water forms UNK acid which in water will UNK into a hydrogen iron and a hydrogen UNK iron which can further UNK this is why i've got a nice wide UNK and you've only got a piece of a four paper so you end up with a carbonate iron two hydrogen ions this system is a dynamic equilibrium
if you put more c o two into the system the concentrations of all of these go up if you take carbonate out for example for conversion to UNK material it will pull material in this direction through the through the s through those equations
the actual point of the equilibrium where the balance occurs on each of these is a product of temperature and pressure
UNK this system is extremely important
if you measure the UNK rise in carbon dioxide due to UNK fuel burning you'll see that it's only about one half of that predicted if all of the coal and oil that had been burnt since the industrial revolution had gone into the atmosphere we would probably have er an increase in c o two double what we can actually measure
the rest has entered this system and has been absorbed by the UNK
okay
so we know that so far about fifty percent of our UNK c o two has been locked away in this system in the ocean
and at the moment there is considerable er research effort being directed to try and work out just how much more carbon dioxide the ocean will continue to absorb
what does UNK mean
from human sources
for example can we continue burning UNK fuel and will half of it continue to be absorbed by the ocean or is the ocean reaching UNK such that these equilibrium terms are being reached and future increases in c o two will be reflected in UNK build up and it's only UNK c o two that UNK to the greenhouse effect
so the exact er nature of this balance and how waters between contact with the atmosphere are being mixed into the deep sea cos remember this equilibrium can only be occurring in surface waters cos only they are in contact with the gas phase how that turnover of deep UNK occurring affects just how much capacity we've got for UNK c o two in the UNK and therefore UNK the greenhouse effect
how can we work that out
what's that
how can you work that out
well that's what they're trying to do at the moment by measuring rates of turnover of deep to surface waters
mhm
which is actually poorly understood we'll talk a bit more about that in the next lecture
okay
but you can see if this lot gets converted to carbonate and then that water then gets mixed down to the deep water it will be replaced at the surface with water which has a low carbonate concentration which will suck more c o two out of the atmosphere
so it's quite critical as to how that rate is turning
it's then oxygen surface waters are UNK in fact they're often super UNK with oxygen
in part this is the result of UNK which is pumping oxygen into solution but again primarily it's down to the physical UNK due to breaking waves and air UNK being mixed in to the system
below the UNK zone oxygen is UNK by biological activity so UNK from immediately below the UNK zone you tend to see a decrease in oxygen with depth reaching a UNK somewhere between five hundred and a thousand metres depth
re reaching a what
reaching a minimum
below about a thousand metres oxygen concentrations are fairly static down to the a minimum between five hundred and a thousand metres depth so they're fairly static
that's in the open ocean in UNK for example the black sea many UNK and sea UNK the deep waters are not renewed by water masses moving in from other areas in the way that they are in the open ocean and there UNK can occur in the deep waters that is the oxygen can be completely removed by biological activity particularly in UNK processes of organic matter UNK so UNK conditions can occur in isolated deep UNK but low oxygen concentrations are actually very rare in the open ocean
why is that
why is it erm well yeah er le less of a level of oxygen at erm medium depth
yeah
now surely it's far more difficult to get oxygen down deep
yeah
it's because that's the sort of trace you get with an oxygen minimum around eight hundred metres
the UNK zone is this is percent UNK of oxygen fully UNK and what we're seeing here is oxygen being UNK by UNK
in general biological activity UNK with increase in depth so you see er UNK using up this material
but when you start getting down here you've got low biological activity
yeah but sh
but you've also got water masses which are being moved in which are rich in oxygen
the reason they're rich in oxygen is because they were formed at the UNK regions alright
where because the water is very cold it will absorb an awful lot of oxygen
we'll look we'll actually look at the processes of deep water formation tomorrow so you'll actually see how the waters are formed but the reason why this is high is basically the act of a low biological activity removing it and b the fact that the source waters have not come from below they've come in UNK from an area where they were formed which was very rich in oxygen
now if you start analyzing the composition of sea salt or the salt in sea water what you find is that there is a remarkable UNK in the ratio of one element to the other
no matter where you go in the world ocean you find that although the total salinity may vary the actual ratio of say UNK no that's let's say potassium to aluminium is the same er so there is a UNK of composition there is a constant ratio between the elements
that UNK of composition relationship breaks down in UNK and UNK for example where er addition processes i e er salts which have been eroded from river water may alter the composition
so may you may have a bay for example that's in an area where all the rivers UNK into it are rich in copper because they're running over rocks which are copper
so in UNK areas like that this breaks down but in the open ocean system you've got this very strong constant ratio
other areas where it may break down are areas of high biological activity for example tropical reef flats very high biological activity there very high demand for calcium carbonate to build all those coral UNK so carbonate will be stripped out
and waters passing through the UNK at UNK etcetera will also have UNK chemical changes so again pool waters being UNK will vary in their composition
so how do we actually go about measuring this thing called salinity
well if the definition of salinity is the amount of salt dissolved in a particular volume of water perhaps the logical way to do it is simply to take a volume of water and UNK it and weigh the amount of salt that's left so that might be the simplest approach
there are however problems with that approach of how much do you dry the salts for example
depending the amount of drying concerned actually UNK the composition of some salts
for example magnesium chloride holds water within its crystal UNK and if you dry it that water comes out but as it comes out it also strips out the chlorine as hydrogen chloride gas for example
so that would be one salt whose actual nature and therefore weight and therefore your measurement of salinity will vary depending on the degree of drying
carbonates will UNK at relatively low temperatures so if you dry your water in an oven you may find you're actually burning off some of the carbonates
so that would be another source of error
well our UNK of composition gives us a way round some of these problems
if we can establish through very careful analysis what the ratio are between certain elements and each other then that ratio also holds between any given element and total salinity yes
yes
yes
so by measuring just one substance we can work out the overall total salinity
the substance that's most frequently measured is actual the UNK is actually the chlorine content and the salinity is one point eight zero six five times the chlorine concentration
chlorine is relatively easy to measure i'm sure you'll all of done it at a level chemistry UNK silver nitrate
yeah
to establish the concentration of chlorine in a solution
and that was the technique that was really used up until the sixties for the determination of salinity
whole research UNK where water samples were being taken at many depths every sample that came back was UNK on board ship to get the silver nitrate to establish the UNK and hence the salinity
these days we can do it much easier and we do it UNK so we can use a relationship between UNK which has to be er UNK for temperature and pressure at which you're doing your readings and that gives us a measure of our UNK and then that gives us a measure back to our salinity
and modern UNK will automatically compensate for the temperature and pressure and do this conversion so you can get a direct read out from an electrical instrument of the salinity
but one must still be wary the fact that although we've got this nice electric UNK that we drop the probe into a bucket of water and it gives us er a salinity it is still entirely dependent on this ratio and this ratio is based on the UNK of composition which is very good for open ocean waters but breaks down in coastal waters where UNK processes where fresh water additions and the UNK loads of the rivers may actually alter this ratio okay
so although we've got a device we must use it with care when working in coastal waters
another way of measuring salinity is UNK
this is an this is er another this is a good one for use in the field it can be quite accurate it's certainly a very easy one to use in the field cos all you need is a thing that looks a bit like a telescope about four inches long and what tha the principle it's working on here is the fact that UNK the UNK index of water changes as you dissolve salts in it
so what it really is a fr UNK okay
it's measuring a UNK index of the solution but and giving you a read out in terms of salinity okay
so a useful field technique
do you have to UNK it first
sorry
presumably you UNK it first
well again all of these things should be done on water that's been passed through a filter to separate the water from the UNK yeah
however again in the field that's frequently not and you do literally drop your probe in a bucket
as the UNK said to the bishop
exactly i was just thinking the same thing
well that's the sort of composition which immediately UNK the question where do these salts come from and where do they go to
so sources and UNK of salts
what do you think the most obvious source is
yeah
UNK of rocks by rain water by frost by chemical action which is then UNK into rivers and carried from rivers into
however some salts are very UNK in river water but are very rare in UNK rocks
in particular chlorine the most dominant element in sea water it's quite common in river water but is extremely rare in the rocks that form the UNK
so the simple UNK model will not explain our distribution of chlorine
chlorine is an example of an element that is being recycled continually
the chlorine we detect in the rivers has actually come from the ocean
the chlorine is picked up as UNK containing salt for example from breaking waves taken up by the atmosphere carried over the land UNK down again gets into the rivers and ends up back in the sea
so chlorine is continually going through this cycle
ocean to UNK into the atmosphere carried over deposited as rain UNK back through the river system into the sea
looking in UNK figures river water is about three hundred times more dilute than sea water
how do you in the first place
i'll come to that in a second
ah right
sea water though contains UNK less hydrogen carbonate UNK and calcium than river water
so river water is greater than sea water UNK for those elements
okay
which implies that these must be UNK in some way out of the marine environment
they're obviously being continually carried in from the river water but are being taken out of the system somewhere in the marine environment
looking at that list would anybody like to suggest what sort of processes those substances are all involved in
UNK biological
UNK
yeah biological
UNK calcium hydrogen carbonate UNK material these things are probably ending up predominantly as deep sea UNK yeah remember
UNK and so on
so that's a sink for some material
let's come back to our chlorine then and think about well if it's not being UNK out of the rocks what's its ultimate source
and the simple answer is it would appear that it's UNK in origin
UNK very large UNK very large amounts of hydrochloric acid as a gas h c l gas and earlier in the UNK history UNK activity was much more widespread than it is now and during this period vast amounts of h c l were UNK
this is highly soluble so it is immediately washed from the atmosphere by rain into solution
and since then this chlorine has been continually recycled through the UNK
sorry one of the other tables you've got shows you a comparison between the elements which are present in UNK rock and in the sea and from that you can see which ones are a good reflection i e whi which elements have been transferred to the sea by direct UNK and which of them are UNK other processes either other sources or other UNK
so for example you can see chlorine the percentage of chlorine in solution expressed as a per centimetre solution is something like twenty four thousand but its percentage in UNK rock is nought point nought one three so there's this big excess of chlorine to explain
now arguments such as that in terms of composition of the sea relative to the composition of UNK rock
imply a steady state system or over a long term and if over the long term the rate of addition of material to the sea is UNK by the rate of removal
if there's a continual turnover of material we can actually calculate its residence time that is the average length of time a particular molecule of substance x spends in the ocean
and that would be calculated as the total amount dissolved in the ocean divided by its rate either of addition or removal so if we're assuming steady state the two will be the same whichever is easiest to ma measure and that would normally be expressed in years
sorry what does r t stand for again
residence time
so w what rate of addition or removal addition or removal
yeah right
ei either the rate of addition or the rate of removal cos if we're assuming a steady state the two will be the same and it's just a question of for some substances it might be easier to measure th the rate of addition for others it might be easier to measure the rate of removal
you should get the same answer if you did them both
mhm
there are some UNK residence times we'll note that the units are actually millions of years
chlorine has a residence time of infinity that's because it's being recycled round all the time so it's in the system forever
very low residence time for hydrogen carbonate UNK active and an intermediate time for things like sodium and potassium which are common in UNK rock and are also commonly being deposited through UNK and so on
in general there's a good correlation between a UNK residence time and its concentration
the more important it is in sea water the longer its residence time
the principal removal UNK mechanisms for salts are UNK a chemical reaction between the dissolved substance and a UNK such that it then becomes part of the UNK and obviously for UNK substances biological processes such as skeleton formation or conversion to biological tissue
just want to look at the carbonate system in a bit more detail
calcium carbonate is UNK on the UNK of UNK in sea water
the surface UNK are actually super UNK with calcium carbonate so there's a lot in solution there's more in solution than in theory is possible in super UNK condition and in addition there's a lot floating around in the solid form in biological material
spontaneous UNK from surface waters is actually fairly rare because most of the carbonate a ions are UNK bound up with magnesium ions in surface waters
so it's the presence of magnesium ions in surface sea waters that helps keep the calcium carbonate from UNK
sorry what's bound up with
the carbonate is bound up with magnesium ions UNK
very UNK but it is sufficient to pr prevent them UNK with calcium ions to form UNK
what's that
er two plus and two minus
now as th this weak UNK overcome by biological processes to actually produce solid calcium carbonate in UNK now as that UNK material UNK down through the water column it moves out of the region of super UNK and begins to dissolve
the region where it begins to dissolve is known as the UNK okay
so that's the region where calcium carbonate is no longer super UNK and so that UNK material as it UNK down through the water column would begin to dissolve
if you go deeper through the water column you'll come to a depth where all of the calcium carbonate has dissolved and that's known as the carbonate compensation depth or c d the carbonate compensation depth
these are not single depths they're more regions and the actual depth where the two regions occur varies around the ocean
the depth of the UNK is basically controlled by water chemistry the p h and the concentration of carbonate in the water
the c d is controlled both by the water chemistry the p h and carbonate concentration and by the rate of supply
so below an area with a very high biological activity where there's a very large amount of calcium carbonate raining down the c d will be deeper because it will take that much longer for this material that's UNK down to actually dissolve
yeah
so okay
so the c d will be deeper under UNK productive regions
yeah
so the c d will be deeper under regions with high biological productivity
and if you remember your UNK of deep sea UNK you will recall that calcium carbonate based deposits are rare in deep waters because it's all dissolved but are more common under regions where there is a high productivity because the c d will have been depressed
so you can get calcium carbonate deposits for example on the top of isolated sea UNK or mid ocean UNK
the carbonate system is also important in the control of sea water p h
typically sea water is UNK around about eight plus or minus nought point two p h units and p h is defined as the negative log of the concentration of hydrogen ions
variations in UNK away from this are typically controlled by the equilibrium we've already seen between the hydrogen UNK ion and carbonate and h plus
so this equilibrium is the principal mechanism for maintaining sea water p h
if it shifts that way you get a greater UNK of ion of h plus ions which moves the p h down making it more acid
how much chemistry can you remember
equilibrium UNK
if k is the equilibrium constant for that reaction then we can actually UNK our terms such that the concentration of hydrogen ions will be k multiplied by the concentration of hydrogen UNK ions over the concentration of UNK ions
in practice it's very difficult to measure the p h of sea water
because there are so many substances in there an and the relative concentrations of many of these ion species are dependent on equilibrium reactions such as this it makes it very difficult to measure using the traditional approaches
one way round that is to actually measure the UNK of the water
UNK is not a measure of how UNK a solution is it is therefore a stupid name
but it's the one the UNK give it
UNK is defined as the amount of hydrogen ions required to UNK the negative charge on the UNK i'll go through it again UNK
in the solution
okay
so that is the amount of hydrogen ions required to UNK the UNK the negative charge on the UNK
and therefore it can be found very easily very directly simply by UNK
and having measured the UNK you can simply convert back to work out the concentrations of the carbonate and UNK ions and from that you can calculate the p h using that relationship
okay
so in practice it's easier to measure the UNK and then back calculate to get that and hence the p h than to actually try and measure the p h directly from sea water
are you sure you wouldn't physics
right just to finish off i just wanna look at actual vertical UNK of elements in the ocean
we can actually UNK three types of distribution
firstly those substances which increase relatively rapidly with depth and then become constant and this group are usually referred to as the bio limiting element or a bi having a bio limiting distribution
substances which are required nutrients micro nutrients copper and zinc are required as micro nutrients by plant cells for example would show UNK like this de decreased levels in surface waters where er in the UNK zone biological activity is high they'll be continually stripped out of the water column there in the concentrations then increase as biological activity UNK and then becomes constant with depth
we then have a group of substances which are bio UNK this is concentration and that's depth UNK chlorine iron magnesium potassium sodium sulphate will all be examples of bio UNK substances
and of course because this is biological UNK it's not as simple as that there is a third category which is bio intermediate
these show some decrease in surface waters but not as severe as the bio limiting substances calcium UNK carbon would be examples of bio intermediate substances
why doesn't it tail off at the bottom then if it equals out at depth
i thought you said with the bio limiting it UNK out at depth as a concentration
well it is this is the concentration across here this is depth
so that's a constant concentration
yeah
everybody happy
follow all of that
good
do deep sea circulation tomorrow
UNK
that's a washing powder
that's right no that's UNK
ra UNK
sea water
keeps all the UNK clean
keeps them UNK white
you've got you've got a video which is scheduled for one thirty because you've got something else at two o'clock but you can have it now if you prefer to have it now rather than one thirty
doctor 's obviously a more UNK character than me because he had this room and the UNK was turned off
i have turned it on and it is doing its little best but our guests from the south are obviously
i'll
UNK it sounds like come dancing
oh i don't know i'm sure say anything rude
no honest
do they
some voices aren't allowed to er appear
are you still in here
it it's okay carry on it's alright i'm i
right
okay i'm sorry i haven't had level three supervision groups before so this is a whole new experience for me
well we're very high UNK you know
chris has given me my instructions so
oh no
i'm supposed to first say is th are you finding the course okay and to ask you about your projects
so course okay so far
supervisor
so mike have you got your project sorted out
well it's more or less in hand yeah
what you're doing
yeah
with stewart
yeah
so is it just a continuation of what you've done anyway
well more or less but he weren't UNK at any of the results so
oh i see right
i've got to start again
that's rotten
so are y are you just do
no it's quite fair actually
are you just doing are you just doing one er sorry j er are you just doing one project a t a two term project
yeah
right so you're s you're sorted out
charles what are you doing
er i'm doing something on wild salmon
oh right
who are you er with
er with gordon
yeah
oh right so what are you tell us about it what are you going to do
erm well alex and i are both doing it but alex has got his own rivers so he's doing it on his own sort of thing
alex
and er i'm think i'm doing mine more sort of related to er the eggs
right
so where
well sort of looking in that s er on the UNK
oh right
so i mean is this eggs that are put in by the i mean i
er yeah i think it will have something to do with that yeah
i've sort of er i've
so are you just doing a lit is it is it a two term project as well
yeah
and you're just starting a research
yeah
right
i've started that i've gotta just gotta i went and played on the computers yesterday
you went what
and played on the computers yesterday
oh right oh right
have you all by the way have you all tried this c d UNK thing
mm
in the library
it's quite fun
it's quite fun have you tried that
yeah that's what i tried yesterday
has anyone got anything useful out of it yet
no it's
yeah i know but they're not exactly over run with them are they
in the library or down here we have to do
have you got to be more specific with your requests
i haven't tried it
well probably but it do it s i mean it you either put in i mean i most
you're doing
most of the things that i've done have been on atlantic salmon and you put in atlantic salmon and you get seven thousand eight hundred
yeah
and forty UNK out
right
forget that
and you narrow it down and you get zero
oh right
right so you've got to play about with the system a bit more
i think so i think so
right
UNK i think it's more helpful i think than c d UNK isn't it
what's the difference between UNK and c d UNK
it's spelt different
no but UNK is just on the scientific end
so tell me about when you first moved in mr isn't it
yes
erm in nineteen fifty one to can you remember what it was like when you first moved in
yes there were er i think there was one two three four houses four or five houses that were occupied before we came in they were still building the UNK and er you know it was a it was quite a shock to us and the wife was a bit upset you know when having to we came from plymouth actually devon and er the wife was a bit er down you know all the night travelling all night with the children
oh
with three of them
i remember that
you remember it
yeah
yeah
yeah cos didn't you
and of course we arrived in harlow on the train and we couldn't see any new buildings anywhere you know near harlow mill
yes
and er they were coming up and went across to get a drink of UNK and it was a bloody hot day really you know a UNK day and erm we went across to this kind of cafe place that's opposite the station and i saw two men with rubber boots on
so i went over and ask them where the new town was and they told us where walk up the road till you come to the lights turn right follow the lane and you'll come to the new town erm
and that was the old UNK lane wasn't it
did you come by car
no by train
we never had a car had we
so you walked
we walked from the station yeah it's harlow
yeah we walked as far as the lights
harlow mill as it was then
on the what was then the a eleven
oh that was harlow town station then wasn't it
it's called harlow town
called harlow town and burnt mill but now it's the other way round
yes
and erm we'd got there and a young lady came along delivering milk you know with a big milk float and she put the twins brenda and
no i thought no
er no mother you and
mum i didn't
mum sat next to you in the front this she sat you two on top of the
on the float
yeah cos we had
and keith and i walked
and mum couldn't walk any further could she
so you had three children
yes mhm
and your UNK what nine and you have a twin
yeah i have a twin brother and erm
another nine and a brother fourteen
and UNK was five years old
well he was fourteen the following august
yeah he was five years old he was
that august we arrived mm and er when we got here of course it was just we went down this lane
eh
of course which is now UNK lane and
but didn't you come up a few days before us
you were here before us weren't you
no you've got it the wrong way round i went i brought you here and then i had to go back cos i was in the royal marine police
yeah but didn't you when you got here they'd given you don't you remember
ah no
and you went to and somebody was living in there
no love because wasn't built then
it was dad that bit was built
oh well no what happen was
don't you remember you had to go to the housing office
just before we left plymouth they altered it to i knew it was the
oh
it was
a hundred and eleven
a hundred and eleven
that's right
it was right opposite the pub now but that was all fields then weren't it
that was all fields yeah
so your wife hadn't seen the house
oh no
before you actually moved in
no we didn't know what we were going to
no it was a long way to come from plymouth you know so we didn't know
we came on a i think it was on a friday or saturday morning and i had to go back sunday night cos i was on duty on the monday back in plymouth and i did a month in plymouth er a month or five weeks no longer and i came up each weekend to see them my wife was left there then
didn't
it must of been it must of been very difficult for her
she had everything to do really
yeah i think i think she's
UNK shop hours
marvellous really you know to do it
and all our shopping was down at the old town you had to go down this lane to the old town if you wanted a stamp
yeah the nearest shops was the old town
or anything
but we got
the nearest shops and that of course were UNK or bishop's stortford
yeah but with bob and i bob and i went to
erm mark hall house
that's right
it isn't there any more beautiful old house like UNK house similar to UNK house wasn't it
mm
and they converted that into a school UNK school
remember the old servants quarters for er
yeah they made a built a playground that's all they did just had a playground
for the original mark hall
the rest of it was just the original house you know it was a beautiful place why they pulled it down
yeah
i suppose i suppose it was falling down
yeah
but it seems such a shame cos er big double gates you went in you know it was lovely erm where did keith go to school then
UNK grammar school
oh yeah he didn't go to school in harlow
he passed his eleven plus as it was then and er he went to a school called UNK street grammar school in plymouth and when we moved in here i had to go to UNK house i think they call it
yeah at UNK
to the council education offices to see what school i could get him in you see i wanted a good school for him because he was showing the ability you know er and er eventually i went to harlow grammar school that's what it was called then
yeah
and it was er a kind of public school
a boys' school
a boys' school and the headmaster there advised me not to put him there he said send him to UNK grammar school it's the best school in essex best grammar school in essex and he said that my two boys go there
poor keith had to go to this he had to go the station every day on his bike
yeah
and go all the way to UNK didn't he
yeah
to school every day
it sounds like a long way
well it's it is quite a long way
well he had a UNK was on the line er cambridge line so it wasn't too bad
he didn't have to change no but how UNK then
move to harlow
well i mo moved because promotion was in the line for me i was in the royal marine police in island depot in plymouth and er i'd been put on plain clothes work and i'd been doing acting sergeant you know when the sergeant was off sick and all that business and er i'd put been put in for this to move because we had a two bedroom bungalow but the twins were getting big and i realized that we'd have to have another bedroom you know very soon and er this seemed an opportunity to get a house and also in plymouth that plymouth was a naval town you see there was still those days there was still kind of a lower deck of sons what they call lower UNK in other words you know people in the lower deck of the navy their sons didn't really have much ever have much chance of getting into places like UNK college or UNK to do as UNK well the headmaster at UNK street school had said to me that keith was very keen on flying he was aeroplane mad you see and he wanted to go in the royal air force well he said to me he said oh no put him in the navy and as a chief art as an UNK so i said oh no i said if he goes in the navy or the service i want him to go in the front door not like me the back door i had ambition for him
anyhow that made me feel there was no future in plymouth for that so this opportunity came i came and when i got here they didn't carry any sergeants so i would of had to move again if i wanted promotion which i wasn't prepared to do for this mainly for his education unfortunately the
didn't get much thought then like
cos they weren't showing any exceptional
life always good enough for us
abilities at school
and er
so you can so you got a promotion and you were working in the navy when you came
i'd left the navy
oh i see
i'd left my pension from the navy but i'd gone into what was then known as the police er UNK police
so you didn't actually work in harlow
yes you came with the UNK didn't you
i came with the UNK here but they had a factory here
there was an UNK factory in harlow
oh
a research laboratory in west road and
cos everybody who moved into harlow moved because there was a job here
oh that's right
oh yes you got your job really through the
you got the house through the job
you got the house through the your job i should say
yeah
and you were allocated this house in the UNK
pardon
you were allocated the house in the UNK
that's right
you didn't choose
before we came here no
oh no but we moved how long we were we at a hundred and eleven dad
cos we moved to ninety five wasn't built when we moved into a hundred and eleven
that's it
a hundred and eleven was a three bedroom house then we moved into a four bedroom house didn't we
that's right
at ninety five but i don't know how long we were how long were we at hundred and eleven
oh a matter of months four six months
so it wasn't long no it couldn't of been very long
oh it couldn't be much longer than that my father my father retired he was a UNK in the village
oh that's right yeah
in the north riding of yorkshire and he retired and he went and er lived in a bungalow belonging to er it was then sir ever UNK
retired
who had an estate and there were st UNK incidentally er UNK that's where the name came from for the books and friend of theirs and relation of his wrote the book i don't know something like that and anyhow eventually i got
they came
worried about them being so far as they've the only child and talked them into come down and live with us so then i applied and got a move to just after it was built which was a four bedroom house
so that your father could come to live with you
so that my father could come down and live with me
yeah and we lived there for a long time didn't you stayed in that house for a long time
oh yes
till after i was married
mm i think you were all married from that house
before we'd all we were all married yeah
yeah in ninety five and er
we've been in this house for about twelve years
we moved into a two bedroom house but it's only up the road at you know you're really not very far away are you
no well we had a four bedroomed house and they were all married mother and father had gone back to yorkshire
yes yeah
my father was dead died in the
UNK and er he missed his cricket and what have you
well tell me what it was like for you from your point of view erm coming to a new town with a teenage son because most of the couples who came either didn't have any children or were just about to have baby
that's right
so what was it like you know from your point of view and first yes
well to tell you the truth i wasn't very keen i er i felt that we made a mistake
yeah
neither of them did want that did you
you felt it ought to be because the feeling i had nobody for at least another generation would really have the roots in harlow that was looking at my children
mm
you see and i felt myself well they're plymouth they were all born in devonport and plymouth
mm
the oldest boy devonport
and that's where their roots were
mm
do you follow
yes of course
so coming here it felt as though we'd UNK and they would never get their roots down because they weren't really
yeah but i've always felt i really feel as if
oh you've always
harlow is
yeah
you know where i belong i don't quite honestly don't really like harlow new town any more i al i did up until about oh eight or nine years ago i thought it was a great place and all the UNK that said you know oh i'd love to be back in london i thought they were UNK you know to live in london the di the difference is i mean my husband's a UNK and he wouldn't would never well now he would never go back to london you know it's a dump he likes harlow but er i think i don't like it now because it's expanded so much you know when we when we were first here mind you when we first moved in it was ever so difficult for us kids because there was the old town kids versus the new town kids and they hated us they really
really
didn't like us oh no matter where we went there was always there wasn't trouble like there is now i mean there was no violence as such you know but we thought it was at the time you know they weren't very nice to us at all
mm
and of course we was i suppose we weren't very nice to them
did you mix in the school or was it just
erm
er new town children in the school
no it was really new town school children because there was UNK and UNK school down the old town and that's where the old town all the old town people went children went so really mark hall was just new town children you know and then when we were eleven and had to go to another school we er there was no comprehensive school in harlow then er we had to get on a bus and go to UNK that was didn't we
yeah
we used to have to catch the bus every morning and go to UNK to school until mark hall was built and erm and there was only one part of mark hall school built when we went there was only a few classrooms and er it's all grew up the school grew up around us you know it's a bit
how did you feel cos you said that you can remember the first day that you arrived
yeah i know
can you recall that
yeah oh yeah i remember it quite well i can remember that i the only parts of harlow i liked were the country lanes i didn't like all the new houses but then i'd been brought up in the country
mm
you know
mm
excuse me
this came from the parents of the children in the old town because of far as i can gather from talking to the people in the old town
that er oh course like everywhere else like the building of stansted airport or the you know there was people who were against i mean the beautiful countryside spoilt by a new town so they had these committees and brigadier
and these people you know er had a UNK and all this business and i think some of that rubbed off on the children and you've
yes
got this er not hate it was just a kind of
UNK
there was there was a UNK
UNK to the new children that i should of
i suppose i can understand it now i mean it must of been a lovely place and then to have all these new houses going up you know but erm i mean there was some lovely lanes
oh yeah often used to get up in the morning and look out of the bedroom window and see a UNK in the back garden
yeah which you don't see now
and rabbits you know
so you've still got a feeling of the countryside then
oh it was yeah it was nice i mean
yeah i mean you had to go across fields to move house didn't you
pardon
you used to have to go across fields
oh yes
to UNK house
yeah
and yet you know now it's just up the road
first avenue was first avenue was built
it seemed a long way away
er all of this side er you know first avenue do you
yeah
well all this side of first avenue of course was all country all this was fields and corn fields and what have you
most of the other side was as well
and woods UNK odd UNK here and there
yeah there was just the church there
beautiful we used to go for some lovely walks didn't we
yeah
walk down to the river it was all countryside
yeah
from where we lived from there apart from the fact they were building a few factories then
a few factories yeah
the other side of the factories was all country
but you
down to the river you know
you could walk down UNK lane to burnt mill station it was lovely down there
little burnt mill station
burnt mill station
of course yeah
all the lanes around it you know of course they cos mrs next door to you lived in
she lived in those
one of those houses
yes oh yes she
by the station her husband worked on the railway there
he was the signal man at UNK was
yeah
alf yeah
if you can go back to the first day that you arrived
mhm
when you first saw the house for the very first time and when your wife saw the house what was the reaction
well it wasn't er the wife it was a bit of a UNK we had a bungalow you see a small bungalow which was in a very nice part of plymouth well on the UNK of plymouth actually almost in the country and er to come and find this well to her it'd be like a terraced house her mind went back to the old days in manchester where she came from with the old terraced houses and i think she UNK that then to go in a house that had a square room do you follow
and that er it was kind of and the garden was small cos we had it a quite big garden and you know things like that i think and the travelling and everything i think got her down a bit i know she sat down and had a cry yeah
and how long did it take before you felt settled in
oh a long time er matter of years really before i could settle down at as i say to me it was roots
yes
that's what it UNK to
yes
and you see then i started thinking what i should of done when i like everyone else thinking what i should of done
mm
which is ridiculous really you don't live for the past but you did think i think everybody did
yeah
you know thought back to if i'd of only gone to yorkshire gone back to manchester i'd of felt my roots see i was born in manchester and
yes
yorkshire UNK on a yorkshire farm and you know what i mean and now i go to manchester and say thank god i didn't come here
yeah
er because to me it's a UNK city
mm
and even the village UNK village it's all new houses around it now you it it's all altered it's everything's altered
do you feel different did you do you feel differently about harlow now in UNK
