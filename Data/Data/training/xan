oh yes i can put up with harlow now i'm not er i'm not over the world over the you know
that's probably cos we were brought
you like it
we were always brought up in the country you know
yes
i mean it's expanded so much innit
i mean erm UNK and all that over there UNK
mm
what was the accommodation like in the UNK and in the four bedroom house in which you spent most of your life what was that what was that like
well it was nice
UNK house innit
a big house
there's four bedrooms
an end house
it was quite a good
but
family house but i mean for space and that sort of
yeah
thing but to me it always looked like a UNK
some of the neighbours are still there mr and mrs is still next door
next door people who
you know that were in it when they were still brand new
who moved in and
just about the same time as we did
yeah they did when it was new
and they're still there their family mm
it's got it's got a block of flats at the side hadn't it
and a UNK
it was an in house but it wasn't
yeah they were building them when we got there weren't they
yeah
was the block of flats erm what was that called
er well i don't know isn't that they're UNK they've got that big eye on the front i don't i don't know if you i don't know if it's still there i mean
i don't know
it's a dead end road so
it's called night and day isn't it
the eye is it
yeah
is it it's like a big eye and it was black one side and white the other side and the black side had a white pupil and the white the other side had a black one
night and day
yes
that was
mm
the idea
and it was sort of quite a thing when that was went up and ooh it was so awful they had some terrible things in this town didn't they
the UNK and things you know but something they've got some nice things now they had that big statue outside the church
that was
that was moved weren't it
in it in the in the in a museum or something now isn't it
they UNK it
it's up the town centre somewhere i think
no it's i think it was taken away to a museum wasn't it
i know the one you mean i can't think of the name
yeah
it's the
a greek name
yeah but i don't know what it was called
child man or a woman holding a child
oh yes that's the one
oh that one's just outside the library
oh is it
i thought it was
mhm
getting mixed up
mm
but to me all
all that was there was mark hall house wasn't there the church and the UNK
and erm UNK house you know there was there was nothing else it was just fields everywhere else
it was all fields
it was really lovely but then
the house that you come from had a bathroom and had all the UNK
yeah
so really you weren't coming into accommodation which was a step
oh no well
up for you like a lot of them here
well no probably mum and dad didn't think so but
no you see that
but bob and i did i could i could remember the day we moved in to a hundred and eleven er we'd never been upstairs in a house before you see we'd been brought up in a bungalow and we'd never ever been upstairs and the thoughts of going upstairs to bed you know was fantastic
mm
and all we kept saying on the train coming down bob and i oh i hope we can slide down the UNK
UNK
and could you
no cos they bent round and we had a tie we did but it was only a little UNK you know we tried it
what do you think was so particular about having stairs
i don't know it was just a UNK we'd never ever i remember an aunt of ours that lived in plymouth near us she had a house with an upstairs but she had a downstairs toilet so we never got to go upstairs you know it's just one of those stupid things i suppose i thought it was great and another attraction was i think one of the main reasons you got us to really want to come to harlow was the fact that we'd have a television
yeah
we'd never like i mean i can remember in plymouth dad saying when we get there erm we'll buy a television we'll have a television and we didn't know what he was talking about and he said it's a wireless with pictures you know and our minds were UNK we just couldn't understand it and then of course that was another bit of UNK got us to come
anything you remember when you first saw a television
yes yeah when you had one delivered that's the first time we'd ever seen one wasn't it
oh yes we'd sat there
and didn't mum have a new cooker
mum had a new cooker yeah
yeah
was it gas or electric
gas
gas it was
yeah she was over the moon with it though wasn't she
what
she was over the moon with it
oh yes aye
she'd never seen anything like it but i think we had quite a lot of new furniture didn't we
yeah quite a bit
we'd brought some with us
odd things well of course bed linen a lot of bedrooms and that to UNK and
well tell me about the furniture that you brought
oh we've got
you've still got your suite haven't you
pardon
still got your three piece suite
we've still got the same and the dining one
and the dining one and the UNK yeah
when did you buy it
nineteen thirty seven thirty seven bought it in plymouth and our dining room suite i'll always remember this cost twenty eight UNK not the dining i'm sorry the three piece suite
three piece suite
twenty eight UNK and when we got to harlow i had it recovered by firm in UNK twenty eight UNK
to have it recovered mm
yes the same price
but it
and we still use the same dining table UNK chairs dining chairs mind you they that kind to of thrown out reluctant to do it
they wouldn't no they
we had a lot of affection for it really and i mean we've had it so long and it was the first furniture we had when we married
you wouldn't do that now would you
and er what else
do you remember when we
we've got a bedroom suite as well apart from the gentleman's wardrobe cos we had them
during the UNK and that burnt all my wardrobe
mm
and side of the bed but we get
in harlow
no
no this was in plymouth
oh
and during the i was away actually i wasn't there but er it was all burnt so i did away with that and we managed to do the bed up somehow
mm
it's still going we've still got the dressing table the big wardrobe
can you remember what the make of the furniture was
well i don't know what make it was but it came from the house the UNK company of union street plymouth i can't remember the shop
do you remember when you got rid of one of your UNK last year or the year before they bought two new UNK chairs and one of the UNK nearly had it
we had to get rid of them they were nearly UNK
and the men came delivered the new ones and erm one of them er oh you said would you take the old one and they said yeah fine you know dad said well it'll take both of you oh no i can do that he couldn't even lift it you know cos they were so solid and two of them had a heck of a job didn't they
yeah
getting it out and that was just an UNK don't know what they'd do if they had to move the UNK but erm that's the difference in
well we had to higher seats really well these are alright but when you get to my age
can't get in and out of them so easily
have a job getting out of them and er you know more or less the higher UNK
mm
better for us
and the dining room suite is it oak
oh it's UNK oak
mm
it's not er solid oak it's UNK mm it's oak yeah
and when you came to harlow you said that you bought some new furniture
yeah we bought a new bedroom suite i think that's about the first thing
i had a new bedroom suite didn't i
oh yes
and that cos when i got married i took it with me didn't i
that's right
do you still have it
and then my mother and father came down in the four bed when we moved to ninety five in the four bedroom yes they brought their bedroom suite down with them
and did you buy the bedroom suite in harlow
erm just trying to think where we bought it
UNK
er what UNK in the stow
no i bought my dining room suite this UNK dining room suite in there i've still got it yeah that was a long oh yeah the shops have changed quite a lot in the stow haven't they
yes when we came of course the stow was er
you know
yeah it was just a little
had a little
trees weren't there to make the stow
we thought it was quite something when we got the shops weren't it
i remember it happening but i can't remember somebody came to open it did somebody come to open the stow you know
forget now somebody came to open
i remember there were UNK given out to go to it UNK party i had an invitation but i didn't go for some reason
mm
i was working or something but erm two of mr went you know that neighbour of mine
mm
so when you bought the bedroom suite erm can you remember if erm what the purchase tax was on it then
oh i couldn't i'm sorry
can you remember it obviously it wasn't rationing any more there wasn't utility
no
any more at that time was there
no i think utility had more or less finished then
it finished at the end of fifty two
yeah i remember i remember having a ration book for sweets
that went on for quite a long time
oh yes oh yeah oh yeah
but the actual rationing on furniture ended at the end of nineteen fifty two but they brought in something called schedule t
we must of bought that suite before then
before then yes we must of bought it when we moved in cos i mean i wasn't without a bed
we did we bought it as soon as we moved in because er
you must of had
must of had one straight away yeah
yeah
you i'd of told you mum should of come up she wouldn't come would she
she'd probably remember
she'd remember things like that
i tell you
yes
i'm very interested in that particular period just before just when you get the after maturity of when they had this strange very schedule d and er the tax the purchase tax
mm
mm
and all that sort of thing and how it affected people buying furniture because there was a very high luxury tax
that's right
highly expensive furniture
mm
sixty six and two thirds
yeah but the single bedroom suite i remember that
i wouldn't know that
and you can't remember where you bought it
it must of been fifty one june
i bet UNK still got the bill somewhere
it must of been at the end in the autumn at least of fifty one
i wouldn't be a bit surprised i'll try and find out for you
i wonder if i know
sixty one weren't they
mm
you know and the stuff we had that cos we've changed it all
can you tell me about the light fittings that you bought when you first got married
i'm trying to think i got oh god that was UNK cos we lived with mum and dad for three months until we got a UNK in UNK
mm
erm i can remember the three piece suite it was that UNK stuff you don't see it now do you
it was grey and mustard it sounds UNK but we were a bit i suppose it was the time we had a purple carpet we had an orange wall do you remember that living room
yeah
you needed UNK to go in it erm oh you didn't really actually it looked it looked alright but it was very modern my mum and dad didn't think it was up to much you know we thought it was great
why did you UNK why did you want to have modern
well i don't know it's just what we liked at the time you know we liked anything that was considered a bit way out then you know
mm
and we had er i mean we had a bright orange UNK chair and when that came out it was called the orbit or something really weird and it had a big back on it and we thought it was great i mean i think it's awful now some of the things we had i'll have to try and find some photographs cos i've got a case full of photographs upstairs
yeah i've got a lot of
i've got lots of them inside that UNK you know when
that would interest me very much
with my er eldest son's nearly nineteen
oh yes you've got those
cos when he was a baby we took loads of photographs inside
and you said that you had an orange wall only one orange wall
on one orange wall yeah
which wall was it
i can't remember what was on it was a plain well we had er french windows with a UNK it was an upstairs UNK and the wall that end was orange and my father in law made us the UNK bar do you remember that UNK bar
that's right yeah
you made us with white UNK on the front oh it sounds awful now but
did got rid of that about a year twelve eighteen months ago
oh and i had sort of marble on the UNK marble contact that contact stuff on top purple carpet er mustard and grey suite that was an odd shape that suite wasn't it
it had sort of round chairs
yeah
you know those round chairs with everything had those legs those screw on legs everything the coffee table didn't it
the suite everything had screw on legs and we bought erm a UNK that was a UNK beautiful thing it was it was ever so expensive then i might even have the bill for that somewhere we bought that at the town centre in UNK was it
erm
yeah UNK
that was my twenty first birthday we bought that on so that was before gary was born and er that had black screw on legs as well the UNK had black screw oh we didn't have a television we had a second hand television about a year after we were married and i remember UNK street starting that started about when we got married
what year did you get married in
nineteen sixty one er our anniversary was a few weeks ago twenty one years we've been married but er
have you er
we were we were furniture made you know all we thought about was the home and in fact once we couldn't afford any wall paper we were decorating so george painted the wall white and we got UNK and even the dustbin lid and with er a black pen felt type pen i suppose although felt pens weren't out then
i don't know that
i don't think but that sort of thing but he drew black circles and triangles all over this white wall it looked i've got a photograph of that
was that
that looked fantastic and everyone said oh god he's so UNK you know and he's a butcher he wasn't really but we just used to sit down and think of all these ideas you know
where did you get these ideas from
well they er nowhere we didn't get them from anywhere we just used to think them up and everyone thought we were UNK didn't they
i bet john liked it
john george's brother
george's brother yeah
he's quite a bit UNK ain't he
yeah well i think george is actually
george is
i mean when he does his window displays you've never seen anything like it you know so i think he's got quite er he's quite good at things like that but erm we've UNK down a bit now
so you were considered UNK were you
oh yeah where the furniture was concerned yeah we only liked it if people came in and said oh my god what have you done now you know
what kind of curtains did you have
oh i can remember when UNK curtains first came out we bought some of those terrible things they just went in holes you know if you touched them too much they just went in holes
they were UNK
yeah
mm
and if you washed them you mustn't put clothes pegs in them cos the pegs would make holes in them
mm
fancy having stuff like that
was it a sheer or a solid material this UNK
i don't know what you mean
was it like a see through like a net kind of curtain no
oh no it's the big curtains i think one we had great big green leaves on
mm
do you remember those
terrible
well i liked them when we bought them
mum and i used to go in and say why it looks alright and when we got outside
ain't it awful
ain't it awful
living with that and then when we got rid of that purple carpet
we got
we brought a bright orange carpet do you remember that bright orange er when that first came out
with the with the erm that big white cat on it what make was that
they used to advertise it with a big white UNK cat
not sue and lord
oh it might of been
mm
don't know but we had this bright orange carpet mind you even we couldn't live with that for too long
so that was after the purple carpet
yeah oh we loved all the gold furniture and that's all we used to do was walk round looking at furniture and things
where did you buy the furniture
oh mainly in harlow
mm
i can remember we went to erm oh cos we moved out of harlow didn't we when nick was eleven months old so that's about fifteen years ago and lived in hatfield for three years so and we used to go to UNK department store then and look at stuff
i can remember one standard lamp we had it was really weird and people used to say that'll be alright if you were landing a plane cos it had UNK i mean now they erm in fact you can still buy the same sort of thing but then it was so way out
yeah
it had sort of round shade with a bulb and the bu but it looked like an eye you know because the bulb came out and you moved these three things around you can still buy them now but er then they were a bit way out
and this was when you were living in hatfield
yes
so that would of been
that would be about fifteen years ago
yes nineteen sixty eight or so
mm
a very nice house in hatfield weren't it
yeah it was a lovely house yeah but we wanted to come back to harlow you see so we did like well we always liked harlow really the only reason we went to erm er hatfield was the fact that harlow council no way would move us out of that UNK we had two boys and we lived upstairs and gary had all sorts of accidents on those stairs in fact we all had because they were outside erm so in the winter they UNK up
mm
concrete stairs and george nearly killed himself on them one morning but er and we tried everything to get out of there you know no one would exchange a two bedroom UNK for a house and of course i UNK for a garden but and er george got a job in hatfield and they offered this three bedroom house the commission for the new town rent was cheaper than here so we moved over there but er as i say we were only there two three years and we came back again we were over here we used to come over here three times a week when we lived there didn't we
mm
so we got back to harlow again that wallpaper but erm what was it called again UNK in this style
yeah
erm cos mary that still works in there she her husband worked for either mr henry i can't remember his name the man that owned it and i think i think perhaps they were brothers or something she her husband owns it now it's UNK or something now
yeah do it yourself there's new
yeah but we used to buy all our wallpaper
at the stow
in there yeah
they use to sell all the paper and all that business then
to do erm wallpaper and we loved and wallpaper and you is there you couldn't see the book anywhere er probably in london you could but erm round here you couldn't but they had the book down here
er how did you know about it
well only because we'd seen it in the shop
from the shop
yeah
and it was only in
well dave worked in there george's friend worked in there as well yes it was it was expensive wallpaper for then it was so way out i mean we had red UNK wallpaper in the bathroom you know you just don't see er actually they'd be really nice designs now you just don't see them now and we had er a bright blue wallpaper that had big circles on it do you remember that one
mm
that cost us a fortune well we thought so then
at that time
yeah
was that in the living room
yeah i'd have to try and er see if i've got any of those bills anywhere i know that UNK upstairs cos erm we did that cupboard out the other day and i found all the photographs all our old photographs in a box but the box had fallen to bits so
mm
i'd put them all in an old UNK and erm cos i couldn't just put them in there i had to have a look they're UNK and that book was in there so i can definitely get you that but i wouldn't go up in the loft i'm afraid i'm so scared of UNK so er you know if you if you want to come back some time when my husband's here i mean he can tell you more about the wallpaper and decorating and i'll get him to get that out
can you remember what kind of paint you used
oh no he'll tell you that
yeah
i wasn't allowed to touch
but did you did
a paint brush i tried
no
painting the kitchen once and i got into so much trouble it took him so long to rub it all off and start again he made me promise i'd never touch a paint brush again but he i mean he would definitely be able to tell you what paint he used and
mm because there was a change over
to the UNK wasn't there
yeah
words of wisdom
what we need to do now is make them look interesting and we do that using the what is called UNK options
and those are actually listed on page eight
so essentially what we're going to be doing are going through er the lessons that are actually outlined in page eight and page nine of your booklet
now one of the features of microsoft word is that a only lets you work with text which is what is called selected and if you actually move the cursor down a bit so that it's not at the beginning of a document and then we'll follow our way through these various selecting text keys which are outlined in that paragraph section three six one
so we u if we use function key f seven we move through the document one word at a time backwards and f eight is the UNK key to that we move through the document one fa word at a time
so just try that
so as we go through we're UNK we er accepting one word at a time
now f nine doesn't do what it says here actually that's a an error on my part
if you hit f nine it UNK the current sentence
i've actually lost the middle bit of my book
there it is
right
so f nine UNK the current sentence that you're in
f ten takes you through the document one sentence at a time so you can work your way through the document one sentence at a time
so it's not actually a next paragraph it's one sentence
unbelievable isn't it
so you're okay so far
well mine doesn't seem to go through the
does it
yeah
for f nine
yes true
it is one paragraph at a time so it is correct
i hope so
i was having a job to recognise what was a pa er a paragraph as far as microsoft word is concerned is the space between two hits of the return key okay
whereas a sentence is the space between er the beginning of er between two full stops
a new way of using the english language when you're word processing is absolutely another world
okay
erm if you go shift f nine or shift f eight it goes through the document i think one sentence at a time
yep
and shift f seven takes you back through the document one sentence at a time
shift f nine UNK the current line we've not er stated i think
yeah shift f nine er accepts the current line where the cursor is located
and probably the most useful key of all when you're doing global UNK is shift f ten and you select the whole document
so if you wanna select all the text you've written she shift f ten UNK the whole document
and essentially you only will change the appearance of the text which is appearing in your UNK video
so if you actually want to UNK something you want to make it bold you le you have to select it first and then you can carry out the tha the function
so if everybody UNK the text that they wan of their document and we'll just play around with it show you what a mess you can actually create using these UNK keys
so everybody have document and hit shift f ten and they're on page nine now if we go hold down the alt key and type b and you'll just see er a UNK go down the screen an then you don't actually see anything but if you alt u everything appears UNK alt k UNK everything into small UNK alt s strikes through everything and alt i UNK all the words
if you don't press your arrow you'll see what a mess you've created in your document
you've made the text bold UNK struck through UNK and totally UNK
so you've now actually taken all that nice typing that you've done and UNK it totally UNK
fortunately this is not permanent
so if you select all the text again shift f ten and press the alt space bar then all of that UNK is removed and it takes you back to your text as it was
so from basically making it totally UNK you're back to where you started
so what we've been doing is we've been taking words and we've been changing their appearance
we've UNK them UNK them whatever this is what is called character UNK and these are eliminated or removed with the alt space bar
the next set of features that are actually mentioned erm relate to the way in which paragraphs are laid out
so if we actually have everything highlighted again and we'll actually not follow the list as in the book we'll if you type in alt c all your text moves to the centre go alt r everything moves to the right and alt l again it takes you back to left justified
so now we're altering the space the words actually placed on the page
go alt n and you can see what's happening is your text is actually being UNK one tab stop at a time so it ends up as a narrow thin UNK of text UNK down the page and if you do this really UNK you can end up with a document that is only just one word wide
it's a great way for producing long UNK or waste paper but and if you wanna actually reverse this process alt m takes it back the other way
and if you get fed up of moving text one tab stop at a time if you go alt p you then actually remove all of the paragraph UNK that you add and it takes you back to your starting position
so when you got paragraph UNK you can
eliminate paragraph UNK with alt p
now has anybody actually got themselves in a total mess
few UNK of UNK from the back
let's try another one is it go in text highlighted try alt t
do you know what happens there
you wha create what is called hanging UNK
your text and your paragraphs are UNK by one tab stop but accept the first line
so we have looked something like our in our conclusions you'll find the alt t is actually quite useful
because you can go down in your first line move to the first letter o after the number hit the tab key and you've actually lined up the first line along with the rest of your paragraph
so you produce nice numbered lists looking very neat
okay
everything is lined up underneath the tab stop
now this kind of ordering text on a page if you're using a typewriter takes quite a lot of skill but if you're a with a word processor it's actually quite easy
honest
right
oh
have you got yourself into a total er
yes
right
okay
go shift f ten or select now go alt p and cancel all paragraph UNK
if you will just wait it takes a bit of time to get back where you want
ah
yeah
so however a big a mess you make of things however big a mess you make of things everything is usually UNK
so rarely can you actually mess up a document in such a way that is totally UNK than the way in which things look
it's not coming right over
yeah
right fine
can't get anyway
go alt space bar should be it
so this is fun learning to format
if you got mice i you can also make things easier by actually moving that arrow around until you get to the individual word that you actually want to find and actually then you stop your cursor there
so if you've got a mouse you could actually help speed up a lot of this editing but i said i've not written in the mouse commands into this schedule because we didn't actually have mice on all work stations when this was written
so as i go round i'll show you erm how to use the mouse er a as and when it becomes er appropriate
so what you'll have to do now is go back to erm page eighteen i guess no haven't got page eighteen have we
i keep on losing bits of my document
yeah i should get one that yeah page ten it says return to your letter and essentially i it tells you all the various UNK options that you want to apply to your document to make it look neat and tidy
so just go through pa the er commands on page ten and follow the instructions
and you should actually then produce a letter which is neat and tidy and worthy to send to doctor and not to your cat
and just to prove that some students have got the hang of this is a letter that er david produced and it actually looks quite good
so he's only had the same length of time doing this as you have so by the end of the afternoon you ought to be in the position to print out a really neat final version of the letter
one that you'll be proud of
can i borrow a book please
yeah sure
also if anybody's not actually paid me for their book that they actually purchased last week i'm open to accept payment today
so is anybody in immediate problems at the moment or you're o okay so i'll it's your chance now to do some work then for the next twenty minutes or so
can you accept payments next week
yes
i'll go on accepting payment until the course finishes
okay
i'll keep reminding you
oh is it possible to
sir
copy one disc onto another disc how come i've done that
and why is it
you want the file off
no why
i seem to have gone into this exactly the same somehow
well if you copied all the files over
well i haven't though
i ju i jus i haven't been asked to
but i wonder if i've done something copied one to six
i bet that has
if you go into dos right
so you go into a cos we've got that disc in
yeah that's the one that i keep
oh
then just ask it to list all the files on that disc
yeah
yeah
and then there's the next one
oh right
and that now will list the same files on that disc
right
and in fact it is more or less the same but you check if some of them are missing
but then i've lost my
i've lost
well
all the other things that were on this disc originally
ee
yeah originally
work
that one is now on this one there's nothing on this
and you just used all the just did that
yeah i just did it as you said
i did a few of them
right
well that's alright
i did that
yeah
i mean some of your letters are there aren't they
erm
there's some of there
yeah but that's and a couple of ones like that and that one
that one but i actually got onto the server
yeah but that's what's on the server isn't it
yeah
but then that's all your files that are available now i think you've lost
some of them must have been on there
have you done your boot
no but that's on that one
this one here
oh yeah
well i think that's happened it's not like they dis totally disappeared
is there any way you can delete like the whole the at once
yes
right
i mean if you want to say delete a temporary file press UNK for delete
yeah
then star that stands for a wild card that'll do all files which have got the back up
oh right
you better go and get some tea margaret i haven't had a chance yet
oh right
have you not done your bit yet
i've done my bit
yeah
oh
right
come and have a cup of coffee then
erm yeah
well i ooh
yeah that needs to be signed and then we can use these and any future occasions when we're all in the same place
okay
at the same time
what a very left handed
person
writing position you have
yeah
yes
yeah
that's a v
how can you be very left handed
well no it was the writing position which is very typically left handed rather than you being very
ah
left handed if you see what i mean
that that's the
you UNK round
yes
rather than turning the paper but UNK your hand round
erm it's a product of UNK or er primary education isn't it
you will be right handed
no i won't
you will be right handed UNK and we won't let you turn your paper
yes
i had a teacher for all of three months tried to make me write with my right hand
didn't last
it happens
erm
minutes of the last meeting
yeah they're not really minutes they're just what i could remember afterwards
i was going to make the minutes up from the tape you see
oh yes
ah
of course
er of course
okay well i think what we did was erm right we talked about the list of UNK things that we can't record because UNK already done them
mm
yes
erm now i was supposed to check and i'm afraid i haven't whether we still need to get UNK from scotland and liverpool
okay
erm but i will check
i've got to talk to them tomorrow
mm
erm i've got a note or i had a note to write to the admin at the university and i have done erm saying that UNK been approaching people UNK for not writing beforehand and saying that UNK been approaching people and if they've got a problem they should write back p d q
oh and by the way how about recording erm meetings of the administration erm
mm
i haven't written to the head of the UNK department
erm but i don't think that's as important
but i will do it
but i might do it by talking to them rather than by writing to them
it's friendly
erm oh dear this is going to be a long list of things i was supposed to do but didn't
don't worry
erm we talked about david's attempt to get union meetings
erm
mhm
colin rang colin rung back and said erm no way UNK
oh
in regards to what
erm to regard er recording trade union meetings
ah
er which is fair enough
did he say why
did he say why
yeah
when you talked to him
he said he said erm he thought people might be less willing to speak at the meeting if they knew it was being recorded which seems entirely reasonable
yeah
erm yeah i mean you know
there's nothing we can really do to
no
er whatever reasons people give we have to accept as reasonable reasons
reasonable re yeah
whatever
yeah
erm i've also got a note here to write to karen
which i again haven't done
right
erm have you been doing anything else at work
erm
about getting mock interviews or interviews or whatever
no i haven't
erm
right okay
well i'll maintain that as a note to er write to this person
erm clare suggested that mike record that presentation he's doing
i asked him he was negative erm and i've got a feeling he never even turned up for it anyway
erm
he was quote ill unquote
it's next week it's
it is
friday next week
i'll UNK him again
mm
erm i'll be talking to him tonight
you try him again
so i'll jump up and down on his UNK toes and see what happens
erm i tried phoning james the place where he's actually doing this training course
mm
and the UNK e who's the person i wrote to there
is erm UNK hard to track down
er really quite impressive actually
erm they obviously have the right person teaching this management course if you know that's one of the prime functions of a manager is to be UNK at all times
that's right
erm so she is in fact UNK at all times
so i'm going to keep trying on monday
mhm
erm somebody and i think it was derek and i put down derek as a guess was supposed to be getting a list of local area mps to whom i can then write
aha
i didn't
you didn't
i completely forgot about it
no problem
i shall write it down this time
good oh
erm
i was supposed to and again haven't asked UNK about finding out erm when and where by elections are coming up
i don't think there are any coming up
they would be very big news at the moment given how small the government majority is
yeah
given the last two terms the government had over a hundred majority a by election wasn't important
mm
with a twenty one majority it becomes important cos all it needs is eleven by elections
yeah
there are council elections in york coming up in may
erm
council elections are something that we need to look at in other areas
mm
erm but i'm not sure how we go about that
i shall enquire er if th there's well i'll i guess i'll get in touch with erm the er town hall in york
mm
and ask about council elections
er who the candidates have to er make their UNK known to who's the returning officer and so
yeah
on and that way you can find out who the candidates are and once we know who the candidates are we can start going out and seeing if they have public meetings or whatever
yes
yeah
erm i think it would be useful to try and find similar local elections erm in other areas
well obviously it'd be useful
but i don't know how we'd go about that other than just writing to town councils
just writing general letters to town councils
well there's no reason not to do that since we'll also be wanting to see if we can tape council meetings
mm
mm
so it's a it's a double
yeah
use
everywhere has a town council doesn't it
yes
everywhere that's got a postal address has a town council at that post town really doesn't it
i mean
yes
postal towns tend to be the place where the council is
yeah
so if i just UNK write to a selection in every one of the areas we're covering
yeah
seems reasonable
erm okey doke
UNK de UNK de UNK where are we
erm david did you check with the town hall about
no
UNK weddings
right
that's on the list
somebody erm said they were going to and it wasn't me so it was one of you three said they were going to check if the ball was having a speaker this year
erm and
i definitely didn't say that
i don't know who
well it was men it was
i
mentioned as a plan
i can check it then
erm and also check whether any of the college UNK this term or year next term whatever are going to be having a speaker
erm got a note here that you're you two aren't going away till may
i
uh huh
presume that's still true
it is
this is still the case
erm
well th it is the case that we're not going we're definitely not going away before may
yeah
and we have yet to be contacted erm despite th the fact that at the time we had our last meeting the thing was supposed to be in the post
what thing
what's happening
er th this is this is supposed to be the er the next stage of the travel agents contacting us
oh right
mm
erm and er i phoned them on thursday before our last meeting and to be told oh it's in the post we're contacting you
aha
and it hasn't turned up yet
this isn't that thing is it
whatever
oh right
it's er th
i've been hearing people UNK about that while i was UNK
there have not been good things
yeah
yeah
but
erm right okay
erm i've got a note to contact people i know in wales which again i haven't done but again i shall
erm i now have a list of all our stock which means i know where it all is and how much of it there is which is nice but not directly relevant to this meeting
erm oh has anybody got any receipts to give to me
erm sort of for tapes or whatever
i've got one but it's not here so i
right
shall forward it to you
okey doke
no rush since i can't afford to pay
er you sent a tape recorder to your dad
er
you're sending a tape recorder to your
i'm sending a tape recorder to my dad
i was delayed a little in that
basically i i've got a l a l a whole list of things that i didn't get done this week either
right
erm
yeah if you need me to buy the UNK direct then
no
by all means package it up and i'll take away
no problem
no problem
erm
i can get it done
yeah
it was just incompetence that i didn't get it done this week
right
i'm very annoyed with myself that it's got round to
okey doke
the end of the week and i was still thinking it's not done
erm i have sent a t tape recorder to my father in common law in liverpool and i need the address for him to send it on to
right
i down there is a letter to my contact in liverpool
right
erm
that's as much of the address as i know
in that envelope is a letter explaining what i would like
right
i'll phone my father in common law and get him to look up the address the er postcode in his
yeah
UNK
erm
erm right
and er that is
shall i shall i look at this or
no
no i can't because it's sealed
you're gonna just post that
yeah
erm
it generally explains to UNK what it is
yeah
i would like him to do and i've put information
okay
in there for him
right well i'll take that address down
yeah
in a moment
erm dum de dum
oh i dug out my or the company's in fact membership of p c w world erm and tomorrow i've got a note to phone them and ask them how much their UNK are for UNK
yeah
erm
mm
cos they er they're bound to be cheaper than they are in the shops
okay
can you also ask them what their servicing rate is for a keyboard
okey doke
right
mm
do that i'll listen to this tape through tonight
erm dum
that's just a note of what we just did
i also didn't ask erm about the status of UNK as a place for getting recordings from
something else i'll do tomorrow
erm when are you going to boston UNK
er it's going to be a week on wednesday now i think
wednesday week right
i phoned and got the address and name
ah
but i haven't written erm cos i wanted to check exactly what day you'd be going before i did
that's it really
erm
mm
they're fairly UNK notes but never mind
this time i'll try and make up minutes and get them out cos it helps i think
erm right well that's basically my input except erm wednesday daytime what are you doing
er i don't have to be doing anything other than er working for
right okay
erm
erm explanation
erm a company called
yes
how's that spelt
erm i've already contacted them
they've said i can record a s an UNK seminar that's on wednesday
right
erm but if it's during the day i'm not going to be able to get there
unfortunately nowhere in any of their literature does it actually say what time of day the seminar is
okay
erm it's in leeds erm and they know that i'm going but i may need to call them and say that i'm sending somebody else because i can't possibly go anywhere during the day on wednesday
o
cos i've let myself in for a day of UNK
i can go no problem
right
well i'll tomorrow morning phone them up find out exactly what time and register you rather than me if it's you know if i can't get to it
okay
erm
and the call you p d q
okay we need erm i need an address and er it would be nice to know what the UNK about
it's about some kind of database structure thing
it's a selling thing
erm it's actually being done by a company called er for or with and i gather they're trying to sell a database package
right
erm the address and everything else they're supposed to be sending
i hope they do because otherwise no none of us is going to be able to get there
erm it's at some venue in leeds
they're actually based in london
right
erm but i'm gonna talk to them tomorrow and sort of UNK the arrangements for that
mhm
if it's in the evening i can go
if it's in the daytime i'm going to have to send you
should be about three hours of recording to be got from them
okay
erm which would be very nice indeed
erm it's something we haven't got any kind of you know we haven't got represented yet
okay
erm does anybody have on any of their various computers a large map of england
no
no but i've got an UNK
well i want to have a big picture of england on the wall on which i can start to tick off bits as we get them
would a black and white photocopy of a map
i haven't the UNK idea cos i don't know how it would come out
i imagine it
come out quite well
yeah
depends which map it is
oh my goodness
a man of many maps yeah
useful having them around
unfortunately i usually use road UNK for maps of britain
now that's a british map but it's in two bits
maps of france the states
other places
it's not really desperately important cos i can do it by using a list rather than a map but it's just somehow easier to refer to
britain
a map on the wall
that's going to be too complicated to photocopy really
i just want erm you know an outline
never mind it's not a problem
there's an outline in the stuff they sent you
yeah couldn't you blow that up
yes i probably could it's rather UNK
the s u has a
that's our best other one
poster machine
right
if you actually want to use this
er actually it's too mm
it's too UNK to you know i'd be wanting to write on it so
well
erm
okay er
bit too UNK
i'll see if i've got a map around or can get a really cheap map and just put it up
i'm probably best doing a blow up of the map they sent
yes
doesn't have major towns
that's it i'll get a get a cheap tourist map of britain
mm
and get the s u poster machine
mm
it's only about a pound fifty isn't it
it really wants to be one without the roads marked
mm
this is the this thing
well
i just want one with erm spot for towns
areas
and s so i can draw on the areas
we well we can doc we can doctor the poster i can get the poster in here UNK those and get the towns marked on that you want
erm i have a map UNK
true
it's got the major cities on it
how UNK that
well it's not very big but you could blow it up
but it could be made into a poster
true fact
put whatever on it that you want
well it's not an immediate problem it just occurred to it'd be nice to have you know i've i'm writing a list of the recordings as they come in and where they've come from
right
but it'd be nice to have some sort of UNK representation of it'd just be easier to see which areas we've got to cover
erm okey doke
how's your week gone tell me all about it
were incompetent erm the people who were supposed to bring up the recording thing at the station meeting didn't
right
and i only found this out when i went in and talked to the station manager and he looked very confused
uh huh
even more so than he had done the previous time i said didn't you hear this about this at the station meeting and he said it hadn't been brought up
huh
so i explained to him and he was very nice er but one of the things that they'd said that they would do is get all the news UNK er to sign consent forms
uh hm
when they did their UNK
and they didn't
right
so i've got to chase all of them up and most of them are going to have gone home for easter
yeah
however er i can i have all their names i know how to contact them
yeah
and i can get round to doing that this week i started trying on friday but most of them were of course hitting the road
yeah
erm so i'm making some progress there
also he recommended somebody else's programs cos there's somebody who comes in and does their talking about political things
uh huh
for a couple of hours each week
right
erm and another idea that i had the conference office there i was getting a little down about al all the students knock at the door excuse me
erm to continue with this train of thought
yes the conference office
erm we realized that with the students going for easter there would be a lack of seminars
yeah
and general meetings and speeches on campus but remembered of course it's conference season
yes
so with it being conference time we can get lots of companies who are turning up and giving conference presentations lots of academic types
er there will be educational and business seminars of various sorts going on
mm
and i can approach the conference office to find out what's here and i can then go after each of the different categories we're looking for or each of the conferences
mm
go after all the various speakers
yeah
because they are going to be from all over the country
how many conferences are there generally
er during easter there are probably about five big ones on
right
th they aim at one big conference per week or slightly more
right
mm
and
so just go for each one then
yes
yeah
if there's you know the UNK that small
the other thing er is that all those UNK are going to be packed full of business men
yes that's true
from various parts of the country
exactly
yes
er and that was my UNK of the week basically
yes that's a very good idea
so i'm not only going to be asking the conference office about what's there but i'm going to be going and asking individuals even if we can't record your UNK speech here will you be able to record us interviews will you be able to record us whatever else
yes
yes that would be very good
erm would it be an idea perhaps to put something up on notice boards that the conference people are going to see
mm
mm yes
you know a sort of a er a fairly low content high impact thing
you know one
just to put it in mind
one side on the 's headed paper
are there conference notice boards
there generally are
yes
yes
yeah
right
i have to track them down cos they put them in UNK places sometimes but there are conference notice boards
yes
the one is in the corridor that goes from the UNK lodge to the stairs up to
yes
mhm
yes i know that one
and there's the one is out just UNK out from the UNK lodge
right
yes so i'll put together erm a erm something on UNK that we can put up on
yeah
the conference notice boards
if i can find whoever the senior organizer is for each conference or whoever is doing the introductory talk
yeah
and UNK them at the start of the conference
mm
then they can if they add a two minute UNK on the end of their introductory UNK thing saying we have somebody here doing UNK research if any of your companies can help them
mm
mm
then we'll be able to get people that way
yeah save us an awful lot of letter writing
mm
which would be excellent
erm i went i was telling david about this in the car i went down to nottingham to and recorded i've got an hour of recording from erm an organisation meeting
mm
in nottingham
erm at which meeting i also contacted or attacked four other people one a solicitor erm one running a sort of a training centre and two running businesses one in sort of sales and marketing and one in production
all of whom have taken away bumf and seem interested and in about a week i'm going to follow it up by writing to them
right
erm
that i mean if they all came up UNK that's nottinghamshire covered basically
right
erm which is excellent
erm and at the very worst i've got you know an hour of recording from their meeting and their going to let me record the next meeting they have as well
er UNK have difference different er UNK
if we positive results from the conferences at easter erm during the summer there are a lot of conferences of various sizes and a lot of professional conferences
yeah
yeah
mhm
which opens up other areas cover
oh the charity always have their conference in york
er
the general UNK
the general UNK
i'm not i'm not certain that the charity are having one here this year
really
the UNK
i heard
the UNK has been here about three years running hasn't it
yeah oh long before that
i heard mention that there isn't a charity conference this year
er not that it won't be in york but that
mm
i could get the conference timetable for which conferences are booked for the summer at the moment
yes
it might not be complete but it'll certainly give us some of them
it'll give us some clues
because writing ahead to any pe any to the UNK would possibly be a useful thing to do give them a lot of warning
oh yeah
right
that's something the
yeah
conference office about
yeah
erm how have things been going with getting lectures
er most of
UNK over
yeah that's the thing
yeah
cos i got the two science lectures and thought i'll try and get a couple of arts lectures
mm
a couple of social science lectures
all the arts and social sciences people had stopped UNK
yeah
oh no we don't do any UNK week nine or week eight
we only do one every week seven and one every week five you know
that's right
so
so we've got about a five week break now before we pick up again
i have got dave all sorted out
right
he i'm UNK he says to UNK him contact him at the start of week zero because he's UNK he he's trying to remember of his own accord but er ju this is just to give him a kick along in case he's forgotten
uh hm
or hasn't got it organised
he's going to record seminars that he is doing and also seminars other people are doing in the department
right
erm and that's the stuff we'll be getting
right
good
we should be able to get er at least three hours seminars out of there
that that's about the right amount
oh
we could we could get lots more
yeah
but i you said three hours or so
we yeah we don't want to push any one area er really too much
no
i mean we can always go back to places like the UNK department or any department on campus we can always go back to and get more recordings later
which is probably better than getting them all at the same time
mm
erm
remember each person in our catchment area should be on tape for one tenth of a second
that's right
erm the law college have expressed an interest and i'm UNK for them this week so i'll chase them
right
can the law college also give you any useful contacts about solicitors
i asked and they were non committal but erm i'll do some chasing
they're very friendly and open people
erm in fact incredibly so erm very nice place to work actually erm so i'll do a bit of friendly chasing
i'm that's why i can't go out during the day on wednesday
yeah
cos i'm UNK there
it just occurred to me that tuesday would be another opportunity to talk to UNK the guy who comes in and does the s u legal aid stuff
yes
yes that would be a very
erm what's the other thing yeah the place that i've just picked up erm a part time job has said i can record as much as i want there
they often have people in doing talks so later on this or early next month i'll be able to get a couple of hours talks
erm shit that reminds me i've got to write a letter
to somebody at the company who's coming to do a talk there
ooh
erm so that's not immediately but in the first two or three weeks of next month going to turn into several hours of recording
yeah
erm and my mother's going to record her theory lessons
in nottingham
UNK i think by the way i've pretty much got all the areas wrapped up in scotland if we can just get going and we can get
right
there may be problems on amount of material from certain things
but i i've got contacts which can get us academic recordings
yeah
i've contacts who can do business stuff consultations after dinner speeches if we're lucky
right
club meetings no problem lots of things
great
i've written to UNK school UNK erm sue 's school where she's currently doing her teacher training
yes er
erm and she's going to mention it to her headmaster as well
hopefully they'll let us record lessons
it occurred
annual staff meetings there and scarborough college i've written to and they they're sounding positive
erm i've got a friend doing teacher training there
be good
i approached company and erm am waiting to hear their reply
right
erm which i will chase up tomorrow morning
uh hm
and see if can get hold of a meeting there
i'm fairly positive about it but
good
i gather you're self employed or going to become so
no
no that's not happening
going to work
oh god that's a pain
it is it's a bit of a pain
derek was all sort of ah about it
it would be lovely if it would happen
yeah
but the time UNK the problem
right
because they say it would be about two months
so i i'm not holding out a lot of hope for it
yeah
at the moment
mind you i mean even four months cos you'd be getting more money
that's right
that's worth doing
yes yeah
i would do it if i'm offered the opportunity
yes
it's whether the opportunity arises
yeah
the other thing i have done is setting down there is various amounts of stuff to go off to my father
right
to have sales demonstrations presentations
uh huh
recorded in glasgow
and erm i'm waiting to contact a friend of mine who works in the library in manchester
right
he'll have library and library meetings
yes very good
recorded in manchester
and i have also remembered that i know a deputy headmaster in a school in wales
excellent
who i can hopefully
yeah
get recordings of welsh school meetings and classroom interaction
right
from
that will be very good
i've just remembered UNK something's just UNK in my mind i rang my mother today and she was busy cos she was taking a confirmation class
she's a UNK at church
oh yes
the catholic church it just never occurred to me before
religious meetings
every sunday every sunday until easter
super
erm get on the phone
UNK
i'm about to get on the phone as well
right
to see if UNK doing one of his tours of the place tomorrow and what time
right
because if he is that we can get that as an educational presentation
yes er yeah or a or a dis or whatever
we a we already asked him about that actually
we we've already asked him he said yes
he said yes he's do it but when
yeah
he said he he'd do it
that's what i he did agree to it when i mentioned it to him but i just ha i want to check if he's doing one tomorrow cos if he's doing one tomorrow it might be tomorrow morning so i'll have to
yes
catch him at the right time
okay
i'll phone him now
okey doke
okay
erm
i've still drawn a blank as far as recording is concerned but i will be to my father
i've asked for about three hours my contact in liverpool
right
and mostly
yeah
and erm numerous
erm i'm still suffering a little at the moment from a shortage of tape UNK so if any more are available
right i have
i can put them to use
one more now as long as they do go out because erm oh i've got one that will be coming back from the careers service soon erm he's supposed to be ringing tomorrow morning
right
erm he's had it for about a week and a half now
mm
and he should have UNK three or four hours of interviews and meeting
mm
i'm aiming towards sending off a return on monday week
with as much UNK volume in it as possible
right
i don't want to send any this is sort of from erm almost from my ego talking now i don't want to send anything until i've had back from company group their comments on my
yes
initial UNK
cos i just don't want to send stuff back knowing that there are things wrong
mm
with the way i view the transcription system at the moment
but if we haven't heard anything back by monday week i'm going to send whatever we've got
okay
erm which won't be a vast amount you know i was expecting a slow start and we've had a fairly slow start but you know i'm not worried by that at all
erm but yeah monday week is sort of the deadline for getting returned
okay
and i should have i hope three or four maybe five tapes to send off then which would be very indeed
erm
UNK out he's phoning me when he gets back
right okay
if company come through this week then it could be considerably more cos i can get interviews sales demonstrations and
great
yeah
i think we i'm assuming that as long as we don't get more than say three hours of one type of recording from each place we can get as much apart from that constraint
mm
can get as much as we like from each place
that
so three hours or so of lecture three hours or so of seminar and
well that means each company we can take for twelve hours because there are basically four business related classes
yeah
er assuming we don't
most companies don't have all of them
erm
company talks business meetings
very
sales demonstrations and interviews
yeah
very few companies have talks to the company
er or done by the company erm sales UNK again we're limited
meetings all companies have them in some way one human being companies
erm what was the other one
interviews
interviews
most companies erm
although not necessarily in the current economic climate
yes
although the news on that looks like it could be improving too
yes
oh i'll believe that when i see it
the other advantages i can think of at the moment for erm getting company to say yes it the obvious connections to company
yes
and the fact that the person whom i UNK i have approached about the project is erm does travel have meetings so which we can record
yeah
right
anything else
any other sort of UNK type things or plan type things
no i think i was restricted to the one UNK this week
that's okay one a week is fine
erm i wanted to ask erm i ga i assume that everyone has read through the bumf that i've been UNK distributing
yeah
yes
erm how d how do you think that bumf comes across
erm i've had one comment from the people in nottingham that er we need to have a clearer idea of exactly what we want from people and then let them go away and read more detailed bumf in more detail
i thought i had that in my introductory letter the one that says we're a small company making recordings we're currently collecting recordings of erm sort of english as used in everyday situations and we would like to record on your premises if we may
i thought that covered it but it may not do
a lot of people i've spoken to have said well what sort of things do you want
yeah
it it's all
what do you mean the english language
hm
oh dear
yes the first questions er
something in german
it is a fairly academic phrase really
mm
well how about we prepare something the sort of thing that i can photocopy ad UNK and give round er conference guests who turn up for example which says you know something like please help we are doing UNK research we want to make recordings
mm
if you are involved in any of the following list all your situations
mm
er and would be willing to have those recorded for research purposes erm
yeah
please
the trouble with a list is that it erm limits people
people assume that if something's not on the list then it's not important or not necessary
mm
erm i'd prefer to give a definition rather than a list so something like any situation where you find yourself talking to people
you know i mean that's basically what we want it's any situation where people talk to each other with some kind of agenda in mind
yeah
yes
erm okay
mm
but if you can think of some way to say that and put it down so that we put down something like four sentences on paper and a few examples
what does the erm where's it gone the er UNK erm help
the consent form
yes
i've got it here haven't i
right
there we go what does this actually say
erm we're asking a large cross section of people and organisations around the country to help by allowing us to record their conversations meetings UNK and so on both in private homes and on company premises
erm
okay in that case what
i mean that's UNK that's already too detailed
mm
really isn't it
well first of all w we've got t if you take out er a large cross section if you just say we're asking people and organisations around the country to help us by allowing us to record meetings UNK er
allowing us to record any situation
interviews and so on and then bracket you know any situation where people meet er and
other way round any situation where people talk to each other for instance
er
i think
i'd rather put the definition first and have it develop
yeah
okay
yeah
and then bracket a list
if anyone comes up with extra ideas that we or haven't covered
yes
then they won't feel
yeah
and er if you are interested in helping us please er contact this
please
please contact us at this number this address erm or attract the attention of the person who has just given you this UNK
right
i think a very erm and sort of thought UNK eye catching statement would be very useful
yeah
because even if you have sat down and spoken to somebody about the project for five minutes and given them all the other information
mhm
if they've got that piece of paper on top of they remember what it was all about
yes
and i think
yeah
yeah
okay
couple of sentences is help we w we want help recording these things can you help us
right okay well i'll put something together
mm
erm yeah
cos if i've got that to throw around conference guests i think i'll get a massive UNK
mm
if it's
i'll try and rewrite my erm this is something that is not a problem every time i write a letter it or write my introductory letter it comes out different so i'll try and UNK my introductory letter as well i think we'll get a bigger UNK
mm
if people are more aware right from the outset of what we actually want from them
yeah
erm
i don't i don't think that the er four thing bumf thing that includes that long list really need to be altered any more
no
that seems fine
i mean that's available for people who want more detail about what's going on
mm
but i think you should say a clear and simple statement of what our what we need for the company or person approached is
yes
yes
okay right
that is a thing to do and i will do it
damn it
i think you ought to put the er the word tape into your
ah
sound recordings audio
yeah
cos all we want is the words
i thought i used the word audio somewhere actually
er
it would still be more obvious
not on this
yeah okay then
erm
yeah
can you make the
UNK would be very difficult if it's if it was a video recording
it would really wouldn't it
they UNK they presumably think we're very high tech and we can do this
oh the sort of thing where you where the faces all have UNK bits on them
yeah
can you make the very brief leaflet the one we've just talked about
yes
a couple of sentences something which will fit on a piece of paper that size because if you can we can have that on one bit and the well to one side or the other we can have the information that we want and we can photo then photocopy those two things next to each other
mm
and double it up on a four
so we can get we can get something with project so that there's a name people will
mm
mm
er and
a statement of what we want
and then the thing in small print so we because if we do it on the company 's headed UNK all we'll manage ah per photocopy is one sheet
yes
and your print i assume your printer doesn't do huge print does it
it does actually
it does
th
yeah fairly big print
okay because
or i can i mean i intend to laser print
mm
things at UNK work next time i can get out there
you see if we photo reduce this all those addresses just get lost
yeah
one thing one thing we could do is erm reduce or not photo reduce but just cut out the middle of a sheet of the headed UNK then you get two ha er two a five things but that way round
mm
rather than that way round
right
er so
okay
landscape rather than portrait
so long as we get something
but i'd rather use the headed UNK than that
okay
we'll get better copies off the headed paper than off the shiny
mm
and
anything which says project on it
shiny
but yeah
er
but i'd like it to have the company address so that people can follow u can follow up our references without us having to give them the address
mm
without them having to ask us for the address
mm that's reasonable okay
mm
erm yeah i l i like people to be able to independently check up on us because that gives us so much more validity
mm
yeah
er if but if you want to do something like that to organise something because if it goes on a five
yeah
and that means that i can photocopy them for half the price
yeah
of course
and if i'm going to be UNK thousands of people in conferences or at least hundreds
mm
going to make a difference
yeah
mhm
a any photocopying that needs to be done in great bulk erm get quotes and let the company pay for it rather than you paying for it and then pay you back because i might be able to for instance get an account thingy somewhere
yeah
and get a further discount
yeah
okay
erm i mean as it is i can get photocopying for four p a sheet getting fifty at a time and that give i get a receipt for that which is better than three p a sheet without a receipt
yes
mm
in terms of tax back
agreed
erm actually it's about the same but it looks better in my accounts
in that case it's probably best if you handle the photocopying as well because i can't
right
get anything better than five pence with receipt
yes okay
erm yeah
is conference season already under way then
conference season will begin on monday
right
there may be a s there may have been some guests turn up
monday tomorrow or monday week
monday tomorrow
yes mo monday tomorrow but that won't that'll be one conference and i i'll be able to well maybe two conferences by the end of the week
but i'll find out from the conference office who's around
right
at the very least i can find the UNK speaker at each one and chase him
okay
okay
erm yeah
yeah i mean just getting the UNK speech from each one would be nice wouldn't it
mhm
erm yeah that's good
okay any other business
UNK
how about a statement of what we intend to do this week
right okay
so that you know what we're off to do
yeah
erm well the things i have to do are basically all the things listed on here still
ha
erm that i went through at the beginning you know which is basically write to lots of people
okay
phone some other people
erm
how quickly will you be able to prepare the erm bumf for the conferences
UNK
and something to go along with our information people we speak to
by UNK er
erm yeah UNK basically UNK busy and i'm UNK the next two days but i'm free in the evenings
mhm
right
unless this company seminar is in fact on wednesday evening in which case i'm also busy this wednesday evening
let me know about that whenever you can
yeah
i'd actually prefer to send you to that than go to it myself because i think that would be a better use of time
yeah that seems reasonable
erm
erm
but i'll have to find out from them it may be that they don't want me to send anybody else to it because i made the initial contact with them
erm
erm okay
but i will you know
so i've got to contact conference office continue chasing up these people about various student things that we have we now tapes of we just have to get the consent forms for
yeah
er and look into local m p's and their speaking agendas council elections round york and see if any of the student events this summer have speakers
right
i'm doing company and i'm contacting UNK on tuesday
and i'm sending all this lot off that didn't get sent off and contacting i'm being contacted about the place
yeah okay
erm
i will chase company this week and see what can be done about er sending that package off to my father recordings will come out of that
mhm
and i will be contacted by UNK
yeah
so side b
more information about
yeah
and i will start looking at organising some recordings in wales because i know that's one area where i can get some stuff done
yeah
business erm church meetings religious meetings and schools
so i will get on to that
right
okay
erm you're going to talk to your mum
i'll talk to my mum
yeah
good
and you're going to
are you going to try and check about er whether you are
yes
going to be able to
well i intend to do
where are you going to be doing that
i'll have to ask
i don't know i've never needed
never tried
to get one yes
erm how about well erm the council offices are on the little square at the bottom of UNK
UNK
yeah
UNK street
you know in there
yeah
er when do you want to go
because if i'm going to check out the council elections and things we may as well go together and do our business there and UNK all the people at the council all at once
aha
er you're going to be busy tomorrow because it's the first day of the conference isn't it
yes
i'm going to be busy tomorrow
erm how about i
and thursday probably
how about i contact you tomorrow evening
okay
after you get back from work
you get back from work about UNK
UNK
half past ten
okay i'll contact
right
i will attempt to use that there tape ta da erm to note the minutes and get those back out
erm i'll attempt to do that tonight but i don't hold out much hope so don't hold your breath
erm other than that i'm going to write to
and do the other things that you
among the four thousand other things that i
yeah
also said i was going to do
erm all this and have a life as well
excellent
is there any of the above that you would like to allocate to me for example
i'm willing to take on more
if there's anything you
erm i'll have to think about it actually
yeah
okay
erm most of the writing letters and things are follow ups so i need to do those myself cos i did the UNK
yeah
erm
we're just going to write to local councils UNK and see what comes up
need to do that now
mm
and i will contact
any tapes that anybody can get to me this week would be very good because i was saying er a few minutes ago erm i'm intending to send whatever we've got done tomorrow week
i will get something at one of the conferences
i don't know how much but i'll get something
yeah
and i will er plead for high a fast UNK time from the scottish stuff
mhm
right
that would be very good
erm
mm
mhm
feel free to take any of the
that's right your tape machine came out of one of those boxes
that's right
this is the one that's going up to scotland
that UNK be going to
that's the one that's going down south
have one of those and have one of those
great
and
the box may be under the table
oh
the UNK or have you got the UNK already
you've got everything to do you've got the UNK haven't you
i've got the machine
you've got the machine just got the packaging
aha
it's just that i'm going to send
erm right
i'm going to send one to erm
yes
erm do you want any of the UNK helpful packaging that came that all these came in
the UNK
actually it might be an idea
do they have small boxes as well
they came in
they came in massive great big UNK boxes packed with UNK actually
right
erm
ooh
well they i think they came by red star
ah
erm
or they came by something where somebody turned up in a little van that wasn't a post office van and i had to sign
right
can i if i can get any tapes to you this week i shall
yes
erm i think mine may be a week delayed
yeah
erm i would imagine
mhm
transcription machines
you were checking about that last time we met
yes
erm the cheapest i can get them is about two hundred pounds the UNK i can get them is forty eight hour delivery
right
erm if i want them quicker than that they cost more
why
who knows
erm
that's two hundred pounds not including the stupid little UNK you get with them because they're crap
UNK
erm i have two sets of UNK that can be used with two spare sets of UNK that can be
right
used with transcription machines
decent ones that are comfortable to wear
rather than the ones that try and pull your ears
erm
off your head
yeah
i do have a transcription machine for UNK
if anybody can record onto UNK please do
i have some UNK
ooh that reminds me
i asked my father about his UNK
there's no way of removing the erm tape
right
so
but it's generally the kind where you can record notes onto them
yeah
erm where you can get the tape out
yeah
mm
erm i've got a well mike has it but erm a transcription machine that takes UNK and also has a recording thing with it that makes absolutely excellent recordings
really totally UNK ones
erm it can hear from the other side of the of UNK living room it can hear the person on the other end of a telephone connection which is
quite impressive actually
erm so that's available as another recording machine and there's a small supply of UNK to go with it
i can get more because my father does have a UNK recorder and a stock of tapes
right
erm if they are useful i will ask him to box them up and send them
the transcription that you're going to do erm mm how
david has done some transcription this week erm and i've done a bit erm and that's basically well we've got one side of you've got one side of those lectures to do erm and i've got some of the recording that i made on thursday to do and that and that
erm so
also
yes
i know i know
want to have a look back at them
yeah
have a look back at
mm
erm
so you'll take care of the transcription
for the moment yes
erm
okay
i mean as soon as we've got enough tapes in that we can't between us UNK them in a week i buy another record er another transcription machine
right
erm
right
but i want to avoid if possible erm teaching sort of the old version of the system of UNK
yes
yes i understand yeah
if at all possible
mm
erm but this is the only area where have ever been slow in
mm
getting that to me
but
er for no apparent reason
yeah
i mean that's one reason why i'm setting monday week as the date final date for making the first return
i think i could probably send a return on tuesday erm but i'd rather wait because if i can send stuff properly done rather than you know done to the latest or the pre latest system then i will
it makes more sense
yeah
erm if you could contact me erm as soon as possible regarding the cost of either servicing or replacing
yeah
my keyboard i would like to get my system up and running erm
right
because i've got for it
what's wrong with your keyboard
erm it's tired basically
yeah
erm keys on it stick
it's fully functional but
mm
if there's some way of
mm
seriously w d forty
erm yeah actually pull all the keys off and
works
and get in there with a
stiff UNK
right
erm it works on
okay
electrical
if you could get me a quote i shall see what d i y i can do and then find out how much it's going to cost me to buy a new
yeah
one because i've UNK the last one up
right
i'll do that tomorrow as well
one thing i must ask you about just while i'm thinking about it
erm i have UNK for
yes
my amstrad at present
will you be able to provide me with a erm wordperfect package
not on the amstrad
okay
i i'm using UNK on the amstrad and it's adequate and i can then just port UNK text files across into wordperfect
right fine
erm i don't use the same disks as you
i actually use the amstrad disks
that's okay i've got both drives
i can convert
so it's perfectly fine for me to UNK on
oh yeah
this amstrad
yeah
in UNK and you can
you can use erm er cut and UNK you know blocks and
yeah
erm phrases for in fact quite adequately to speed up the transcription
mm
erm
mm
it's not as nice as the UNK on wordperfect but it's adequate
mm
erm
erm
erm i had a problem with the amstrad keyboard
it's so tight
this big
it's so UNK
it's got as many keys on it as an i b m erm
mm
erm you know enhanced keyboard and it's this big
perhaps because i don't touch type i did have a problem
yeah
it's relatively simple
you just count five buttons to the left after the nine
yeah
that would be the four
five buttons to the left
i knew what she meant
the other left
yeah
this left
i mean she di did demonstrate which left she meant
yes
five
yeah
buttons to the left
yeah
it makes perfect sense
using my right hand
i mean
yeah
what do you expect
okay
i mean that's my left
over there
mm
anyway
yeah
okay
right fine
that that's the er
it's an eight two five six
yeah
yeah
no problem
erm right well i think that's about it
erm
no that's all the business i had
right
i want to push off erm because i've got a lot of work to do tonight
so i'll
on a on a serious note if there is anything you want to delegate you know where to find me shout
yeah
i will
yes i certainly will
erm that's it
yeah
hit it
birmingham UNK offer all their facilities absolutely free of charge to us so get yourself down in the entertainment bar in aston
er make full use of all their fields as well as their indoor UNK leisure centre swimming pool etcetera
birmingham university don't let us use their stuff free of charge
er it's thirty six pound a year to be a member there but if you are a keen UNK their facilities are well worth using because it's a very good sports centre indeed
aston university haven't got an awful lot of good stuff in the way of indoor facilities
they've got a good seven a side UNK pitch which we can hire fairly cheaply
but er i wouldn't recommend that too highly
sporting teams you all look a sporting bunch to me specially that UNK chap there in the middle er i've got contacts with not only all the local football rugby cricket clubs etcetera but also the teams that sort of how do i put this represent people in er the city on a good sporting level i e UNK rugby club aston villa football club so whatever your standard is in any sport come and see me and i shall sort out exactly what you want
of course the college has its own teams as well
er football rugby UNK are popular ones
er any team that you do want to join there is also a team available
if you actually want to set up the society yourself find ten little friends come along ten people giving the number you need to form a society one pound each for membership i shall give you all the er relevant data and you can start up your side in whatever it be as long as it doesn't UNK union policy on UNK racism etcetera
and i'm sure you wouldn't
er that's briefly enough on sport i'm gonna move on to entertainment facilities now
the bar the guild bar downstairs currently not open at the moment i grant you but hopefully with a bit of luck tonight is the grand opening tonight
and what a wonderful place what more can be said about the bar
free with your guild card which you will carry with you everywhere i know cheap beer brilliant atmosphere incredibly good UNK
erm we're always looking for people to come along and have a go so if you wanna put your name down you can have a saturday night and spin those wheels
excellent atmosphere friendly UNK
he's alright your friend there
he's just a bit UNK he's a bit UNK at times excellent UNK er i'm usually down there s UNK the diet coke or some such UNK thing like that
er and you will definitely get to know lots of people down there and it's a good focal point for the guild
i must point out about isn't just the guild a lot of people think it is but it is a good focal point to find out what's going on and meet people
er on a slightly bigger scale entertainment again as we're only a small college we do tend to liaise with the bigger education establishment in the city i e birmingham university central england university UNK birmingham UNK and aston university
they have fairly regularly UNK what you might call bigger bands who play the university circuit as such and they're always you know dying for people to come along so there'll th there'll be lists published at what time what events are on at these places if you wanna go and do that and if you wanna go to the top UNK bands UNK a good venue for that with the leisure centre the m i a the n e c the k g b etcetera all that stuff there so there's always plenty to do don't feel restricted just cos we're in er the middle of the city centre in this college and there doesn't seem a lot to do there's a lot going on
a free legal service is offered by the guild
it's a firm of city centre solicitors they're very good indeed er i recommend it thoroughly
it er doesn't have to be a problem related to college any problem you've got er come and see me it's as well to take advantage of it cos those of you who have been involved in legal UNK before will it's quite an expensive business so
i mean you'll have to come and see me about that because it's fairly confidential so but they are very good
er what else can i go on about
representation
now there's a long word for you
erm my job i i'm employed by the union of students which you have all paid your subscription to so therefore in effect you're all my bosses
i'm here to represent you basically as your voice with any problem you have as i mentioned at the beginning
a problem is a lecture a lecturer other students anything of the college er i'm the person who takes your voice
now you're welcome to register a complaint yourself but i i'm a representative on the board of governors the academic board committee etcetera so i can get these points right up where they belong
i can also if i erm come across the same problem a few times i could hopefully work on that and then probably UNK altogether
so do come and see me if it's a problem you've got that you think needs sorting out
er again on the national level if you think there's a campaign you wanna be involved in or wanna get started i'll put that on to the area n u s who will if it's a UNK case will put it forward to the national executive
but i'm really the person to come and see and i liaise with all these bodies as such
the annual general meeting our a g m is next week where we elect all the officers the guild officers who will serve with me and help me on the forthcoming year
there are eight positions up for UNK which are vice president sports officer UNK officer publicity officer welfare officer women's officer and UNK and overseas officer
if you're interested in standing for any of those or wanna put someone forward to stand for one of those come to the elections in room six two three six two four friday the twenty sixth at two fifteen twenty third i'm sorry at two fifteen and er not only will you get all the general UNK about what i've done so far this year what i intend to do what next year's UNK going to be etcetera that's when those elections are actually held
so do come along to that
i'll leave it at the moment i know you've now got a very busy day ahead of you lectures to attend and such things like that but er has anybody got a question or two they'd like to ask me concerning anything
don't all rush at once
this man here
what's your question sir
do the guild offer a typing services
not free of charge
there are though numerous students on certain of the third year and degree courses who are trying to
earn a little extra income shall i put it and far from the majority of traditional methods they are to do it legally and set up little UNK agencies etcetera and if you keep your eye on the notice boards you'll see various
for instance you know contact carol h n d three f er for typing UNK they're not free th they're dirt cheap about twenty p a page for a four
that's quite a bargain
why don't you like typing
no
rugby
no
where can you play rugby
i shall get in touch with UNK rugby club for you
thank you
it's taken me long enough god knows but
i'll get in touch with them for oh dear i'll get in touch with them for you
round the corner no doubt i'm sure
indeed
any other questions ladies and gentlemen
okey UNK
a boring society
we haven't got one of those
no i'm only joking
erm thank you very indeed for your time boys girls ladies and gentleman
er i shall let you get on to your lectures or what other UNK you have and no doubt see you around
any problem you've got do come and see me
thank you very much indeed
right then
leading on from last week we were looking at menu planning and i actually asked you to bring in some menus
who actually managed to get a menu
yep
yeah
right let's have a look
well that's a shame innit
what
somewhere
it's only you
you might want to use those a little later
yeah
right hold on to them cos you'll want them a little later right
right
can anyone tell me what the four most common ones are
yep
yep
yep
er UNK du UNK
right
okay then
what do each of those mean
suzanne
erm the table UNK
shh
shh
shh
shh
is er a choice out of the main course is a choice out of two and everything else is set
or is it a choice of two for each course
your telling me
it's a choice out of two for each one
right
erm the er UNK du UNK is a set menu
yes it is can you expand on that
er
no
set price menu
yes the price would probably be set
so i gave you two examples and i said that it was often
UNK du UNK
yes
good
well done
and
set budget
it was set which to er and it looked different
it usually the UNK
okay
erm UNK
the other two are
she's covered UNK du UNK and table UNK
a la UNK 's er wide choice of choice of food
has to wait for food to be cooked and prepare to wait for it
okay
did anyone get er an example of an a la UNK
yeah
right
okay
hold on to those
i want you share those with the group shortly
and the other one is please
okay
and what UNK that
what am i gonna get for my money for that
erm
continental
it is continental
what do i actually get
what is the way
oh accommodation
accommodation right
can you just check that we took down the following
i think that we actually just had time to talk through these and you didn't actually make notes
we did
yeah we did
you've actually taken notes
yeah
and you did that
yeah
right
wonderful
i was just a little curious and she seemed to be er
UNK to
and you actually took that down
yeah
yeah
right
wonderful
okay then
continuing with the menu and when planning a menu the points to be taken into consideration are david
david
okay
what things do you think you need to consider then when you're putting together a menu
they like a lot of food that's popular
popular food
mm
good
choice
appearance and choice
UNK
baked potato
alright
just one at a time
UNK
no time
go good balance
who said balance
me
okay
balance in what way
well i mean well that's it you know selection of everything like the UNK foods
is that balance or variety
plenty of
variety
don't know
okay
oh
but you need a balance as well like protein and
if i put there balance
yes you're quite right
what else do you need to consider
something that's very important that you need consider
type of customer
well done
you actually need to consider this person because if you haven't got that person i e customer there's little point in having a menu unless you're going to sit and read it yourself
okay
so you need to consider that very carefully
so first things first then the people for whom the meal is intended
and it can determine certain things right
type of food to be served and type and the number of covers
why do we need to consider the type of food to be served
so people they always keep the customers that always arrive if you're in a restaurant
you never know
yes
what type of
can i have a look at those menus that some of you brought in did i cos we've got some with a la UNK did anybody get sort of erm a pub grub menu or no you all went for the top of the range
who's got the menu
i've got a UNK one
right
where's the have one
who had that copy er a la UNK
that's fine i'll give it you back i won't er i won't take it away from you
martin
who had the a la UNK
that was from
and that was a la UNK
right
you hold on to that and you and you can sort of talk it through
with that hold on to that
right
can you give us the prices of have they got prices
a la UNK
that's right
are you listening
a la UNK then
just give me a
in the erm the starters UNK in four ninety five UNK is five forty five UNK legs ten ninety five and that's the most expensive starter
right
erm yep
and then it's UNK starting at three forty five forty five and then it's on to main course
fish twelve salmon is twelve ninety five UNK sole is twenty two ninety five
okay you can stop there that's lovely thank you
right
at UNK we can have starter for one pound thirty if we want
and we can have a main for seven pound fifty UNK
can you see the range of price but also obviously pizzas and command a lower price than things on an a la UNK menu
oh right this is a fixed one
good
we'll use that in a moment
now so the type of food that you offer will reflect the type of establishment
you wouldn't really expect to get a la UNK style food in a pizza establishment
okay
what about the time where do i put the time
bearing in mind this is in relation to customers
time of day it is
yes the time of day will depend of menu that you offer but what else will it consider
time of year
time of year
food that is sort of
pardon
things that are in season
yes it will
but think of your customer
the time people go out to eat
the time people go out to eat
the time people will go out to eat
if you were going for a UNK how long do you think it would take
half an hour
depends how much you eat but assuming
alright depends how much you eat
a big UNK some UNK and a coke
about half an hour
half an hour
half an hour at the most
depends if your
right
half an hour at the most
if i went and had a meal in the evening a la UNK how would you envisage it would take to go through that
an hour and a half
about
i it virtually you're virtually going to use the evening
number of covers
depends how many people you're erm UNK actually cooked for at the time
yes
why would that reflect what you offer
cos
the time
how long it will actually be
how long the customer's actually sitting there for his meal
that's right
but also
how many
how many it's for
how many actual people in at any given time
tha that will reflect what you can actually offer
right
all important cost
the amount of money that people are prepared to pay for the meal plus the overheads and the establishment
and i think we actually got that somebody said price
mm
david a question to you
you said popular food did you not
mhm
how would you find out what is what food is popular
oh you gotta do it now
pardon
depending on the amount of people
no
so you're just going to compile a menu and you're gonna hope that joe public likes what you've put on
no you can put
right
so you sort of do a survey
you do some research into it
yeah
if you put if you compiled your menu and you then found out that certain dishes weren't being sold what would you do then
take them off
right
good
did i actually tell you last week about the feed back
yeah
yes
no
it was the other group i mentioned
what you've got you've got your customer we've got your menu feedback and you got your products
right so your customer has the menus you get some feedback and the feedback you might need to modify your product which is really what david's just said
the fact that you would need to change your menu if it wasn't being used
that's quite important that you're aware of that
season
and i think se several people did say that
use foods in season because they're cheaper
hot weather dishes not always suitable to serve in cold weather
although this summer i don't think it would of had much of an effect
yes
can i leave
yes certainly
that okay
yeah
right
i've also said that you need to consider the staff
why
what type of restaurant it is
when you're putting yo together your menu why do you need to consider the staff
they can
yes
exactly that
whether or the they've got the ability to cook what you've put on the menu
it's absolutely crucial
what else
serving
yes whether they can actually whether they've got the skills to silver serve if your menu requires that it's silver served then yes clearly you would need to consider that
what else would i need to consider david
well i think when you have the customers then you know what type of things once you've down you get type of people
if it's a high class restaurant then you prefer to people who know what they're doing
that's right
what else do i need to consider along with the staff
for the benefit of the staff also
we've looked at whether or not the staff have the skills to cook and serve what else do i need the staff to be able to do
who's worked in UNK sorry
explain all the dishes so that the customer has
that's right
yes they need to have product knowledge
who's been in kitchen
who's done production
yeah ah
right
when you actually went into the kitchen what type of things were in there
the sink
what else is in there
equipment
equipment
did you know how all of it works
did you use all of
not all of it
it
no
no
yeah
okay
that's something else that you need to be aware of
it would be no good putting together a menu that required certain equipment to be used and staff didn't have the ability to use it
and that is a summary of that
another point there size and equipment of kitchen and dining room
it would be no good putting together menu and arranging to do two thousand covers if you've got UNK for twenty persons would it
by the same token if your equipment is small pieces of equipment then you would not have the facility to do a large volume of meals
if you think of it in relationship to the size of your cooker at home and the size of the UNK in the eighth floor kitchen or in they're much larger and therefore you are more able to cook volume
it's alright
when i'm actually choosing the dishes that i'm going to put on the menu what things do we need to consider
er special UNK like UNK or
er yes we would consider that
what else wha might we consider
you can take erm of how much it's gonna cost
buy in bulk
yes
what things do i
and that's one we'd look for in se in season
but there's something else
we'll eat with our mouths but we also eat with what else
eyes
our eyes
our eyes yes
so what do we have to think of when we actually compile a menu
pardon
colour
yes we do
the colours
the colour
you need this information to do your exercise that you're going to do for me shortly
so do not repeat the main ingredients
avoid food the same colour
it actually gives you an example there
and think about the UNK of food
over here
is that better
can you see now
yes
and something that you all mentioned UNK
no
it's alright
if you were planning a menu which would you consider first do you think
UNK
protein
UNK
when you're UNK a dish then
what would you do
select chips and plan it round the chips
no
no
you'd plan it around the main course the main the main meat
meat
why meat
suzanne
because UNK the main
UNK
which would you plan first
if you're planning a dish which would you UNK the UNK the UNK
protein
protein
i say UNK first
UNK
no
all that UNK got a
pardon
all that UNK got a lot of
protein
yeah
yeah protein
protein
protein
does anyone know why protein
yes
oops
steady
why protein
erm it's the most beneficiary to the body
yes
and also you wouldn't want a piece of UNK
no that's iron
no
no to me piece of UNK
people do
yeah but then it's
yeah
i if you've ever UNK then you'll be aware that you actually reduce the UNK but you need to retain protein and UNK
because those are UNK
right
for the good order of the body
basically
and therefore when you're looking at the UNK value you need to be very aware of that
yes
so you need to be aware of too many UNK
plan your protein first UNK and minerals second and then your UNK
right when you've completed that you have a menu UNK exercise in front of you
from the items in the list below prepare to UNK menus
one menu should be a four course table UNK with two choices for each course plus vegetables
and the other should be a set six course menu for a business lunch
you can't actually repeat any of them when in your menu UNK
there is adequate there in ar order to be able to do the exercise
now based on the information that you've just taken down you need to give thought to the way in which you compile those
off you go
you can do it within twos or threes
that's not fives and sixes that's twos or threes
so david and UNK and david and i don't know your name
terry
terry
terry
right
david terry and
you'll be all up kieran you've got somebody behind you
two
two
UNK you can join up there
three
yes
group threes isn't it
group of three
this group's three
yeah
so you got to UNK you got to think of colour texture you can write all over the sheets if you want to
as long as you use the ones on the sheet and you come up with the two selection menus
yes put everything on it
make out a from both
well you've got to make that i'm going to tell you need to think about it
there isn't a list so that you will need to sort of think it through
are we not allowed to use the same things twice
that's right
oh
and so if you use the whatever what is it you wanted to use in yours
right so have a look
it's actually quite helpful isn't it to have
yeah
two or three you can have a look at what they the way in which they're put together which why i
right well you how you going to use it
well i'm not going to actually tell you because i'll UNK the solution to this
so if i start to tell you
you need to think it through
okay
so it's i it's not going to be as i
the things that you would get out
UNK
that's better
it'd be certain things you would have as starters and then
how many how many
right
do you think i about the
yes
well have you got some
oh you can't use you can't use your
no you can't use anything twice
no
can't use anything twice
i yo i mean if you use in one
well i shall be interested to see what you can get
you've found a certain paul
yeah but i mean
can we erm does it have to be all on here or can we use
sorry
can you copy that and just what's on there
can you put to it
no you can't
right
no we're not gonna take forever
can you put add things
no
copy it all down
i haven't any
there is a solution
we can't use the same things twice
no you can't use the same thing twice
you can't use the same thing twice and coffee doesn't count as a course
just put it you you'll need to get that so what's the problem
well then it'll be a course on it's own
impossible
you've gotta get haven't you
you've got to think about it
cheese and biscuits
cheese and biscuits can be a course
could we have er
can you
you tell me
yeah
and don't forget you're thinking of colour texture
so you've got set menu and you've got table UNK menu
right
well that's got a starter and it's
how you doing
just the starter now cos she's
let's see
what's it called
erm
pardon
please worry about listing them
right
than one two three four five six
take a look at those
well your table UNK
that's not the choice is it
it actually says to you two choices for each course
read the instructions
yes colin
you had a six on table UNK you've got give me three choices
as you long as
yes you can
do you have to use all the vegetables
i think you'll probably be able to
yes
bearing in mind you're looking for colour and
it's possible to use all the items
keep in mind one quarter
you got it
i'm glad there's
right
did you all manage to complete it
yeah
right
i want you to bring it in it's completed state to next week's lesson please
so whoever you're working with shh
shh
shh
whoever you're working with you need as a pair or a three some to bring the solution with you next week please
also shh
shh
shh
shh
also you will need to bring menus with you next week for comparison
right
if there's anyone in your group that suddenly UNK they need to see sally for their assignments
not in any way in competition with ni with er UNK creed or anything else
it's a quite different er animal
it's er the UNK creed ha has erm er is erm out of a different background and that er compiled in a different context altogether it's UNK law so often this is UNK
these are we are saying here things that we rejoice to say and which we give glory to god
it just has that particular UNK that particular emphasis
so i would prefer to let you be the judge of it as it stands today
any discussion if we enter into any discussion we start UNK with it and er we don't know where we'd end
i leave it as it stands
may i ask the clerk to kindly read the addendum since we don't have it in print
it is in the erm statement of faith to substitute for the phrase by his death on the cross the words he died on the cross for the sins of the world
those who vote for that addendum would you please stand
those who vote for
would you please sit
thank you
those who vote against would you please stand
i declare it has been carried against
any other contributions on deliverance number four
ian number three two six
a brief amendment moderator er to the deliverance not to the text of the statement
i have sympathy for the view of the convenor that it has been er revised er enough
er it reads er to add to an addendum to section four further instruct the panel when addressing concern for a modern confession of faith to give consideration to the difficulties involved in common confession of faith today
er i think the panel have er UNK completed a difficult task in drawing together the statement of faith they have presented
er i'm impressed that they are willing to er potentially consider a further difficult task in drawing up a confession of faith
er perhaps we have not up until this point considered just how difficult that task is
i think there are aspects of the world in which we live and er in which the church lives which make common confession of faith particularly difficult er today
we tend to UNK er generally of faith very much in personal terms we see it as personal faith
er we think of the mission of the church very largely in terms of personal UNK
er i think in an age of such UNK er the whole UNK nature and possibility of common confession of faith becomes difficult er and i'd simply ask that if it's going to go ahead and consider possibly a confession of faith that the panel er might give consideration to the difficulties gen generally involved in er the question of common confession of faith today
i move the amendment
he now UNK me that he's willing to accept that addendum
is it the will of the assembly to accept that addendum
thank you
d dr
number sixty g f
moderator this is a new er for a new five
haven't approved of number four yet
oh i'm sorry
we've still to we've still to come to
i'm sorry
the gap between four and five
thank you
any more UNK and are you making an amendment or an addendum
i just want to make a very brief comment first of all
yes certainly
thank you
number eleven the name is margaret
i should like to congratulate the panel on doctrine on the very difficult job they did in handling all these responses from kirk session
our kirk session was one which objected very UNK to the use seven times of the male pronoun in the section on the holy spirit
i think what they have done reads beautifully as english is very profound UNK and it uses language that is not UNK specific
i congratulate them on that and hope that in the future they will carry on that practice
thank you
now i'm going to come now i think it will be the mind of the assembly to take the vote on for deliverance number four and mr 's counter motion
and as i've indicated i'm now going to ask the convenor to sum up
you have the right of reply to mr 's counter motion
well mr took a terrific UNK at us and i think i couldn't possibly enter into the detail of controversy involved there
i th stick to my former line i think that we've all had a look at this er we i believe it's a useful UNK instrument and i rest my case
thank you
now could we just hear mr 's counter motion again please mr
then i'll call a vote for the deliverance or against the counter motion
moderator the counter motion is in section four as it stands to stop in the second line after the word commentary
delete all the words after commentary
thank you
now we have the deliverance number four before us in print as the motion
could i ask those who wish to vote for the motion deliverance number four as in print on page one eight five to stand please
thank you
those wishing to vote now for the counter motion in the name of mr to please stand
thank you
i declare that the motion has been carried that is the deliverance as in print number four on page one eight five
now we've quite a we have first of all in the light green papers notice of motion from mr UNK of moving a new five
i've also heard dr wishing to move a new five dr i think yours will be five b and i call first of all on mr
moderator
mr six four eight
this brilliant piece of UNK which i have in my hand here in addition to many other valuable UNK contains three alternative definitions of faith two gentle UNK at professor and one definitive statement of when the third UNK begins
however i am not so UNK of the sound of my own voice that bearing in mind what er dr has said about the amount of business i would insist on UNK it upon it if someone would be prepared to second it and the convenor and the assembly be prepared to accept it
accordingly i formally move it but if the a that acceptance is not forthcoming then i would have to deliver my speech
mr i really should say UNK it's just like being back in UNK college with you
could i have a comment from the convenor
simply to indicate what your mind is
not just
i think we'd be er prepared to accept this at what's asked for is a feasibility study no more than that in the first instance and i think we'd be prepared to accept
is it the mind of the assembly that we accept this
thank you mr for arranging your argument that way
dr
dr you've a new number five
sixty
so you've a new number six now
this very brief motion i've discussed with the convenor who will accept it and also with the general secretary of UNK of the board of the world mission who was ready also to co operate with it
the my proposal is simply this consider the feasibility of a theological examination of anti UNK
just like that without any restriction
now i do this sir because last week in the council of christian and jews in edinburgh we had one of the UNK meetings i've been at in which very distinguished people jews and er christians were concerned with the fact that anti UNK at the very bottom is anti god it opposed to revelation
and behind all the ethnic and UNK and other religious elements there is something very deep and this struck a deep UNK with me
when i was a student in germany and UNK fierce anti UNK and a fierce anti jewish relations i soon realised that at the back of this was a direct attack upon the concrete revelation of god in history through israel and the church which called in question german nationalism german blood and soil
now i believe that the time has come for us to think again about the theological side the theological er and i make this proposal consider the feasibility of a theological examination anti UNK and the convenor is ready to accept it thank you sir
thank you
dr do you accept
yes may i just say a word here
yes you may
moderator we do accept this but maybe i could er say just a word to the assembly about the workload as it were of this panel on doctrine
if you look at er the erm the er papers what's the book called the order of proceedings you'll discover that we are quite a small body of four a convenor vice convenor four ministers four UNK four others and one representative from each of the four UNK erm of UNK from those members of the UNK who are members of the church of scotland
now that number is small and decreasing it seems to me
er furthermore er so the number upon whom we can draw is really minimal and we do depend heavily on the help of the professional UNK though we're all UNK you know i UNK to the idea that we're all UNK i won't listen to these people who say i'm no UNK
we're all UNK but we do obviously depend heavily on the help of the professionals
er that help is there are fewer to draw from i it's also far more difficult for them to spare the time the pressures on the UNK are considerable nowadays
so er as i say we do accept this but we have to er be careful just how much we undertake and UNK on this case there is no time limit a and also i think we have the assurance from the board of world mission and unity that they and any others who are have something to offer will help us
so on that understanding i accept
is it the will of the general assembly so to accept and approve
do you wish to speak against
i wish to suggest an addendum
to dr 's thank you
four two
moderator i declare my interest as a member of the panel on doctrine but i wanted to enquire whether professor would be willing to include not only the problem of anti UNK but what seems to me to be the opposite problem which also exists today which is the problem of UNK
and i wonder if we do not need to enquire into the theological basis of both
dr would you include that within your statement
no this would this would be mixing up two very different things
that's right
like oil and water
s so
has to be done i wouldn't agree with it
i'm just asking professor for my own clarification at this stage and it is that he does not agree to accept mr 's addendum
and so therefore i have to ask now is there anybody willing to second mr 's addendum
it is being seconded
any discussion
then we have a vote as to whether to accept or not to accept mr 's addendum
could i ask the clerk to read it please or to recall oh sorry the convenor yes indeed
i tend moderator to professor 's view that this UNK the issue and we'd be better to deal with anti UNK by itself first of all
shall we shall we still we w we still have the issue of voting now for or against mr 's addendum
and i wonder if one of the clerks could just put it before us please
the this amendment moderator is simply to add to what we've already agreed the er feasibility of a theological examination not only on anti UNK but also UNK
those voting for mr 's addendum on UNK would you please stand
thank you
those voting against
it is carried against and so i come back to the new erm section being proposed by professor on anti UNK and UNK by the convenor dr and put it to the assembly
is that approved by the assembly that is then given to the panel as a new responsibility
now we come in the er blue papers page sixty five to the notice of two new sections six and seven in the name of mr and i'd ask mr to speak to these please
david one six three
moderator i'm going to ask the general assembly to turn their mind to quite a different subject now
we've had baptism we've had statement of faith we've had anti UNK we're going to think now about UNK all under the umbrella of the panel of doctrine
moderator i refer commissions t commissioners to appendix two on page one hundred and ninety one of the blue book
there we read in line seven of the UNK of retaining a UNK contact between our two churches on matters of doctrine a desire express i'm glad to note by our roman catholic friends and that's good
then in the last two lines of the appendix i read the panel on doctrine seeks permission for the joint commission to meet twice yearly as necessary to study documents of UNK interest
i don't think that's quite so good and why because of its evident ab absence of the note of urgency and its lack of UNK
moderator all the main line churches have recognized a divine call to unity throughout this century
but the century is fast running out
while there are UNK of light the establishment of act two years ago increasing UNK activities at grass roots level some referred to by bishop this morning i believe that the times require a note of urgency in our response to god's call
and god's world in its great need requires a visible sign that we are all truly united and no longer divided in our UNK to christ as lord
growing together is a step by step process
i say real progress has been made but today i am asking you to think about the next step a step that i am sure we all feel is at the heart of the matter a UNK step perhaps the critical step that will guarantee ultimate success in fulfilling god's loving will for his church
the next UNK to my mind centres around the lord's table
our roman catholic friends already recognize our common baptism into christ
they recognize also that we are together the body of christ in the world i hear them saying so now
so it would seem logical that the invitation to the lord's table should be UNK and why is it not
an archbishop in the hierarchy has said to me recently oh i feel the pain but rome does not permit it
you've all heard that and i've heard it for about thirty years now
now that reason without large expansion cannot satisfy fellow christians
and is that really the case
UNK two in the UNK on UNK number eight certainly says that sharing in the sacrament should not be UNK
i quote further it should only be used to UNK the unity of the church and it should provide a sharing in the means of grace
the gaining of a needed grace sometimes UNK it
now all that from UNK two and its UNK
now with that statement as guide discretion is left to the local bishop
it is happening now not just occasionally but increasingly on the continent but not yet here in scotland
there is also the UNK repeated argument that we should not sit down together at the table until after unity is UNK
but i repeat if we are united in a common baptism united together as the body of christ in the world the primary union in christ is acknowledged
unity of organization which by its nature will be a very UNK matter and unity in UNK not of the substance of the faith and we all know of significant divisions there do not affect the central doctrine
and here i come to the UNK of what i want to say
what really matters is whether or not we all believe certain UNK about the UNK
that the lord jesus is always the host at his table present in our midst as we do as he UNK
that in and under the bread and wine as UNK put it set apart from common use to this holy use to represent his body and blood he UNK us with his very life i in you and you in me i the UNK and you the branches
no chemical change takes place in the bread and the wine nor in ourselves
now that is accepted by all and i've discussed it recently i say with one of the roman catholic hierarchy
UNK now listen carefully i have discovered this in conversation to be a matter of semantics of words
i've said to my brother roman catholic if what you are saying is that the substance of the UNK is in a mystery transferred into our substance that is to say that we are UNK in the sacrament of the divine life then we go out in faith together believing the same essential
if that is so and it does seem to be so is it not time that we rejoice together while we are being UNK together at his table
i am asking today that our commissioners ask the scottish UNK in accordance with the permission granted in UNK two's UNK to allow an open table on UNK occasions
now note i'm not asking at this point in time for a general opening
our own reform in the matter needs clearer definition and our people need a lot of teaching and the panel could help us there
my fi five minutes are now just about up so i finish moderator by UNK that
i'm allowed one more minute after the bell
i finish moderator UNK that if we are in communion with jesus christ we are necessarily in communion with one other
all other UNK are very secondary to that and the question is are we to express that reality or must we continue to UNK it
we must express it for the world to see and to believe
i plead with our commissioners and their UNK in the roman catholic side to concentrate on this issue and not to UNK for this i believe is the golden key to that greater UNK and more effective church that is surely coming under god
is this seconded
thank you
could i ask the convenor just to make a statement
it's not it's not his summing up it's just a point of clarification to indicate whether he may or may not accept this
moderator i think i'm wholly in sympathy with this
one thing er pu UNK me a little and gives me a little difficulty that is erm the addendum refers to an invitation to all UNK members
i imagine UNK members would make this a little easier
mr any comment
i'd be happy about that
you'll be happy with that thank you
and so we
moderator
yes
of course you can you're a delegate and entitled to speak bishop at any time
one two eight nine i think
er
twelve eighty nine sounds more historical
twelve eighty nine
i'm sure there's some awful battle where we got er knocked about but still
i hope that's not a UNK of what's gonna happen now
i'm rather UNK for this one admittedly but it seemed to me that if you're quoting a member of the absent hierarchy you might as well hear er from a present member
erm certainly i will carry back to my fellow UNK what is expressed here concern about the question of UNK
i would like to say one or two things which might help in understanding
one is that it isn't all just a question of the scottish hierarchy being UNK to rome in such a way that it cannot do what it wants
nor is it a question of our seeking a UNK from the holy see to UNK to some request locally
the question that we are looking at is a question not simply of discipline but a matter that depends on our understanding not just of the UNK but of the nature of the church
and so we're talking not just about UNK communion but UNK communion
and these are matters that we are and will be for the future the immediate future and perhaps for the more distant future thoroughly engaged upon because there are very deep questions here and the UNK one hinges upon the UNK one
now as regards the actual well perhaps i should add to that there are two principles if you like in the theological field which UNK the practice of the church
one is the principle that given UNK communion that UNK communion is represented is UNK is UNK is celebrated in at the lord's table
now that is not to deny that it is in effect surely of bringing christians together but there are certain questions
at what point do you in all honesty and UNK er celebrate a sacrament which is a sacrament of giving unity as well as bringing unity forward
the other principle is the principle of particular need
in other words UNK the UNK are for the good of men and woman of course the UNK in latin includes both it's inclusive language for the sake of er well of certain persons who will be picking me up
and that is why there are occasions particularly on the continent when christians from other UNK are positively welcomed at the table
because the local church recognizes in the person of its priest or bishop their need for the sacrament and the UNK of the sacrament within their own communion
and those two principles are the governing principles at present in the practice of the catholic church with regard to admission to the sacrament
let me finish in a very positive note in saying that i'm as concerned as the speaker to which i reply that day will be reached and reached soon please god when we can sit down together and share fully in the sacrament of the lord's supper
thank you
any other any other discussion
mr
moderator thirteen forty two and convenor of the board of world mission and unity
to remind the assembly that this is a matter which was raised i think by mr a couple of years ago and when a very similar motion was accepted by the board er asking us to raise this matter with the roman catholic hierarchy in scotland which we did er we know that there has been attention paid to this by the hierarchy
about six months ago our deputy general secretary wrote to UNK the general secretary of the UNK conference and er told him that we hoped progress was being made referred in particular to the degree of consensus that had been a arrived at in the baptism UNK and ministry document and er also to the difference that had been made by the coming into being of acts and its commission on unity faith and order and we had a reply to that er a letter from UNK as that the hierarchy were taking this seriously that they were discussing it er amongst themselves in scotland and were also in discussion with rome on the subject as well
er and as would have been noted in the in our report to this general assembly on page four hundred and nine we say at the end of er the paragraph in the middle of the page in which we are referring to acts and its commissions in this connection it should be noted that the UNK approach to the roman catholic UNK conference of scotland on the question of UNK is under discussion in that conference and in the acts commission on unity faith and order
so although there is not as yet any definitive question any definitive answer to this same question which was raised by mr a couple of years ago it is under consideration and we would hope that the sort of answer which he is hoping for might be forthcoming from that source
if the convenor is willing to accept this and i'm aware of the time if anybody wishes to strongly speak to a new point or a new angle on this matter i'd really prefer to call on the convenor to sum up
would that be the will of the assembly
thank you
moderator it's a great joy to hear bishop speaking in this particular context on this subject
he and i enjoy very happy UNK relations and personal friendship and we've argued this out in our respective UNK before now
erm i he has these two principles and we respect them
i think there are other two principles though which i hope you would feel we er should respect
one is that erm in this matter especially the matter UNK we are always anticipating when every time we celebrate the lord's supper we anticipate the marriage UNK of the lamb
we don't wait till the kingdom comes before we celebrate we celebrate now in UNK
our lord taught us to pray er give us this day our daily bread but we all know when we've read our UNK that the word UNK means of tomorrow give us today the bread of tomorrow
and therefore i think this principle of UNK i is also an equally valid er principle that we should er look forward in faith to the day when we celebrate and on occasions we should be able to anticipate that unity
furthermore we believe that the very celebrating of the sacrament does bring us more UNK on the way to that UNK for unity
i think it's quite proper for us to be UNK and hammer on the door and say it again as the deliverance would have us say and i'm sure our roman friends will understand our UNK
now to the assembly these new sections six and seven is it the mind of the assembly to accept these
thank you
is it the mind of the assembly to accept the deliverance as amended as a whole now
thank you
dr before we pass to other business i would like to thank you very much indeed for all the work that the very small size panel on doctrine has carried out for the good of the assembly and the work of the church
thank you
a call for the report on the board of social r responsibility
moderator four hundred and seventy five
moderator i reported to the general assembly last year that the board of social responsibility had planned a deficit on its operation of thirty eight UNK homes UNK to a little over two million pounds
at that time i explained that although the board's weekly rate on these homes was low due to our policy of not charging any element for capital in the rate we calculate the department of social security made available to elderly people in residential care in the community an allowance in that year of forty pounds and in this present year of fifty five pounds per week below the cost of such care in any of our homes where the cost is already artificially depressed
the board's policy of completely UNK all capital costs and charging nothing for income on capital amounts on average to a subsidy of ninety six pounds per resident per week
and the board thinks there's a reasonable subsidy to offer to its elderly residents
it is with considerable regret that i now have to tell the general assembly that although other parts of the board's work and the board's UNK invested capital have performed well from a financial point of view the anticipated deficit on thirty eight UNK homes has been sustained
representations have been made and are being made to her majesty's government
we see this UNK of UNK care as limiting the choice available to people who have come to that point in their lives when they're making decisions about the sort of care that they will next require
it is our hope that the department of social security will move in keeping with the findings of the all party parliamentary select committee on social security to correct this UNK before the responsibility for meeting the cost of residential care in the community is transferred from the d s to local authorities a year from now
in the meantime the board is looking for ways to fund the deficit should it continue but has decided not to charge the deficit as an additional burden upon those residents who are able to pay their own way from their own resources and not to move from its established principle of offering care to those most in need towards a UNK policy of offering care only to those who are most able to pay
needless to say needless to say this deficit has not involved any additional call whatsoever upon the mission and aid fund of the church from which the board receives an annual contribution of around four hundred thousand pounds towards its overall budget of twenty million pounds
moderator that works out at a contribution of seventy five pence per minute towards the actual cost of our operation of forty pounds and twenty three pence per minute
the board has met the deficit entirely from its own resources and has had to budget as i've said a continuing deficit into the current financial year
all other parts of the board's work have been budgeted within acceptable limits
and i should say to the general assembly that the board's four homes for people with UNK are differently funded and any UNK there are made up by grants from health boards and social work departments which are UNK from making up the deficit in UNK care
during nineteen ninety one the board has been delighted to open new areas of work in UNK where our first designated place and associated UNK was opened on a most happened happy day by sir russell
in UNK near UNK where lady the wife of last year's lord high commissioner opened our fourth UNK unit
in UNK in east lothian where UNK park house now offers a mental health service within that county
but while new projects were opening the board was forced to depart from its shetland islands project which had been undertaken at the invitation of the shetland islands council and the island council charitable trust
this work was undertaken on the assurance from the council and charitable trust that those bodies would UNK would respect the board's employment policy
in the event although both charitable trust and council had given UNK to the first advert on the policy agreed they UNK at the second wave of recruiting and sought to change the basis of our agreement
even going to the length of UNK in the public press that it was the board which was in breach of its contract
as we indicate to the general assembly in the printed report the board could have insisted on its rights under contract made with those bodies and the board was confident that it would have won any action in the courts
but to pursue this matter would have delayed for some years the opening of much needed services
it is nonetheless a matter of deep regret that the board has had to depart from this project and that the first of these care centres on UNK which would have been opened in november nineteen ninety one had the agreement been left UNK was still not open at the beginning of this month
nonetheless we take some satisfaction from the knowledge that the involvement of the board did break the UNK at the earlier stage of this project and we're able to report that the shetland island council charitable trust has recognized the work of the done by the board in its final settlement of its account with us
last year the general assembly decided UNK con without UNK on the advice of the assembly council that the board of social responsibility should move away from the UNK office in george street
and we now report that the arrangements towards this move are well on track for execution this year some time ahead of the timescale that we indicated last year
this will UNK much needed space in one two one and enable the board to bring together its central administration in one place for the first time ever
in this time of new opportunity as the board is making arrangements to move to its new home and looking to developments in every area of service we've also recognized that opportunities UNK for local parish initiatives to attract funding from a variety of places
for this reason the board has sought to liaise with such local initiatives and to ensure that wherever possible the expertise and experience of the board will be made available to them
one area in which local initiatives within the church have proved invaluable has been in the delivery of service to people with h i v or aids and to their families and to their loved ones
last year the general assembly gave to the board of social responsibility a task of coordinating the work of the church in this field and we are proud now to be able to report to the general assembly that the work done by the UNK various boards and by numerous local initiatives make the church of scotland the UNK leading provider of services to the victims of h i v and to their families delivering both the most extensive and the most comprehensive service to these people within scotland
although the church has traditionally been reluctant to expose those to whom it UNK this service to public attention the general assembly ought to know of the scale of the UNK response
and i pay tribute now to all those parish and local church initiatives to all the work done by the major boards of the church and of course to those who deliver the service on behalf and in the name of the board of social responsibility
in the field of UNK to alcohol and other drugs the board has been glad to see the wholly responsible position taken by the national union of students in its response to the pressures on young people to drink
the board has been delighted to congratulate her majesty's government er in its UNK that factors such as public order should be taken into account in the fixing of a europe wide alcohol pricing policy
and in response to the growing number of women presenting with problems associated with alcohol UNK the board in its report this year makes some moderate and practical proposals about the way in which alcohol might UNK be UNK
it is in its work on health and healing the board of social responsibility has for some years now been concerned with the provision of training conferences for ministers and others involved in this aspect of the UNK commission
when this particular work was added to the board's remit it was our intention to offer the church advice under our social interest section and important reports were prepared and submitted to the general assembly and accepted
but the board now asks the general assembly to look again at this part of our remit and to form a judgment about where this work should be most effectively done in future
we ask the general assembly to remit to the assembly council to give attention to the placing of health and healing within the overall work of the church and to report to next year's general assembly on where they think this remit should most effectively be discharged
in nineteen ninety the general assembly instructed the panel on doctrine to consider UNK the question of the christian doctrine of marriage and to undertake this work in consultation amongst others with the board of social responsibility
this consultation has been UNK through the board's own study group on family matters whose work the board reports to this general assembly
the board is happy to commend this work to the church and UNK the UNK attention to the contemporary statement of the christian ideal of the family contained within that report
in making these statements the church is not standing UNK from the UNK them on how they ought to live their lives rather the church is speaking to itself holding before all its members the id the ideal of what we believe god has taught in his word about the way in which people ought to live
in that sense our failure to measure up to that ideal can be seen can be measured can be understood and the strength of the holy spirit can be sought as we all UNK in his power not to fail in future
and in saying this sort of thing to its own members the church also UNK the rest of the community to find for itself people within the community to find for themselves the positive benefits of living in UNK to the word of god
in addition to this major report on the christian family which is the board's contribution to the twin track work with the panel on doctrine the board also offers an interim report on young people in the media and its final report UNK at last year's general assembly on ritual abuse
moderator in UNK these reports to the general assembly and in particular in presenting its work on ritual abuse the board is conscious of its deep UNK to those who have looked on its behalf at the mixture of evidence and UNK on this most disturbing area of modern human UNK
moderator it's hard within the space of these few minutes to give a sense of the UNK of the board's work
and in focusing on some problem areas it's possible to fail to give an impression of the enormous privilege it is to serve the church and her lord in social responsibility
but i would not be true to myself if i did not record my own thanks to all who serve on the board for their hard and devoted work and at this time to take a moment to thank the retiring vice convenor bill for his work his prayers his support his wisdom and his fellowship over the many years that he and i have served together
moderator i submit the report and i move the deliverance
is it seconded
seconded
questions to the convenor
yes
nine hundred and forty
my question concerns the shetland island project and the question is this how much has the withdrawal of the board of social responsibility from the shetland islands project got to do with the board's policy on social responsibility appointed staff being sympathetic to the christian faith and how much has it got to do with the fact that the shetland islands council no longer need the board of social responsibility to be able to spend charitable trust money in other words oil money without UNK community charge support grant
i was six and a half years the minister of UNK and UNK where the first er centre h ha has been built and there was UNK in that community that the that social responsibility had been invited by the council to join in this work
and er at that time when it was being UNK the council could not spend this charitable trust money without putting into UNK vast sums of money from revenue grant
speaker that you've put your questions and i think they're sufficiently clear for the convenor to reply
yes moderator mr is known to the board and his support was greatly appreciated erm when these projects were being UNK
erm i don't know the answer to his question but i think he's put his finger upon a point
further questions
thank you
seven three two
i have a brief question and one comment
i look with pleasure to see that the UNK
please may i ask you sir to limit yourself to your question
yes well the question is that i notice in the assets that investments at cost were twenty five million the present market value is twenty eight million indeed since that's been written it may even be more and when i looked down to the other side of the accounts i noticed interest on capital of twelve hundred and four pounds and i wonder where the interest from the twenty eight million has gone to
erm i s suspect that it's er the one million two hundred and forty two thousand transfer from general operating reserve is that figure but may i make one comment
your question only
that's the question
convenor will reply
yes moderator the commissioner is UNK the investments at cost were seventeen million nine hundred and ninety seven pounds two hundred and ten
erm the market value he's right to say is now twenty eight million two hundred and twenty four pounds er two hundred and twenty four thousand six hundred and twenty four pounds erm and that's what's happened to the interest
it's marched with the capital and that's why erm the capital value of our investments is so much higher than the cost
thank you
one comment
no questions only at the moment
there are a great many UNK in due course to consider
five four eight
er moderator you'll probably not let me speak either
but this is a quite serious problem and er i don't i don't apologise for it because this is what's known as a UNK card
now this assembly can i get a couple of minutes please
can you put your question
yeah i but i mean i've but i've got to give you a small area of background
well it's a very important subject
let er me hear the question and i shall know if a background is required
you won't understand the question without a
moderator UNK moderator
a wee
moderator questions are asked for clarification of points in the report at this stage they're not asked it's not general questions that we're into
i mean i can understand all this but i'm just asking
i'm asking i've been here since saturday
now i've sat here
i've sat here UNK and i've UNK i've listened to all the UNK and i think i'm due a brief word to the assembly
on this particular item which to me is very important
there are people on waiting lists and i just want the chance to say something on this subject which will take two minutes
you you're chance will come in due course sir when we're making comments but at the moment it's just
but i'm just now moderator
i mean
if i don't g
i
i just
i think having i think having waited so UNK for so long that you can wait a little lo further
i must as ask
what
you to retain your seat meantime sir
could you give me a shout when i'm due
i er
this is really this is really just in case i fall asleep
i couldn't possibly forget you
thank you
further questions
yes
three one four
i'd like to know the board's
i'd like to know the board's position on UNK
i ask this question purely and simply because of all the children's homes that are being closed and these children need a caring and a happy home life and could the board encourage church members to become foster parents
an answer will come yes
yes moderator
erm it's now some years since the board UNK from most of its work with erm in children's homes i think we have only one children's home now operating in UNK
erm at that time erm we did erm report at some length on the question of UNK and exactly what the UNK asked for was the burden of the advice that we gave
moderator
yes
er eighty seven
er this is a this is a question concerning something which is not mentioned here which i think should have been
erm the complete absence of any emphasis er in the UNK on erm child abuse er child sexual abuse which is a most horrible sin
this was er reported on a couple of years ago but we've heard nothing since is there any action
the convenor will answer yes
yes moderator erm last year two year's ago the general assembly a very major report from the board of social responsibility on the question of child abuse
erm we have produced a study pack which has been extremely well used within the church erm and is still being extremely well used
it also contained erm guidelines erm er from lord the then UNK now lord UNK erm on the way in which ministers ought to respond in cases of child abuse
erm having produced that report and having erm er done the follow up on it doesn't seem to me that it would be reasonable for the general assembly to expect that the board would come back year after year with UNK of what we've already said and that's why the commissioner notices that erm we don't report this year on child abuse
thank you
someone here i think
yes please
twelve thirty three and if you look you'll see i'm from orkney
i i'm a general UNK and i would like to back up initially what the convenor has said about the study pack that has come on child abuse but i have a question
could you put the question first please
the question is why is there no mention in the paper on ritual abuse er of the use of general UNK to assist ministers in areas of difficulty
thank you
yes moderator i'm grateful to the commissioner for the for the question
erm again this is something on which we've already advised ministers and in the context of the report on ritual abuse specifically refers to the as a as the context in which it's offered to the c erm report on child abuse
any further questions
yes
please er i'll call you next yes
one o six o
moderator could the convenor tell us why the board wishes to be discharged its remit on health and healing when it's been so successful in bringing this to the notice of the whole church
grateful to mr for his very erm generous en UNK of the work that the board has done on health and healing
as i said in pre presenting the board's report when this matter was first given to us we were invited to advise the general assembly on matters relating to health and healing and that we did
at that time the general assembly didn't remove the remit from us and so we were UNK by being allowed to continue erm to run some training conferences for ministers and others in the church who were involved in sharing this ministry of healing within the nation
however th the fit of that training work for ministers and others within the church has sat less and less easily with the board's commission to advise the church and that's our social interests commission to advise the church erm on matters of social ethical or moral importance within its remit
and so because of that sense of ill ease of fit we decided that perhaps it would be appropriate for the assembly council to look at where this work ought to most UNK go
if the assembly council decides to report to next year's general assembly that the board of social responsibility is the best of all possible places for this work in training and advising ministers and others on health and healing then we'll happily accept that
but i don't think that will be the finding of the assembly council
thank you
yes
please
er eleven ninety
could i ask a couple of questions about the section on family matters moderator
erm i'd like to thank the er the board for this er helpful part of the report
first of all i'm looking at page three hundred and fifty in the blue book
at the end of paragraph four three two
er where the report has been pointing out the cost not just in financial terms but in terms of hurt and UNK of a home breaking up a family breaking up
i'd like to ask the convenor erm how would he have er replied to a young woman who came to me fairly recently whose husband had just left home by mutual agreement and for the sake of their children and er she said to me after he had gone er that the home was a much happier place now that there was they had been freed from the tension that they had been going through in a very difficult time
the children are no longer worried about dad coming home drunk or arguments between er husband and wife
erm i appreciate the point that the board's making about the hurt caused by broken families but how UNK would one respond to this case
thank you
yes reply
moderator nine eight o the convenor of the study group on family matters
erm naturally that is a problem that er exists and er people presumably divorce because of the pressures and problems that are there
if i could lead you from that paragraph on page three fifty over to page three six four page three six four one two three four paragraphs from the top it's ab it's the second of two paragraphs that begins the board UNK the UNK th that christ teaches that marriage is special and divorce is not the way he would wish for his people and then this sentence no one would wish to UNK condemn someone to stay in a marriage which is beyond UNK
we are not trying to say that divorce is never the answer
what we are trying to argue for is to try to prevent the cost the pain the hurt that is experienced after a divorce by UNK people to the fact that a divorce won't solve all their problems it will transfer one set of problems for another and our great concern in this report is to go back one step not just to speak to people who are experiencing hurt but in the hope that we can say something before it reaches the stage that it had reached when they came to you
thank you
on the se separate part of the report please moderator
erm looking now at page three hundred and fifty seven er paragraph seven three two oh seven three one and seven three two page three hundred and fifty seven where the report makes the point that er when legal proceedings are entered into they tend to create further barriers and make it m less and less likely that th there can be UNK between UNK partners erm and paragraph seven three two points out a growing need fo or speaks of a growing need for UNK
erm what place erm does the convenor see being made in the legal processes to make available to UNK couples the opportunity for erm voluntary UNK between the parties
erm i is there opportunity in our legal system at the moment or are there movements that way
moderator i think er mr wants us to go back to the words reconciliation
UNK is used in this technical sense when the couple have reached the stage where they've agreed there is no possibility of reconciliation and they are now seeking to make arrangements for example about er the children and about money
er and so you you're question is a good one what about reconciliation
and our great concern is that people in scotland should know that the possibility of reconciliation exists
they don't about that when they're in the middle of a dramatic crisis and they've fallen out and perhaps the only thing they know about is how to go about getting a divorce and you see a lawyer and so on
well we want to say there is hope
as christians we've discovered about reconciliation in our own lives and we know the need of it in lots of areas in human relationships
erm in terms of er forcing people to have it well you can't er somebody has to want to look at the possibility so that we would er let people be aware there are there are UNK organizations like er in england it's re er it's relate er marriage guidance scotland still called that in scotland
the there are parish ministers who are willing to listen and long before it reaches the stage of lawyers and divorce
does that answer the question
thank you
thank you very much
yes
eric one o two
i would like to ask the convenor with relation to one three on page three hundred and forty concerning the christian ideal of marriage why not mention is UNK is made there of the importance of the family UNK and praying together
erm if i knew the pages in the report as well as i try to know my bible i could point you to another place moderator where er
we'll wait two more minutes till class turns up

this is jonathan he's a he likes the
quite the rest of you please
he likes the college most days
the organisation is getting better
the facilities are quite good
i'd like to see a bar
more canteen facilities all that UNK for food
lots of people who meet him who he likes and he goes out with them
that's not nice
you said that they're to put up more was it
trees
more trees
better classrooms
UNK selling machines
a bigger car park for john's little UNK m
better computer facilities
right
i agree with the last one
next two
this is paula and she don't mind college
made a lot of friends
erm it's very organised
can't se that's about it
okay
next two
this is sarah
erm she doesn't think the college is particularly special
er it doesn't look very nice
his influence
erm she said she didn't like the course too well and
and erm er good place to make friends but at any college you make friends
and from the UNK exeter college where she first knew me so
that's about the size of things
right
are you dedicated to terms
am i
yes
no
because shouldn't be
okay next two
this is lisa
and she thinks the college is a UNK
erm the course is too jam packed and she doesn't enjoy it
erm she could make plenty of improvements make it look nicer more organised better rooms the people are okay but that's the only good thing about college is meeting people
the rooms are badly heated the facilities are okay and it's been it's been an okay experience so far
right
erm
and the last two
this is claire
she loves the college
she's on the b tech first diploma on caring for a year then she's gonna go to a two year national
erm she thinks it's quite a good course she likes the tutors and she likes going out with friends who she meets at college
she has a day off a week
aha
erm she
if i'm lucky
a bit bad
no
but she erm thinks that the way it should be only four days rather than three
and
ha
lucky
and it could be improved
the college could be improved a lot
right
i've all those feelings
seems to be all about stop and go
right
let's now talk for a little while about the assignment
maybe give you extra help extra information
we'll hand out some paper this is not to make one of these long lists or anything it's basically to help you to make some notes if you wi require to do so
right
yeah
would you like to hand that for me round claire
yes
thanks
i want to go through the process of what we really have to do and consider to build up the story
not just the basic elements but let's put one or two things down on paper for yourselves
now as you know i when you
oh yeah
when you paint a picture when you paint a picture you put all the information in the picture that you need to present the idea to other people
the same thing applies when you build up a story in words
you have to build that picture in the mind
now if you want to make any notes read them through now it may be helpful to you if you think can just remember then that's okay by me
but i always find and i think you probably do if you write things down you remember them easier and far longer
right
now what i said to you approximately two minutes to the side that's fine if you want to know how many words who kno who knows roughly how many words in two minutes
right
i'll explain to you
it is based on three words per second as the spoken word
oh
oh yeah
alright
that is the spoken word
and three words per second is the way that television UNK make er their scripts for presenting to the public in a news UNK
so for a minute you have obviously got a hundred and eighty words and for two minutes it's double that amount
i see
okay
mm
now i'm not going to be UNK and say anything under two minutes is unacceptable two minutes is the guideline just to give you an idea of what would be a good idea
right
okay
now we're talking about whether it can be a story about human beings or animals
it can either be looking at the animal as an observer in which case you can talk about the animals and what they are doing
or you can take the point of view of the animal and have the animal speaking in a human tongue
the same as i did mention last week
a simple structure for the plot interest and also or possibly it's quite nice to include a little bit of humour
so straight forward there's something to create a smile about
now apart from a UNK er magic of the story line you also need a UNK character or characters
to build up a character you need to know something about that character what sort of person that character is or what sort of animal that character is
is it happy
is it unhappy
erm you need to set the scene
now by setting the scene we'll take an example just a straight course statement alright
a girl goes for a walk
that is just a few words in your mind you can see a person walking along
as a story line it's not all because it doesn't say anything about the girl it doesn't say where she's going where she's come from and what's happening on the way
so that's the starting point
that's the basis of the structure
from that point on we need to give a name to that person we need to give the environment that is to say is she inside
is she outside
is she walking in a park
it is good to know if it's outside what the weather conditions are like
is it sunny
is it cloudy
are the UNK blue
or is it about to snow
it'll be interesting to know where the girl was going to
and perhaps where she'd just come from
is she doing anything apart from just walking along
now you start that building that information into the first statement of the girl goes for a walk
you then begin to build up a story line a structure and something which could be called interesting and could be the start of interesting idea
so using that idea using that information
mm
yeah that's
would someone like to tell me how they would actually incorporate that additional information into the first statement
who's got an idea
who can tell me
i'll start you off if you like
right
first of all someone give me a name for the girl
UNK
UNK
UNK it is
UNK has UNK been born
one day UNK was walking along in the park it was very hot and she was very tired
okay
we've established certain things there
there are other things we can now add to that
who will now add to other elements to that story
it's hot
she's tired
she's in a park
her name's UNK
the UNK were singing and the
right
yes
that sort of thing's important because it gives it gives it then builds up original
ideas and part of the story as well
right
more things please
mhm
the park was UNK
right
the park was UNK
what else
and say what the people were doing like you know there's people playing
and the story line could go and over the horizon she could see all sorts of very UNK flying in the sky that other children were flying in that lovely afternoon
right
what other things could what could she be doing apart from just walking
what does something that one does sometimes if you're UNK maybe happy
UNK
UNK
right
UNK or whistle
a whistle
okay
so she was quietly UNK to herself
she seems quite a UNK li er girl lady
have to stop and sit down because she's tired
yes
she could stop and sit down
an ice cream
get a drink
she was
right
in the distant she heard the sound of an ice cream van with it's with it's UNK little tune playing and she thought oh i'd love an ice cream
yeah i you may laugh but you see if you're writing stories for a for a young child then you've got to be explicit you've got to be UNK and you've got to talk in a basic language that child will talk that like that at that age
so one has to take that on board
so that is the idea of building up the structure for a story of that of that of that kind
now if you can once again for those who are going to actually do this assignment for me i hope you are
base the idea and structure building on that and then increase the UNK as you go along
the UNK being part of if you want to incorporate some sort of plot sequence or some sort of UNK erm that's entirely up to you
okay
the other thing that we mentioned last week as well is the moral message erm be it safety factors to deal with children
do it as well
i mean you know how a lot of a lot of these stories end and the moral of the story is etcetera
okay
the people here do you actually like er telling UNK stories
yeah
yeah
yeah
it's great innit
mm
cos you get a lot of feedback and th and there's a lot of excitement
do you have a chance to do it much here
yeah a lot
cos
yeah
our are expected to do it
yeah
to like of children
good
and th the stories that you read are all for children are they ones that you're reading from a book or are they ones that you're UNK at the time or what
well most are from a book
a book
from a book
normally
normally
right
so what you need to do is expand on what you've read and then start to invent things yourself
you will not always have a book available to you
but it's nice to be able to invent the stories as well
it's interesting for you apart from the child
right
we are going to do some UNK this afternoon
oh
which is er going to UNK our friend here
trouble is it's a
yes
right
so split up into four groups as wi with we did once before
it goes er
UNK
oh
sixteen of us so it's four in a group
are we playing the UNK
are you happy to take groups in that direction four
yeah
yeah
okay
so the first four there
watch what we do
okay
they'll be group a
oh no
that's us
the second group there including yourself will be group b
see this
yeah i know
the four in the corner including UNK
ha
will be group c
and the last four up this end will be group d
that's fi that's five in that
five
so five what
don't know
what is five
tell me
is there five people
one two three four five
that's right
one two
your
three four
that's one two three four
one two three four five
alright
use a five yeah that is you're right
i'm going
what the hell are you doing like that
just thinking of the role plays
she'll be death of me
yeah
what
that
one two three four five
you will have used them all
just one over
yeah i'm putting the extra one in the appropriate place for the role play that's all
you keep you keep a volunteer
right
okay
right
before we do the role plays i'd like to discuss them to sort of so we know exactly what we're gonna do
the subject for group a will be purchasing an outfit against your UNK wishes
oh yeah don't look
purchasing an outfit against your UNK wishes
and this at least UNK
but before we start we'll talk about controlling
oh i've done this before
oh yeah
group b
teacher now
i've done this
group b is something totally different
UNK and decorating an UNK tree a christmas tree and putting the presents on
we'll discuss that
did you hear that group b
yes
yes
right
group c different once again dressing in a dressing room for a play or any kind of stage production
i will not tell you what the production will be
we got we got a good then
but doing it in UNK
yeah i know
will be interesting
and group d and the reason i've allowed the extra person in your group is snow white and the seven UNK i know there are not eight of you
it doesn't matter
oh
it doesn't actually matter that much if you leave out UNK snow white
the idea of the seven UNK thing is you've got the seven UNK and i'm sure you can sort out who they are
and what i will do is they are all presents on christmas day
oh
your opening presents on christmas
oh
right
okay let's go back to the beginning
prepare you now
body language is the most important thing in UNK
now what's a typical who can tell me what the typical body language is that you would UNK present or UNK if you said i don't know
what would you what would your body language be
UNK the shoulders
the shoulders
a UNK
yeah
right okay
group a purchasing an outfit against your UNK wishes
now as near as possible you can do that
you can go into a shop and start purchasing this item not knowing your partner is there and the partner suddenly appears and then the UNK starts bearing in mind you are not
speaking
this is UNK
now what i would like
that's very good
you all to try and do this time is to avoid if you can UNK words UNK dialogue
UNK dialogue in UNK is an easy get out
because you just stand there and hope someone's gonna read your UNK so you don't have to do anything with your body
but this time can you concentrate more on what you are going to do with your body to actually tell people via your body or give them a good idea of exactly what you mean
yes
to say
yes
try and remember what you had originally on your on your gesture list
try and remember what certain things mean
what UNK means or what it can mean
and also what things like folding your arms means
right
what talking behind your mouth means
looking up and looking down
if you're not sure of anything and you haven't got your things here please ask
oh could i have one
mm
you wa you wanna have a look
i haven't got the for a moment so you'll have to use this one
thank you
right group b
have you
UNK and decorating a christmas tree and putting on the presents
now i would suggest you start that physically bringing in the christmas tree
let's say it's a fairly UNK one
if it's a fairly tall one then obviously on it's side it's gonna long
try and think work out how heavy that tree would be and how difficult it is actually to get a large tree into a lounge living room dining room call it what you will
call it a
erm let's say that the family are involved in decorating the tree
now when you're putting on the presents there are little there are other areas within putting on the presents that you can possibly include like a UNK going on the tree you happen to see your name in it on the tag right
and what does one do one picks it up start UNK it like the devil to find a work out what it is
now these are basic ideas i want you to add to these ideas
right
group c dressing for a play or any kind of stage production in the dressing room
you're all in the same dressing room
now
it's quite important to be very specific about how you do this because it's not just a matter of putting on clothes
oh
i mean for one production you may need a wig another production you won't
i mean if you can imagine what the process of a UNK in pantomime goes through to get all that gear on then that is the sort of thing you've got to try and do in UNK
a few weeks ago we were talking about lifting objects and the size of the objects
if you lifted a large laundry basket think about the size of a laundry basket think about where the hands would go then down lift it up and if it's full of laundry then it's obviously going to be heavier than if it was empty but that's the size
the difference being that if it's a UNK then obviously a UNK you lift it with one hand and if it's full of hot water or something then you'd have to be careful
think about the think about the sizes think about the weights and think about what it's gotta be used for and that is really got to relate to the dressing in the dressing room because there's all sorts of things there there's jewellery there's hats
right
going on to group d the UNK the seven UNK
happy UNK
UNK
UNK
UNK
UNK
ah
and then take which one
and there's isn't there
you want to use
now and i said alright
opening presents on christmas morning it's not just a case of opening presents is it
i mean one opened a present yes but
but are you happy when you're opening it
are you UNK ha are you happy when you see what it is
or is it one of those presents which
take the
and you can't think of an anything that you would like less
UNK
for the for the for the tenth year running jonathan has just got a pack of white UNK
yes
what have i got this year though
not white just green
right
so erm
one can in interpret one's attitude in relation to opening the presents in different ways
their faces
did you do it happily
what do you do
i mean you must still be half asleep in which it could be himself
okay
now this time we'll think about it
oh
carefully before we do it
so can you get in your groups now to discuss exactly what you're going to do how you're going to do it
very sort of slow
pardon
don't just take the basic subject today
think of really think hard about you're going to do
include something in it which no one else is expecting
quite difficult wasn't it
yeah
if you take a facial expression anyone of the seven UNK and you want to try and give a dramatic idea how to present that face or that attitude to do it just by standing there without curtains opening on you and all that sort of thing it's quite UNK it's quite difficult
but there are various ways you can do that
if there was a long line of people number of seven for the seven UNK and they were all standing there side by side and they had their hands over there face like so and the altogether at the same time in unison they UNK the hand to reveal the facial expression that is more of a dramatic experience to people looking than just by standing here
alright
so that you are actually creating the drama for the people that are looking at you
okay
let's go on to another subject which is another subject we'll be dealing with today
and i'd like you if you haven't destroyed them totally to use the little piece of paper i gave to you all
oh
i didn't have one
if you would like another piece
it's alright i've just looked at mine
sorry
whatever it is that changed
i mean you can't do stories one side can i
i no i didn't need it back
it's for your benefits
i'd like you to write things down because i think you're gonna remember them he says hopefully
i've lost it
if that happens to be on a piece of paper and you want to keep your it might be a benefit to you later on
it's there look
right
we'll end up today by talking a bit about children's role play
yeah
now in the past so far this term we've covered areas such as the bus role play which i suspect you remember the shop role play of which i'm sure you remember
mm
now have you obviously heard of the home corner yep
yes
right you know what a home
yes very well
corner is
i'm sure you do
what we want to do now can we stand on these ideas and put down on paper some more ideas of what circumstances and situations you could use for children's role play
areas which would benefit the child possibly educate the child in a different direction a different way
ways of explaining to a child or showing things for a child or showing a child how to do things
such as
such as buying an ice cream
has a great education value for children it helps to form their personality and character it allows them to exercise their imagination and explore the world of fantasy
when a child plays a game and assumes another character it enters into a form of role play which in itself is a dramatic experience
this is all part of the learning process
with guidance and the use of role play children can begin to experience many of life's situations
now incorporate in your play there is the there are the benefits of dressing up using clothes that may well be available or using er specific UNK as well
dressing up helps to helps children to find a simple way of changing role and to establish their own UNK
dressing up can help a shy sh a shy child to lose his in UNK in UNK
UNK
thank you so much jane
what a child is by anxiety to play out his fears
wearing specific copies of UNK also gives children the opportunity to try out occupational roles such as UNK or nurses as well as fancy roles like UNK or UNK
right
so if you can start writing your list of you have examples already of other areas that you think could be interesting useful educational helpful to a child either as in a group or maybe it's two children
in role play
for role play
yes it's a role play
yep
role play subject
mm
sarah
mm
what have you got
erm
good
you've got on your list
yeah
er i've probably got everyone else's i've got car racing
what sorry
car racing
when somebody
car racing
wants to
what as a racing driver you mean
yeah that's
yeah
right
erm a farmer
i know what i've got
nursing and doctor
what have you got
yeah
mm
nurse and doctor
yes
cos ac they like that
anything to do with the hospital
yeah
doctors one of course
yeah doctors one
is a very good idea
UNK here for you
UNK here
yes of
can i have a word with you please
you may indeed
we're about to finish so please come in
close the door
yeah in a minute
how long will you be
right we'll wait outside
alright
couple of minutes
the benefits of a role play for children particularly are
or rather is a play the role play results in a child getting used to experiences a experiencing a situation which is gonna be helpful to that child
and often the situation is one that
cheers
ha
thank you
that's alright
your very polite aren't you
right
next week
next week once before you go
before you go
next week if you'd like to bring some more music tapes for next week
okay
okay le let's get started
we're going to conclude now the discussion of the various ways in which bacteria in particular er lead to the production of UNK disease and really to centre round centres round the discussion of the UNK that is the mechanism by which the disease is produced and UNK
and i hope to run through today basically a set of examples of specific UNK positions which show particular UNK factors er manifest themselves in terms of clinical disease
we start with er a fine and exciting topic for monday morning the topic of boils and in their UNK form they're shown here as UNK
but the sa the very same organisms responsible for that relatively moderate appearance can also produce blocked er region of prince charles the UNK with which in it's most er UNK form can break down and produce the series but really effectively UNK
if we sample one of these UNK in which the process is er which produce boils er are going on almost inevitably we find this organism UNK and UNK have been clearly fulfilled with organism and this disease most UNK by a bunch of medical students who are subjected to all sorts of UNK by their professor of UNK back in the nineteen fifties
and over the years it's been possible to identify a number of factors produced by these bacteria that seem to make sense in terms of the UNK and the conditions
now the UNK is by a chief information and i in fact the chief information could be UNK merely by the presence of organisms
you will you will recognise from your UNK that the presence is certainly foreign UNK materials can lead immediately to the acute alternatives
but UNK inside er the material that UNK the boils and UNK there is a cell death both of bacteria and of the both the defending cells and the structural cells
and to a very large extent UNK cell death can be related to the ability of UNK to produce UNK toxins which actually leave the cell death and
but the characteristic of this UNK forming organism is that the UNK it produces are UNK off that is they're relatively UNK
and although the er the UNK relationship is not completely established it is a very helpful way of remembering that one of the principle UNK features of this organism which UNK it from other members of the UNK it pr it produces this UNK to UNK things on and the effects of this UNK are illustrated here as against the control preparation you see a UNK form due to the action of this UNK on UNK practice which has been put into this test tube UNK
so this is almost certain a UNK factor but is also very useful in differentiating UNK species of UNK from non UNK species
and as you'll be hearing in later er stages of the course there are many non UNK species of UNK
it's worth also mentioning since you saw it in the practical class that UNK in general produce this UNK all of these er lo thi this is the UNK which breaks down hydrogen UNK and UNK it
all of these factors together lead us an to recognise as it a UNK forming organism which is often recognised by the term UNK organism ability to produce UNK in er the form of reactions it UNK
now i want at least to UNK introduce the possibility in the series of diagrams i'm going to show you in this lecture that we can relate it to the four stages of UNK that we outline briefly er in the last lecture
the first stage being the establishment the next stage being UNK the third stage being damage what actually produces the damage in the disease and the fourth stage is if the disease is going to last for any period of time the ability of the organism to persist
i'm going to introduce this UNK here in the hope that during the course of the lecture i'll be able to add comments about which of these factors lead to which of these results
er but if we run out of time and i find we haven't we can't fit it all in i'd like you all to attempt to do this for yourselves after er the lecture is over
okay
so establishment for UNK is often not an important feature because in the majority of UNK we're talking about an UNK infection the organism was there in the first place
UNK in many instances is not related to a property of the organism itself in most instances it's re related to some form of injury in which the organism is moved from it's normal skin location to a deep tissue location
so we won't mention these factors here although in some instances er these properties are important to talk about for UNK
the damage is fairly obvious to see is produced by these two and it's worth pointing out that UNK can be related to this UNK
UNK have some degree of resistance to killing by UNK and yo you should recall that UNK er one of the mechanisms by which UNK kill UNK organisms is the production of reactive oxygen UNK and UNK is one of the ways that these can UNK and th there's fairly good evidence that the UNK enables er UNK to persist
okay
so that's the first example of a very common condition
let's move on now to consider a very important type of infection such as UNK
you recognise by particularly common in children not recognised by the particular UNK that they adopt and extended neck rigid neck due to the inflammation of le UNK which i will resist being a reflection of the neck completely UNK
it's a disease which if it a they're fortunate enough to re recover from the disease if it's been severe enough the inflammation may have involved er some of the UNK nerves and here we can see a third nerve UNK er as a result of er the process
if you take a sample er of ce the UNK fluid during the course of acute bacteria UNK you will find it's UNK not due the fact that it's an organism but present being due to the presence of UNK cells
this is another UNK fluid and in about a third of the cases you will find this very UNK with them
mm
which you can just about see here a in conjunction with the UNK cells with which it is UNK
the life and death life and death tackle
this organism is the UNK grand negative rod you saw in the erm practical class UNK
and it is a very important UNK responsible for about a third of the cases of UNK in this country almost exclusively in children
now the process we recognise in the pa UNK of UNK due to this organism is as follows first of all and then it is able by mechanisms not completely described but we could probably involve this UNK er phenomenon that er i briefly mentioned last time
first of all UNK from the into the UNK and then into the UNK fluid
now the basis for the UNK is not well enough established for us to expect you to understand the details of how it UNK these processes but one thing which is remarkably clear is that the organism is a capsule producing organism and that once it gets into the er UNK fluid that UNK is an acute UNK
we do recognise establishment factors that is UNK in this part of the process and it is very clear that the capsule is one of the factors which allows the organism to pe persist because it helps the organism to resist UNK
you'll notice that the damage in this instance is actually the result of the acute UNK response not particularly some form of direct UNK effect of the organism so the contribution of the host is absolutely critical
now the reason we focus on the capsule as illustrated on the right here is that UNK have many different UNK types but only one type appears to be associated with UNK
this type b capsule refers to a particular pulse
and has it's so important in the UNK of the capsule that antibodies to it can be used er ca er can actually completely prevent the disease and we end up with a capsule vaccine based on the type b pulse
plus UNK with the other two organisms which produce UNK in humans it is very prominent that both of these UNK and UNK are also very prominent capsule mechanisms
hello
that's like the type
h i for UNK
and that's that h i is actually the th h i b is the UNK for the vaccine
there's a new vaccine introduced last october which is being er used for the first time in this country to prevent UNK in children
is that just the name of the vaccine
h well h i b is a an UNK for the strain of UNK that produces the infection but the name of the vaccine the h i b vaccine yeah
okay
i should say that a lot of this information will be covered again during this course what i'm trying to do now is to bring together the themes in a UNK of infection that i introduced last week into the practical context of clinical UNK
and to try and illustrate to you why we focus on particular UNK factors for particular organisms
move on now to look at an area that's er not frequently er doesn't UNK a great deal on life in this country but it certainly does for travellers and for many people in the developing world
this is the topic of UNK diarrhoea produced by UNK agents
this is a dramatic disorder of the small UNK which produces a massive UNK of water UNK that can be fatal within a matter of hours after the UNK of disease
we recognise two agents which are er responsible in UNK causes of this process th there are many others but these are certainly the most important
UNK the UNK and er an UNK here UNK i wouldn't worry about taking down the full er it actually stands for e UNK it's a strain or a group of UNK that are able to produce this effect
these diseases are common in areas er where an out pouring of water from the individual is squared up with a ou out pouring of people into the water then you can appreciate that UNK is very er readily promoted under those circumstances
the effects on the individual are very dramatic
UNK er can produce death within a matter of fe er a few hours and an understanding of the mechanism by which this UNK leads us into one of the most effective forms of heat treatment er ever produced
a prominent feature of UNK diarrhoea is that effective and normal UNK in yo you ca you can ignore this sign are almost UNK so despite this dramatic change in the UNK of the small UNK it actually looks quite normal
and you have a normal UNK
now the organisms that produce this effect haven't have this target which is around zero for the UNK the UNK of a small UNK and the both of these organisms have pro prominent UNK mechanisms
let's just show you something with that
in an affected small UNK you will see the grey background with these tiny little UNK rods present the whole area of the er the UNK is covered by the organisms which are er stuck down effectively by the processes which you ca you can't really see them in the UNK but they are attached to specific UNK on the surface of the UNK membrane
once they've got there the organism really goes no further
both the UNK organism and the UNK organism UNK toxins referred to here as c t for UNK toxin and UNK for the le UNK toxin
it is very striking that these toxins are actually almost exactly the same molecule
so that although these are er fairly different relatives in terms of bacteria it's striking that the UNK organism has been able to acquire in some way almost exactly the same gene that's present in UNK
and this toxin when released from these tightly organisms disorders the er the physiological activity of the lining cells the UNK cells
the UNK oh we've lost a slide
the UNK basis for this is very well understood and forms one of the important themes in er the effects of e UNK in human cells
this toxin is composed of two components er of binding components and active component
binding component UNK to specific UNK on the UNK and the active component UNK into the cell and UNK the controlling mechanism on the production of
and this is the cell that er is UNK by several other toxins that affect not just the gut but other parts of the body as well
i should point out that in one of the features of UNK is that it takes two to UNK so to speak
where specific UNK are involved the structures that are most commonly associated with a require a specific receptor for the UNK reaction to take place and that if the potential host doesn't have specific receptor they're not susceptible to that particular strain of organisms
okay
let's move on to look at another fairly dramatic infection which is a case of diphtheria
that which is er a infection ca UNK by this UNK of th the base of the neck referred to as bull neck if you look inside this child's er UNK you see this very messy UNK process at the back and the whole of the UNK is beginning to UNK in what's referred to as a UNK membrane
in fatal cases this UNK membrane can extend right from the top of the UNK track here down into UNK and you can get these enormous UNK of UNK material er starting in the UNK and working their way right down in the UNK
it's been known for a very long time that from these cases you can UNK this organism c diphtheria UNK which you saw in the practical classes and has this UNK stayed property where er certain UNK can be stayed up and also the arrangement of the cells is rather UNK of what called chinese UNK
the picture the acute picture which you've just seen is virtually exclusively due to the production of a toxin and that toxin produces really a UNK inflammation of the UNK associated with UNK and UNK of what we call the UNK membrane
in very severe cases the toxin gets into the blood stream and their UNK effects toxin i is to some extent a UNK toxin and also there are effects of the heart
so although for the majority of cases that a fatal as a result of diphtheria the fact that due actually to the UNK and the UNK membrane UNK the UNK passage
in later stages the minority of cases may go on to produce these results
well this is a disease due to another UNK which in practical terms is of importance to you because it's the basis for a test for identifying the
the toxin may or may not be present in strains of er c diphtheria and this is just an UNK test so i wo won't explain it in detail but what you can see is a strip of er filter paper which has been UNK in anti toxin and growth of various different strains of the organism erm which some of which do produce the toxin you can see lines of UNK here and some of which don't produce the toxin
and that test has to be applied to es each UNK because this toxin is not part of the UNK of UNK bacteria diphtheria it's actually a UNK toxin it's actually UNK for by a bacteria UNK
so when
what's UNK then
UNK
oh
i thought you were doing UNK sciences course
the as i said this is required for identification for the organism but the to the toxin has been recognised for a very long time and right from er the early days the possibility of UNK the biological properties of a toxin while retaining their UNK properties has been attractive to people seeking to prevent these diseases
and if you treat this toxin with something like UNK or UNK you end up by UNK it's toxic properties and you end up with what we call a UNK something that UNK properties it's able to stimulate specific immunity to the toxin but it doesn't have any of the toxic effects and we end up with this UNK vaccine against diphtheria
and all of you i would expect have received the UNK vaccine against diphtheria
UNK it has led effectively to the UNK of UNK diphtheria from the circulating UNK in this country and the reasons for that are quite UNK
another im prominent UNK vaccine which you should all have received and be regularly receiving UNK for is the tetanus vaccine and really a very similar situation UNK here that the toxin is so important in the UNK of disease tetanus that simply immunity to that one factor can lead to immunity er to the disease as a whole
so i've gone through a series of examples of UNK i want to just er as far as is possible summarize the general properties of UNK
first thing to be said about them is that they're all UNK covering a very wide range of UNK weights between three and three hundred UNK three thousand to three hundred thousand UNK
and they have very specific impacts because they all result their effective result on an interaction with a specific receptor and er an activity i would express on that receptor or as a result of the er erm the UNK of the toxins
consequently
as i've indicated before you can divide them into UNK and physiological effects and membrane damage more specifically than what i said before membrane damage is the i is a particularly important thing
your UNK and physiological toxins are often sub UNK structure and they make the most the UNK most widely used is an a plus b sub unit structure
the b is a receptor and a is often although by no means always an UNK and in the case the UNK toxin UNK toxin and several other erm UNK membrane toxins and several others diphtheria toxin they have the specific a UNK i think they put the group onto a target molecule and disorder itself
the membrane doesn't use toxins like the UNK toxins that UNK expressed er they're often detected by their UNK properties see the in the er in the UNK passage
i'm sure you've experienced in many instances here the effect of UNK toxins in er a boil or some other unpleasant minor UNK
gonna go on now to talk about a severe condition which may start out that with a minor skin rash like this is called a UNK skin rash they later progress to rather more UNK rash and in it's most severe form it's UNK
effects on the skin and er obviously a lethal outcome
this type of picture is almost exclusively related to the isolation of grand negative organisms from the blood these may be UNK or UNK doesn't really make any er any difference
it's the grand UNK negative cell wall structure that seems to matter
and we now know that these UNK effects are the results of what we referred to in the last lecture UNK
you will hear in considerable detail in a later lecture about how UNK shock and UNK work
at this stage it's worth UNK that wa there are perhaps three prominent features of UNK effects first of all they promote UNK release and th the two pro prominent UNK affected are i o one UNK one and UNK factor which i hope you heard about in the UNK course
i o one is the molecule most closely associated with the mi the effects of UNK and that is fever i o one er when released into the blood sys UNK affects the UNK and th i one of the principle reasons why UNK conditions lead to fever
in more severe situations there's UNK continent UNK and UNK factor UNK and it's really that last feature that's particularly responsible for the er UNK skin disease you saw i in the last UNK in the previous slide
now the UNK the UNK as i've is almost exclusively associated with the grand negative cell wall
and again in UNK form that i just want to take you through the UNK basis for UNK action
here is the positive wall with it's large er UNK grand negative with an inner and an outer membrane and the UNK in between
here we have a diagram of a grand negative organism with it's inner membrane and outer membrane illustrated here
very easy to UNK shock in experimental animals and er it was found fairly early on that the effects er the UNK effects were almost exclusively associated with the outer membrane
and detailed chemical strains of the outer membrane show that it has a slightly different structure from normal unit UNK
expand that up you'll end up with a normal inner leaflet to the membrane a UNK but the outer the er the outer layer is almost exclusively composed of this stuff UNK i mentioned this in an earlier lecture but we need to go into in a little bit more detail
this UNK is can then be broken up into three different sections the internal membrane section is referred as UNK a
UNK in general are not very UNK erm er it's interesting to note that UNK a when it's UNK from the other components is almost totally responsible for the toxic amount of any property
the UNK component of composed of a four region to which the UNK are attached and that outer region is er it UNK out into the environment
now the importance here is that both of these UNK components are based in general the outer region is highly variable that's to say that very er that most of organisms possess a unique outer region to that UNK
and by contrast the poor region certainly amongst the grand negative UNK is very similar across a wide range of different species and this provides a very important opportunity to produce immunity to UNK directed against the core and this possibility has recently been UNK by a production of the molecule UNK directed against the core UNK of the erm er of UNK
so this has been shown to be effective in UNK the toxic events which occur in grand negative shock
building on this approach and something which i think you'll see certainly during the course of your medical studies antibodies directed against UNK process factor are now being used to try and interrupt the chain of events at a slightly later stage
so that's the UNK story
i want now just to summarise and er some of these the features i'm going to point out i've already stated so you may just want to sit back and just take this in
if we compare UNK and UNK are only associated with grand negative organisms whereas UNK maybe produced by either grand negative or grand positive
UNK are exclusively cell associated in their production
UNK may also be cell associated they've they may not be a sa they're not a structural component but particularly in grand negatives UNK er are released first into the UNK space the space between the two UNK and the actual release into the medium er may require cell
so tha they are both cell associated and cell free
UNK from different organisms although it may be of different UNK has essentially the same biological effects
so a wide variety of different organisms can produce UNK shock
but UNK from different organisms produce really very different biological effects
even though they may be er the they may work as a result of different o of the same UNK activity in some cases the target for that UNK activity and the UNK that have put it into the specific cells that are targeted lead to really very different biological effects
in general terms UNK are a very low UNK about point o one of a gram is lethal to one person some UNK are incredibly UNK and they're being the subject of er a certain amount of er weapons research
the same goes for o one of a gram for example toxin and it gives you a hundred thousand er as i've indicated here there's a wide range for the UNK
UNK are heat stable and this is very important when we try to produce materials that are safe for UNK injection
whereas for the most part UNK are destroyed by heat into a hundred degrees UNK
and finally treatment with er UNK or UNK has no effects on UNK but in a number of instances UNK or UNK will lead to er the production of UNK
so i think you should now have a very clear basis for UNK between the two sorts of two sorts of toxin
and we can move safely on to another and the final really final topic about the patterns of UNK
let's move on now briefly to consider this disease tuberculosis
this is a normal test x ray the UNK of tuberculosis is the disease of des destructive regions in the upper UNK of the lungs and UNK the very nasty destructive UNK er are appearing in the area
and in a mi in a minority of cases you may get a sort of UNK region this is er small scale it's perhaps a centimetre apart across a series of lung UNK containing these little UNK due to the er the presence of UNK
although this was this organism UNK tuberculosis named tuberculosis was discovered back in eighteen eighty we really understand the UNK of the disease very poorly
what we know for sure is really outlined here
the organism is in i is UNK into the UNK spaces and it's taken up by UNK the standard er UNK for UNK and the organism i in contrast to many others which we've sort of er die fairly rapidly after being taken up by these UNK cells says UNK
that was exactly what i wanted to happen
and it grows very rapidly within UNK and after er a period of time is actually UNK into the circulation
now this happens in nearly all er cases o of tuberculosis but interesting the vast majority of UNK tuberculosis are UNK and the reason for that is that after a period of growth and UNK does not lead to clinical symptoms cell UNK immunity c m i comes into comes into play and you end up with a balance between the UNK and fi and m t b where there's a constant turnover of UNK dying and m t b winning out
excuse me
hello
yep
what's the m t b
UNK tuberculosis
okay
thank you
you have a balance between the effects of UNK which have been activated by cell UNK immunity and the lethal effects of UNK tuberculosis
in individuals in whom some UNK immunity is not well developed the growth and UNK de UNK phase may take over altogether
if the c m i doesn't lead to this kind of balance then it can have this sort of effect and get rapidly fatal tuberculosis occurring at the time of the primary infection
but it's believed that the majority of cases of tuberculosis that we actually see are so called post primary tuberculosis where all of this process is taking place UNK and the host is in this state of balance but something else comes along and stresses cell UNK immunity and the control breaks down so that th the organism m t b wins out very dramatically over the over the UNK and you end up with this post primary pattern of tuberculosis
an example of th of the stress might be the administration of UNK or the UNK of another disease most UNK in this day and age of course aids would lead to t b coming out in this way
is this a type of UNK
UNK er i it refers well you've heard of UNK seed and it's it refers to a UNK of many different UNK er around the body it means the UNK form of tuberculosis where the UNK occur all over the place
mm
you'll hear you'll hear these things repeated many times again both in the UNK and in the UNK course
so that's er really a very different pattern of UNK where the UNK factors are not clearly identified
let me just finish off now by UNK what leads to the outcome and how a of a particular UNK condition and the combination of the factors that we think lead to these outcomes
i think the best analogy i can produce for you is that a balance in which various factors act on the side of the host and various factors act on the side of the organism and the outcome is disease and death if the organism wins out and outcome is resistance or recovery if the host wins out
and we could really add in for each organism in different weights the significance of each of the factors on each side
so for example if we took diphtheria we could say that the toxin was by far the most important and UNK factor and that if we knock the toxin out then the disease can't occur
and similarly on the host side we could say that UNK was the most important feature
in another example in tuberculosis we could say that the ability of the organism to persist inside UNK was the most important feature and that effective cell UNK immunity was the most important feature on the host side
so i hope i've introduced to you the very different styles by which UNK produce disease and indicated the balance of factors involved

recovery position right
now the m here is for mind and that includes obviously brain now we come on first of all to the head injuries head injury there is a brain now a pressure accident which involves the head
it could be a break this is the bone here supposing there is a break there pressing down on the brain that is a head injury this part here is the bolt by the way and that is a injury to the bolt of the brain just the top
the base of UNK injury is here when you get somebody with that base
can you see how thin that is there
it's very thick on the outside but almost you can almost see through some of the bone in the base there and that can be caused by as a blow on the head if it's the bolt of the erm brain that's caused got the injury or from the base of UNK is usually caused by er landing on your feet from heights and
