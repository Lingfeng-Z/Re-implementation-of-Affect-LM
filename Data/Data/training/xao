it's the shock comes up the legs if it doesn't break the UNK or feet or these it can break the bottom of the bone a piece here or it can travel up and break the base of the UNK
now either way obviously it's a head injury and must be dealt with but we're going to do an overall thing here by saying right now the next one on the list is UNK now UNK is shaking of the brain inside the UNK now there's UNK no room for anything but the brain inside that UNK so if that's UNK the brain hits against the sides of the UNK of the er bone and UNK so what actually happens here is the brain gets UNK and the nerve cells get damaged now you've all seen this con and it's so easily done UNK you can go through a whole list of things which can cause UNK road traffic accident sport construction working erm anything that erm heading ball football that's another one that erm you get quite a bit of UNK and of course boxing
mm
as we could as i was talking to our group yesterday well now that is the one game they set out to make a your partner unconscious by shaking the brain inside the UNK and that's what exactly what they're doing
a blow on the UNK don't forget the UNK is part of the UNK blow on the UNK the brain your casualty gets UNK and they go unconscious now how's your casualty going to feel
confused
they're going to be confused yes very confused i mean on the football pitch you usually get the trainer run man and they're talking to the UNK and it's looking at them all the time and he will ask questions erm what's your name
where do you live
what were you doing
how many fingers
that's it how many fingers
and all these are telling him whether the person is confused UNK or what whether he's able to go on alright erm check the memory because that is a good indication
if your casualty if you say to your casualty ooh what happened
how did this happen
and they say i can't remember it just happened so quick that i can't remember they have been unconscious for a it may be just a split second it's affected the brain they are UNK
so let's go through the signs and symptoms of UNK
they could have a headache depending on how it was caused they could be confused but not always and there could be that brief loss of consciousness and so you must check the memory recall if they do know what's happened well then go back a little bit further to see if they can remember what they did last night or something but erm make sure on that memory recall
now the face when you look at them they're going to be very pale cold and UNK the eyes well erm unless they're really into UNK they're possibly normal
you see with these signs and symptoms remember you don't have to have the whole lot a couple of them will give you an idea that this person is UNK
their breathing will become shallow and the pulse rapid and weak where's your casualty going
to the hospital
going to hospital now UNK will lead us very nicely have you finished that writing that yet
no
no not yet
UNK will lead us very nicely onto UNK and if anybody in your place of work has a head injury at all a knock on their head and they say most people do don't they
oh i'm alright don't worry about me i'm they the person at home their family must be told as well as you making a note in your accident book that there has been somebody with a knock on the head however mi minor it is it's got to be reported because that knock could have UNK it could have broken a small UNK in the brain it could still be bleeding and that is when UNK takes over
now a UNK is pressure on the brain caused by UNK or blood UNK now if a person has been suffering from UNK and it's gone UNK that UNK could be just carrying on and on and on and it could take up to four to five days before the UNK shows itself so perhaps a week later they're sitting down to breakfast saying ooh my head hurts now the poor wife or husband or whoever it is doesn't know about that knock on the head that they had previously unless somebody's told them about it mm so your casualty now is going to have this headache and a beauty they're going to be confused their levels of consciousness it will UNK face is very hot dry UNK the pupils will become UNK and because of the pressure breathing becomes noisy if you feel the pulse it's going to be slow and strong and you will get UNK on the opposite side to the UNK what are what are the signs and symptoms of
stroke
who
shock
stroke not shock what's the signs and symptoms of shock
pass the body for bad circulation
yes what's the signs and symptoms
pale isn't it basic
pale cold UNK yes this is the opposite you've got all the signs and symptoms here of a stroke now if this could go on with and erm if somebody if something isn't done very quickly with this UNK the person has still got this UNK or UNK in the head and eventually they just kind of all come up into the UNK position literally all goes UNK all these UNK movements right you finished writing
no
hang on a second
nearly
nearly
nearly
that's where it all comes confusing cos there is things in there which still UNK the shock in that as well as the other
there's the shock
yeah
right
right
yeah but you're going to look at your casualty
yeah
now there's no comparison in the pale cold UNK position that shock produces
no
to the hot dry UNK that the stroke and the UNK so there's the conditions there your UNK and your stroke will be identical signs and symptoms because you've got pressure on the brain UNK you will get all the sign and symptoms of shock okay
does it make sense to you
all in favour say aye how's that
right let's go on a bit further so we've just done UNK er the next one is an illness UNK now UNK two types you get the UNK which is the small fit and the grand UNK which is the erm large fit or the full fit
now anybody can have erm within the areas if you like our part no you don't have to have all the signs and symptoms to say that person has had an UNK fit
with UNK the small fit it used to called vaguely you could talk to somebody and then go on UNK away and then suddenly the person would switch off and then just UNK and then after a while they come back and talk to you and it's they pick up exactly where they've left off so as i say it used to be called day UNK now that's the low end of the scale now we go to the other end of the scale and remember please that there's no set type for an UNK anybody anywhere any age at any time can have an UNK fit you don't have to be that type don't
now what actually happens now as i say i'm going to the far end your casualty may literally UNK as they go down now this is the person that has no warning at all they may UNK as they go down and it's the air that's coming out of the body they will go rigid as every muscle UNK the teeth UNK the muscles go rigid erm and they're going to be very blue because erm because er they've stopped breathing which seems like an eternity
now at this st this stage usually the do UNK who don't know any better and put and insist that something should go in the mouth and it shouldn't you never ever put anything in anybody's mouth at all
somebody's car UNK gone off no right now this where lots and lots of people used to really UNK the person that was having a fit would absolutely go through hell because somebody at some stage had said oh you must put something in a person's mouth that has UNK
the answer is once they've UNK their teeth there's nothing you can do about it if their tongue is there i'm afraid it's just hard luck
tablets control UNK very well now and you can go for probably years without an UNK fit then all of a sudden erm somebody will think oh i'll try leaving off my medication and of course they have a fit
erm er now of course to get back to the ambulance erm if somebody comes out of an UNK fit and goes immediately back into another one then you must call an ambulance it takes so much from the person it takes so much energy that the person can't possible go into one fit after another erm without showing some affects and therefore you would have to get them to hospital if you don't and they have two or three fits one after another they can die so they must go to hospital
now if your person were to say come round said it's the first time they've had a fit you get call an ambulance it may be UNK but it could be anything else it could erm be the start of er something else in the brain because that's all an UNK fit is it's an electrical UNK nobody actually knows why or when or how it's caused but it happens erm but above all be very nice to your casualties they'll want to get up and they'll run away they want to get out especially if it's outside because they're embarrassed by it
now this is the time when you must watch them because it can take from two to two days two hours from two hours to two days to regain control of the brain depending on the person and if it's happens outside and they want to get away stress the fact you get up and run under a bus and they don't mean to obviously
mm
but they're not in control of their body so you must watch them talk to them and if you can walk along the road with them talking to them now the there is the other type where you get the UNK they know they're going to have a fit so if somebody at your work place comes along and says to you i'm gonna have a fit in five minutes i mean don't laugh at them and think ha take them to a room where they're safe and this applies to all UNK fits they've got to be safe so you're going to clear a room of any danger they're laying down on the floor UNK because they've got time they know they're going to have this fit if they've got something to put in their mouth alright they will put it in their mouths themselves and once again they've got five minutes to do it in and then that person will go through their fit you stay with them you comply by their wishes if they say to you right well just leave me when i come round i don't touch me i'll be alright they know so you comply by their wish wishes erm but only go in when you feel it is necessary if they say right erm i should regain consciousness in ten minutes and they haven't you're there you stay there in case make sure they're safe there's nothing there that can hurt them then they'll probably get up at the end of the fit and erm go into a room for a rest and say thank you very much and er erm that's it
right that's UNK
any questions
how do they what sort of UNK do they get that they know that they're going into a fit
erm sometimes they get a certain er UNK of something er you know an imaginary smell
smell
erm something may flash across the face you know eyes or whatever it's er an UNK that there is particular to them or peculiar to them
my husband feels as though somebody is co chasing him
yeah
and he says he's after me and he just puts his arm round me and then he's alright after that
yeah
and then he has a sleep for half an hour
that's right most people with UNK they're much better if they go to sleep and you don't wake them up if you wake the person up from a sleep that's just had an UNK fit they'll be UNK but if you let them sleep through it then erm then they're usually fine
right next one is poison must get a move on cos we're running a bit late so as we're going to UNK later i'll just go on to say here that there's four ways UNK can get into the body
you can breathe it in through the lungs you can swallow it through the mouth you can inject it through the skin and you can also absorb it through the skin
now breathing in erm UNK we'll go over this in more detail erm there's so many things as we've already gone through that can cause us UNK one of them's poison in itself isn't it
you've got to get your casualty from the cause but make sure it's safe for you now if it is a place where you've got to get your casualty out and you haven't got a UNK and i must express this really that there must be two of you and if you are going in you only go in if you think it is safe to go in and you must have a line attached to you and there's somebody outside so that if you do get erm overcome by fumes or whatever they can pull you out you are safe they'll see to you if there is no hope you don't try to be the hero what you do is go and make a phone call and get the professionals in because they don't want to come along and have to deal with two casualties when there's only one
so make sure it's safe take your casualty from the cause you may have to UNK now if a person swallows something by mouth there's two types of UNK one can go by mouth and one is er UNK and the other is non UNK but at the same time you have a liquid or tablets now if it's a UNK liquid that you have UNK or somebody has UNK it's burning as it's going down and may i say in first aid you never ever on any circumstances make anybody sick er especially UNK can you imagine if it's burnt going down it's probably UNK the food pipe and somebody comes along and UNK on the water because you can give UNK of water for UNK well it's because you're trying to keep the UNK open if it's burning UNK is burning you'll get swelling so this is why you give UNK of water but if you give too much your casualty will be sick and if it's burnt going down and UNK the tubes and they're bringing it up again it's gonna burn coming up and go into those UNK that and cause further damage
so what you're going to do with your casualty that's UNK poison is UNK of water while they are conscious don't forget nothing by mouth once anybody is unconscious and get them to hospital as quickly as you can
now if don't wait if you know somebody has UNK a poison whatever it is get them to a hospital don't wait for the signs and symptoms to appear get them to a hospital
now if it's tablets they've taken we don't do whatever UNK did years ago in UNK and then she's walked up and down and given gallons of coffee what you do is keep your casualty at rest nil by mouth because you if you give them any fluid whatsoever it's going to UNK dilute the tablets that are in the stomach and once they're UNK they've gone into the system quicker mm so there's nil by mouth now if you're going to get up and walk them up and down because come on you must walk up and down what's happening to this per these tablets
going into system
being pumped
they're being pumped around the body even faster so therefore that's going to take hold of the person faster so you keep them at rest into recovery position if possible and get help don't forget to er collect any evidence of what the poison is it must go with the casualty
now injection two types of people inject the drug UNK and the UNK
would you know if you came across somebody and erm could you tell the difference between a UNK person and the a per drug UNK if they were unconscious
smell their breath
smell their breath
proof of identification perhaps
you could look for identification if yeah
pupils
pardon
pupils
yes you could do but the point is the it's where a person UNK a drug UNK always UNK into a vein so therefore they get these pin marks over veins not necessarily the veins go between fingers and toes and wherever but they go into a vein where the UNK goes into the muscle into the arms round the stomach area or the UNK
now if you know that somebody is a drug UNK and they've just had an injection you keep away from them erm if they're having a bad trip whatever they call it because you don't they become very violent they can do a lot of damage now the only time you will step in and help is when they go unconscious but at the same time remember protect yourself we're talking about needles here and probably shared needles you must be terribly careful that you do not get UNK by a needle especially if they have a habit of sticking needles under UNK so always be aware of this if a person is a drug UNK in fact if you can find some easier way of turning them into the recovery position do so erm you can then obviously either call the ambulance
now the UNK i'll leave that for a moment because i'll do that in a moment erm the UNK usually UNK agricultural people that have dealing with ordinary UNK and all the other UNK that er are about today they're usually protected but sometimes either you get somebody in a garden with and using all these things and they don't read packets do they any more
they think ah look there's a bit of drop of water in there's a packet of something let's stick it in and UNK it up they never read a packet to see what it could do
now if somebody has got a load of chemical open and it is being absorbed you must protect yourself first if they are still conscious well then they will take off their own clothing you do not unless you have got protective clothing on
once they've you've got their clothing off they can probably stand in a shower but remember to take their boots off or whatever or shoes of because if you don't they're going to stand in a in a dilute solution of whatever it is that's being absorbed by the skin
anybody working with chemicals should know they are very silly to work with a chemical that they don't know what it could do the first aid treatment in fact erm anybody here work with chemicals
so you all know the correction regulations yes
and you know it from cover to cover
no
well i think you should because erm remember it's up to you should know
now if you're going to put somebody under a shower as i say be care be very careful that you're not UNK and get the ambulance on the way
some of these chemicals don't mix with water and this is why i did mention UNK because they are working in er conditions and with chemicals that probably don't mix with water but you should know what the UNK is yeah
yeah you spoke to you should be carrying the UNK anyway
yes erm no i won't spend any more time on that because we'll probably come back to that anyway
but now let me get onto UNK the other the other illness what UNK now UNK are very clean they know exactly where they're going to inject in fact they UNK because if they keep to one spot then it's gets a bit sore
now with UNK there's two types too much sugar and too little sugar now UNK erm UNK said to you erm is controlled by the UNK in the UNK in the stomach it throws out this UNK the liver throws out the sugar and i'm not going into actual detail but if there is too little UNK then it is allowing the liver to send out too much UNK so if the person has got this erm UNK that isn't churning out UNK or too little then your person will have sugar UNK
now the one we are going to talk about first of all is the too little sugar where your person has been UNK and they're taking UNK
now UNK meaning too little UNK sugar
this one comes on very quickly and this is the one you are likely to have to deal with
now say your UNK has UNK as they have done for a couple of years or so with their UNK injection in the morning and their breakfast and that's how they carry on then till their tea break or lunch time they know exactly how much they're taking
now they've come out the front door and the bus is running er coming down the road so they're running for that bus so they're using up their energy the UNK there but the energy level is going down
they get to work it started off one of these days didn't it so the UNK out of order and they work on the top floor so they've now got to run up all those stairs the energy is being used up
now gradually the energy level is so low that the in although the UNK level is there there's no sugar for it to work with so now your casualty will start showing signs of too little sugar
first of all they'll go very pale and they'll start sweating and the pulse will be very rapid and the breathing will be shallow now what are they going into
shock
shock but after a while their UNK start UNK and they become very confused now a person a perfectly nice person oh you know always very helpful and kind can suddenly become aggressive and they really do become aggressive and if they go to violence their strength oh where they get it from god only knows but they could literally throw a person across the room
now if you see somebody going into this state you must give them sugar it's no good waiting till they've UNK or become unconscious because you can't give them anything then can you
no
you can't give anything by mouth to an unconscious casualty because they'll you'll UNK them they can't swallow
do you have safety first they'll be able to throw you across the room
pardon
they'll throw you across the room
oh yes you'll probably have to get somebody else as well mm
now if you've had if you know you're a UNK and see this happening in the in the get this getting this the size
the shock go up to them and say you know have you had your right amount or have you taken some sugar and very often they'll pull up and ah yes i've UNK it
now if you've got sugar on you when you're out give them sugar four UNK of sugar and they're marvellous they come round just like that and erm then they'll got off and UNK themselves
as i say if they've gone unconscious then or UNK you've got to call an ambulance
see a chap at work he's sort of day dream you'll be talking to him and he's miles away
yeah
yeah
was that one of his signs of
yeah
yes but you knew
yeah but you had to sort of force him to go and take some
yeah oh you will yes
cos he wasn't interested in taking any
no but once he's taken it and then he's come round and erm he realizes what it's what he's done yeah
so once a person becomes unconscious remember they've got to go to hospital because they can only get worse right there isn't any enough sugar in that body to be able to work properly so they'll only get worse
they must go to hospital
now the other side the UNK that is too much sugar now whatever one it is if you don't know the difference the treatment is the same you will give sugar even though this person has got too much but this one comes on very slowly and quite honestly the person should realize themselves it's so slow
their skin will be very UNK and dry you'll get deep UNK and this is the one you'll get the smell of UNK not always you know the nail UNK smell the UNK drops and then from there they'll get they'll go into gradual i've put UNK there but gradual UNK treatment the same sugar if it's sugar they want they'll come round almost immediately if it's they've already got too much well you have that little UNK not going to make them any worse they've got to go to hospital anyway
if a UNK is unconscious urgently to hospital okay now that UNK by the way comes under the a of our UNK here which is an illness okay
any other and i put UNK in there asthma is an illness which erm you may come across it's the UNK up it's something UNK the tubes the UNK and the UNK tube and the person cannot draw air in well they can draw it in but they can't get it out and they're and they're trying very hard and the noise has anybody heard anybody with an asthma attack
yeah
you can hear them from a long way now what you do is you sit them down and let them take up their own particular position you can if they've got their medication their UNK or whatever you can put it beside them they will know if they need to take it or not get them with the fresh air and let them take up their own position which is usually leaning forward so that it UNK their lungs talk to them about something different because sometimes well they've got to think of what to answer you it's relaxing those tubes now if they're taking their medication and it doesn't work within about five minutes get them to hospital because the only people that really die with asthma are those that have taken medication and keep saying i'll give it a few more minutes give it a few more minutes and if they're getting worse and worse they're leaving it too long
so all as i say erm never used to be able to die with asthma there was but very few but now it seems to be more common because people are not going for help when they need it
right i think we've been going on long enough and i think you've been sitting there long enough ha
oh i'd suggest with respect that it should be included in a UNK to that affect so that the simple minded like myself when they see well cost value of as almost eighteen million and a present day value of twenty eight million and over and look again at twelve hundred and four pounds i say where is the money gone
i think if there's if there's a reason for not showing it there i think i comment to the bottom would satisfy most people
thank you
yes moderator the board's erm published accounts are UNK by some comments on the accounting UNK that are used
thank you
number three
number four
number five
number six
moderator
i was going to call you now because of the national health
but you've UNK me
i'm awake
and
i'm still five four eight
right
now don't be too surprised if this sounds like a question
now i've learned i've been since saturday as i told you and i've learned how to make a good question
now what you've got to do is use the correct words and phrases and these are finally
briefly
now i thought i knew what that word meant until i came to the assembly
it seems to me in conclusion important right a wee bit of background will help the assembly understand my being here
now i had a kidney transplant in nineteen eighty four
the assembly made a very good decision in nineteen ninety to support the transplant programme
the assembly passed it to presbyteries and they in turn passed it on through their UNK to ministers who in turn were supposed to pass it to sessions and it was supposed to be discussed at session level and turned down to ordinary UNK
now unfortunately that's how it should of worked but the message got lost down the line somewhere
now these messages remind me of the old UNK now you were all old enough now to remember the old UNK
in the old UNK they used UNK and they also used UNK and the UNK carried a stick they called it a UNK stick and it looks like the assembly might need a new set of UNK sticks
because these messages keep getting lost between here and the congregation
the kidney transplant waiting list could have been reduced remarkably if the church of scotland had done their job properly
now that is a good story for the press
it's not a bad one it's a good one
so finally briefly and in conclusion
this is where my question was coming i ask the convenor why the committee failed to follow up their good work by not promoting the kidney UNK cards through ministers to the congregation
now we let's say for instance we've got five hundred thousand members of the church and they in turn have a circle of friends and relatives of ten now you don't need to be a UNK to find out that's five million
so that everyone in scotland could have been covered and given the opportunity to carry a UNK card
now all churches should carry a supply of cards t at all their functions even the general assembly
and i'm not just quite finished because i was gonna put a wee p s in why don't we have the assembly at the s e c
because you've no stairs you've got no hills and you've got bags of wee places to put your motor
i i'm looking to see if dr 's there because if he were me or if i was him i would say what the commissioner UNK is neither known nor admitted
erm the board has not failed to follow up its very good work
in fact it has followed it up with an absolutely excellent study pack which has been very widely used within the church
it has followed it up because i personally and other members of the board and er and members of our staff have accepted UNK to go and speak to UNK conferences on human UNK
i've been as far a places as far apart as the UNK of erm UNK and UNK which is to what to south of scotland erm and i can't think of any corresponding place erm in the north but there have been places in the north that i've also gone to and this is my UNK card
and i commend this to the church and i and i'm glad the commissioner had a chance to come back and speak again about his concern about erm the waiting list for UNK
please carry a UNK card please discuss it with your relatives please discuss it with your congregation please ensure that in the event of tragedy UNK you your relatives know your views in advance on transplant surgery
and if it is your view that y your organs may be used in advance and if that's known to your relatives it'll make a very difficult time for them a great deal less difficult than it might have been otherwise
thank you
thank you very much
moderator i'd just like to thank the convenor
i hope you feel your intervention has been worthwhile and has borne fruit
i was proving to the convenor that i'd made a mark opposite that deliverance on which to call you
so he can prove it's true
can we pass then to number seven
on number eight dr has erm an addendum i think
er fifty five
moderator i've asked for this new clause to come in immediately after seven because of what in accepting seven we've just done
we have welcomed what the board are doing and we've encouraged them to find new ways of doing so more in meeting the needs of the elderly who increase in numbers here in scotland
now they cannot possibly do these things without becoming UNK aware as i am sure they are already of the problems arising through lack of financial er financial sufficiency or poverty among the old people
now let me read the words for the s benefit of those who don't have them add new section eight and rem UNK eight urge his majesty's government to give continuing and careful concern to the many situations in which lack of financial resources are still causing elderly people grave hardship
having read that i immediately UNK me in dust and UNK for having committed a dreadful UNK error
i was so caught up in my UNK or situations in hardship that i didn't notice that the subject in more senses than one is a UNK lack and the verb should be is and not are therefore i must ask the UNK of the general assembly to change the verb
i don't think it needs to go down under the barrier act
moderator it can't be very often that a young minister UNK a giant of the church in open assembly but it did happen several years ago
in fact if the previous speaker has complained about waiting in patience i have waited forty years to tell this story in the assembly because a young minister UNK a giant of the church dr john the UNK of national church extension
what happened was that he was a giant of the church indeed and he behaved as one
i remember UNK making a note at one assembly of the number of times he spoke and believe it or not the total was sixty seven
and i'm not setting that up as a record to be broken or a
or a target to be aimed at because when i saw the sixty seven i remembered it's the number of the song that begins lord bless and pity us
now how did a giant of the church get himself into such a position
in presenting the report to the national church extension committee he made the astonishing statement that there is no longer any dire poverty in scotland
now how on earth did he say such a thing
he was falling into the trap of the UNK of UNK his case
it was a good case he wanted us to remember that there's a UNK for the word of god and that what we should be worried about was poverty in the things of the spirit but he made the blank statement and it shocked one young man called john who at the time was the minister of a church extension charge in one of our deprived housing situations
he went straight out went to four families whose names immediately suggested themselves to him checked his facts and figures got in while discussion was still on and UNK the great john and gave him the facts and figures to prove it to tell him that he was wrong
what on earth has this got to do with my motion
simply this that any government of any colour at any level central or local and any organization charged with the responsibility of meeting the needs of elderly people which proceeds on the UNK assumption or makes the UNK assertion that there is no longer any poverty in scotland is requiring to be UNK because it is not true
i haven't used the word poverty i've used a phrase about lack of financial resources because it relates more obviously and directly to many of the concerns of the board for example almost certainly the real reason why there was no room in the inn at bethlehem is that the income of a village carpenter didn't go near the UNK prices being charged by mine host when to use the good scots phrase the cow UNK and there was this boom over the UNK for the census
in other words lack of financial resources can contribute to homelessness and it does
and in all our consideration about homelessness to which the report rightly refers we must remember that lack of financial resources is a UNK factor and how many in the assembly know that while we naturally think in homelessness of our tragic young people five per cent of the homeless are elderly
like the UNK scots sitting up in bed with his cap on in UNK royal UNK asked by the retired sister who visited people like him who had no friends how old he was he says ninety two
oh where do you live
central station platform six
contributing to homelessness
moderator if the board wanted a UNK saint my sole UNK would certainly be the good UNK cos he got it right
he was faced with a situation where he had to deliver a service to use the jargon of social work which has dropped into their report
he went not to collect particulars and feed them into a computer he went to get down on his knees and get himself covered in mud and blood
he did not qualify him for income support he supported him on to the back of his UNK he took him to the inn
he took care of him and the greek verb means that he literally took total charge of his case in other words he probably stayed up all night nursing him and so he made the inn into temporarily a nursing home and we're back into another area of the board's concerns
but he gave two pence how miserable can you get
but put the two pence in their contemporary context
we know from the parable of the labourers in the UNK that one penny or one UNK was an accepted whole day's wage for a twelve day in the heat of the sun in the great harvest so the two pence was the equivalent of two days' wages
now bring it back to the modern time of the five day week what is two fifths or what are two fifths of the wage
at the end of last year the national average wage in the manufacturing industries would give you for two fifths one hundred and fourteen pounds
what does a pensioner get
now a pensioner over eighty and in poor health possibly requiring special food that costs more certainly requiring extra heating in cold weather will get sixty three pounds twenty
and if anybody thinks that with reasonable budgeting you could manage on sixty three twenty i challenge you to do a little personal budgeting
you've got no savings you've got no relatives you can fall back on you have no other source of income and you've got to pay for everything off of sixty three twenty
so what in fact happens
i'm not going to leave you with statistics they don't get me any longer i've developed an immunity to statistics thank god
there are a hundred and seventy thousand people in scotland who qualify for income support whether they get it or not is not the point but that's the size of the problem
and what happens in actual human situations which are what get me and i'm going to give you three and i guarantee their UNK you will doubt them all i have not the least fear but i guarantee you their UNK they come from the records of age concern scotland of which i am the president
here are a couple who are doing very awkward cooking over an open fire because their cooker has packed in and they can get a new one only in terms of a loan which is UNK payable by deduction from their from their pension every week and they've a UNK dread of debt
here are a couple who must be just UNK in this kind of weather because when it's cold the only way they get warm is to take their shoes or boots off and go into bed in the early evening with all their clothes on
here is a little old woman in her upper eighties never been married no relatives UNK all her generation
her UNK is a UNK terrier called sandy and UNK is her UNK
sandy takes her for walks not the other way round
and because she happens to live reasonably near a park she walks sandy or sandy walks her in the park she meets other dog walkers and they are her human contacts
sandy means an awful lot in that old lady's life and she does occasionally reach the point when she's got so little money left that believe it or not she has to choose between buying food for herself and buying dog food for sandy
now don't say it's a silly UNK story that's what poverty means in real terms to actual people
three years ago when the new regulations came into force the then secretary of state for social security said this means the end of the era of poverty
now john was not afraid to tell somebody as great as john that he was wrong and i see no reason why this general assembly should be afraid or inhibited about telling the authorities that they are wrong
if and when they work on the UNK assumption or make such a UNK assertion as that there is no longer any poverty because it is not true and unless and until it is true neither they nor we have got any right to be content
is that seconded
seconded
the convenor i think is willing to accept this
yes moderator
erm er i'm very grateful to dr and i'll offer him another story a woman who's now died whom i used to visit who sat with her coal fire set but not lit until someone would come to the door
she'd always say she'd just put coal in the fire
that kind of situation dr is entirely right to say to the general assembly that kind of situation is utterly UNK it's utterly UNK
next year i'll report to the general assembly erm if all things are equal that the board will by then have set up a scheme to allow care workers to go out from our erm residential establishments into the community to extend the kind of professional service that we're able to give in our establishments to people who live in the community
that's something that will need to be financed and it's something which the board will need to find the money to do
i in no way want to resist dr 's erm er addendum i hope that the general assembly will simply erm accept it by UNK
will the assembly accept it
thank you
then we pass to number nine
yes please
thirteen twelve
visitor delegate from the christian church disciples of christ in the u s and canada
it appears that there are many points at which er we can identify with one another or i have found that i can identify with the church and its social responsibility in this country because of our experience in my country
the cut back of social services by public agencies has meant for us and i'm sure for you er the church becomes more and more important in helping people survive and live more fully
in erm our situation dedicated persons on the front lines have found themselves overwhelmed by increases in human needs and UNK resources with which to meet those human needs and so we've tried to get innovative and do something about it
in our particular ministry in st UNK we are trying to use the vast technology that's available to us in linking up with other organizations such as catholic charities salvation army and others so that when persons are in need of help they can go to one organization and tell their story and they don't have to keep going from place to place telling their story over and over and we're beginning to look UNK the use of computers and what they are capable of doing in order to help resources stretch
and i think the kinds of er UNK expressed in item nine erm in which service delivery and the changing needs of individuals and the regular personal UNK demand that kind of er linking and working together
there is also technology available which can link organizations throughout the world and so that when er the church in one place UNK a resource or a way to work with people around a particular need they have the opportunity to share that and i would be interested in talking with persons who might have an interest in that
a man came to us for food recently but he also needed spiritual counselling
he was on the point of taking his own life because he was depressed over his ill health and at the in the church one can find spiritual food and physical food together and in our country that's about the only place where you can find those two together
later he said to me that we had been very helpful to him and he said it's bad enough to be depressed but when you're depressed and hungry it's really bad
i think that the church has the responsibility to continue to find new and innovative ways of reaching out and doing a better job and that is er testimony to the fact that we can continue to reach out to persons who are suffering in many ways and i would appreciate and look forward to learning better from you how to do that and would be happy to share
thank you very much
pass to number er ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen
please
i wish to inject an addendum in deliverance fourteen after the words each other helping each other to continue to mature add the words christian worship together is seen as a priority
moderator in the course of my lifetime i believe one of the big changes within a family has been the fact that grace is no longer said at meal times
in so many of the homes that i visit that is UNK clear
perhaps it's a small thing but it's a UNK of other things and a reflection of the importance given to god and christian principles in the home
i believe christian worship within the home and with the family together should be seen as a priority and therefore i'm not satisfied with the UNK comments earlier on in answer to my question
i believe if this is indeed a statement about the christian ideal of marriage then we should put worship at the very centre of it
shared worship UNK increases the trust and security which the words that follow my suggested addendum make clear
in this context of trust and security they engage in sexual relations
i believe that christian worship together is a vital and important place where such trust and security and the UNK can be built up
the only christian element of this ideal this christian ideal is the mention of the word god in the promises made at marriage
how UNK it is that so often in the UNK that we come across those are the only promises that seem to be made and the only mention of god within the family
my contention is that god and christian principles need to be set explicitly and UNK at the heart of this declaration of ideals
we heard the other day from professor about the importance of a UNK mother
i would add to that the importance i am not a sexist of a UNK father
i think it's very important that we should make clear
eighteen ninety seven in 's yard which was at in derbyshire
and what caused your move to you to move to nottingham
well dad he did some drinking
he was on the police UNK
he got that way if he wasn't drunk on the days he should have been UNK they used to trip him up
and as i said he gets UNK and he left derbyshire and come down to nottingham to work

and that was where the stables was
we went rating UNK there with UNK and dogs
and there were some rats in those days
now they look as if lean and built a where pit was built close there

that was n that'd be er about nineteen thirty
when they got them
of course i was working there in nineteen thirty three
but in between that we e we were dad was w going by train from wh to
that used to cost one and six a week for six days there and back
mind you it were like all wooden UNK
c they used to call them the horse boxes
but er when i as soon as i was fourteen i walked to and started working next day
i walked from mill to get that job
mind you they brought me back
who brought you back
in well it were done you know one fellow get on with that

mm
and how much were you earning when you started
when i first started i were getting fourteen shilling a day
that was when i was fourteen
and getting nearly as much as a man got in some
that was that must have been a lot of money
mm
that was quite a lot of money then wasn't it
oh it was a lot of money was
mm
well when i left there and joined the army i was getting twenty seven shillings a week
i used to give my mother the lot she used to give me a shilling back
and if i had anything left at monday she used to borrow it forget to give it me back and
i could always ask me mother if i wanted anything
mm
how much was your a father earning at this time
oh about seven and six a shift
so i mean
that was top price
before you started work were the family fairly poorly off then
well i was selling papers when i was ten years old ten years old
in nottingham
and we used to be selling them at midnight
well after so long they brought the brought those passes out for all news boys to have them
well when i had that used to cost sixpence but you'd got to be properly dressed afore you went i tell you
that's how i got that UNK suit
trousers coat shoes and stockings
when i when i when i finished from papers and er started w other i went into in a into er 's bottle washing

and UNK picking
we used to get a shilling a day for that
and how often how much work could you get on a farm then
eh

how many days a week
well i used to go about everyday
mind you went early in the morning and come home late in the afternoon
some of the farmers were working till nearly midnight when it was harvest time you know
would this be still while you were at school

would you be UNK the day off school then
well when i was thirteen i supposed to be having b bad trouble and i went to doctor's and instead of knocking off school at waiting till i was fourteen i'd finished at thirteen
i didn't bother going to school again i just didn't
and i'd been to top standard as it was then it was standard seven and as the er you know now they let when the when they've somebody in so long they let them walk about and come home and all so that time of day you got to you'd got to pass UNK and exams and such like as that
and er of course as i tell you i finished when i was thirteen years old and i was on this er bottle washing UNK and o one chap as lived next door to us back at er at road he got me his this job on the farm
i went er UNK and then er one day they got to go hay making and of course i cou i had UNK to do then
but i walked in one day and he says you'd ge better bugger off home he says
that was one form finished
next day i started another form they were doing bird UNK you know UNK the birds on the fields
that was all round UNK 's place at
i'd been in and the east fields at
you used to get a bob a day for that
what did i tell you i'd have finished off bottle washing then i got this when i was fourteen i walked to and got there
well the first job they had there was clip i was on cl down below on in the pits
there were no training you needed for this that and the other you went down
and the they give me as light a job as they can you know
they used to have a UNK get the UNK to hang them on the wagon another bloke took clip off
well the clip is about like that see two sheets like that with a UNK there and a handle here
the handle is up when you hold it and you hook the UNK you hang it on bottom of the wagon
underneath the clip it's like a that fitted on the
well when he'd cl er UNK it on the wagon he puts that clip on and he press down that arrow
that grips the rope takes the wagon along in the one at a time
when i'd been there so long next thing was UNK on
that was taking the UNK off and UNK the wagons on
stop so long in the pit bottom like that is
mm
how were the UNK transported
were they did pit ponies pull the pull the wagons
no
they those wagons were sent up and then the UNK the pit ponies at the far e far end of the pit
you see that were end of the rope was what we call a endless UNK
it used to run round right around and same as your UNK do now
it works a way round see
they take the UNK to the end and bring the full ones this road
and you get so much time taking the strips one running them down
and i got the job of going up then they sent me up knocking th knocking the wagons off
and putting UNK on at the far end
what did you have to do for this job
what did you do for this job
what did you do did you say
well after doing the UNK wagons on i went the other end er cl er knocking UNK off
well as i told you at you used to clip them that damn short and we when i was knocking them off i had to keep UNK down let the UNK and keep knock UNK off and chuck the one side and then the wagons came down they went down the hill like that and then up here there was a hook line to stop them
as that com they c them coming like the they did you'd no time to
course two UNK sat up at er back end at that end there
of course and i back
mind you i'd been running er UNK running the tail route that's another route as you meet on er goes onto a gate on the left hand side where you got wagons about eight wagons put it put them back UNK this rope at the back
and the line they're running down like that
they're going they're going some too i tell you you'd got to keep your head down
used to take them down run them in one gate and next day you go a bit further on
alright after you perhaps took wagons down and put into that place where you and find the old ones in that room where your wagons are you see
and that's how it worked
like er a motor e electric motor that wagon up
and some in tail room
that's instead of er UNK them on they used to b instead of UNK them on the back you used to rope at front and one at back see
and it's drawing the wagon you've got control right the way through
well with the others it used to have to brake if it were going too fast you had to brake up a bit
put the brakes on
when you get too much when you'd been er a little bit longer you'd perhaps go UNK
that with the ponies
and we used to have a box lamp
and that was fi filled with
i don't mind telling you used to get some UNK glasses broke
mind you in those pits in it was a safe pit
you know we had we had the UNK lights or these box lamps
and we kept of course they carried er safety lamp to test for g er for any gas at all
after that after he this deputy had UNK me and i UNK back at him and they put me er UNK me for a for weeks you see the UNK er the manager i says i'm not i'm not stopping
so i went and left i got a job at which that was one of 's
whereabouts was
why it lay down er just down the road as you turned down to it used to be across the fields
well it's a place you couldn't it was practically UNK stopped in the fields
of course dad worked at the other pit that was where he lived
it was er what they called a tunnel pit
a we had to walk down but he used to when he was younger he used to break the ice up formed in before they could run down
and when i when we went to i was i was running a four lad for another fellow
we used to one at a time
and that UNK that pit got flooded out
mm
running a four lad
what did you what did you have to do
mm
being a four lad what did you have to do
what was your job as a four lad
just opening doors and let getting in the front letting it come by with th h ho horse and that see
so it was UNK coal in and out of the pit
it was UNK the wagons
no UNK it on to the main road so they can took it to the pit UNK
they didn't have a endless UNK cos i don't think they'd keep one going
it was always got too much water to deal with
mm
a lot of the men had come from this pit where dad worked
so as soon as er i walked they said eh up
that was what they used to call me dad
they knew cos these were the chaps that used to live at
and they were working at this pit
it's just afore you get to
mm
between er and
but nearer
well when we when we got flooded out i went and saw the man the manager at
and er he told me i could start and if i could relieved from the other pit so i went and saw the under manager at and i says aye he says you can go
so i started at
er the boss the manager his name was bob
he had he short UNK or something he was very
he was er you know he used to UNK a lot
i we had a under manager come he come from somewhere down UNK way and y you you've talked about UNK and UNK they used to call him UNK he was just like one of them

er up to nine and in nineteen eighteen the end of nine the end of nineteen eighteen th it was
well i tell i started back in
i said to me mother when we start go to work monday holiday tuesday go to work wednesday and UNK and holiday thursday and then friday
i did
i went to work monday and i couldn't get out come downstairs for the week i was that stiff
but the promises with work that we had when we went in the army you j you'd be looked after we got the worst damn place anybody could
i had to walk three mile to work doubled up when you got so far down
you was boiling with sweat before you started work
was this three miles inside the pit
underground
yeah
from so from the pit head down to the face
from the from the pit bottom underground it was three mile to walk
and it were about that height
now up about five or si about five foot up in height
you had to bend down when UNK walking down
would this be the top hard UNK
you'd be working the top hard UNK would you
no this was
it was it was erm main to er to london
it was household coal you know real good coal
top the hard coal was next shaft to what ours was
we the both together you could g you could go down either shaft but you had three doors to come through from one pit to the other
and it we tried to open all three together sometimes you know
it used to cause a hell of a me a hell of a draft
well i worked there and then er quite a bit i had to w they had me working on the main road
i u i went in one there was like a junction as come from pit into
the towards th pit bottom like
i had to run them UNK out and i tell you the they come over the top of and of course 's coming up here 's coming down here and did meet there
and the office was just here
of course the UNK bosses were always there and he was a right a right fellow you know he was he got UNK at they couldn't stand him
one of them sort
he'd swear at you
and if you UNK back at him it was alright
he used to forget it
do you remember his name
UNK
he finished up at but he was the under manager at
and that was er under john was the manager and er i tell you UNK come and he started UNK at me and i says i didn't m ask you for your bloody job so next er next morning when they goes he they had they had me walking the rope
i had to see as the wagons in the UNK as it shifting not falling off you see
when you were walking the rope there's so many of you UNK you walk so far t till you meet another fellow h he goes on and you come back
and they do that all day long
s see that everything's going backwards and forwards
this particular day he comes round to me he says take this lamp he said bugger off down there he says and thou can the coal i'm coming
so i do and do his lamp job
it's just that just how i had to be
see if you if things weren't well he'd swear at you
well if it wasn't your fault you'd swear back which i did
in fact before when i was tha when i was young i was i met th i were on night shift meself UNK
and the manager the un the deputy met me he says and i were just going down main road at nighttime as me dad were coming up
and this deputy says oh alright george
i says aye i says yes but look what th that look at this bloody thing
and that's as what i UNK
you could lift his UNK up like that and you'd see his brain working
and me dad was walking that way
and he heard me
i didn't know till the next we er till the weekend and he made me know as i'd UNK
he could swear but i hadn't got to do
not and let him hear it
of course he finished up in the pit w in with his eyesight
can you tell me a little bit about your family
what did your father do for a living
my father was a miner all his life
well i say all his life er early in the early days he was er a groom to a UNK surgeon in manchester
and er course i don't know a lot about his early life cos er i was young to remember it
and er what pit was he at
he w er he was in er at UNK
he worked at UNK pit when they were came to this district and then they came into the UNK common district and er and then er we moved from UNK common and he went to UNK for a short while only from erm probably eighteen months to two years that's as much as did there
and er we lived at a village called UNK near heath there then we moved back from there he moved back to er UNK again
and mother kept a shop a sweet shop on UNK opposite where they eventually built the UNK empire
and what did your father do er as a miner what was his job
he was a UNK on the coal face
and what did that UNK
that en UNK employing men to get the coal and er he was responsible for the wages he was paid by contract the amount of coal that er he produced his stall produced
you see
and er from that he paid his men a wage and er if there was any left over that was his
and
and
and er
s
and on friday on that friday mother used to go to UNK hall to collect the er the wages that my father had to pay out to the men
and then he'd bring that home you see
she'd bring that home and er the men would all UNK then round the table at home and he would pay them out
and sometimes he had to go upstairs to fetch some of his own money to put to it to pay them out
that was before there was a minimum wage
and what sort of wages were they getting
do you know
well i i'd couldn't really swear to anything of that description but it was it was before the er old age pensions came out because i remember my grandmother lived with us and er i remember the first week that she drew her five shillings old age pension
when would that be
nineteen eleven
yeah something like that
was i think nineteen eleven
er that was at the time of er king edward the seventh s it was time of his death wasn't it
i think
er at that time too it was er we the UNK of the UNK
the ship within a ship
i remember as a kid hearing of all this er how the UNK on her maiden UNK the ship within a ship
yeah
to come back to your family a little bit erm did you have any brothers or sisters
oh yes
yes there's a i had two brothers and one sisters
and of course the old joke goes like er i got two brothers and each brothers got a sister and i've got a sister
er were they older than you
younger than you were
er no er i was the second eldest
er my eldest brother now is eighty two
i'm eighty
my younger brother is er seventy eight tomorrow and my sister is seventy two
er could you tell me a little bit about the schools you went to
what school did you first go to
i started school to er UNK school on UNK lane at UNK when i was two and a half
my brother used to take me
and er i stayed there at that school until nineteen hundred and twelve
and have you got any memories of that school at all of teachers what they were like
perhaps
or the lessons you had
we used to on a monday when it was wash day we used to have to take sandwiches for dinner and we used to have to eat it under the shed in the school playground
can always remember that
and er i know er we used to put er i er kind of er bit of er play on once a year there
and er i got UNK into it one year because i had to stop in for something or other that i course i hadn't done but
and er i was pulled in to take a little part in this play er i remember that
what play was that
erm it was about it was about UNK and it was when UNK were in the very early stage
and there was a song i can't quite can't quite remember it now
what the song was that we had to sing on this stage with it
and i used to go to the methodist chapel that was opposite the school there
and er i joined the band of hope there and i signed the UNK
what was that
what was the band of hope
it was a s er like a sunday school bible class
er and er i say i signed the UNK never to touch UNK which i kept for until i was thirty five
i was thirty five before i ever touched a drop of UNK
and erm er have you got any other memories about your school can you remember any of the teachers
yes erm a the er headmaster at d UNK at er at er UNK schools was then mr
his name was mr
he was a very strict man the headmaster cos i remember one little incident that i thought was rather harsh
er they used to march us round the playground you see and er i was in the back row and of course the teacher was at the front more or less
and er i was dragging behind a few UNK and the headmaster was watching out of his study window you see
and er he called me in i had the cane for that and i had to tell the mess boy
and what about the kind of lessons you ha you had
what sort of lessons did you have
well we had slates then i can remember we had slates and er we used to have arithmetic lessons and er history
i can remember those sort of things what we used to have to do
but er it was only u until i left the school cos i was only a matter of eight when i left that school so er i wasn't in a it wasn't in any progressive sort of style then i mean we wer it was more UNK of education that we were taught and er
what where did you move to when you moved from that school
we moved from there to UNK
and why was that
we moved dad came to UNK pit
by the way they UNK pit they cut the first sod the year i was born nineteen oh two
and er little history of that was sunk by some UNK and they reckon they UNK the UNK they UNK that pit without the aid of a UNK bob how true it is
a german firm UNK the b the b UNK there's a er the what do they call it
the UNK the UNK
that was water and the german firm sunk the UNK that while they went through it
but coming back we moved again as i say and it was in the er winter
and it was a terrible winter that winter there was about a foot of snow on the ground and i remember UNK moved us with er a pair of horses and er and er a little removal van
and i can i can vividly remember now coming along UNK road towards UNK from UNK and seeing all the telegraph wires hanging down pushed down to the floor broken with the weight of snow
and that was i it was as i was saying in early january
er that was in nineteen hundred and twelve that was
and twelve or eleven nineteen UNK i either eleven or twelve
do you remember your school once you had moved
then i moved from
th er i went into er the board school at carlton
opposite the UNK head pub
went in there and a mr he was the headmaster then nice chap
but you see i got a vivid UNK hair real red you see
so consequently every time i moved school moved into different i had to fight me way there for the first week because i hated anyone to call me UNK you see
so
yes
and erm
i didn't stay at that school long before i moved down to erm the er tins school on UNK street
that was a series of tin UNK iron classrooms that was and the first the first teacher i had there was a mr and he got a real fierce face and a fierce UNK and he was a r a right lad he was
and in the he he'd give you the UNK if just lifted your fingers up
and we used to there at there at that school every morning we UNK to line in the in the playground and he used inspect your hands for UNK and your shoes
your shoes always had to be clean UNK you see
but our trouble was that to get to it we had to we had to walk across the recreation ground and there was the river UNK the UNK it was and w we couldn't resist the temptation of jumping across this UNK you see
so we were always in trouble for appearing w we got dirty shoes you see
so we evolved a brilliant idea of hiding a brush in an old tree at the end of the UNK so that we could brush the dirt off afore we got there
but that was that was quite a good school went through there via a mr he was a very nice teacher very efficient and he didn't believe in the cane he didn't
he er he believed in other punishment lines and that description but er i liked that chap er very nice chap
and that was the headmaster there was mr he was
and from there we moved to the secondary school that is now at station road at UNK it was a new school brand new school built er purpose built
and er we the tea the class all the boys it were all boys er we had to carry each carry a chair up to the new school
and erm UNK er th that was quite a quite a good school quite a modern school but i i'd er i'd er i wasn't able to stay there long because i was approaching my thirteenth birthday you see than
i did go to night school there to learn UNK
they used to have a UNK class there
but er i went from there er i er i was thirteen on august the twenty fifth nineteen fifteen
that's right
and of course we broke up we broke up on the first of august er for the er month holiday you see
but er i'd er got a job
don't know how i got it when my father got it for me
in the offices at UNK pit and i started work on august the third
that was three weeks before i was four thirteen then
in the in the time office
and er and there er i began to learn what the what things were beginning to happen in the coal fields
from right from the time office er i used to go into blacksmith shop to UNK tea because that's where we used to we used to be able to go and take the UNK for the UNK and i was in the stores too and er UNK the tea in the UNK they put the kettle on the UNK you see
and i UNK the tea and made it and a fitting shop was there too
er
what did you actually have to do
when you worked in the time shop
er well i was in the time office in the first place the men used to er cl check in they used to bring the checks you see brass checks numbered
and i'd got a board with all the numbers on and UNK you see
and as they came along we used to have to hang these checks on the number you see
and then the UNK could mark down that they were present they'd gone to work that day you see
and of course that was the wages book that was made up out of that
and er and they the afternoon shift used to come on and i used to have to carry all these checks across then the yard and take 'em and hang 'em up in the in the check weigh on the pit top where they weighed the wagons of UNK
the tubs of coal not the wagons
and er i used to have to prepare the er the er timber er orders for the men in the stall down the er down the pits
the UNK had prepared er they'd er there'd be a stall say erm n nineties or like that might be and the order for them would probably be twelve four foot UNK and twelve bars you see
that was a timber prop and a timber half a prop for a bar to carry the roof
but my instructions were that what the deputy ordered and i used to make a book up for the UNK to prepare these
and my instructions were that i used to either let them have two thirds of that or a half you see
t er cutting costs
and what were your wages for that
seven and sixpence a week
that was good that was
what
g good money that was
what hours did you do for that
er i used to get there at six o'clock in the morning
six o'clock in the morning till four o'clock in the afternoon
ten hours yeah
and y you worked how long did you work f at the ti in the time office
in the time office i worked that till i were i did about er seven or eight months in there and from there i went on the screens
were the screen they call 'em
we had to pick the bind out by hand er the coal was all er sorted on the screens and er a u us lads we used to stand at the side of the belts that were travelling round and UNK the coal into the wagons down below you see
and we used to have to pick the bind out you see
out of the coal as it came by
and er you see you weren't allowed down the pit till you were fourteen
you'd got to be fourteen
of course the temptation er had got to be er we'd got to earn money erm so er father insisted that down the pit after you're fourteen
as soon as you're fourteen down the pits you go you see
and er i went into the high hazel UNK
which is a four hundred yards and it was an inset the top hard UNK was ninety yards lower down at the four hundred and ninety yards to the and the high hazel used to have an inset
you see the cage used to go down to that and it used to you see the f the four for you to get off you see
and
yeah
get on
pardon me
and er that's how it was when they were running the coal on tubs of coal onto it
and er another thing that used to happen though if anything happened to that shaft you see
er there used to be a an UNK to the other shaft you see there was an UNK shaft that was all UNK in that was the top hard that went down four hundred and ninety yards you see
now if anything had been wrong with this shaft we used to have to go to the other shaft and ride that rope you see
but there was no facilities for running on you see and when we had to ride that one the chair would come down to this inset ninety yards you see
but it was about anything like two to three feet away from the side of the and they used to drop a plank down you see
and you had to run along the plank to get on
and there were a ninety yard dr drop but er had it happen it very often of course but it was rather UNK when it did happen
and wha what did they pay you for this then
now what was i on
i wer i started on ten shillings a week there down there at er fourteen
ten shillings a week that was
and you worked different hours
yeah i worked six till two
six till two that was
and i worked in the pit bottom for a start for about three or four months in the pit bottom
you see coal used to come down one UNK and the and it used to knock the UNK off two UNK off you see
and there was catches on the chair and you used to be ab a lad used to stand there and he used to pull a lever and he used to level these catches and the tubs would run off and then as two ran off he'd let it go and it would catch the UNK you see then
and one of my jobs was to push these UNK round and round
the empty tubs
the empty
yeah
tubs you see
to go away off up into the workings again
and what was the sort of clothes you had to wear down the pit
did you have any safety
well
equipment
we used to have mole skins mother used to buy mole skins because er they wore very well they did
but er a UNK shirt and mole skins but er that was while you were in the pit bottom you see
and er you see the air used to come down our shaft
our shaft was open all open the other shaft was all UNK in and there was a huge fan you see
just below the surface of that shaft and that's that used to draw the air down our shaft all around the workings you see
and back up this other shaft you see
well i went from the pit bottom i went er stake UNK then
with a horse i had a horse then and er there u there used to be er there used to be three or four of us there with horses and we used to the from the coal face there used to be all individual horses bringing odd tubs into a UNK what we called a UNK which was a collection of different tubs you see
the full tubs
and then that was a short UNK that was so that one horse called spring his name was he was a UNK he was
he used to bring these tubs down into a long UNK
well our UNK was a lot longer than his so he could keep three horses going you see
and there was captain and my main UNK name was UNK
i forget what the other one's name was
but er we used to bring these tubs then down from there on to the main road where the rope the UNK rope travelled you see
and he'd clip them on the clip them on the rope and take 'em to the pit bottom
but er that was happy days
in your er early days so you remember any accidents down the pit
not er not while i was on this on that job
except that horses used to get killed
we used to i know er old captain he came down as tubs came onto him and broke his neck and he er funny part of that it was
one week he broke the record he pulled f he brought forty tubs down and then the following week he got killed and he'd only got seven on
and did it did you move on from that job
i moved on from that then i was fifteen then and me dad was he was a UNK and er so er i had to go on the face then
cos i was fifteen you see
the coal mines act said that i shouldn't go on the face until i was sixteen but er the war was on
it was er nineteen seventeen you see
and so nobody thought about UNK the coal mines act you just had to go and er and i went
and er the old man they used to call him the iron man and he was the iron man
and i'll never forget him the first shift i went on afternoon shift
quarter to three till quarter to ten and er we came out of stall at quarter to ten at night
i'd been loading for him loading the t coal into tubs and UNK them
and er he was rubbing the coal off his back and was stripped there we used to be stripped to the waist then
and er he stretched his arms and he said ooh he said my UNK come and i said er ee yes i'm afraid mine's come as well my UNK come
and that i had the nerve and the cheek the UNK to be tired at fifteen years of age i it wasn't possible
and i thought he'd have UNK me
and what did you have to do on the pit face then
well you i had to load for h for him you see at first
er he'd get the coal you see
and er and then i'd load it up into the tubs and tram it out into the gate
and then the horse would come bring me two or three empty tubs in you see
and take the full tubs out you see that's how they used to work it
and how did he get the coal
hand got all hand got then
we used to hole you used hole underneath it lie on your shoulder and er hole underneath the coal and er wedge it off
what sort of tools did you use
we used to have a pick er that was a UNK that had a slot in it and you had a pick shaft with a box and er a an iron box on the top
and you used to put the pick UNK into it and it was a piece cut out of it th the UNK you see
and er then you had a UNK that you drove in underneath it and it secured the pick because
every night you've got to take those UNK out of the pit and have them UNK you see
and there used to be a man had a little UNK on the top a chap named an old man
and you used to pay him i don't know how UNK it was a week now
but you used to have to pay him once a week for UNK your UNK you see
you used to with three or four UNK in time what we see
and er drop them in the in the UNK shop and then when he'd finished with them when he'd done 'em they'd all be in a tub down at the pit bottom
and you'd go and sort your bundle out you see
and carry them in
what other tools did you use any
hammer and wedge and shovel
hammer and wedge and shovel
and it UNK never had any shot firing
oh ye i it all depended if you needed er shot firing
you see coal used to lie in er different UNK what we called UNK white UNK and yo you had to get your coal line what we call half and half running in half and half
if it was head on it was UNK to get the coal you see
if it was flat on it was the same because he's got to go right through to the UNK before he could get anything you see
oh we used to hole underneath the coal and er and then er oh we used to have a UNK that was a long steel UNK that you could put behind the UNK in the UNK and lever the coal off you see
with it
there's an art in getting coal
but er aye it was very much an art
what about things like lighting in the pit what did you do for lighting
we had oil lamps then we only had oil lamps they hadn't invented electric lamps then
and you i mean you're gonna get you're only about four foot high you see
and you had to carry your lamp in your teeth you see
and on your belt when you're walking and you had a lamp hook which was got a very sharp UNK on it you see and when you was working er UNK you'd stick it in a prop you see
and they'd hang up you see
erm that's how we used to work that is
and it all depended on where you were now i remember one time we were working and er both ends were in you won't know what that meant
but you see the we'd got no stall that end open to us and no stall that end and the gate was down but we working to UNK to get some fresh air through from there
and er i remember we used to get the gas then and er that was at a time they were used have an electric lamp we had one in the stall you see
one electric lamp the others all be the UNK would have the electric lamp and he'd also carry an oil lamp for testing for gas and er i can remember going nearly a whole shift having to carry this lamp right down on the floor carry it up into the heading you see
and when you got into any gas a blue flame used to come on the top of your lamp pop gone
back you'd go then to the we used to have a machine then an electric box affair that used to put your lamp in it would set your UNK at a certain angle that there wo made a UNK and when you'd close this up it caused a UNK that would light your UNK again you see
and what about was there UNK safer ways for testing for gas
for fire damp
only UNK
but we didn't have any UNK
no they only had them the er rescue operations rescue men
did you have any safety equipment
at all
ooh no
no we didn't have any safety equipment
now
i remember being in one time with both ends in like i were talking about and we haven't got a road out we matter of fact we were trying to break through to another district
and er the gate end came in that's where the gate men and er we were trapped in there were three of us and we couldn't get out and we were there ooh about twelve hours before they managed to get us out
and er i remember one chap he were a bit scared very much so and oh dear he'd only been within other bloke a chap a chap from what was his name now
i don't know
he
so of course i had to take my lead from him i was only UNK then
but er we got out eventually and they managed to get a road through to us and but er and er i remember another time where a bank came in and they were one man trapped in the far end and there were another man trapped on this end and my brother and me we dug round to him we got to him we got him UNK so far and what to his waist and it was still UNK and we got hold of his belt right ready
now pull
you see
and we'd pull and his belt broke you see
and we shot backwards and down it all come again killed him
if his belt hadn't broke we should have got him out
but er the other chap at the other end his name was bob
er they managed to tunnel in for from the other end to him and er his UNK gone white
oh er
now what about the trade union were you involved in the trade union
well we had
miners' association
notts miners' trade union then and a matter of fact me dad was o on the committee he was a committee member of that on that
but erm we used to have a little shed a little hut in the pit yard where we used to go and pay our dues every week
how much were the dues
only thruppence a week dues were UNK me
and er another thing we had as well that the union had ar had er fixed for us and that was a family doctor
and we used to pay the old man used to pay thruppence a week for the family doctor you see
so we never had any UNK bills
the man used to come round and collect that a chap named
he used to come and collect that and er but er the union well we were alright a chap named he was the secretary and er and jack he was the president and me dad were on the committee there were several of on the committee
and we did get on reasonably well with the management then u until we used to run into trouble of course and er the er nineteen twenty one strike i can vividly remember that it was a glorious summer dead against us nobody wanted any coal and it you had the it gave th the management the opportunity of selling all this all the old stock all the rubbish and everything
clean the there used to be huge stocks leading right up to UNK pit of this slag and stuff and they sold all that off and er that was the year that fought and al broke his thumb on him
and y that was the year i met d th i met the wife in that in june of that year
but er it was a tough struggle that was
we did get a bit of u of er union pay then i couldn't tell you how much it was but it wasn't very much but er
and why did you go out on strike in the first place
well you see i was nineteen and er really i don't really know why the nineteen twenty one strike was
except that is was for money i know it was for money but er i don't know the exact er because i think i think in that year we got what we called the samuel award that were three shillings a day basic you see
if you only worked half a day you got the three shillings samuel pay you see
we got that
i were i were er we won that
it was quite a long strike them was
two year three or four months that strike lasted
while they got cleaned up
and that strike was lost
pardon
wo that strike was lost was it
it was a it was lost er no i don't think it was entirely lost not the twenty one strike wasn't entirely lost
did we go i er i'm now i'm pretty sure we went home for a seven and a half hour day in twenty one pretty sure that's what one of the things that we did
seven and a half hour day that was the idea
and the same wages
i think you'll find that was the twenty one strike
and do you remember the general strike
do you remember the nineteen twenty six miners' strike
oh yes
vividly
i vividly remember that
there were no strike pay you just had a UNK note that er if ever they got any money they'd pay you see
but er course we n never got any money because we er m it more or less UNK the notts miners' union that did it er it took everything away was that was when we were er s the spencer union was formed more or less by the management
and so you were telling me about the twenty six strike
well it wasn't a strike really it was a lock out
we were at that time of day the UNK the minimum wage was fourteen shillings a day
and they er locked us out until we'd go back for ten and thruppence a day so of course we didn't go back
and it was a great tragedy cos er it did i it did cause the general strike and er we had a week of the general strike
and do you remember how that affected nottingham
not really we it wasn't
we weren't really interested particularly in nottingham it was the general strike but what we were going to do i mean we'd o er we we'd er already formed more or less a government of our own if you understand me to take over you see
if the general strike had lasted we could have took over but er jimmy stepped in and er he was the er he was the er general secretary of the n u r national union of UNK and er he stepped in and persuaded the government to more or less step in and take over and UNK with the miners
well that was a foolish thing really cos there were four hundred and forty coal owners in the government and what they were going to UNK in our favour for we couldn't see
but er that is what actually happened and er jimmy thomas sold the pass he was the biggest UNK we ever had
well from there that was evolved the spencer union the
this er after the strike was defeated
at the strike we didn't go back
we didn't accept the UNK you see
we still stopped locked out
we were getting no money from anywhere and you had borrowed you had to pay it back when you went back to work you see
anyway er it the outcome of it was that the spencer union was formed george spencer er i in UNK with er the mine owners you see
and he accepted the ten and thruppence you see
and we had to go back you see
because one reason in nottingham why they went back was the fact UNK pit was starting to turn coal
they'd just sunk that pit and they were starting to turn coal and the miners were UNK back to the new pit you see
and it more or less made it that we'd got to go back for the ten and thruppence
but er we didn't i didn't go back we'd already we'd got some land and er and we'd set up er pig breeding and er we'd got about a hundred and twenty strong store pigs at that time
and er a horse and UNK and float
UNK er g got married in er twenty five and er agreed to buy a house in twenty six january moved into it and er so er i took over the t horse and UNK and er opened the front room as a shop a UNK shop
we used to grow quite a bit of stuff on the land and er we lived
the wife used to wait for somebody coming in the shop to buy something and then she'd go out and get a bit of meat and we'd have a dinner and er we had seven months of that before i was eventually more or less forced to go back
actually i was UNK people from UNK to UNK with this horse and UNK
and er so of course there was no future in it really so i went back
me brother was deputy in at the time erm
what when did you go back
pardon
when did you go back
i went back in er in the november just before christmas
that's about it isn't it
seven month
may june july august september october that's right
and erm i went back but er i we i we i went back er UNK and er i got er a UNK contract
and what did that mean
that meant that er we were maintaining the roads you see
and UNK gates er main roads and that sort of thing
and i used to have er i u i used to have men working for me you see
and you were a UNK at that time
i was i was er we weren't UNK because UNK worked on the face you see
yeah
we were UNK we worked on the in the stone you see
UNK worked in coal UNK worked in stone you see
and er i er carried on with that going on very nicely until they decided to UNK you see
and brought the coal cutter in and they put brought the pans and the UNK pans they used to wear belts then for UNK pans you see
it used to shake the coal down the b banks
and they were UNK to start them off we went in on the thursday morning and we had to fit all these things together and make 'em work you see
and it was sunday afternoon when i came out the pit the next time
they used to send us bread and UNK down from chase farm
and erm we eventually got these things working and er i got the contract along with jack to turn these pans over you see
as they got one face off we'd turn them over the pans had to be turned over and backs built you see
and road ripped ready for the next day you see
and er i got the contract for that
and then when i was about twenty four twenty four or five i'd got twenty men working for me so er we weren't doing so bad
and er then i had trouble with the er with the er afternoon UNK chap named
and er we fell out over a fall really or whatever it was
and er i was informed like that er i had d stop till six o'clock at night that night and i was informed that er i'd got to come back at night and bring me men
so i decided that it was time to pack up i decided that the nights were made to sleep on n and i was going to sleep on them you see
so i came out the pit and went into UNK and bought a lorry
but while you were still a miner did you have any trouble being in the miners' association when the spencer union was
never joined it
we never joined it
we still maintained the UNK of the notts miners' association
we still maintained that because er
were you UNK
it
because of that
oh we were UNK alright oh yes
yes we had all the dirty jobs
all the dirty jobs and the tough jobs to do
what sort of things were that
well i if there was er any new er wanted opening up which was always a minimum wage job you see
we had those sort of jobs to do
like when we opened a ninety z up and we couldn't open that face up it was hell
they you used to go and walk on the face in a morning an and you'd UNK on the face with your pick and buggers are green ther they're not ripe yet
you've got to earn your living out of that
but er we eventually beat it though and as i say a good colliery you could er you could beat 'em to it
matter of fact dad he agreed with the management for er you see the management never wanted anybody on the minimum wage never wanted to be on the UNK so he agreed with 'em f for a special price for our coal we got out
and er within a few months we'd got the thing going till they were blowing out and we were making it hand over UNK you see
and
what sort of money were you making on that then
oh were making twenty five bob a day then
and this was after they tried to UNK you
that's right yeah yes
we booked ten pound a week
what we were getting then
and it were a lot of money a lot of money and they pay a lot of benefits out of that now because the old man used to have it you see
and you have to pay them board
they wouldn't let us pay our board you see used to ha used to have twenty five bob spending money then
and w
did they try to UNK you in any other way
well er n no not necessarily i mean that was the worst way they could have UNK you by er making things damn awkward
that was the top and bottom of it but er the er the worst jobs we used to have you know was digging dead UNK out and actually i remember seeing one chap he got his leg in a coal cutter and got his foot cut off
u and of course the there were things that er y you got used to you see
and we just pulled his shove a bit of bind back of his leg tied it up together stopped the bleeding shoved him out
now i remember another chap he got done with a UNK
that were of piece of bind that come out and it was shaped like a UNK a ton in weight easy
and er that poor devil i it hit him and i know UNK we got him out one eye was about an inch lower than the other
it'd split his UNK
he died on the way down while we were carrying him to pit bottom
where that was er but er i remember i er i broke a collar bone while we were down the pit down there
and er we were coming out of we were getting the tub out an and er me brother was at the front end of th it went off the rails and er as he pushed it back i was at the back and it UNK me again the face and broke this collar bone
about twelve o'clock
but you weren't allowed to come out the pit i mean you had to wait until knocking off time you see before you were come out anything like that i mean er unless you've got broken legs or anything like that
so i had to s stop in the gate and mark tubs for two
and then i had about a two mile walk to pit bottom you see
and this thing was just dragging me down you see
and then when you got home er had me dinner you see
but you couldn't go to the doctor's until surgery time that were six o'clock you see
so off i went to the doctor's six o'clock and he examined me shoulder
aye it's broke there just there
spot
he says er and he lifted me hand up here and bound it tight and UNK across it
he says now when it gets UNK the bandage up you see
and come and see me again in a month
that was the therapy that was what we got
and i saw him in a month and he took the bandage off and me arm UNK of course
aye we'll see you in a fortnight and you'll be ready for work
i said well what do i do with the arm like
with this
had well he said just get on with it and keep pushing it up the wall just keep pushing it up the wall just come back
that was the UNK that we had for a broken collar bone you see
i mean nowadays you'd have a thomas UNK on it you see
so
i remember the spanish flu this was the kind of UNK we get if you don't mind this little these little incidents
when the spanish flu was on they were dying like flies
and they used to let us come out of the pit at three quarter time there were six of us all of a size strong as young UNK and er we used to have to i if the body was within less than a mile from the church you see
you weren't allowed to have a UNK you had to carry them to the church and er we used to b bury them by lamp light
we were allowed to come out a at er twelve o'clock you see
and we got payed seven and sixpence for each body we carried you see
that was something to make up the quarter of your shift
and er i remember going to the doctor's with me mother and where as we sat in the surgery which was packed eventually the old doctor come out of the door old
he says there he says you can all go home and die now all i've got left is UNK salts
oh
and so what did you do
we had to go home
we didn't die though erm
did you have some sort of treatment at home
did you have some sort of UNK
home made UNK
oh erm my UNK mother had it she got but she got better with it
but er this old doctor i remember the wife she had an UNK that was er a er conception in the UNK tube you see
and er the chap that tended her was er a UNK he were only a young chap and er he says oh i'm sorry he says i'd better get me old man to come he said i don't suppose i'll ever see another of these in my career
he got the old man to come old the same old bugger
and er he went up and examined the wife and he come down stairs and he said to me are you the husband
that's how he used to talk
er yes that's me doctor
well he says i might as well tell you he said
your wife could go out like the snuff of a UNK
and he went
er the young chap then came down stairs and he's says i'm having dinner with er i forget what the UNK name was now he says er i'll have a word with him about it
he says come down to the surgery in the morning
and i went down and he gave me a letter he says take your wife in to the general hospital with this letter
took her in the next day
and waited for her and brought her home again
and he removed it
mm
so
but that was the UNK that we had in those days
with all this er trauma did you have er wh what did you do with your leisure time what did you do with your free time out side of the outside the pit
did you play football
oh yes er oh yes er
er always played football or tennis and i played all sports that i could get hold of
cricket and er yes i er matter of fact i was selected to play for notts once er a one thursday afternoon
and er when i went to me i found out it in the post it was in the post that i was picked
so i went down to see the secretary who i found out was in the flying horse and er told him who i was ooh yes ooh yes you're playing this afternoon aren't you
yes i oh yes i remember now
i says it all depends how much er do we get like
cos i was on the afternoon shift and as i told you i was getting twenty five bob a day
ooh he says we can only pay you your travelling expenses
oh i says that's four pence tram fair
i said i'm sorry but you'd better pick somebody else
i'd rather have the twenty five bob
but er sport played a big part in our lives you see er then
because we'd nothing else to do i mean really
er you see the wireless that we'd got was the old cats UNK on a crystal you see and a pair of UNK that we used to and if anybody UNK a paper you see
so th the pictures you could go to the pictures but er UNK light and the UNK hand and m mary UNK and
how much was it to go to the pictures
well i it all depended the er when UNK a school er at school you see
it used to be a ha'penny on the front row you see
and a penny for the back
and the first three rows used to be a ha'penny and the others used to be a penny
see better you was looking up it on the front rows you see
but er yeah
and i remember the first UNK i ever heard i walked in the UNK one night with the wife and er as we walked in we hear a chap says i'm i am
that were the first words i ever heard on
and that week al UNK was on the UNK with UNK boy
they were the first
er UNK that came to nottingham they were
now you're telling us that you left the pit and you bought a lorry so could
yes
you move on about what you did then as your next
yeah
job
well
we bought this ton lorry
morris UNK from UNK and er i said i'd buy the lorry off 'em if they'd find me some work
so they sent me to UNK lane UNK colliery UNK
and er it was the time as they were there were UNK a scheme from mine to your cellar m i n e mine to your cellar you see
which meant that we had to cart this coal from the UNK take it to the client and put it in his coal house you see
otherwise he used to just shoot it up you see
but we had to go and take it into his UNK i had one day at that i thought i thought i'd had enough coal
so i went and saw a building contractor friend of me UNK and er he welcomed me with open arms he'd just got a contract for building council houses down UNK street at UNK
and er i got going with that UNK bricks and timber and all that sort of thing for him got really going and er UNK from train concrete
and er within eighteen months i'd got three lorries running
how much were you earning
well the earnings of course went into the business we'd er there was dad he'd retired then out of the pits early
he'd retired at fifty five to run this er small holding we'd got you see
and help with the lorry business and er i used to get three pound a week out of it
and er camel UNK i er cleared a lot of stuff from camel UNK
terrific lot of stuff from there
paint red paint that they used to paint railway wa er railway UNK
they used to make railway UNK down there you know then
where UNK is that
camel UNK on n kings weather road erm it's the government r o f there
they took it over
it were eleven acres there under one roof
and er i know i cleared a lot of er fire bricks
there was a range of er UNK and i car i o everything had to be cleared for when camel UNK finished with it
and i cart a lot of these bricks fire bricks up to this land that we've got and er this was in nineteen thirty seven
nineteen thirty seven
and i built er a bungalow for the old folks all interior were fire bricks
the outside was of course was facing bricks but er
how did you manage to do that then
well i was a UNK
you did anything when you was a UNK you see
and i'd been to as i tell you i'd been to night school UNK classes
i'd UNK it the er oh it er yeah
i did
all this work i took that out the door out of there and built all this and built me garage and you see
you can do anything if you try you know
if you try hard enough
mm
how long we
and then after about eighteen months er UNK came along with the road traffic act you see
and you had to have licences for your lorry then
a b and c licences and er it got so complicated that er i er eventually drafted in by virtue of er being able to sell UNK er drafted into the c i s the co op insurance
in nineteen thirty two
may nineteen thirty two
and how did you come to get that job
well my brothers was er he was er an agent for them and er i in the country area UNK joyce UNK and all round there
and er and er he got to take his boss down to er UNK joyce UNK sorry UNK one afternoon on a case
would i take him in the lorry yes i can do that for you
so i took them in the lorry
and while i was waiting for them i went into a little shop and for some cigarettes and er me brother y oh younger brother we'd started him up er f he was a UNK
and more y o out of work than in them days
and we'd started him up with a little donkey engine and a saw bench started him up making UNK of UNK up
and er so while i was in this shop i sold this chap five hundred UNK of fire wood you see
and i thought right i think i've just about got time to nip home and fetch that fire wood and pick them up when they you see
mm
low and behold when i got back they were waiting for me you see
and i UNK for what i'd done sold the UNK took 'em home again
and er about a month later this chap sent for me
er he wanted to er see me his brother had got promoted and was half of his book was come vacant would i have half the book
he says er an er a while after he said to he said did you ever know how you got on here at agency
no and i certainly would
he said well i thought to me self well the bloke that's co just walk in the shop and sell five hundred UNK of fire wood he could sell insurance
oh
and what wages did you get for that then
the first we didn't get any wages
or UNK
it was all commission you see
never worked for wages in me life after i was sixteen
but er me first week's commission were two pound twelve and sixpence
and i'd got ten and four pence more we used to pay twelve and fourpence monies i had to borrow to buy the book
a wife and a new baby so er you had to work
in
and
other words i had to get on my bike
i'm sorry mr but
we well
ah
wha what sort of er things did you have to do then
well i used to cycle from UNK to UNK me UNK was at UNK and i used to have to cycle from there to UNK and i used to take bit of food an and bread and cheese and pieces of anything i could pick up in me pocket and i daren't come home till i'd got some business
use to have to get a new business canvassing
we used to get help from the co UNK because they used to give us lists of new members and we used to be able to UNK those
but er within two years i'd doubled me book and i was UNK over five pound a week then
what kind of hours did you work the
ooh aye well ha
you didn't consider that
you didn't consider that you er i as i say you'd go out in the morning
if you had a good day you'd probably come home for your tea you see
otherwise you'd be out more or less into the night because you got to go and see the men at night you see
and you imagine in the nineteen thirties selling insurance
it was hell selling insurance then
i mean i if you could get in for a penny a week that was alright because when things got better you could build on a penny a week you see
if you was greedy and went for a shilling you lost it after a week or two you see
but er
and were you involved in a trade union at all
oh yes oh yes
it er we had to be it was a closed shop that was and er i er i was the er i was the secretary for er for our chairman rather for ou our er local branch for the nottingham area branch of er UNK you see
we
and how did you come to be that
oh i was elected
u
i could talk
i'd had i'd had schooling you see
from the old man you see he'd always been an old i l p man and er i remember when UNK put up for parliament in the UNK division
he er he was strong enough man to put fifty pound down for his deposit towards his deposit of a hundred and fifty you know
and er they UNK he were mad but er he got it back
aye so of course as i say er i we were more or less grew up with it
it er it grew into it
and then when i got promotion i got promoted to UNK district inspector
then we had to change the unions to UNK and er i er i became national president of the UNK er district inspectors branch of UNK yes i was president till i retired
and did you e ever remember having any trouble
any industrial trouble
er no not never had any industrial trouble while i was in
i i'll never forget i er i used to try er you see we used to have three sets of commissions
twenty five percent fifteen percent and ten percent you see
well the twenty five percent was whole life business and fifteen percent was a commission er a term endowment and the ten percent was endowment you see
but the results for the ten percent were better than is had nothing for me
i think it's next door the te er the fifteen percent was less than the ten percent you see
less er less for the c for the customer
well up in scotland the main er was twenty five percent
i mean the scottish boys i mean they always wanted the big end of the stick you see
they didn't believe in selling endowments they only sold whole life you see
a lot of them did
anyway at one of the branch UNK er e c UNK er executive meetings
i er put forward the idea that twenty five percent was dying out this
can switched off a second
anyway you see the trouble was that the twenty five percent business was falling fast
people were getting educated to endowment assurance you see
so i start to put it across to the to the why not try and negotiated one commission fifteen percent you see
cut your ten percent out cut your twenty five percent out and accept ten fifteen percent you see
we used to have three lots of entries in our collecting books you see
i said it'll cut all that out chief UNK welcome you because it'll save such a lot of but er the scottish boys oh no oh no he'd never accept that you see
i said well the men with the bigger books of twenty five percent we could compensate them you see
but er no they wouldn't wear it
consequently eventually the twenty five percent went all together
and they'd still got a majority of ten percent you see the fifteen percent went as well you see
they accept the deal
now
another thing er while on union business er i used to go up on negotiations you see
and er i er i went up on negotiations we used to get a small a small basic wage you see
and erm i w we went up on er to try and get the basic wage increased and er i know mr he was the er general manager at the time
i er i tried to tell him he tried to point out to me he says that er the average earnings you see of district inspectors you see
was i think he said it were about twenty six pound a week for that time you see
but you know mr i don't believe in these average earnings average business oh yes there is UNK the accountants will UNK for it you see
yeah but i i'm not talking about th being correct i said
i said you see the point is that the temperature the temperature at the north pole is a lot lower than it is in th on the UNK i said
but you can't con you can't persuade those chaps at the north pole that they never get any frost you know you see
course the average temperature is no degrees UNK you see
so they don't get any frost on your argument
i said the same i can't persuade our chaps on the yorkshire UNK that they are getting twenty six pound a week when they're not you see
but according to you they are you see
that's why i say let's have an increase in basic wage
yeah
you see
i'm saying this today
instead of talking about an average twelve percent or thirty percent you see
go for a basic
now erm let's come on to er the last war and er i'd like to know what you did as part of your war effort
well i was in the insurance then of course you see
and er i was too o old for call up at the beginning of the war well we had a car so er we were asked anyone that had a car to volunteer for er a r p services you see
so erm the first week of the er of UNK i went and volunteered to for the a r p

thank you
and now it is my duty to introduce doctor and erm i think you said you were talking to us about yourself and erm also a little bit about your holidays
that's right yes
and
i'll stand up unless my legs start to UNK and then i'll sit down again
well thank you very much for inviting me to come
i've come to saint mary's and i've been here er just over a year now and erm UNK me into speaking to you
as i was speaking at erm a neighbours and friends group at my parents church and UNK heard about it and she said will i come and speak to you
can you all hear me
yes thank you
right
first of all i thought i'd tell you who i was i'm a g p in er in new harlow in bush fair and i've been there for nearly three years now
i am i was born in essex in hospital and my family all come from essex and i was brought up in UNK and i was very fortunate in that i was born into a christian home and i had christian parents and christian grandparents and christian UNK and UNK and i went to church from the time i was about two or three weeks old
and this wasn't an UNK church erm it was a UNK church and when i was seven i understood that jesus had died for me and then i asked him into my heart and when i was twelve i was baptized which is the equivalent really of being confirmed
i was a sunday school teacher erm when i was in my secondary school and i wondered what god would want me to do with my life when i left school and i thought maybe he wants me to be a missionary and i thought it was only teachers and doctors that could be UNK i was wrong wasn't i
but that's what i thought so i thought i'll try and be a doctor
so i did my o levels and my a levels and i then went to the london hospital which is in UNK from the age of eighteen until i was twenty three
and god was very good to me there i wasn't the UNK in the year and i had to work very hard but god always was with me as i always passed my exams much to my surprise
what you do for the first two years is you learn all the theory of being a doctor and you go and you have to between eight of you learn all about a body you have one body between of you and you learn all about all the muscles and the nerves
over a year and you also have to do lots of experiments you have to learn to take blood pressure on each other learn to take blood from each other
oh dear
and erm i UNK when someone tried to take blood from me
because they couldn't find where to do it and they were
oh
digging all over my arm
oh
and then we had to do experiments on each other like putting tubes through our UNK down into our UNK
ooh
and finding out what our er UNK were like whether the liquid in there is UNK whether it's an acid and do you know the girls were UNK than the boys the boys wouldn't let anyone do that to them
women are brave that's why
and erm we had to learn erm how to do heart UNK on each other and er all sorts of exciting things like that
and then after two years we were allowed on to the wards in our white coats and we had to erm find out about the patients and initially we were all very slow and we were given two hours to talk to a patient to find out all about them
now i'm a g p we have ten minutes
and i can remember one of my first patients i had to take blood from and it took me quite a few goes on that poor lady but she's still friends with me so she's forgiven me
we get sent all over erm the country southern england i was sent to different hospitals to learn about different things to learn about erm UNK and UNK and medicine and then erm you also do some er training back in your own hospital but it's not big enough for all the doctors to stay there all the time well the baby doctors
and then in the last year in the fifth year you have to do and pass all the exams
in the fourth year i was lucky enough to be able to go to kenya and find out what life was like in a hospital there and we had a missionary from my church that was a teacher in kenya with the african inland mission and i went to really i was nursing erm and helping out there
their erm conditions were very basic and i took two UNK hot water bottles which were going to be used as UNK for the premature babies that's all they had and i took out lots of needles and the UNK gloves and a special instrument for operations
so i went UNK out i'd never flown before and i went to kenya and life is very different from hospitals in this country
the wards were very bare and the families look after the patients they come in and give them food and erm do a lot more for them than er they do in this country and erm there were two wards out of eight for tuberculosis for t b cos that's a very big problem out in kenya
erm and on a friday all the beds went out onto the grass outside the wards for the wards to be cleaned
oh
so they were all UNK out of everybody
fortunately it didn't rain otherwise they would've all got very wet
some of the erm people are in hospital there for problems that we don't have in this country
they have their local medicine and the UNK doctors try and cure them of their diseases first so they would even bore holes into people's UNK to let the spirits out for headaches and things like that
also there were things called UNK which were knives erm and the we saw quite a few UNK incidents and people were injured from knife attacks
and sad things like children falling into fires and because in the mud UNK you have the fire in the centre of the hut and it's quite easy for the children to fall in and there was one little boy there who had been there for over a year and they kept trying to erm heal up all his skin UNK
we also went down into the valley into we were on the edge of the UNK valley and there were a different sort of people
UNK near our hospital they all liked to wear western clothes they were a bit out of date but er the there were lots of t shirts and s and dresses worn by the people there was even a blackpool t shirt i'm not sure how they got in the shops
erm but down in the UNK valley the UNK people were a very different UNK they wore leather little tiny leather UNK and UNK and nothing here and it was very hot and they were a UNK people who erm moved about with their animals but because when i was there there'd been a very bad UNK they'd had to erm just beg really for food
so that was a contrast from the people near the hospital where i was and what happened was we used to do a little service and then anybody that wanted to be seen used to come along and we needed an UNK and it was a bit like a surgery really and they would come with any problems and anyone who was severely ill we would then take back in the UNK back to the hospital
we used to have to use a generator for our electricity and that used to go off at ten o'clock at night so if there was an operation that needed doing there were two car batteries that were turned on and you used to have to do it by those
ooh
so that was different
and the water to UNK in came from the local river and er it was very sandy and it just looked like mud that you were having to get in and do your bath
ooh
the water for drinking they used to collect from the UNK and erm it used to go into big barrels and then they used to boil it for a long while
the meat used to have to be pressure cooked for four hours to make it tender enough to eat
erm there were lots of fresh fruit and vegetables and we had lemon trees and UNK trees in our garden
so that was quite an experience and quite a contrast from er life in good old england
after i'd finished i went and did six months in UNK in er UNK er doing surgery
i was just helping out and erm learning the basics and i erm came and appeared in the christmas UNK the fairy UNK of the UNK
oh
and when they used to rub the UNK out i would appear
that was good fun
we did that to all the staff it was a sort of UNK story
and then i went to UNK for six months and i did er six months of medicine and that was a long way from home in essex and er we all sort of er UNK in and er made our own entertainment and cooked for each other and that erm was quite a good time
and then i spent six months in peterborough doing UNK erm working in the special care unit with all the premature babies with UNK and not UNK hot water bottles
that time
and that was really amazing to see these little tiny UNK that were twenty three or twenty four weeks so that they were twenty six weeks early is that right
sixteen weeks early and er they er really didn't seem to stand a chance erm of living but a lot of them did and that was amazing
and then all the all the little children some of them with very serious illnesses but seeing how brave they were on the wards it was a very moving six months
and then i got on a g p scheme in crawley in sussex and i spent three years there
i did er UNK and UNK and casualty and then i did a year as a g p trainee
i think erm casualty was the worst in that you had very long hours to do erm sometimes you were on call from five o'clock in the evening until nine o'clock the following morning and you did that for a whole week so by the end of the time you really did feel UNK you were very tired
but i think probably the most disturbing was some of the poor people in UNK erm and er that was very hard work because you seemed to take the problems home with you and you kept thinking about some of the conditions that people had
and then i came here which was quite amazing because i didn't want to come here i wanted to be er like james UNK and go somewhere really rural
and i wanted to erm you know just travel from village to village but erm it was quite amazing how god said you're coming to harlow
i wasn't looking for a job because i hadn't finished my training but er a friend of mine has h her father is a g p in UNK and he erm was at a meeting with the senior partner of my practice and they said do you know of anybody who's interested in a partnership
and they suggested me but i said i didn't think it was a good idea because i hadn't finished
and they said we'll wait for you
and i said well you haven't even met me
said no but you come from essex so you can't be too bad
and i came and i didn't think harlow was for me because i it was all very built up and lots of roundabouts but the people the partners were so lovely and er i saw some of the patients and i thought they were very lovely too so this is where i've been
our practice has got five doctors erm and doctor erm elaine who comes here she works for two evenings a week with us and we have eight thousand patients on our list and erm sometimes we're very busy and sometimes like in the summer we're not so busy
everybody seems to have flu at the moment
and they're coming in with the UNK and the UNK and not feeling very well
erm but it's a it's good
erm like any job you have your ups and your downs it's very nice when you see people getting better or you've followed somebody through their pregnancy and they've got a lovely UNK baby at the end of it and sometimes it's sad when you find out that somebody has got a serious illness or you're looking after people where somebody has died and it it's very hard for the people left behind to cope and so that's very difficult sometimes
sometimes i get very cross with the patients sometimes they when you're on call they ring you up at three in the morning and say they're UNK
ooh
an and they ring up and they say they've had a cold all week and they can't put up with it a minute longer
ooh
and so sometimes the calls do seem unreasonable but you shouldn't get cross and when you go and see them sometimes you realize why they're anxious because something that might seem quite trivial to you they might know somebody who had similar symptoms and it actually turned out to be UNK or something so you're then able to put their minds at rest
but erm it's quite hard if you've been up a lot at night and then you have to go and do the whole of the next day of work but fortunately our UNK aren't too bad so we're never on two nights in a row compared with the hospital which was quite a lot harder work
right erm er then i what did i think i'd say after that
erm i thought i'd tell you a bit about what i did apart from medicine
erm i like doing water colour painting and i've been on two holidays down in cornwall and i've done that and that's very relaxing erm and it seems you seem to forget about everything else and that's quite good fun er but erm obviously if it UNK all your all your colours get washed away but that's good fun
and i like erm knitting and UNK and i like cycling and i like running and erm i like walking and erm i was very fortunate to be able to go to UNK the other week
erm i went er at the end of september and i did white water UNK going down in a UNK er seven to a boat and going over the UNK wearing a
ooh
wearing a crash UNK and erm a UNK jacket cos if you fell in you could hit your head on the rocks
and that was quite an experience
the wa the river UNK very UNK there so a lot of people got tummy bugs and we slept er on the side of the river in little UNK and erm we didn't discover till afterwards two things one thing was that the little holes that we saw in the sand were actually UNK holes
ooh
and another thing was we went to a UNK farm later on and they said that they release the UNK into the river that we
ooh
fortunately we didn't see any
but that was good fun there were eighteen of us from eight different countries er americans and UNK and UNK and new UNK and dutch and UNK and english and er we had a good time and then we and went and did mountain UNK in UNK
and we went up and down erm the valley and we saw some of the UNK
ooh
and we saw them burning bodies on the side of the river
and we saw the religious people the religious men who erm are the only people that are allowed to smoke drugs you know illegal drugs er things like UNK they're actually allowed to because the people view them as half alive and half dead and that was interesting to see
and we went to one temple and it got dark whilst we were there it was called the monkey temple and it's just so many UNK around and they just are allowed to run wild but by the time we got back to our UNK it was dark and we had to cycle back in the dark without any lights on these UNK roads and that was quite frightening really
mm
and you have to pay the little boys to guard your UNK otherwise they let down the tyres
and then after that erm i did er an eight day trek erm which was in the UNK region of the UNK and that again was sleeping in UNK and we had UNK to carry all our UNK apart from things like water that we carried in our day sacks and they carried four bags each on their backs and my bag weighed about thirty pounds
ooh
and they had a strap and they used to carry all the weight on their UNK and on and through their UNK and they used to climb we went up to seventeen and a half thousand feet and they UNK up with all these bags and they cooked for us and they got river water for us and sometimes they had to walk a UNK to the river to go and get the water and then carry it back again er with the band around their heads and so initially it seemed quite difficult to accept them doing this for you but for them it was a job and erm it was probably the only sort of job that they could get
and they seemed very happy doing it and they certainly were very UNK
ooh
from all the work they did
they'd have to be wouldn't they
yeah
people there are very poor
we saw lots of people picking up stones erm from around by the edges of the roads and making little piles and they would then get picked up by lorries and i should think they'd get a couple of pence through doing that
all the children know how to beg they run up to you and they say hello goodbye because normally when someone says hello and you're going you say goodbye so they think hello UNK the UNK
and they say pen and then they say one UNK which is a tiny bit of currency erm and they ask for pens for their school so that they can write at school
and erm there's lots and lots of erm poverty but yet the people do seem fairly content with their lot
there's a lot of UNK that's grown so in some areas the people can actually make a good living for themselves
the roads are UNK up and down and they're not UNK and so erm you often saw er buses that had fallen over the sides down into the river or that just were on their side and that erm that obviously there'd been accidents
apparently what the erm UNK do is they have to make sure that they get to where they're meant to be on time otherwise they get their pay UNK but they like to stop off and see their friends on the way and stop and have cups of tea
so that when they have to go they go very fast and we were advised if we ever went on a bus to sit on the roof
because there's a UNK there and some people do so that if the bus does turn over at least you've got a chance to jump out
to jump out mm
and so that was all very interesting
and then after that erm the trek we went erm to a national park the UNK national park
apparently that was on television last week they were did a programme about UNK don't know whether anyone saw it
and erm we went on an elephant on a UNK and we looked for erm wild animals and we saw some UNK and that was quite good fun
and then we did a jungle trek and erm the guide said if i do that you've come near if i do that you have to go away if i do that you've got to quickly climb a tree
ooh
if i do that you've all got to UNK and we were really worried about what we might find
there are UNK there and there's UNK and things called UNK bears a sort of bear but they're actually quite rare so er we didn't see any of those apart from the UNK we went very quietly UNK under the UNK and we saw them in a water hole and they were just bathing there
but they've got very poor eyesight so although they could sense where we were as we stayed really still they couldn't see us so we were quite safe but er we couldn't go any nearer than about ten yards from them erm because there weren't any suitable trees to climb in case they started to chase us
ooh
and then erm one afternoon we went in a dug out UNK erm to look for UNK and we did actually see them on the banks of the river as we were going down in our UNK so that was quite exciting
and on our way to the UNK farm erm we past some beautiful countryside and on the way back one of the two UNK broke down and after an hour they decided we would have to leave it
so we came back in the dark there were fifteen of us in th this UNK up and down so that was quite fun too
erm our last few days we were meant to see UNK and the beautiful UNK but the UNK didn't er finish so weren't ab able to see that but we understood they were there somewhere
the other exciting thing was the UNK er because the UNK hadn't finished there were lots of UNK around and i'd imagined these huge things that were going to suck me to death but they're actually little like just very tiny little UNK about erm an inch long and very thin and what they do is they sit on leaves and things and as you walk by they get UNK on to your boots or your socks and then they UNK their way in and they you can't feel them there but what they do is they suck your blood until they UNK
ooh
so you er you take your shoe your socks off and you find you've got a some blood in your socks and that's where a UNK had been
but erm i think i had lots of people praying for me back here because i didn't have any problem with them and i was the only one who didn't
but there's two ways of getting them off if they do UNK on to you one is to burn them off with a cigarette or a match and the other way is to use rock salt and if you put rock salt on them they then just come off so that's a little bit erm more UNK for the UNK but it depends what you feel about them really as to whether you want to give them another chance
when i came back to england i was very UNK really to erm because i arrived in UNK three hours before that crash and erm a lot of people had thought i'd died in that crash and erm the patients had thought i'd died as well and they had to put a big notice outside to say that i'd been alright they had lots of people ringing up
and it just made me realize how UNK life is and how god has got his hand on you and erm how he protected me from erm being killed in that plane crash because it could easily have been my plane
mm
and erm it just makes you put everything into perspective
so that's one of my hobbies i don't know whether i'll be going to UNK or anywhere like that again but it i've certainly got er lots of happy memories of that experience and er i've brought erm a photo album erm with some of my pictures in if anyone would like to have a look
oh yes
and i've also got one album erm with a few pictures in from when i was in kenya which was in nineteen eighty four so you know if anyone wants to see what i looked like in there i had longer hair and i was wearing a white coat so they're very welcome
the last thing i thought i would talk about was my christian UNK why i am here today why i am a doctor and what god means to me
being brought up in a christian home isn't enough to make you a christian
you can you go to church every sunday sing the UNK or the UNK listen to what the man has to say or the lady has to say at the front and it can just go over your head and it can mean nothing to you apart from something that you believe might be true
but what you have to do is actually realize that jesus died for you have to be sorry for all the things that you've done wrong and you need to ask him to come into your life and to be your own saviour
and that means that from then on your life isn't your own you don't do what you want to do you do what you believe god is telling you to do and you try to live by what the bible says and you pray about any important decision you make and then when god has shown you what the right thing is to do even when you're going through very hard times you know that you're there because that's where god wants you to be and that gives you faith to carry on
i thought er that god wanted me to be a doctor and i didn't have a place to go to i took my a levels having had five chances of places to be a doctor and everybody saying no we don't want you and erm i had everybody praying for me at church and quite UNK at the end of the august when i should start in the september i had a phone call at half past ten at night from a surgeon at the london hospital asking me to go for an interview the next day
and i went and he offered me erm to start the next month and i just couldn't believe it
but i knew that was where god wanted me to be because it was such a miracle
and when i arrived i UNK been surprised if my name hadn't been on the list but it was there
when i when it came to exam time i used to work until midnight have three hours sleep and get up at three in the morning to carry on UNK er because i wasn't brilliant and i couldn't remember everything and it was hard work
but i tried always to have a quiet time with god before i started my revision that morning
and god was faithful and i passed my exams
then showing me erm his promises in the bible when things are hard then that's when you look to god and his word more and that's when he's able to show you things from the bible because you're in a state of wanting to know
when everything's going well for you it's easy to forget that god's there with you because life's so busy and so much fun
but when times are hard when you're upset by things that er are wrong with patients or by things that have happened to you then it's nice to know that god's always there for you
when i was twelve and i got baptized erm a lady gave me a little text and it was from UNK chapter one and it was verse nine and it says have i not UNK you be strong and UNK do not be terrified do not be UNK for the lord your god will be with you wherever you go and that's a verse that i've been able to remember and to thank god for on so many different occasions all through my training as a doctor and it's all the promises in the bible are absolutely true and you can rely on them because it's not a book written by men but it's a book written by god
another one was in isaiah chapter forty and er god says here do you not know have you not heard the lord is the UNK god the UNK of the ends of the earth
he will not grow tired or UNK and his understanding no one can UNK
he gives strength to the UNK and increases the power of the weak
even youths grow tired and UNK and young men UNK and fall but those who hope in the lord will renew their strength they will UNK on wings like UNK they will run and not grow UNK they will walk and not be faint
and i knew what it was like to be tired and UNK but i knew that if i trusted in god and spent time with him then he would renew my strength and i could carry on
the people in UNK are UNK or UNK and they believe that they can get to god by going and praying lots of times UNK putting special UNK on their UNK on their erm UNK and making UNK
they erm bring fruit and UNK and things and lay them before a god that they can see before them
but in john chapter fourteen it says jesus said i am the way and the truth and the light
no one comes to the father except through me
and that's something that christians believe they have over all other UNK that the only way to god is through jesus christ
some people think that if you lead a good life then you can get to jesus and get to heaven but jesus said that you have to come through him
in erm romans chapter three and verse twenty seven it says that er jesus died for our sins and i'd just like to leave this thought with you that n er just like me when i could have died the other week in that plane crash that none of us knows how long we've got on this life and however long or short it is there's no time like the present to get right with god if you if you aren't and the only way to do that is through jesus
i did that when i was seven and different people can do it at any time
jesus said now is the acceptable time
if you do want to ask me anything about this i've got some little booklets or i'm sure some other people here could talk to you about it
but that's the thought that i would really like you to take with you today
thank you
that's very nice
lovely
thank you very much
oh it's really lovely wasn't it
yes very interesting yes
is there any questions anybody like to ask er kate anything
cynthia can you think of anything to ask
you talked about pressure cooking the meat for four hours
yes
did you ever find out what meat it was
oh yes we bought it ourselves
it was mainly UNK meat
yes
it's interesting because i was in nottingham a few weeks ago and actually on nottingham market they sell a lot of UNK meat
right
and it said genuine UNK
did it UNK
i didn't get close enough
i thought she was very brave wasn't she
yes very brave
but like she said erm the lord was with her wasn't he
mm
and erm we did pray for you several of us UNK for you when we knew you were going to UNK
thank you very much
was there any christianity in UNK or kenya
in kenya there's a lot of erm er UNK
k kenya has more UNK than any other country in africa
erm the africa inland mission has many UNK there are a lot of american UNK there erm and there are a lot of new churches being built and a lot of people are becoming christians in kenya
UNK is different that's erm very much erm influenced by the UNK and the UNK ways a lot of people believe in both
mm
and erm i don't believe that there are many christians there
jo 's in teaching isn't she
yes
i wasn't able to see her but erm i believe the work is very hard erm in UNK and i certainly didn't meet any christians whilst i was there
do you know what the difference is between the UNK and the UNK
erm not at not in detail
they do actually share some of the gods
yes
some of the gods erm they believe in erm both erm but certainly there were UNK and UNK and erm people used to go to both
but they manage to live happily side by side
they don't
yes there's no UNK a lot of people believe in both and go to both UNK
yeah
mm
so erm
well that's a good point in
you talked about being erm you know if god wanted you to be a missionary you'd got to be a sort of teacher or a doctor do you see your role in harlow as a missionary role or as a doctor
erm i like to think that erm you can be a missionary anywhere
mm
mm
erm sometimes i do find being in harlow very hard erm and there's a lot of unemployment there's a lot of depression there are a lot of one parent families and er the children ha er in one family they've all got different UNK
mm
and erm sometimes that is very hard and i think you can be a missionary anywhere
erm i do look for opportunities to talk to people about god but i certainly think that you have to wait for the right opportunity because if people are ill or very down then it often isn't the right time when they're vulnerable erm to try and erm talk to them about something
but yes i'm sure you can be a missionary in harlow and i'd like to think that maybe i could erm increase that work and maybe have an afternoon a week where i could talk to people about god but i think there's not really time in a ten minute surgery slot
do you find it difficult i mean i talk to people who erm work with you know relate marriage guidance and they find it quite difficult not to be able to bring their christian faith in when they are sort of counselling people
er presumably doctors also find this difficult do they
it's very hard not to put your own views on to other people's UNK
often there's a lot of that people erm do or don't do that you can't erm go along with when people are wanting UNK of pregnancy or they're thinking of leaving their husbands and going off with somebody else then you just have to listen to what they say and put the facts as you see them in front of them
occasionally you can say you think they're being stupid or have they thought about other things but at the end of the day people are UNK erm for their own decisions i feel and if i have an opportunity i'll tell them what i think but er if people aren't wanting your opinion then you can't really give it
no
i think
you're working in one of the of the less UNK parts of harlow aren't you
very
yes
much so yeah
but they've all got videos
they may not they may not have carpets on the floor but they've all got videos
it's sad isn't it
it's interesting isn't it you know i mean i come across a lot of people who are poor
yes
sort of well we can't pay this that and the other and the thing that really gets me and you know i i've tried to reason it through so many times but top er top of these UNK sort of shopping list is these UNK nappies
ooh that gets my UNK too
and they really get me you sort of say well what do you spend your money on
ten pounds a week on UNK nappies
and cigarettes
yeah
well of course you see when you when you reason it through lots of these people they haven't got washing machines they haven't got drying facilities
mm
and i suppose you know they're perhaps better off buying these UNK nappies
perhaps the babies don't get sore UNK now
but they're causing a they're causing a problem aren't they
they are
cos i've heard that on the television
yeah they don't break down do they
UNK nappies no
no
they're causing problems everywhere
and we pulled in a car park in brandon the other week and there in the middle of a car park was this UNK
it must it must cause disease and trouble mustn't it
all them dirty nappies left about
in the bins don't they
then the bin men
but you can't burn anything these days can you
no
no
nothing can be burnt
i mean fire UNK everything but you can't burn anything you're not allowed to
mm except on bonfire night
i don't know why they don't wash nappies we used to do it i can remember washing them
i mean i like to see the nappies flapping on the line
yeah but you see lots of them haven't got lines you see
some of them don't want them either thank you
they'd rather sit there and
i think mary was going we'll just have our shall we say the lord's prayer before we
yes
say the
you hot
yeah it's very warm
shall i turn it down
turn it down
is everyone else hot
yes i'm hot i'm always hot
i sat in church this morning and fairly boiled
our father who art in heaven UNK be UNK name thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our UNK as we forgive those who UNK against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for UNK is the kingdom the power and the glory for ever and ever amen
well we'll have hymn number twenty two in the red book
are you alright catherine
it isn't it's now thank we all our god
you know that
have you all got it
have you all got it
yes thank you
now thank we all our god with hearts and hands and voices who UNK things have done UNK
who from the and bless us on our way and still is ours today
through all our life be near us
with ever UNK hearts and blessed peace to UNK us
and keep us in his grace and free us from all UNK in this world and the next
all praise supreme in highest heaven our eternal god who now and shall be ever more
thank you mary
explain to us
stop the tape because it doesn't want me on it
right we're ready to start
erm how long have you lived in the flats
er two year
two years you've lived in the flats
yeah
so UNK you and your girlfriend and daughter came in moved into f into the flats two years ago
erm where did you live before
er down at farm
mhm
so did you actually decide you wanted to come to the flats was it was it a decision
no what actually happened was er we was at with her mum
yeah
and then we had er our daughter and so the house was a bit packed cos her UNK got a lot of kids
mhm
so we asked council if they could get us a place and they offered us a flat at first over the other side i don't know what walk it was on and they says you can stay there until we get an house for you
mhm
cos there weren't supposed to be moving people into the flats with kids you know with them falling down stairs and things like that
and then that one fell through because they hadn't done the repairs on so they gen us this flat
and so we moved into it and then we've been here ever since
mhm
did you did you originally when you actually erm applied to get a council place did you did you s did you want to move to the flats here or did you apply for put other
no
names down
no we didn't want to move to the flats
we wanted somewhere round the area or valley but we didn't want to come to the flats no way
but it was a case of suits it's a case of actually it was here where it was easy to get a flat than places anywhere else it was a case of less waiting
well
time
the case was that her UNK house was UNK
yeah
so we had to get out anyway and
and it
the sooner the better
but actually it was worse coming here
mhm
so erm how old how old are you and your girlfriend
are you both
i'm twenty five she's twenty
daughter's two
daughter's two
erm terms of living in you've lived here obviously where you lived before how does it compare
how do you find it living in the flats compared with anywhere else you've lived
er bad
yeah in what ways
bad
er well compared with erm and valley there's more violence round the flats more litter there's more everything really you know
more trouble and everything
you see at you can walk around go in a pub have a drink come out and UNK say anything to you there's no trouble round there
i know they've got a bit of crime rate with burglaries but it's not actual violence round and round valley you can do the same go in a pub and come out and er no one UNK say nothing
but round here you could just walk er to the shop and get mugged or you know your girlfriend could get raped kids can get assaulted anything
so i it's a bad area
it's a no go no go area
do you ever do you ever go out to the to pubs round here
yeah but i always we always go out with her family
there's al it's like next friday we're all planning to go out but there'll be fifteen of us see we all go out in a big group
so you go i mean round here is that
yeah well we're starting off round first we have a drink in
yeah
so you know we've got enough courage to come down this end
even though i live down here you know but i don't go out
i never go out on me own
mhm so do
you fi yeah do your
family often come down here
no this this'll be the first time they've come down here in about three or four month
yeah whereas it would be
like it's her UNK birthday
yeah
she likes to go to the UNK er across the road from the at the bottom of road it is
mhm
she always likes to go there when it's UNK and things like that special occasions
mhm
that's the only time we come down
mhm
but they wouldn't they don't come down normally to
no
they'd never come down
and is that cos of the
that's cos of all the trouble round this area
any worries of that to come down
yeah
they might be at risk
yeah
so have you ever in terms of the crime have you ever been affected by it in any way
in person
you know or anyone in your family
yeah
no not really
we've only had one bit of trouble once and that was when we first moved on
there's some people at the flat out there and they used to bricks at the windows and things like that
still got an hole here that was just with a UNK gun that was
how long di how long ago did that happen
that was when we first moved in
that was when you first moved in
yeah
mhm
never bothered repairing it cos it's a waste of time
it's gonna get
do you know when you actually go out does it actually you know cos it used you said in terms of does it actually worry you going out do you actually f think there's a risk
yeah when i go to the shop i either take the wooden rolling pin or a knife
you do is it cos that's
yeah
and that's just over to the shop there just over the at the other side of the road
i always take some
sort of you know defensive thing
and did you ever do so when you lived elsewhere di you ever feel you the need to
no
o so it's
no
just since you've been living here
it's just here
yeah
yeah
erm in UNK in terms of the erm crime why do why do you think that there is so much crime here
well i think it's er an area that's most of the people are unemployed for a start
yeah
and there's no facilities for kids you know young kids ranging up to the age of er about sixteen seventeen
i mean there's not many UNK round here what you can see for kids
i know they've got a community centre but that don't you know have everything for people
nowadays there's varied taste isn't there
er i mean some people like UNK music some people like body popping and things like this there's all different taste
so
yeah
the council have got to try and cater for every one
cos it's gonna be a
yeah
community
is it that UNK do you think that encourages people to get in trouble the fact that there's so little
yeah i suppose it does in a way
i mean cos
that yeah
the flats is er a no go area sort of thing and a UNK come along and spray summat on a wall and next day three UNK come along and spray things on the wall so that you've got more and more UNK going all over the place more and more rubbish more and more people coming to the flats just to get into trouble
mhm
how do you fell as a person that in here do you feel any UNK as a person sort of living here compared to with erm with your UNK
no i just feel more frightened that's all
feel more frightened
cos you never know if someone's gonna bust your door in one night and raid your house or anything like that
i mean you could be laying in bed which are downstairs and someone could throw summat through a window
which is
so do you any kind of UNK to UNK against that kind of thing happening
well i've fitted extra chain locks on the door and extra locks on me door downstairs
i'm not so bothered about the windows so much cos if they break someone's bound to hear them smash
i don't know if they'd be bothered but they'd hear
mhm
them
in terms of facilities you you've got a young daughter what about what are the facilities like round here in terms of erm i mean
i haven't seen any anyway
nothing at all
nothing
i suppose if there was i wouldn't take her anyway not round this area
see at i can just let her go and play out on the park or at anything you know with the other kids but round here you can't
mhm
cos you never know if they're gonna get into trouble with other people or whether they're gonna get er sexually assaulted or raped or mugged or UNK
in streets you can never tell round here
so what do you if had er in terms of how do you feel about bringing up children round here what do you what do you feel about that bringing up
i wouldn't i'd have
you wouldn't
to move
you've said it's that
if my daughter was say seven or eight now she wouldn't be attending any of the schools round here cos i wouldn't let her
no chance
mm so what kind of damage do you think you could do if you say you wouldn't let them so what ma what makes you feel that way
well it's just that the fact that there's more UNK and things going round this area than any other part of
mhm
i mean there's proof there cos five just in four days
because that's a list he's of erm he's showing there of crimes that have been committed in this area er since
that's just within a week
in the last week yeah
i mean there's five UNK there and er assault on a five year old kid
mhm
and you can't bring people up in that environment anyway
mhm
yeah how do f in terms of the police i mean how do what kind of work do they do in d in response to the crime
well i don't know cos i've never actually seen any police in these flats
yeah so do they do they walk around at all or
i've never seen them walk round the flats i've seen the odd one or two with the security guards
yeah
but then there's about four or five of them then
they never come round on their own and you see them in the daytime you know probably one or twice a week
mhm
but at night time you never see them at all
yeah and what do they do i mean do they s
they just walk round they don't do nothing they'll probably just walk up this and then c come out the other end and go back to the police station
and they never actually see them walk round where the all the empty flats are as well
mhm
and some people that's where you'll probably get mugged anyway if you're safe from well from one road cutting through the flats where all the empty flats are that is the point where they'd probably get mugged and assaulted and raped and god knows what
mhm
and i in terms of you know in terms of the image that UNK got the flats do you can you remember before you came into here you knew you had obviously had a cer the area had a certain image do you think that image is fair or not
no i think it's worse
think it's worse than the
i think it's a lot worse
a lot worse than you expected
yeah
i mean when i when i first heard about green flats i thought well it can't be that bad you know
you know just cos there's a few UNK and UNK down there i thought it can't be that bad
and when i come here and i lived here for a few year and then really saw what it was like i thought god never again
no way am i living in another flat no chance
i mean my parents won't visit me cos i living here
so i have to go up and visit them but her parents never come down here only once in a blue moon when they feel like it
so we're losing out as you know we're losing out all the time
no one that no one UNK visit you
so you have to keep spending your money to go and visit them
and yet you know you think UNK stick together in this day and age
you know like if you go and visit them sometimes they come down and visit you but they don't
cos they're frightened of coming down here
mhm
my dad he usually goes to a pub er it is on i think it's road but instead of coming this way he goes all the way into town up the other end you know past the hotel he lives at
mhm
valley
and he goes all the way down that end and round
right down past the big dole office in town up that way and then that way instead of coming through green
just to avoid green
just to avoid it
so how do you so how do you feel of the fact the fact that the flats are coming down shortly how do you feel about that
relieved
you feel relieved
yeah
cos i know that once the flats are down it's bound to be a better area but ten again it'll probably shove trouble to another area say like
or fields it'll just UNK trouble at somewhere else
mhm
you know when they pull the flats down they should say right we'll put fifty families in fifty families in fifty families at you know what i mean to split all the people what's in the flats up into different areas cos most of the people in the flats you know they all stick together sort of thing
mhm
and if a certain family gets stuck in with another family and they're both trouble UNK and they both get moved to the same area it's gonna cause trouble in that area so they ought to say right fifty there fifty there
mhm
you know
split them up that way
how do you find the actual what do you f do you think of the actual flat itself leaving out the problems that outside that you've in terms of crime you've referred to what do you think of the actual flat itself
rubbish
rubbish
yeah
yeah
erm
i mean the front UNK a long you can't put your furniture how you really want it you see cos you've got a bit sticking out there and then you've got this big sticking out here
i mean if these petitions weren't in it'd just be a square room
and then you've got the stairs which haven't got no door on so the kids can fall down the stairs
and then the bedrooms are cold and damp
you've got a lot of damp in these houses
and big UNK coming under the doors
i can't complain about the windows cos o you know i haven't had no UNK really but then you get UNK you know like UNK and bugs coming through these UNK
and is that does that is that ma is that a major problem has that been through since
i've no idea if it's a major problem or not
but every time we put our heating on you can guarantee you always get UNK so we d we don't have the heating on no more we just leave it off
i don't know where they come from they're breeding
do you leave it off even though you're paying you'll be paying won't you for the heating and it's
yeah but you st no you we pay er twelve pound fifty four a fortnight
that's for that's for heating yeah
that's for the heating whether we use it or not
so therefore you're a you're actually
so you're still losing out
yeah
anyway
i think they should've had
meters on the heating or summat
mhm
so you're paying for he you're paying for the
yeah
we're paying for the heating
heating and yet you're finding that because of the UNK that you don't want to put it on so you're UNK
yeah we can't put the heating on
you're losing out yeah
mind it's pretty warm anyway without the heating on really
but when you want to heat the bedrooms up you can't unless you only have it on for a bit you know
and then you have to keep see in one bedroom we've got a you've got a UNK
mhm
and that's where the back door is in the other bedroom you've got a UNK you know but it's not actually facing into the bedroom it's facing UNK towards the bathroom you know and the stairs
mhm
so you're not getting no heating there in that bedroom at all
cos there isn't no UNK in it and that's the one we sleep in cos we're frightened of people coming through the back door in the night you know kicking in the back door so we sleep in the other room
and our the baby she UNK in bed with us you know cos we're frightened in case UNK gets UNK through the window you know it might hit her so we put her in bed with us
to in order to protect her
yeah
yeah
see she's got a single bed down there but we don't let her sleep in it just she's stopping in bed with us cos no way am you know we might be sleeping here petrol bomb might come through your window on a night when there's a riot on
you know it might land on her bed see if it landed on our bed at least you can chuck the blankets off and protect her and take her out of the room but when she's in her own bedroom in a single bed you can't you can't do things like that
mhm
do you does she ever does she ever play out at all or
no
we never let her out the only time she goes out is when i take her to the shop
and when we go visiting her mum and my mum that's the only time she goes out
mhm going back to the actual erm house itself you ever had do you have you had any problems with repairs at all or have you found them okay when ever you've had any
have there been minor things that have gone wrong
things that are a bit the repairs have been alright really
yeah
have you ever had to have you ever had to actually have you had any major things that have gone wrong in the house or had it been okay
no the only thing what went wrong really was er a woman but that was in the top flat
yeah
she had a bust pipe and it all kept dripping through our ceiling
yeah
you know and it even went through to the next floor you know into the bedroom like
mhm
but they repaired it
it took them what she reported it as soon as the office opened and they'd done it at about ten twelve time
it took a long time for the UNK to come round but at least it was done you know that day
so i haven't no UNK with about the repairs
mhm
and they come round and sweep up outside or you know near enough every day
so repairs and in general 's alright
since you since you came into the flats have you have you been working at all or have you been erm
no
unemployed yeah
i've been unemployed
do you think yeah
there's another problem is say if you want to order a catalogue
yeah
from a you know a mail firm you can never get one
you can't
no
so you've tried that have you tried that
yeah
yeah
we've tried loads
we've ever tried UNK the television
you can't
you know a colour television cos you know we've only got that one
but you can't it's just impossible cos you live in the ar you know green you're like a second class citizen you know
yeah
you're classed you're classed as a reject sort of thing cos you're living in these flats
is that by er do you is that just is that with UNK firms or is that do you think that's general full stop
i think it's in general
you know just cos it's just cos it's a bad area that's all it is
it's not i mean when someone calls
do they tell you
green a bad area it's not the whole of green it's just the flats
cos this is where most of the trouble comes from when the UNK are on there's people come out of the flats to join the UNK
you know most of the people what was in the UNK come from the flats
and what happened then do you know
all the shops was UNK up and everything
so i think th the flats is the main problem round the green area
mhm
anyway
so when you said about a second rate citizen yeah
yeah
is that are you saying that you fee you feel living here that as a second rate citizen or you think other people see you
i think other people see you as a second class citizen
you know cos it you was living at
yeah
like her mum she's sent off for a cat catalogue she got it you know within thirteen days i think it was
but she got it
and she could order from it
mhm
and get things from it
and her sister who lives next door but one from her mums she done the same thing
so we've had to get things out of her sister's catalogue if we want them
cos the mail order round here you can't get one
you just can't get one
i've tried it just about every s catalogue there is near enough
and they've just said and they've said no they're not giving you a reason or
they just reject it you know they just say no
sometimes we don't even get a letter back
and with when you s said in terms of UNK a t v what's happened with them when you tried
well i went down to a UNK firm you know
yeah
in town and i gave them me name and me address and then they sent a letter saying no you can't have one
so i went down and said well why i can't have one
and they says well a person who lived in your flat before you had a telly you know and they gave me some excuse you know that the person who lived in here before me had ripped them off and they says how do we know that you're not that person you know things like that
so i tried another one and they says we can't give you one cos it's a bad address
so
so they said it's a bad address
yeah so that means that people who've been living here before has been UNK off and things like that
cos i as soon as i moved here i wanted a catalogue and a telly
cos i never had one anyway
you know cos we was more or less forced to move into the flat erm under the circumstances but we just heard no can't have one
bad address bad area bad everything
do you use in UNK in terms of going onto erm local shops do you use those at all
no i usually shop at myself
yeah
but if i find i want little bits an UNK what i need i just pop over the road
is that why is it that is it because you don't think the why is it you don't use the local shops is it because erm you prefer to go elsewhere
well i go to
cos it's cheaper anyway
yeah
and we go in car shopping and we always get our s shopping from you know with it being cheap and we go in her brother's car and so we don't have to carry it back all the way from but round here you see you'd have to go out you'd have to take the kid with you and your girlfriend and then you've got to come back with all the shopping and your kids as well
so
so it's more convenient for you
yeah
it's just more convenient that's all
i think the shops are alright round here but you know it's just a few of the shops are a bit you know funny
mhm
t er erm moving onto erm the area of erm the fact that obviously a lot of people round here have got very limited incomes
erm in t how di does that in any way affect you know the kind of things you eat or in terms of diet
well i suppose so yeah cos when you're on supplementary benefit
yeah
you don't get in enough money anyway really
so wha
i think that leads to crime in s as well in a way
mhm
so getting back you know the fact that you said about a limited income so what does that in terms of foods you buy what kind of things do you find do you buy actually s
well i don't i don't go out and buy biscuits
yeah
cos to me that is wasting money you know we just i just buy the UNK
you know what you need for your dinner
i never buy it of UNK so i i'll go to the shop and i'll say right probably seven tins of beans seven tins of peas er you know a few tins a few beans er tins of UNK and things like that you know bits and UNK but i'll still get a joint for me sundays
yeah
you know for me sunday dinner
and food a week we'll have UNK or UNK or things like that UNK
so i have to i sit there the week before i get the you know before i get the money i sit there and work it all out
you know what i'm gonna have for each meal over the
so that
and i have to sort it out sit there sort it out and then work out how much it's gonna come to and then i know then when i go to the shop i know what to get and i know when it goes in the cupboard i know that i'll have a meal for every day of the week
you know at least one big cooked meal
and i always buy a bag of potatoes you know a big
mhm
bag rather than keep buying it in a couple of pound and a couple of pound there
cos
and that lasts you
that lasts me about two and half week
mhm
a fifty six pound bag
milk we get milk tokens anyway
with being having a kid not long ago
so do you have milk delivered
no i nip over to the shop and get it from near
you know you get seven bottles for a token
and you have to pay a penny for each bottle summat like that
but in one in another shop you see it's twenty five pence
so i was caught with these milk tokens
at it's two pence
in UNK in terms of getting milk delivered i mean do many people get milk delivered or
i've never seen a UNK round here
isn't
i've never seen one
do you do you think you said that you're not sure whether the UNK comes round the flats
no idea i've never seen one round here
and i've been down here two year
mhm
i've only seen an ice cream van about four times since i've been here
what do you think when you actually erm when you look ahead to erm moving out of the flats and finding somewhere else where do you w where do you want to go to anyway
probably back round to
you'd like to go back to
yeah cos it's a better atmosphere at least you can walk round the streets safe
have you managed to make have you made any friends at all in the flats
no
none a well i don't associate with people in the flats
i just keep myself to myself
mhm
so why do f why do you feel that why is it you said you don't associate with the people in the flats why is that
cos i might go out one night and i might say i might meet up with a with a another white man or another you know a black man or something
yeah
and the next thing i could be on to drugs you know er putting UNK in me arm i could be doing anything
which is stupid you know
mhm
so i just keep myself to myself
cos the area's got a bad name for drugs anyway
in terms of drugs yes i mean is that do you actually know of erm is it is it what you've actually seen that makes you
no one of our friends she's on drugs
yeah
and
he he's been on everything here
yeah how did he does he live
he's still on them
he lives in the flats
so is it was it was she on dr erm drugs before he came to the flats or is it
no
since coming to the flats
no he wasn't on drugs before cos he used to live at valley
and he was alright then
it's just since he's been in the flats
now he's associated with the wrong sort of guys so he's UNK on to that stuff
and when i see i thought no way no way am i gonna do things like that
so that's the main reason why you keep to yourself
eh
you don't think you think
i mean he's been round here a few times
yeah
you know and smoking his joints and things like that but i never touch it
i used to tell him i used to say you you're stupid
you're stupid taking things like that cos it ruins you
mhm
see he has to send his UNK out UNK and things just to get money so he can buy drugs
and you say that it's since he's co it's the since he's come
it's since he's been
here
yeah since he's been in the flats yeah
is there much in terms of drugs do you actually are there many people in the flats who actually that are actually involved in drugs or
yeah
or take them yeah
well i've seen i've seen guys walking along UNK with joints in their hands you know smoking the joint as they're walking along
as they're walking along
yeah this one here
yeah
just out there
just outside you see them
walking through with drugs
yeah
and there's a flat over there on that walk what deals with drugs
er there's one up one er on the next walk down
and there's another one somewhere cos my friend he used to come round here with his drugs he used to tell me where they was you know
probably thought that i'd go an get some but i no way
that's one thing i want to try and keep off
you know being round here you might be tempted to do it but that's why i just keep in me flat and out of the way
what do you fee as a person do you feel in do you feel any different living here to elsewhere
ah i'm just more alert at night times you know
yeah
cos you never know what's gonna happen
so i i'm more alert i wake up earlier
you wake up earlier yeah
see at i'll wake up about eight or nine o'clock but round here you wake up at six
five and six in the morning and you're always UNK up in the middle of the night cos you don't know you know if UNK happened or UNK gonna happen
i'm always UNK up in the night
like last night i couldn't get to sleep
you couldn't get to sleep
i didn't i didn't get to sleep till about two o'clock
and then i woke up again and i come upstairs to look at the clock and it was half past three
and i went back down to bed and i got up again at five went back there then the baby wake up at seven so i come up and stayed up
so that's because of erm
that's just cos she's UNK
yeah
you know you don't know what's gonna happen next
you're not sure you know what's happening and what's going on
so that's very different so you feel different very different to when you lived in
oh yeah cos when we lived at you see you could just go to sleep and that's it you knew that nowt was gonna happen
you knew nothing was gonna happen at
could just go to sleep and enjoy a good night's UNK and wake up in the morning
and everything's
mhm
just the same as it was the night before you know
but round here you could go to sleep wake up in the morning and half the UNK have been burnt down and shops have been UNK and you don't know where you are
if you if any of if you have say er any problems with the people in the flats that you could actually go to would help you in any way
oh i've no idea really
is it i mean do you know many people in the flats who you could actually rely on if you ever if you were
no i don't know anybody in the flats
so you so the two years you've been here you've not managed to really get to know many people
wouldn't want to know
i wouldn't want to know anybody anyway round here
i mean cos if you got to know someone they might be might be UNK or you might get in you know et to know somebody else and they might be a big crime organization
mhm
never know
what do in terms of erm terms of prostitution is that act is that does that bother you or are you not bo bothered really about the fact that goes on in the area
i'm not really bothered about prostitution meself
i mean som you know i suppose they've got to make a living some how you know with the money you get off social
but the only thing that does bother me about it is when they get you know school kids coming out of school and going straight on streets on road
you know little kids coming out of school and going straight on the road
that's the
mhm
only thing that UNK you know
mhm
so i can say that really what worries you is more the crime and the drugs much more than prostitution as far as prostitution you're saying that basically there's a
ah no i mean cos violence and drugs is more harmful than a load of girls you know doing stupid things on s street corner
yeah
i mean you know drugs and violence they're the things in life what can really hurt you and damage you
mhm
i mean prostitution can't hurt you they can't damage you i don't think
mhm
you know when you actually when you er finally when you leave here will you be obviously the UNK coming down you're gonna be leaving it here
and they told me my UNK and go you know i can move i'm gonna pack everything before even a house comes through
i'm gonna go round and collect everything up and pack it up
i'm just gonna leave certain things out what i need to use till my house comes through
do you since as soon as you've got any clue you're gonna start packing stuff up ready and
that's it all the pictures are coming off the wall and everything
they're all going in boxes
oh yeah
i'm just gonna pack them in one bedroom and leave them there
even if it takes four week they're stopping there
you've told me UNK quite a lot about er yes quite a lot of the bad points are there are there any is there anything at all any good points at all about living here
i don't think so
you've not found any at all
no
i mean some of the pubs are quite nice
but then again you see you always get trouble in an in another one
mhm
you can come out of a nice pub and go into another bad UNK
mhm
so when you've actually gone into pubs have you do you ever go just you and your girlfriend into thi into this pub
never go on us own
we always go out in a group
because why is that is yeah
for the simple reason you know you one of the if someone starts on one person in our group all the rest of the group can get together and get them
mhm
and
what's it like have you ever have you ever when you first came here did you go did you ever go in the pubs
no
with just your girlfriend then
we never went out
didn't go out at all
the only time we went out is ice UNK and that was in town just go out ice UNK now and again
the only time we've ev you know in pubs round here is like i said when it's someone's birthday in the family
mhm
and we all go out together
that's the only time we'll come round green
yes is that is that because of erm fear that
fear really you know violence you know
i mean her s her dad he come down green not so long back to go onto the market what's that you know just outside the flats
to the market that's here every wednesday
yeah
yeah
and he went into the to the pub
yeah
and he went into the toilets and there was a lot of coloured men there do you want to buy some UNK
you know he only went to he only went for a UNK you know what i mean that UNK five pound and ten pound deals at him and he's going no you can you know
in terms of erm the blues parties have what's your view on those
do you hear much about them or
well there used to be one
yeah
on the end of this walk that used to bother me cos it used to be going till four and five in the mo you know in the morning
and then when it finishes you've got all the guys coming out shouting and screaming and running about through the flats the music never bothered me it was just the you know the guys coming out after that bothered you
cos you didn't know whether they'd had er you know had a lot to drink or had a load of drugs and start going on the UNK or something
mhm
but they'd never have bothered me
it's the blues that never been never been much of a problem really
no
bothered you
it's like that one there they left er i they left the blues and then the tr trouble was caused you see
mhm
so you're saying yeah
see it's not the blues that bother me i don't think it's just the fact that there's there might be trouble afterwards
you know like then
mhm
like a couple there they got UNK
yeah
and that was after the blues finished
when you had the blues erm near by you said at one time that it was just away from here was there was there any was it was there any bother after that after the blues then or was it okay
no i never heard no more
mhm
you know you could hear you could hear them shouting you know UNK and things like that
mhm
but there was never any trouble
mhm
not with the blues
is it you know in terms of erm in the flats f erm is there any how do people you know of different you know white and coloured people do they get on o okay or is or is there is there a problem there or not
i don't really know myself but i
yeah
i find that i get on with UNK anyway quite well
you know cos i know a lot of coloured from different areas
yeah and that's the
and most of them moved down to green as soon as it was built
yeah
so i find that UNK and UNK get on alright anyway
so i don't think there's any problem with that
so you don't think there's any problem at all there
no
no
i think we'll just right erm you lived in you were born in is that alright saying that
yeah
or and you lived there right through until you were fifteen
then you went to valley and
yeah
yeah
so do you fe obviously in terms of particularly because you lived there right throughout right up right up until you were fifteen how did it c how does it compare living there with here
well it's a lot better
yeah
i mean there's no drugs and prostitution and there's not much violence round
there's a lot of burglaries round i admit yeah but there's not much violence and drugs and things like that so i used to think it was good living round
you know cos at least you've got a few fields for the kids to play on and you've got a decent park you've got a nice pub just down the road and then you've got the big sports hall
you've got a golf course you've got quite a few things round here you've even you've got your school just a bit you know up past
you've got the church community centre infant school and junior school combined and a nursery so you know it's all within a little community sort of thing
mhm
and how does that compare
but i think got worse when valley was built cos you know there was more families moving from different parts of t to move you know live at valley
that's when you know they got more crime committed round and valley then cos there was a lot more kids up there
mhm
but before that it was best you know it was just all farm land it was brilliant you know
mhm
and does it UNK
yeah
wake up to the sound of chickens you know sheep and horses and things like that
it was just great
mhm
so what how does it compare now would you sa is that kind of erm the other places that you've lived at you know you've lived at valley and
how do the how do you see those areas as comparing you mean you were UNK you said they bit they were better how do they compare with living here do you think
well i think if i had a if i had a choice where to live
yeah
out of them four
yeah
valley and green i'd pick first and then second i'd pick valley third would be and last would be green
mhm
would be the last place possible
it would
yeah
if someone a obviously it's what i'm asking is hypothetical anyway because i mean the flats are coming down so no one new can move in but say you actually if it was possible for other people to move into these flats and you knew someone and they said erm you know i'm thinking of moving into green flats what would you say
i'd tell them no
i'd say you don't want to move here
i'd i was i was glad when they said no more can move into green cos i was thinking well my sister's getting a house soon and my other sister she's getting a house and i don't want them two living round here as well cos the me mam and dad won't be able to see them either you know if they move into the flats so i was glad
mhm
so how did they react to you when you your mum and dad when you actually when you moved in here
you said they haven't been round do they do they tend to keep away from here so how did they react when you actually first
well
got the flat yeah
they just says where you living again
so i says walk at green
and they says is that near the pub
i says yeah
and they says oh well we're not coming down that area then to visit you
i says why
she says cos there's a lot of drugs and that being you know pushing round that pub
and i says well there's nothing wrong with that i mean i says i'm not taking them or UNK
she goes no but the point is that people kill for drugs which probably is right i don't know so she says we're just not coming down
she says you know it's not being funny or UNK but she said but you could still visit us but we're not coming down green
no way
it's just the area
but we still get on alright you know we're still a close family ever though she don't come to visit
mhm
do you find yeah the fact you said that you've got your close family do you find the fact you're a close family does that does that help you know the fact that you said that you haven't got
yeah
many people round here
no
yeah it does help us
yeah
you know cos at least i can still go out and visit all my family even if they can't come down here
mhm
how will it be actually living here
you know cos you said that you di there's no there's no one who you really know round here
and if you UNK have a close family
i think it would be some who doesn't have a close family because there'll be some people round here who probably won't
i don't know i just think we'd be a lonely you know on us own
sort of thing cos i wouldn't mix with anyone round green
so i think we'd just stay here and UNK
and then you know till we move
right
thanks very much
right so erm
you you're the manager of erm the building society in
yes
erm how long has this branch been in
we opened end of nineteen eighty so just over six years now
mhm
and very successful it's been too
mhm
very pleased to be here
and the performance both at this branch and as a spin off our city centre branch in street which has benefited from us being here and the contacts we m we've made while been here
excellent
mhm
very pleased
what you know when a building society is you know when it when a new branch is opened up
erm you know some people would say you know er seeing the kind of publicity that has had that it would be it might be quite risky to er to o open the business of a building society here
erm so what kind of what kind of research goes into erm choosing where to actually site one
well we had we had to look into it very carefully
we looked into this are in terms of the population here
the potential we could receive here erm the kind of people who live here the numbers of people who live here now and in the future the types of housing and housing again in the future and all in all a g a great deal of study went into the area
mhm
and in the end we decided to open here
there was three main reasons
firstly there are there were no other building societies here anyway
mhm
so we we've UNK the market as it were
no real competition there
er secondly we've got a link with the large tobacco factory
group savings schemes and such like which have been in existence for many years
and with the factory being so close it would offer them a service by being closer to them and improve our links
and thirdly related to that point with there were a lot of existing members in this area anyway
so it seemed sensible to move into this area take advantage of that for ourselves and provide them with a better service
and again that has proved successful
mhm
so this is an example of erm a business that which has moved to and done very well
very well indeed yes
we're very pleased
very successful
mhm
in terms of local people erm have you got many local people who are customers
yes
in the su around about this area the local housing estates a great many of our investing members just live practically round the corner so we get to know them very well
for the mortgage side we've got a lot of properties in the area that are UNK
but this particular branch has got a large area stretching out like as far as
a lot of out mortgage business comes form the more UNK districts
i think it's fair to say the majority of our investing members just live round and about
mhm
again due to the local er schemes and such like
got a lot of members from there
which we see in very regularly
mhm
the fact the fact that erm this branch is erm situated in a fairly disadvantaged erm area erm does that have any implications at all
or not
erm i wouldn't think so w it means that we have to get to know the local clients very well indeed
we get to know their problems better ad understand them better
we get to know them better
which means we can provide a better service
it means we our staff are able to take more time er to understand and advise our clients which we need to do
erm and there's no real problems because of the area i wouldn't think
mhm
but er in fact it's probably an advantage because the people who come in are generally they're very friendly they're they've got a good spirit amongst themselves
and we find it's a warm friendly area which er a UNK possibly a bigger more higher UNK environment wouldn't get
mhm
er
yeah
so you're saying it actually has quite a lot of advantages
mm
yes
th the people round here are excellent
mhm
and there seems to be a good spirit around and yeah we're very pleased to be here you know
mhm
we've found a lot of UNK and warmth
how does that co you spoke about UNK and warmth here how does it compare working with the other places you've worked at
previously i've worked in city centre environments
which i have enjoyed it's been er a bit of a challenge coming here because in the city centre business wise you're surrounded by the UNK such as estate agents and solicitors
and the membership your investors had to actually make the effort to come to you
whereas here the situation is reversed
erm we're surrounded by the membership and it's actually me which has to go out to visit the estate agents and solicitors and such like
but i found in the city centre that er i did enjoy working there but it can be a bit of a cold and UNK place because it's so such a rapid pace of life
mhm
whereas here you're still very busy but er you have the membership just on your doorstep and you can get to meet them and know them a lot closer than you would when you're having er a large volume of people filing through your doors in the city centre
mhm
if you said you preferred to work here you preferred working here to other places
i think i do yes
i did enjoy going to the city centre but so far er in the few months i've been in i've enjoyed it tremendously yes
mhm
when i s first spoke to you erm earlier i mean like last week erm you were telling me er something about erm the involvement that this branch has had with the local community
so what do you think about that
yes with the membership being on the doorstep we do get to know them a lot better
er we do have to get involved with the community and we just find ourselves drawn into the community without any real problems
we've been able to advise and help the members
and enabled us to be to be known throughout the local streets the local UNK and such like
so we find ourselves drawn in very easily
on a more specific nature we've sponsored a five a side football competition at the local leisure centre for the last couple of years
providing the UNK getting to know the people involved and getting publicity obviously for ourselves from that which has been very UNK very enjoyable
er we're involved in the local UNK recently
er had a stall there again getting to know the people involved
various other things there's the local day centre
which is a local centre for physically handicapped adults
we've got to know the people who run the centre fairly well
erm helping out whenever we can
and helping them with advice as well
so all in all yeah we get we get involved with the community as much as possible
both as a conscious decision because of the business we do er need to be known around the area
and also for the enjoyment and personally the satisfaction you get rather than going home at five o'clock and forgetting all about
much rather be involved and i find it much more UNK personally
mhm
in terms of erm the fact that you've got f erm fairly UNK ethnic minority population
mm
erm what kind of efforts have been made to get customers
first of all we offer a good a service as possible we try to get to know the individuals and help them and give them individual advice
erm i think that's ab the best that though we can get word of mouth erm getting to know the individuals
erm also w we've had several window displays er reflecting the local issues
such as we had an exhibition of UNK art last year from a local UNK just up er road a little bit
and that produced a lot of interest
from the local community
had people coming in they noticed that we aren't just a building there offering financial services but we were actually interested again in the local community
and the interest which bore out was of great use
it wasn't the kind of display which we could have had in a city centre environment er but in this area er it shows that we're UNK to people's needs and we care about what goes on
and it helped
the individuals the members to see that we cared about what their interests were
and they came in and UNK to us about it
er it was very UNK
mhm
went very well
and it's something which we're doing again in the future
mhm
with regard to the flats i mean one o erm the flats have been up since the late sixties and erm now they're gonna be coming down
mm
and they erm were a large area of housing in the local area
erm what do you feel about the fact that those are gonna be coming down
i think the flats still have a stigma about them
they're a lot of the problems in tend to be directed towards or because of the flats
they're certainly a controversial issue
erm so if they do come down or when they do come down i think it will benefit the area as long as something better is UNK is there to replace them
erm i think very many people live in the flats sort of thing and they're going to need UNK
a lot of them are going out of the area but i think er i'd imagine that a large majority or a large proportion certainly would wish to stay in
and the first priority must be to find them suitable replacement housing
i've noticed in and there's a lot of new town houses being built
new brick built standard sort of more traditional type housing which are very attractive and appear to be very well built
and i think that could be the area or the type of development which could go on the flats
mhm
er the present flat site
er new housing has to be a priority in this area i should have i would think
and this type of more traditional housing er would be preferable
mhm
n my in my mind
my opinion
mhm
going back to what you said earlier on er on this question erm you mentioned that erm the flats were subject to controversy
mm
erm what are the kind o obviously you've been here a few months
mm
erm what are the kind of comments that people have made to you about the flats
concerning the flats
i mean how have they been seen by local mu community
how you know w what kind of views do people have
yes we have
a lot of a lot er of members who actually live in the flats and all of our members practically know about the flats and the general impression is that they are a in a way a friendly and er a community type place
but they're very disadvantaged and they're a bit of an UNK
generally
so the impression which i get from the locals is that they'll be happier when the flats are down
as long as they're replaced by something which is an improvement
mhm
the general feeling is get the flats away and the place will improve
mhm
and that generally comes form the flat owners which i've talked to meself
mhm
do you so you've got quite a f some customers from the flats
mm
certainly yes some people who live in the flats come along to the branch quite regularly and generally the impression which they give me is that they'll they will be happier when they're the flats have been replaced
mhm
you personally would like some kind of UNK some housing to be put there
personally yes this isn't er a policy view but living in the ar or living around the area working in this area i think the area could be improved if s the flats were replaced by something which looked more attractive
because the don't look attractive
mhm
and er they seem to be the cause of all the problems
if they could be improved by er sorry replaced by housing of a higher standard erm generally made to look more attractive UNK and such like then i think the area as a whole will improve and it'll attract people to the area
mhm
which i think should be er an important er an important idea in their minds
in the minds of the people who decide what's going to replace them with
mhm
what about for local businesses erm what do you think could be done to actually to attract more businesses to the area
i think the first thing is to improve the appearance because the area itself appears to me to be to be thriving
there's a lot of larger shops we've got boots just over the road and er a lot er of good businesses round about
there's one or two empty shops but they appear to be moving fairly quickly and getting taken over
so the important thing i would say is just to improve the physical appearance
because a lot of the shops and house UNK which the bus routes are on the main roads are on do look UNK
and if they could be given a better appearance then the people who see them the people who drive through on th main road such as road and UNK they could see that the area isn't as run down as often the medium makes it out to be
