erm to me it is a thriving and very good community and all it really needs is to look as it's thriving
mhm
erm perhaps money could be spent on face lifting the areas because a lot of the structures the s themselves seem very stable and sound
it's just the actual a UNK of paint here and there basically and
mhm
erm other areas in which i've lived in i lived in the in an area in hull where the whole of this inner city area was UNK simply by giving things new front doors and new UNK and drainage and UNK up the small gardens that there were and providing things such as UNK
this was all done by er a local authority grant
and the whole street was UNK in a in a in a UNK
and that kind of thing on a perhaps a little larger scale could work here i think
mhm
yeah that's quite interesting
that's an example having worked somewhere
mm
and er the response there and that
yes
works
how well did it work
that worked very well indeed er over a period of what twelve to eighteen months the whole street which was mainly residential was brought up to standard up to a higher standard simply by providing new UNK
mhm
erm th the bits of the properties which people actually saw
and that produced a spin off effect because the people who actually lived in properties or the UNK in the properties they could see that the UNK were improved and that provided a UNK for them to provide the UNK
and it certainly got er the community spirit going and got everyone working together
someone had given the UNK to sort the outside external improvements for starters and that provided the UNK to for them to do the internal work
and as a whole the whole street was improved very quickly
mhm
and it was very successful
i mean a do you think that kind of thing would work here
i think it could do
yes
erm as i say the people here ha have got the spirit enough the they they're quite happy to improve the area the they want to see the area erm go up
there's a lot of pride in the area
and if they were given the opportunity or and the UNK to start to do something positive i'm sure they would take that up
mhm
just talking about there about the people in the area
mm
erm how much community spirit have you found does exist
very much so
erm perhaps the since i came to the area about four months ago the thing that i've noticed most is the people are very proud and they're very friendly very open people
and s we get a mixture a large mixture of people coming to our office because this type of area we are a building society er w we see all manner of people coming in here and the way in which the they mix very well
complete strangers come in start chatting to us and to each other and the as an area it seems to pull everyone together
they realize that they have problems and but they seem so willing to stand by each other and the spirit which i've noticed is very h
so direct UNK
and inverse
not too much trouble with that
okay if erm so one of the questions that comes up a lot is speed and distance and time
and that's a good example of both types there
so let's say we keep the erm you've got to get from here to birmingham
if you go faster erm what happens to the time it takes
less time
right
so if i go twice as fast does that mean it's gonna take me twice as long to get there
no
no
so it's UNK proportional
yeah
if i go twice as fast it'll take me one over two so that's a half as long
okay right
if i go ten times as fast i get there in one tenth of the time
and that's all it is
that's all the inverse UNK
direct UNK if i'm driving at a steady sixty miles an hour how far would i go in erm one hour
sixty miles
how far would i go in ten hours if i'm going at a steady sixty miles an hour
how far would i go
doing sixty miles every hour and i keep going for ten hours
so
six hundred
so i do six hundred miles
erm if i've got sixty miles to do and i do it at erm do it at sixty miles an hour it takes me one hour
if i do it at half the speed just do it at thirty miles an hour how long will that take
two hours
if i do it at half the speed
trying to cover a distance
trying to cover sixty miles okay trying to cover sixty miles so i do it again at sixty miles an hour
takes one hour
now if i do it at half that speed if i do if i drive at thirty miles an hour how long will it take me to do the sixty miles
two hours
right
two hours
so this is the speed and distance and time thing gets very confusing because some of it is direct proportional right so the faster you go the more distance you could travel in a fixed in an hour say
obviously sixty miles an hours means if you keep going for an hour you do sixty miles
thirty miles an hour keep going for an hour you'll only do thirty
so how far you go is directly proportional to how fast
yeah
if you say how far would you go in an hour keep the time fixed so we're not changing all three things cos then it's really confusing
so keep one of them fixed
change another one
so it's keep the first one fixed change the second one and see how the third one changes
and most of it if you try and do it with sort of the UNK on the paper
equations this one go on the top or the bottom of the fraction or what
but if you just back off bit
and you think well hang on let's just do it a bit of common sense
and apply it to say driving along at steady speeds then you can work a lot of it out for yourself
and erm you'll get should get happier with that
so let's try a few examples
erm for you to do
when i say let's try i mean you can try some
so if we've got let's say sixty miles an hour
a fixed speed of sixty miles an hour
and we want to travel a hundred a hundred and twenty miles
how long will that take
two hours
that will take two hours
and suppose i go twice as fast
right double the speed if i drive at a hundred and twenty
now how long w will it take me
one hour
that's only half the time it took me last time
so that's a half of two which is one hour
okay so here
twice the speed
erm what would happen if i drive at a tenth of the speed
one tenth of the speed
i drive at six miles an hour
hey it's the original time which was two hours is times it's times a tenth
no
no is that right
what's going on here
if i drive at a tenth of the speed is it gonna take me longer or is it gonna take me is it gonna be quicker
longer
it's gonna be longer so it can't be a tenth of it
no
right here we went at twice the speed and it finished up half the time
now we're driving a tenth of the speed so it's going to be one over one tenth
which is ten times
so it would take me twenty hours of i drive at six miles an hour
yeah
right
and that ties up when you get it like this a tenth of the speed
what we've got now is it's directly proportional but they've got a fraction in
so it's making it look like inverse proportion and the first thought is oh it l er oh
well it'll take a tenth of the time wouldn't it
no it takes ten times as much
half the speed it'll take you twice as long
erm that's thinking of a steady speed
that's a fixed speed
i'm just sort of rushing through this a bit and i'm trying to show where the where most people get it wrong
erm and so you can watch out for those the UNK
now if it's a fixed distance fixed distance let's say we're going to go a hundred and twenty miles
right and we're not gonna change the distance now we're keeping that fixed
if we drive at sixty miles an hour
erm we've done the time there
right
er right
what are we do hang on let's just check what we're doing with this
fix first one we did was fixed speed sixty miles an hour we go double the speed so what happens to the time
er that should have been a fixed a fixed distance there
fixed distance
a fixed distance er sixty miles say
er say a fixed distance of a hundred and twenty miles
that's more like it
okay
and it we drive it at sixty miles an hour for two hours
now if we keep the distance er let's see that was the fixed distance
if we keep the speed fixed now we have do the one i should have done first
fixed speed of sixty miles an hour
okay
and we'll try how long would we go in how far in one hour
sixty miles
right
okay
how far in erm three and a half hours
a hundred and fifty miles an
that was very good
that was brilliant yeah
yeah exactly
how did you work that out
well it's double that hang on
it's close
mm
how far would we go in three hours
at a steady sixty miles an hour
how far would we go
a hundred and eighty
right
so we'll go a hundred and eighty in the first three hours
and how long would we go in the last half hour
thirty
and we'd do another thirty miles
yeah
okay
so two hundred and
two hundred and ten
two hundred and ten miles we do
now you can do that straight off
instead of doing it a bit at a time we can just multiply it
and say three and a half times sixty
just do it that way which is what you'd normally do on your calculator you'd just do sixty times three point five
now that's a very quick look
erm don't worry if you don't understand it all
now UNK you got the problem that you had
yeah i've got it here
well look through that and i wa what i want now is if you can try and work your way through it
without okay
go on
you haven't seen it yet
well er if it's a messy one the first thing to do with it is to split it up into little bits
i noticed
this one
a and b are okay
i can get that
ah
it's c and d
right
six swallows ate three hundred flies in five hours
complete the following
six swallows eat sixty flies in how many hours
right
and how many swallows would eat six thousand flies in five hours
right erm okay talk about it
you said a and b were okay
how did you do a
yeah
well you had six eating three hundred so yo i divided three hundred by six
and UNK it by thirty
and that gave me how many flies were gonna be eaten
okay and why did you divide it that way round
cos the number of flies into swallows
okay
so this is a bit like the speed and the distance and the time and things isn't it
all combined
yeah
erm so we need really equations for all of these
cos they're like if you like
so let's have a look at it could you could you find out from the question here six swallows ate three hundred flies in five hours
can you find out how many flies one swallow would eat in one hour
or could you find out how many flies one swallow would eat in five hours
yeah
yeah
how would you do that
so we've got six swallows eat three hundred flies in five hours
okay
how many would one eat in five hours
okay
fifty
right
so one swallow would eat fifty in five hours
how much would one swallow eat in one hour then
ten
okay so you you've got it now that one swallow eats one fly erm sorry eats ten flies
ten flies in one hour
in an hour
i'll write that down
okay so write that and then we'll check it
right
now let's check it
let's see if it gets back to what they said there
six swallows erm would they how many would six swallows eat in one hour
sixty
okay
so we that'll just we multiply that by six
or how much six swallows would eat
and you get sixty
right and how much would they so if they if these six swallows are eating sixty
three hundred
in one hour
erm
that's it
er in five hours
right so if we're looking at what are they asking for here
how long will they take and how many swallows and on this one how many flies
right
so which ones are proportional to what
if you've got more swallows do more flies get eaten
yeah
and if you've got more time for them to eat do more flies get eaten
yeah
so they're both directly proportional
okay
now just talk about c
now that you've worked out how many one swallow eats in one hour
swallows
er
how many would they eat in how many would six swallows east in one hour
sixty
okay
it says here six swallows eat sixty flies in
six hours
how many hours
six hours
well we've got here we've got one swallow eats ten flies in one hour
okay
we have six times as many swallows if we have six swallows
just write down how many six swallows will eat in one hour
so just write it as six times ten or ten times six
okay
are you happy with that
yeah
one of them will eat ten flies every hour so if we got six of them it'll be ten times six
in one hour
and that comes to sixty and the question here is six swallows eat sixty flies in how many hours
so what's the answer to that one
one hour
just one hour
okay
so you've done c
yeah
now d
how many swallows would eat six thousand flies in five hours
well six of them eat three hundred right
if they going to get through six thousand are you going to need more swallows or less swallows
more swallows
okay
so have a guess at what you multiply or divide by there
just to not sort of working out just what you see it probably is
six thousand divide by three hundred
that's it
six thousand divided by three hundred
erm and what about the six that's where that comes in and starts confusing things isn't it
yeah
so if you just did six thousand divided by three hundred
it wouldn't tell you how many swallows it would tell you how many lots of six swallows would east that
then you multiply it by six
then you have to you've got what your answer let let's say we keep our swallows in UNK
right six swallows in each cage
and we sort of go and feed them three hundred flies every five hours
and then somebody comes along and says oh we've got a some big order on we're got to feed them six thousand flies in five hours
so you first thing you says well how many UNK are there then
one cage one cage of swallows get through three hundred in five hours so six thousand divided by three hundred
that would be the number of UNK of
UNK
swallows
that
yeah
you'd need to get through the six thousand flies
and then you say now how many how many swallows in a cage
and you said multiply by didn't you
yeah
sorry that's right
yeah multiply by
so six thousand yeah it's alright problem
six thousand by divided by
three
three hundred tells you how many UNK you need
and there's six swallows in every cage so when you get that answer you just multiply it by six
so you want to work that one out
what that'll come to
and er just sort of work it out on here cos a UNK cancel
we'll start from six swallows eat three hundred
yeah
are you are you are you happy with this or am i confusing you
i think i'm confusing
yeah
you actually
no i get i get the idea there
yeah
six thousand divide by that
yeah i get that
mm
that
i don't know what you mean by cancelling down though
ah
you know i i've cancelled down before but you know in this like
in
right
down like this
never cancelled d i've cancelled down like equations and things
right if you're cancelling down
you were doing erm six thousand divided by three hundred that tells you how many UNK and there's six swallows in every cage times six
okay
now this was flies that the old ones ate flies the new ones ate
there's going to be eating more flies so you need more swallows so that looks the right way up
and we weren't thinking about how many one ate we were thinking about how many six ate
so it'll take more of them
so we can cancel that
divide three by a hundred
sorry divide three hundred by a hundred
what do we get
three
and divide this by a hundred what do we get
sixty
okay and then divide that by three
one
and that by three
three
no
how many threes in six
two
okay
so it just comes to
a hundred and twenty
a hundred and twenty
erm don't bother about that about the cancelling
erm no
do it do it on your calculator just put the figures in and do it
but then think about it when you got your answer if it seems okay
er this is this is the one that you get a lot
about cars doing journeys
and this is the other big one that you get about erm food
that's the other one too
four men do a job in twelve hours
how many men would it take to do the job in two hours
right
this sort of thing
twelve men build a wall in eight hours
how long would it take four men to do it
so let's just talk about that without doing erm a particular example
er twelve men take so they're building a wall or something
twelve men take eight hours
okay
erm how many men would we need if we wanted it built in four hours
just to just to guess at it without sort of working it out
what would you say
s twenty four men
right
if you want it done in half the time you've got to have twice as many people
yeah
yeah
erm that's inverse proportion that's the hard one and i think you understand what you're doing
yeah
very well actually in there
erm you'll see a lot of them like this
four men
try nine
completely on your own then
four men do a job in twelve hours
how many to do the job in two hours
forty eight men
now how did you work it out
well it takes fo four men twelve hours to do the job
so in two hours you've got to have twelve times as many men as you've already got
oh
where do you get your twelve from
here
let's make it a slightly different problem
UNK say erm four men take twelve hours
okay
how many men would you need to do the job in six hours
eight men
right
you only spend half the time you have twice as many men
how long how many how many men would you need if you want it done in a quarter of the time
if you wanted it done in three hours
twelve men
twelve men
let's forget about the numbers
let's say we don't know how many men there's erm just one gang of men
so we dunno how many men in a gang
and it takes them twelve hours to do this job
and the foreman comes up and says oh want this job in half the time
so we need two gangs to do it
if he comes up and he says well we want this job done in a quarter of the time
four times
four times as many
he says we want this job done in a tenth of the time
ten times
yeah
ten times as many
if he says oh well this isn't a rush job we want this job to take twice as long as usual
UNK the half the
that's it
just have half the number of men working on it and then it'll take twice as long
okay
now in this case four of them will take twelve hours
let's say four men is one gang
so forget about you know like think of a cage of swallows
that's one gang
so one gang of men take twelve hours
what we want is only two hours
so how many gangs are we going to need
are we going to need more men or less more gangs or less gangs
to get it done in
more gangs
we're going to do more
going to need more
so we want to do this is in a sixth of the time right
we want it done two twelfths of the time
that's how many gangs erm that's two twelfths of the time so it's one sixth
this is one sixth of the time
now we want this job in one sixth of the time
that is takes on gang to do
six more gangs
so we'll need six gangs all together
okay
cos that comes to one sixth
we need six gangs
one sixth of the time
so six gangs
okay
and then you can think of i mean this is this is just sort it can be there to confuse you while you're sorting out the time
and when you're sorted it out they want six gangs so that's six times four
so we need twenty four men
UNK
on that one
there's four men in that gang
now going back to it
so that was four men do it in twelve hours how many in two
erm let's see if
oh that's nasty that because they've got six in both of them
six women do a job in eight hours
how many women will it take to do the job in six hours
two
think about that one
are you going to need more women or less women
more women
gonna need more
so which way up is the fraction going to go
the first thing to do is forget about the six for a minute
right it's not six women it's one gang
right one gang take eight hours
so how many gangs are you going to need to get this job done in six hours
well two gangs are gonna get it done in four hours
right two gangs in four hours so we don't need two whole gangs
yeah
so that'd be too many
so one gang takes eight hours
how many gangs would take six hours
this is where it's the inverse proportion
it's going to take eight over six
right
eight over six which comes to
one and one and a bit gangs
that seems to that looks sensible it seems to
so it's eight over six gangs
and how many in a gang
six
six
so the number of women that we'll want is eight over six times six
that'll just cancel that
and we finish up with eight women
well that's interesting because six women do the job in eight hours and it would take eight women to do it in six hours
so if we had something like that page
have you ever heard of the term man hours
yeah
it takes so many man hours
erm like to UNK a house well no let's say in a factory there's erm they've a rush order they want to get some stuff out and they're going to need another hundred and twenty man hours
to get this job done
now man hours is just men times hours
and if you look at this i mean this is actually women hours but if you look at that
see what happened with this one that we worked out
four men do the job in twelve hours
how many man hours do we need altogether
how many man hours does this job take
four times twelve
that's it four times twelve
so number nine the job takes four men times twelve hours equals four times twelve man hours
okay
now if i wanted this job done in six hours how many men would i need
er
four men take twelve hours
i want the job done in six hours
eight men
i'd make i'd take eight be twice as much
now if i said how long would three men take to do it
it's a bit awkward isn't it
yeah
but one way of looking at it is well the job takes forty eight man hours
forty eight man hours
so how long how many hours would three men have to work before they'd made up forty eight man hours
forty eight divided by three
right
so three men times x if you like x hours equals forty eight man hours
and you can all of these all of the ones where they say so many men or women take so long to do a job how many
you can do them all just be looking at that
you see multiply what they give you
right
the men times the hours
and that's fixed
that's how many man hours that job takes
and then if they say well so three men would take forty eight divided by three hours
yeah
yeah
okay e divided each side by three x equals forty eight over three
erm it takes forty eight man hours
if i said i want this job done in two hours
how would you work it out
the job takes forty eight man hours and i want it done in two hours
so how many men would we need
forty eight hours
well that's three men
yes when there were three men right when there were three men that's how many hours it took
now a different problem erm it still takes forty eight man hours but this time how many men to do the job in two hours
is it going to take more men or less men to get this job done
more men
mm
so you can work it that way you can think of that as a check
but the easy way as i say is to just concentrate on the man hours
this job whatever it is it takes forty eight man hours
so if you multiply the number of men by the h number of hours they work it's going to always come to forty eight
so if you'd like er we don't know how many men
let's say it's x
x times two hours has got to be equal to
forty man hours
right that's got to be and that's x men times fo times two hours equals forty eight man hours
that's man hours
okay
divide each side of your equation by two hours
x men is equal to forty eight man hours
over two hours
yeah
right
i see that
the hours go oh lovely
thanks very much
do you want that window shut
i'm fine as long it's not too noisy for you
are you sure
if no i'm thinking of you know erm
great fine okay
if you want to shut it anyway just get up okay
thanks
yeah
no i like the fresh air
okay so the hours would cancel off there
how many twos in that
twenty four
so you take UNK twenty four men to do the job in two hours
in two hours
now how many man hours would we use up if we had twenty four men working for two hours
we'd have twenty four
forty eight
that's it
twenty four times two man hours
so any of th this is a very common problem that you get
so many men digging a ditch building a wall digging a hole whatever it is
and you just they always tell you so many men take so long to do it
well how many man hours
so try one completely on your own
i won't say a word this time
i UNK you to do the lot
and i'll turn that over so you can't see that
okay
erm and i want you to tell me what you're thinking and how you're going through it and so let's see if i can find one of those
er here we are the first one here
fifteen men can build a wall in six hours
oh it's too easy this cos you can do it in your head
erm right this is better
four men can build a shed in nine hours
okay
how long would it take six men
keep going
alright
nine hours
erm four divide by nine multiplied by six
okay
now that's just sort of coming out with the answer
i'm not saying whether it's right or wrong but how did you get to it
because i want to find out how many men it'd take you to do the job in one hour
it's not that
yes
yeah
that's one way of looking at it
how many men would you take to do the job in one hour sort of thing is you're working out how many man hours th are there in this job
okay you just multiply the number of men times the number of hours and that gives you the man hours
and that doesn't change
that's always fixed
you always need so many man hours to do it
so wh how many man hours are there in that job
four times nine
right
four times nine man hours to do the job
so how many hours so that comes to
thirty six
yeah
thirty six man hours in this job
okay
and how many hours would six men have to work for before they worked thirty six man hours
if six men worked for one hour UNK work six man hours wouldn't they
if they worked for if six men worked for two hours they'd work
six hours
for right
six hours
so if mix six men work for six hours they'll produce thirty six man hours
which is what we want
okay
so the way the way of doing it
the men times the hours gives you the man hours
and then you divide that
so same problem now
six men take nine hours to do it
ah this is no good i want this job done erm in four hours
how many men are you going to need
thirty six and divide that by four
yeah
and that'd give you the number of men
right that's it
and then what will that come to
nine men
yeah
the men times the hours when whenever you whenever you get your answer you can check that your men times the hours must still be the same as it was when you when they gave you the question
so if four men take nine hours nine men will take four hours
yeah
and they sometimes put it that way round
there was one in erm here where they'd done that
erm and they did that with the women
six women take eight hours
how many UNK women would you need to do it in six hours
well the women times the hours it takes six times eight women hours to do this
man hours if you like
it's still gonna take six times eight but this time the six is the hours so the eight will be women
and doing it on man hours is er an easy way
erm you probably need to practise a bit
to think of it that way
so that you're not think oh you're first thought cos i know the way you were working you're thinking oh if i just double that half it or take a third of it or something like that
and it doesn't always work out
sometimes if you get an easy one fine you could do it that way
but erm the UNK easiest way of the lot is well how much work does this job take
it takes either three men working at ten hours
that gives yo thirty man hours
or ten men working for three hours that still gives you thirty men hours
or fifteen men working for two hours two men working for fifteen hours
as long as the men time i mean perhaps it would take sixty men working for half an hour
as long as it comes to the same man hours then that's it
cos that's how you measure jobs when you in erm when you're sort of managing projects or something or so many man hours to build this and then so many man hours to do this and then so many man hours to do that
and they always talk about man hours
erm do you want to try another one
this time absolutely no help at all
i'll just look out the window
but you t say what you're doing
don't just go for the figures
come sort of some of the words describe why you're doing what you're doing
cos it'll help you to erm say what you're doing and probably to write it down some of it as well
rather than just go don't forget if you write it down and you've got the right method
if you get the answer wrong you can still get some marks
but if you don't write anything down apart from just the answer
if you just put the figures in the calculator and write it down and it's wrong or this one times that one
erm did we do that one
yeah
we did that one
okay
a farmer UNK twelve men so number seven
twelve men will take ten days how long would five men take
twelve men twelve men times ten days
a hundred and twenty
man days
man days
that's it
erm how long would it have taken five men
a hundred and twenty divided by the five men
that's it
so a hundred and twenty over five men
right
will take five days
yeah
sorry will take
no
yeah any
yeah will take five days
when you multiply that one by that one it's got to come to a hundred and twenty man days again
yeah
cos that never changes the does it
erm have a go at this one
erm eight men is this one you've done
no er well i
okay try it this way with the man hours anyway
erm or the man days in this case
eight men take six days
how long would twelve right
go on
good
that's excellent
you don't go on to the next bit till you've worked that one out
erm and a lot of the time you don't need to multiply it out
it's better for the working if you just you know show what you're going to do there
that's it
eight times six man days
now even if you put that in your calculator and you get it wrong and you get fifty or something
then you're going to get a lot of the marks for it because they can show
yeah
that's what you mean
so
right
so long would it take twelve men
eight six twelve men
okay
now you've got your you've got your twelve
now i'm stuck here
right okay
it's now we've switched round differently
there we were sort of trying to find out how many men
but here we know how many men take how many days
and it's this thing here
but it's that's how many days they took
because how many man days will it be now
it'll be twelve men times
yeah
that many days
and the UNK cancel and you'll finish up with eight by six again
eight times six
quite as young as that er you know but i mean er then as i got older i d i did live with me grandmother
when
for a bit
wh at what age
er ooh i figure i'd only be quite young perhaps might be about five
i can just remember m i can just picture my grandma she was
and i can just remember where she lived
i know it went up two steps
of course and then she dies and erm i went back to me own mother you see
why did you with your grandmother
i don't know my grandmother must have took to me
and er and then er of course i went back to me mother after me grandmother died i went to me mother and er mind you when i was th young there was a lot of poverty about you know there was er no security pay and no er and you couldn't get any money from anywhere or anything like that you know and er so it used to er had to do the best you can
me dad used to do anything kind you know or work
to well they used to call what they call them a labour man you know he'd do any sort of work
do you mean that he didn't have a permanent job
no he didn't have a permanent one no not for a bit
not for quite a while
and then erm then when er once when i was only little there was a pit strike on i think i'd only be about seven somewhere there
and you was allowed to go and get the coal from the pit UNK
like there such as housewives have always got no coal
of course there was no gas fires about then
no gas fires
you used to have to cook everything on your fire
you had to cook everything
on your fire
yes there used to be a oven one side a boiler on other and er your fire in the middle and the fire used to have er a thing what used to come down and you used to stand your kettle on there to boil
or you used to stand your UNK on there to boil
and then when you was boiling your potatoes or vegetables you used to have tho th the iron UNK in them days
and you used to be ab well you used to be able to over the flames of the fire on one side and then er a UNK on the other on the in one side with your vegetables in one side with your potatoes in and then you used to have your oven with a for your meat
there used to be two shelves in the oven

s and er and then of course when you'd got your so much water out again you used to go and fill it up again
fill your fill your boiler up again
oh it used to last all day
you know and then er and then er and we'd got no gas in when i was quite little
there was no gas
you used to use oil lamps
UNK lamps
i've seen my mother stand them on the table middle of the table you know the oil lamps
and then i've seen t er me mother once had er oil lamp from the ceiling and it was round and the oil lamp used to stand in the middle
and the UNK used to have nice fancy work round you know to make it so it wouldn't stand on the table cos me mother bought one of those because it used to be a bit dangerous on the table if you knocked it you see and
what with the children
er yes if you know if knocked the table any time they fall over liable to set fire you see with the UNK and that
and you used to have what they call a UNK in it you know to light it and turn it down at night time and blow it out down the
and then in the streets there was no electric lights in the street they all used to be gas
and er a UNK used to have er a gentleman going round with a great long stick
and er just pulling the chain in the thing what er like a big white UNK they used to be
stand high up and big white UNK and the used to little got a little door

they used to these they used to be a round used to be round you know and not very used to hit them as you hit them with a stick you see they used to wheel round and round
oh like a like a UNK er
yeah
a round
then we then of course then used to be this er game skipping
two one girl one end one girl another you know turning the rope and you skipping in the middle and counting
did you sort of sing any songs or anything when you were skipping
ooh yeah
ooh well they used to well they didn't used to sing a lot of songs but er they used to do a lot of you know playing about and perhaps and then they'd perhaps have a ball
you see
you'd s er a lot of them you'd sta you'd stand up against a wall and then they say UNK throw a ball
and you'd just hit it like that and as you hit you'd got to run and come back again before she got the ball to t er tap you on er you know with the ball
and er then you'd got to be on then
oh we used to oh play all sorts of things like that
when we was young
whe when you were didn't it happen mrs that when you were playing in the street one day you were knocked over by a tram
yes well i were i think i was running after me mother more than anything
cos i was on me own and er i me ma i think me mother had gone of an UNK and of course i run after her
and it was on
first car that ever run along and it was facing a chemist what they call
any old people knows the UNK and it was ge there used to be a park at the side on it and all
well i got erm and them boards underneath there's some boards underneath the tram car there was and they s picked me up you see they so when er there was a crowd outside the chemist i was in somebody took me inside
i can't remember who took me inside
and then er somebody told me mother and of course me mother come in then and a policeman was there
and of course this policeman used to come and see me ever so often but me mother never saw his co operation
no
and er then of course when i got better it hit me all on the head and that well then er when i went back to school they found out as i couldn't see the board properly
so the sent me to the er eye UNK and of course the eye UNK sent me to the blind school
and there used to be a lady named mrs used to come and take us
and er the corporation used to give her so many tickets to last her the week
and of course we used to have to go on tram cars to the school and road
was this you and some other children that she took
yes
yes there used to be her son and there used to be me and there used to be a girl name UNK right and there used to be her sister UNK right and then there used to be another young girl named UNK
and then she used to take all those together and she used to have to give the conductor so many tickets each time she went
and then er we used to take us UNK to school erm whatever your mother had got to give you
if you took eggs there used to always be a lady there at dinner time what used to come round and ask you what you'd got for dinner and then if you'd got eggs she used to write your name on the eggs and do them for you
oh what and boil them
yes
oh
boil them
or if your mother had got a say she made you a meat and UNK pie in a little dish if you took this little dish with you the lady used to er warm it up for you
they used the oven there and we used to sit and the you see
and er there was only three classes there was er i can remember two teachers' names
there was er one named miss and the other one was named mr
and er and he was alive till not many years ago
and er and of course
and could you tell me when and where you were born please
yes i was born in lane at lane on the eleventh november nineteen seventeen
and erm could you describe the house you were born in at all
yes it was a tt a very large semi detached house with erm a UNK attached
my father was a miner but loved his garden and we had a big UNK
mhm
all garden and at the bottom was a UNK then had UNK in it
so did you live with your parents in your both your parent in your early life
yes erm that was where i was born and er then when i was five my father erm hit a bad patch and he sold the house and er he decided to become a UNK in UNK
and he and my mother had a disagreement about this and er the result was that my father became very ill and i went home to grandma
and you lived with your grandparents then
yes and then my father when he had recovered a bit he came to live with grandma
mm
and we i had a brother a younger brother as well
mm
were there
did you ever get any feeling of sort of UNK from anybody about y your mother leaving home
no
no
my father was shall we say well respected and er no there was no there was never any query about it
mm
so you lived with your grandparents then
was your grandfather a miner as well
yes my UNK this was my second grandfather because my UNK my own grandfather had died before i was born and my grandmother had married again and he was a he was the arm UNK at colliery
mm
and your father was a miner at this time as well
yes
and also in the house was uncle my grandfather 's brother uncle bill who was er a UNK at colliery
mm
so everybody was based at then
yes
do you have many memories of well the men in the house coming home from the pit and talking about the conditions
m yes they talked about work or work and erm but not about conditions particularly and was a medium pit for conditions
they talked about conditions at which was a wet pit and er how hucknall was much better anyhow and things like that
but great talk about union activities
what were the union activities
er well there was the highly UNK thing called overtime erm if you had too much overtime you was keeping someone out of job
er you wanted a fair number of hours and you wanted a fair wage
er the union was very UNK
mm
so the men in the house were all members of nottingham miners association
yes
what about the general strike
i suppose the strike would be an early
well
memory for you
yeah
the general strike it's a strange memory because i had to walk down pad er now erm i forget what the proper word is now er it's called walk now
sounds UNK er terrible to me because pad was the way to colliery the last half mile along a dirt track
and er granddad was on maintenance of course and i used to have to take his meals so i used to go past the er picket along with many other people who were busy coal out of the pit tip
er the picket was not as UNK as it is now and there were the talks of scabs and things like that
but the strike was well we had the pit ponies up and er we always used to go and feed them and then we went of course to chapel for meals
i won't say soup kitchens because they weren't that at all i mean they weren't as UNK you had a UNK meal i know you sang grace before it and said grace afterwards but you had UNK and UNK and chapel china
mm
so how
do you remember how your grandfather and father felt about the strike
erm yes they er they felt they'd been let down by the railway men i think or someone else at the beginning at the strike and they were out on a limb but er they'd got to make the best of it
mm
erm i think they thought they'd been let down at the end of it
erm i was taken to h hear a j the miners leader at the time he was the best type perhaps a welsh chapel UNK erm on the recreation ground and on the marketplace when thousands turned up
mm
attend
how did people feel about because well if you read alan book then he's criticized very strongly as being too UNK and r well really UNK preferred to him
how did the miners
well the miners er were middle of the road as lots of miners are now but er probably more middle then because well the colliery chapel and the co op were a way of life
mm
what about
of course was a chapel man and er i think they saw or some of them saw him er a in him a way round out of things and of course he did deals with the UNK to get people back to work and whilst families had enjoyed six months in the gardens and doing all sorts of strange things erm the men mainly wanted to get back to work because they saw time running out
mm
w was the strike a period of hardship particularly
it was hardship in this that er perhaps the hardest time came after it when er well it was called public assistance then social security payments had to be payed back
all the things that you'd had during the strike but things did get left and er UNK were very UNK there was no chasing for m hard for money and er i know we had an insurance that wasn't paid and we used the book to have an imaginary shilling on a horse each day
which put me off UNK for good because whilst we won every day it seemed we'd lost a lot of money at the end of the year
theoretically we hadn't done but of course we hadn't played anything but it was good exercise
mm
well moving onto social life what are your childhood memories of playing and with your father and UNK etc
well of course er f er fathers and UNK er took er the UNK a walk
er there was walking there was cricket and er UNK erm street games things you can't do now because of traffic
but a lot more i feel sorry for my grandchildren where they can't have as much fun as i used to have kicking a tin
mm
did church figure as UNK in your early life
oh cha chapel later on i mean er you know when you got to ten eleven ch there were so many things at chapel i mean from learned UNK i mean the gentlemen from the university here
er UNK and used to come and talk to the guilds and things er the men's meeting
and er then there were the concerts or the UNK or the UNK
i always finished up as a UNK or a UNK i don't know quite why
i couldn't sing
but equally they did UNK and er merchant of UNK a good standard too
so is th is a idea of a chapel being more in the community than just religion
is that
oh yes it was a very much a community centre i mean we played UNK at chapel and various chapel people had UNK tables un under their dining table and er we u just go and play UNK
going back to the your mining background erm after the strike were your father and grandfather members of both the nottingham miners UNK association and the industrial union
erm yes
my grandfather became involved because 's union er made a big thing out of compensation cases
compensation had to be fought for it wasn't a matter of right and a piece of a very small piece of coal fell down the shaft the UNK the man at the bottom and it through his hand and he got compensation and then my father was sacked for the shovel
too much of a coincidence i'm afraid to our minds
do you think the two were connected then
oh we're sure they were but er this was the thing with a private UNK company where you had er a sort of not quite chairman of the colliery sitting there at the top o in the office watching everybody come and go
and er after that my father went with the rounds with the UNK where you had to belong to union to go to them and colliery didn't accept what was called the old union
yeah was
the pit was the colliery
pit as my n pit was colliery then there was and then of course there were the pits and the pits on the edge
er but UNK as they became they didn't UNK that was UNK they didn't accept er the old unions so they erm they belonged both i can't on friday night i used to the UNK chapel to pay the old union subscription and to the west to pay 's
what was your father and UNK attitude to authority in the pit
were they very UNK about well these UNK
very UNK about that but er no er i think er tt some of the pi it was er not authority in the pits they UNK the co owners erm one or two and respected pit always had a respectable authority er and ownership i mean UNK from the UNK one
but er and the other pits where personalities were involved were not quite so happy
but er the managers and er and the manager of the pit and then the UNK and the rest they were people who had worked their way up generally and were accepted
so had the idea of the coal owner er well at the end of the century the coal ow owner and liberal mp sort of connections in
well was pit was and er they came to the family that was someone at mansfield came back to open chapel UNK and all sorts of things and particularly for the adult school
yeah going on to schools which w which schools did you attend
i went street erm which was just next door to UNK only over the wall
and er then to 's street which was called school for a year and then to 's when it opened in nineteen twenty nine
do you have many memories of your well early education
street yes because er you went er you had a marvellous thing called nature study come geography come everything where you went for walk
but equally the first thing i remember was my number in the infant school when i was number fifty five and er there were fifty eight of us in the class and one lady kept order
they were very ordered classes i'm afraid
was much learnt or
yes oh yes you learnt quite a lot and er much depended on er the teacher of course they weren't as bound as er teachers had been
mm
we heard discussions of that
but erm you learnt quite a lot and you learnt the basics very thoroughly
i mean you marched round the playground until you could knew that twelve UNK were a hundred and sixty eight
which was when the top class in the infants at seven got in
di was there any sort of education outside school say sunday schools or
sunday schools er mainly was er in best chapel tt tradition i suppose of er bible study and also of the social conscience of the methodist
and er to me it presented a great opportunity i j i won quite a lot of books
i always remember asking for lawrence in UNK as a sunday school prize
and they weren't the victorian prizes that i won i we got them for getting through an exam because you could write or something and er tt well they were quite good books and it was one way of getting a book
mm
w what about street school
street school i was th there on only there a year and the headmaster came in one day he was another liberal politician
UNK were always members of the council in those days and they were always tended to be la liberal or labour which i the present labour would say was very pale pink
and the headmaster at er street school joseph was a labour member of council and joseph was tended to be more liberal
he came in one day and asked what m c stood for and i've always known a lot of useless information so i could tell him so i was then UNK everyday to the erm radio shop in the high street to get the cricket scores in australia
and then he asked me he said well have you read that notice on the board about er UNK
i said yes but there's no hope
he says well your aunt was a teacher co you could go teaching
you're na you're not going down the pit
i said no one at home was everyone at home had said you're not going down the pit
and he entered me for the scholarship and er i won
mm
i incurred his UNK on one occasion there was a young lady sat on the form in front we had those where you sat in pairs on the iron sort of things
she had UNK and i tied them together on to th behind the bar and he UNK me
mm
i suppose UNK was a more frequent form of discipline in those days
UNK was er yes erm
if you asked for trouble you got it
would you ev would you ever get any UNK from you your father if you got told off at school
if you got in trouble at school you got in trouble at home
no if and UNK
about going t about getting the UNK scholarship to had only just opened then
that
hadn't it
it hadn't er i went when it opened
we were er before then there was the school just over the wall to street was the centre
it was a pupil teacher centre
it started life as a technical school which it was given by subscription mainly the colliery company for scientific education
but used during the day by the education committee as a pupil teacher centre
and up till then you went to you got your scholarship you went to the tu pupil teacher training centre and then you became a teacher
erm if you passed erm you did a UNK and then you came to college nottingham for your teaching ticket
so but was without a secondary school
yes
for quite a long period wasn't it
yes
yes until annie came m after the war
was
how did the community feel about that
they felt strongly
they felt strongly about it but er was only twelve minutes away on the railway quarter of an hour on the bus
and of course in spite of everything that's being said the thing about was that because of the two railway stations you could get anywhere in half or three quarters of an hour
you could get to i know graham went to which is way out other went up the UNK and that area and other went to UNK
and everybody could get home very quickly because of the railway stations that were there
so did you travel to school on the railways
we tr i travelled to school on the railway one bit when they gave us season tickets because with a scholarship you got your fares paid
and then they started paying your bus fare at the end of the week and so i decided i could walk
er fourpence return was two mars bars and quite a lot of us walked
were there many boys from at
oh yes there were well all the erm boys from up to about the fifth form in the old pupil teachers training centre went er was formed by joining that and school they took boys from there
and er then there was the new intake of ourselves and er there were probably fifty or sixty the first year
erm only three scholarship but then of course you got the er governors free places which were nearly the same and then the number who were being paid for
d s so did you notice any sort of class differences within the school
very little after the first week
erm UNK a great UNK or a i i'd never had such marvellous clothes
erm i know a friend of mine and my ambition then was to wear a collar and tie and wear half shoes as opposed to a jersey and boots
erm now of course we'd wear a jersey and boots quite happily but er i did get a grant for clothing because otherwise there was no way of UNK of accepting a scholarship
and erm the immediate reaction at home was to say well you can't go
and the headmaster said quietly let's talk about it
and er so i had clothes from and er i learnt what clerical UNK clerical grey was and er also what house shoes were erm you know UNK for wearing in school
so tt and of course the other thing i learnt there was that you had dinner the wrong way round you didn't have your pudding first to fill you up
so what other memories do you have of then
oh very happy memories really we erm we had two or three masters from erm one was the sunday school superintendent again this chapel and the son in law of the headmaster of street george edward as he's known to thousands
he must be rolling round cos he was the maths master he must be rolling round in his grave as people say percentage because he if you said percentage he UNK at you percentage of what
erm but you'd failed him if you didn't get a distinction in school certificate maths or arithmetic
so h how old were you when you left school
sixteen
which was i mean very late for those
no
no
we left er the secondary school or as they were then the grammar schools at sixteen
you left the other one at fourteen
i could have stayed at street till i was fourteen i could have stayed at street until i was fourteen and then you would've been out
and er but at er there you'd got to go for the other two years and some parents were rather wondering whether that left you late in the queue for a job because jobs were very difficult
or whether you were going to earn enough later on
mm
how did you go about finding a job
wrote hundreds of letter er to the people you wanted to do because i'd never expected having to find a job i must admit because the year before i took school certificate i had got a naval a UNK apprenticeship but then i got kicked in the eye playing rugby and failed a medical
something i'd never to do so i had to settle down and get school certificate which i got with my UNK exemption and people from did
it er you were taught and er i ju i'd say it was as liberal a education as you get now but you'd got to get your maths you'd got to english you'd got to get a language you'd got to get a science and
mm
it was broadly based
and so what was the job found
and eventually i found a job er as assistant to the er UNK to the rating officer who had also been a member of t who was a member of the chapel and er knew i was looking for a job and er i hadn't written to him cos i didn't know this one was coming up
and so he told you about it rather than
yes he told me he said ah well have you got a job yet
i said no not yet erm i'm awaiting replies from so many
so i accepted a job with him and then i got two offers the next day one with the savings bank i think it was and one with someone else
and what payment did you get
ten shilling a week
would it have been better had you gone to the other jobs
or would it have been about the same
i don't know erm probably about the same then
it was about it was the same as i'd probably got if i'd have gone to the pit at fourteen
but er nevertheless you felt that you wanted to go into well you were probably to over qualified for going into the pit weren't you
never thought about the pit i'd been there was no question about that it was something that was not going to last
i mean the pits would be worked out according to the talk at home and anyhow we wanted to live in UNK
mm
so what did you actually do in the rating office
well i wrote out births deaths marriage certificates and er then measured up houses on the rating side erm worked them out for UNK
erm used to go down to weddings at the register office on a saturday morning and hope that they'd turn up without witnesses because then you had to be UNK for giving your service
how much would you get for
i occasionally got ten shillings which was more than a week's as much a week's wages
erm but er i learnt to write a fair hand erm without too many UNK which er because i was always told that somebody might be looking at this in a hundred years time or more
mm
in going to measure houses did you have to actually go out and visit houses
yes oh aye i yes we you had to measure and in those days the councils were grouped in what they called assessment committee areas and each were wor making sure the other areas were using the same sort of basis
and i remember one afternoon going out with the whole of the rating committee to houses at UNK and beeston and other places and m in effect measuring them by counting how many nine inch bricks they were across the front and back to make sure that you know nobody was UNK anybody else
mm
erm and you went in houses you saw them
you know learnt about construction
mm
did you see much of people's living conditions
particularly poor living conditions
oh you saw er you'd seen this because er you had friends all over i mean the fact that you went to didn't er tt get rid of all your friends
mm
erm you had friends UNK in all sorts of places you didn't UNK shall we say in some of them that might have been a bit UNK
mm
and others that you wouldn't have gone in anyhow but they were areas
but generally i saw more living conditions later on er when er i started rent collecting for the council
mm
and the rating officer was part time with the council and one day a rent collector was taken ill and then i was given a five shilling bag of copper and told to go and collect these
when
when was this
er it would be nineteen thirty seven
mm
so that was
thirty six
thirty seven
thirty seven perhaps
that was during well th the end of the depression really
well it was still very depressed in the coal trade you were they were doing this marvellous thing called three on and three off
if you worked four you were worse off than if you worked three you know you'd got three days on th er and you got you got three days dole er unemployment pay
mm
and er so times were still hard it wasn't until they let's say until thirty ei thirty eight that the depression finished in the coal field when they started building up from then
and of course this was the time of the means test when young men from who er lived at home their income was taken into account in assessing how much dad or mum couldn't get
and er they took themselves off to coventry and to and to luton to the motor trades
and quite a few went
what were the
what
what
was the sewage conditions and the water supply like in the thirties in
good
because there'd been arguments about it earlier on in the century hadn't there
oh there had er it h erm had a marvellous water supply and it had a good sewage it had a good sewage disposal system
but erm sewage was to be one of the things i shall never forget later on
whilst i was working for the council someone came to ask and we had some new o new officer appointed and he was very worried about getting ca er p permission from the council to launch a sewer scheme that was going to cost a quarter of a million pounds a very large amount in those days
and the older members of the staff and there weren't many i mean the total s council office staff was only about thi was twenty or so and erm more men were employed outside than anything
and they said well you know how to draw up your agenda and you'll have something that's contentious in this case it was the supply of stationery from three local UNK from UNK local printers
and they argue that half the night and then er your thing will go through on the nod if you get it in before t half past nine when they er standing order say the council meeting closes
mm
s so UNK urban district council was separate from nottingham wasn't it
yes
yes
er nottingham had about three attempts to pinch and er the last one they were told to put their own house in order first because conditions were so much better than in the city
erm mainly as a result i UNK that earlier on the UNK coal owners encouraged home ownership has this very high proportion of er owner occupiers
tt er in nineteen seventy four i think at least about three quarters of them were
mm
there are no there were no big property owners no big coal i mean the colliery company only owned sixty houses i think which were sold to the tenants er when the lease ran out
w what about the health service in nottingham
in
er in
sorry
erm health service
erm what do you mean
the doctors
mm
oh well you had er some very well loved doctors we had the black doctor dr he was er west indian he took over from another one dr who was also west indian i gathered i never knew dr
but dr was a good UNK erm he also wrote a very you could also read what dr put and he was also said that he sent people to hospital very quickly
erm then there was the er and he m dr and er dr and then it became dr who is still there
erm dr was the medical officer of health part time and dr was a character he always had a white UNK he UNK round in a carriage on occasions and he er wrote UNK
that's when i had to put these things onto UNK er put death certificates into th their the doctor's certificate into english erm they were pretty good t others weren't so g er you know weren't so good
i have been accused too of saying that you tell your doctor i'd know what you i knew what you'd die of because they had their own things their own pet UNK
erm UNK and UNK and erm probably quite accurate but er short of breaking your neck i think you UNK was the UNK in
mm
so yo you had to fill in births and deaths certificates
oh yes i had to co copy them and er you know you got these things but the UNK he was you know he was man
mm
have you s
did you see many changes in over the pre war era
yes erm during the h the probably one of the reasons i was set on to start with was the tremendous amount of house building
i mean john who was a local builder sold a house a day for five years which is some building
and you can see john whichever way you go into you'll see john types e and g the semi detached on road lane and road and road
you'll see them everywhere
and one or two people are very honest they call the house because they borrowed the money from halifax building society
what about transport in
transport
oh well now it isn't a patch on what it was
erm yo there was so many trains into nottingham into victoria at twelve minutes it took you thirty minutes into the midland station having called at and all sorts of places on the way
they were first of all there were and 's buses direct and the bus
and then of course come along and er for while there was a competition with UNK over the forest you know one running either just in front or just behind the other sort of thing
and then tt er UNK took UNK er UNK went and er trent took over and then UNK went and trent took over again
what about
did many people have cars in hucknall
no very few erm in lane which is now in an estate UNK erm a desirable part of the town they used to be mr the local the solicitor of UNK and his wife used to drive him to the station to catch the train to nottingham
she also meet him m met him at lunchtime because the steam coach used to come out from town and bring the business men the UNK one out
mm
and i suppose seeing as it was so short it was worth coming home
yes
in that sort
oh yes er he could er he could still have an hour lunchtime and er only be out of the office say an hour and three quarters
erm moving on a l a little bit what was your social life at the time
my social life i suppose ticked round chapel then it ticked round er cycling and er walking
my brother tt he er had a bicycle and then he joined up er we did have a UNK time he could make anything go
mm
he built a motorbike out of scrap bits he found on the tip which didn't UNK him to grandma or anyone else
and then joined so he joined the army and i was left with this bicycle and a friend of mine said how about coming with us on sunday you can skip chapel this sunday and we'll go out er we're going into derbyshire and i finished up on UNK edge
i'd never UNK a bike hardly before
but then they had a cycling club at chapel and so we tended to go saturdays and then i started walking and youth UNK
we went youth UNK for m the sort of the chapel choir after when you grew up in chapel then you were either found a job teaching in the sunday school or you went into the choir
well i went in a choir i could never sing and i still can't and er the choir used to go out quite a lot and er we UNK and we youth UNK even as w or in on working parties at some of the peak UNK
what about erm you were involved in the amateur UNK
well this er came through the same thing the youth UNK association we had a visit from UNK some german ones who did m play reading in UNK and er some of ours went back there and the youth UNK associations they had a play reading group and er i joined that
as i say i'd al been in things at chapel UNK and things but er this was another thing and of course that's where i met my wife at er row which is the boys' UNK was the boys' UNK headquarters
and er we did one or two plays there and
mm
in the old s st 's church hall on street which has now gone
would robin have acted with you then
robin er william was at school one year behind me and i played with him but bill wasn't very er big
erm i'm amazed now when i see him on television as to how big he is because he wasn't as a UNK and he was UNK and er we UNK him because in those days you had an UNK case for a school bag and your initials were put on it
and er he had the lot w h m b you see and er he wasn't robin then
and er this was one of things that my old boss when people came into name their children he said now remember these initials will go on case perhaps one day and you don't want s a p or something like that
and if they came in a with name that was unusual er now are you sure
do you want a moment to think about it
you know when somebody came up with UNK or something like that
er but no er robin and the local dramatic club was er very good you're in the market for money putting on things in the chapel or in the co op hall at
hit the was usually done in the co op hall and er they were good
mm
i mean people didn't pay money just out of you know loyalty completely
what about the spanish civil war
do you remember
well at that time my best pal went to the pit his mother wouldn't let him enter in th for scholarship but he did happen to come here for well he seemed to always get a day's day release from the year dot i think and er eventually he got some a levels
he got his trade unions things and his UNK certificate and that
but then he got some a levels and he's finally got an open university degree good luck to him
and er we used to go occasionally to w e a meetings in the library at and er i wasn't a member of his class but i did once go and hear hugh when he was at nottingham
and er then er we had er a tutor who was very keen and we nearly all went to er the spanish civil war and we took er the er paper for ages erm and er but one of the group did go frank from went but the were always communist they never claimed to be labour
but er they were always er well remembered and er w spanish civil war through i suppose nowadays you call them fringe newspapers but there was this paper we used to get at the tim at the time it wasn't the er morning star or even it's predecessor erm but you got a paper and you sort of heard the other side
erm er very concerned as to what it was going to lead up to up and hoping you know against hope that's you weren't going to be involved in anything like that
mm
and my grandmother certainly wouldn't have wanted me going she had er her feet very firmly on the ground
i hadn't realized till long afterwards until she after she was dead that er she and her brother came to work when the midland railway came to nottingham they left norfolk and he's got a horse as a UNK and they walked from UNK in norfolk to nottingham in search of a job
and they went to live at and
wh what about the sec second world war
the second world war
well originally er i was involved in er registration because there with this very loose connection with the UNK by now i was full time with the council as rating assistant and rent collector
and er i got involved on national registration and er on one occasion we were working we'd got a deadline and we were working through the weekend and my wife came to pick me up at what she thought was a reasonable time at one o'clock on saturday found she was given a cup of tea and set to work and we finished going home about midnight
so would you would you work overtime a lot
oh yes you worked overtime for which there was no pay i mean it didn't count er you see things you know there was less structure about it then erm and you could have ti if you wanted time off for something you'd probably have got it fairly easily but er it didn't seem to be the great arguments that you've had since
and of course er by nineteen forty erm well christmas thirty nine i'd got my calling up papers
were you on th
you were on the point of getting married by that time
no
i we'd talked about it and said well we're not going to get married whilst UNK on as er probably the generation before had said in nineteen fourteen and er we got married eventually on the first of december nineteen forty
erm when one of our friends who was a writer for the local press UNK it the cutter who walked a thousand miles together before he got called up
was this because of your UNK
yes
so that's the
yes
what were your experiences of the war
absolutely chaos i suppose
erm i had expressed a preference for the navy so i was sent to plymouth to join the UNK regiment at mill bay docks which was a an UNK regiment and machine gun core regiment
and er it was very reg a regular come UNK and i was one of five UNK from up country erm you thought yourself as er an absolute UNK in grass UNK waving a UNK or something
and er but er we got to know them eventually but for the first few weeks whilst we were in devon i think the five UNK sort of got landed
we'd got nowhere to go at weekends and they disappeared
erm but then we slept under every hedge i think along the south coast till we lost our machine guns collected anti tank guns and eventually were transferred to the royal artillery but still with this county pride of devon which i'd never met before
in nottinghamshire we don't have county pride to the sense of yorkshire and devon you know where it's absolutely m something that really matters
mm
erm devon erm and their UNK of their neighbours or UNK of cornwall i know on one occasion in the first fortnight i think we were in the y m at devonport and er there was an argument with the duke of UNK light UNK and er well i know we got out of a back window of the y m fairly UNK erm avoiding trouble
but er tt erm tt again er i had a spot of luck i suppose erm at one stage we had a very ex indian service bloke who ha as UNK had thrown a typewriter through the window he was known to do daft things like that
i happened to be able to put it together again it wasn't too difficult and er so i got the job of being clerk UNK what have you
it didn't get me out of very much except a few guard duties and er i collected one UNK and then two and i did the pay and all sorts of things
eventually we m when we became a mobile self UNK anti tank unit erm my office er thing for paying everything was a metal table shall we say on the inside of a truck that was about one foot by two feet
and on that there was a typewriter and you could send signal messages and everything
but UNK we had problems with because if they went in for repair you never got them back from the UNK core and so at one place in UNK wells we handed a typewriter in and because the army were allowed to buy UNK paper we bought a lot of UNK paper which came in the package of a new typewriter
erm er nothing changes
right
start
erm you've worked first of all as erm a probation officer
yes
erm probation office
the one right
right next right underneath the flats
erm between what years did you work there
from nineteen seventy seven through to nineteen eighty two
and since nineteen eighty two am i right in saying that you've worked at the law centre in
yes
yes i've kept up contacts with people
mhm
erm starting with your work as a probation officer
erm UNK you have a lot of contact with tenants in the flats
we did yes
we were on the ground floor of the flats and we got to know a lot of them as neighbours as well as some of them as clients
and we shared some of the same problems sewage s UNK into the offices and UNK round the UNK
so yeah we got on
mhm
pretty well
and worked with the tenants association too
mhm
and what kind of work did you do with the tenants' association
erm it varied really w we saw our role in general as being to support and UNK the activities that they wanted to get involved
yeah
in
r not to sort o determine in any way the kinds of issues they took up
erm the probation office itself has b had a rather big conference room and
mhm
and that was a facility that we made available to the tenants group for public meetings and that kind of thing
erm we also offered everything from sort of UNK help and er use of UNK and UNK to the tenants' group through to i guess being able to perhaps suggest to them who in the council it might be that they needed to speak to or perhaps UNK how to go about achieving their particular aims
erm certainly a lot of meetings in the early days focused on the level of policing in the flats
or as tenants saw it the lack of policing in the flats
mhm
and er to some extent probation obviously had something to say about that
tt
in terms of policing was it erm you were saying about there was a view that the police were not
there was a feeling that you never saw a policeman
actually walking through the complex
and er the people who lived in the flats felt UNK and isolated from er from police support
mhm
why do you think there was a f a fear that people wanted the police to erm going round the co i presume they wanted more wanted more police activity
they wanted the police to be seen a lot more
was that why do you think that was the case
people felt that way
there obviously was er the odd incident actually inside the flats
mhm
UNK g b hs erm the occasional UNK
and just the sense of security and i don't think that the level of incidence was very high but it was enough to make people feel UNK about walking through there at night
wi without any you know without any police presence around
mhm
did you have much contact with erm individual clients in the flats
or
i do what a lot of contact with individual
yeah
people in the flats
some
mhm
some as actual probation clients
erm and as many a as many people i have contact with through either the tenants' group or through the UNK which was erm set up in the probation office but was for people who lived in the area not necessarily for
mhm
okay what yeah
offenders
now what was the UNK
well w we just er opened it s i think it was three and a half days a week
yeah
just UNK the doors open
mhm
basically and said you know this is a place local people can come into for at least initially a cup of tea a chat whatever
and the idea was to provide a place where hopefully local people could erm identify for themselves the problems that they shared in common
and take some kind of action
it wasn't intended to UNK the work of the tenants' association it was it was looking at different kinds of issues
and issues that also affected people in the surrounding streets not just people in the flats themselves
so being on supplementary benefit was one of the obvious things that people in the UNK chose to look at cos it affected most of them
erm i think it started off people would come in the UNK with their own supplementary benefit problem and clearly we had the sort of UNK there and they saw the probation officers on duty as people who could help them to sort out that sort out that kind of problem
erm but f what it moved towards was them recognizing that they could sort out their own problems and perhaps sort out each others
and so a sort of small welfare rights group began to form in the UNK
mhm
and that eventually led on to them contacting other interested groups in the area erm like some lawyers from a legal action group and er other groups who meet together for whatever purpose in the area and setting up free legal and welfare rights which was a formal advice session run on a thursday night
a lot of local people erm put a lot of effort into creating that organization
and kept it going
erm right through till eighty two when it actually got funding
mhm
was that the am i right in saying that was the origins of
of
the law centre
that's right
am i right in saying that
yes
yes it was
and the local people and professionals who were involved erm proved the need if you like
demonstrated the level of need in the area for legal welfare rights advice
did all the UNK did the lobbying got in touch with the councillors wrote the application for money
and finally after two years the a full time centre was set up
and many of those either lived in the flats or in the surrounding streets
mhm
moving on erm in te you know obviously you must have had a fair amount of c you said you had a fair amount of contact with erm tenants in the flats
erm during the time you were there between seventy seven and eighty two and you've probably kept some contact since
have things changed in the flats at all would you say that in terms of the way people feel
erm
it it's changed at
or
various points in time
yeah
when i when i first got to know the flats certainly after the incident of a of an elderly lady being erm being mugged and beaten up by some kids up there
mm
certainly after that incident and all the erm the very UNK dramatic publicity that centred on the flats
erm i don't know the figures but the feeling certainly was that everybody wanted to get out and thy wanted to get out as quickly as they could
as a result of that incident and the publicity
erm certainly that highlighted for people the sort of fears that they may have had before
and generated fears that were unrealistic and the press report sort of had you know one rape one UNK every three minutes or something crazy
and certainly there was a high turnover for a couple of years erm late seventies
and it was very difficult to erm to get to get much activity going in the flats cos people's aim was to get out rather than to improve the conditions or work on local issues
they weren't gonna be there long enough
or at least they didn't want to be there long enough
and then it then it settled again i think in the very late seventies through to the early eighties
there seemed to be a period of much more stability in the population
mhm
up there
erm see the last couple of years it's changed again
mhm
particularly with the s the strong belief that the flats were going to come down which has subsequently proved to be true
people are taking the opportunity to get out when they can
a lot a lot of well quite a few people and i mean th have been in the flats way before i came to
and have quite a lot of good things to say about the flats and the
mhm
area
yeah what kind of good points do they make
i think two levels really
one is th the actual facilities round
mhm
erm you know it's near th near town it's near good shops it's near the schools
you've got the little bank of sort of library and arts and UNK centre
yeah
and youth club
so it it's not as isolated i as some of the more modern council estates that are sort o stuck on the edge of the city
and are great UNK er masses of property
er and some people have formed strong UNK and strong contacts with other residents in the flats
and for them
mhm
this is where their friends are
mhm
on the basis of your experience you know you was you said that the fact that erm sometimes you've got tenants who've formed really good relationships in the flat
that's erm would you say that obviously it's a b it's very difficult to actually ask cos it to some extent you'd be UNK anyway would you say that people in the flats do stick together or do you get some people who isolated and just k just don't have any flats
i mean how does it
i think it's difficult to make friends
yeah
in the flats
mhm
erm just the geography of the flats doesn't help much
i mean you're gonna bump into your neighbour opposite i suppose both walking up and down the stairs but that's about all really
there's no erm there's no i dunno bit of front garden where you where you feel secure but you can have a chat with other people it's an UNK design
erm so it always seemed as if something else was the trigger for UNK
i mean people ha found they had something else in common
kids in the same class at school
erm or a need to i dunno find some sort of facility in common
i mean th there w there was always some kind of trigger that broke that initial feeling of isolation and suspicion
and i think people were quite suspicious of their neighbours
er until they actually met them and got to know them
yeah
why do you feel it is that people are suspicious of their neighbours
i mean i
several people who came into the area
yeah
c came in with the reputation and the press reports about the area firmly UNK in their in their head
and that would make anybody initially very suspicious of getting to know o other people there
i mean the press reports on the flats have always been erm very UNK and very disturbing
so you're saying you're the in terms of the media and how it's erm presented to the outside world i mean what do you what do you f that you've said this now you felt you feel it's unfair
erm
well yeah
i mean it's portrayed the flats as a sort of nest of criminals you know
erm high level of crime
of all varieties erm violent crime prostitution theft UNK
that's the sort of image it's been given
er i and it was given that image by pointing the cameras at the flats and then UNK off the crime figures for the whole UNK
which is a massive area
er but you know it's very effective i meant it's stuck
that's that
and it's reputation has travelled or it it's false reputation has travelled quite a long way
mhm
i mean you go to other towns they might not know nottingham but they've usually heard of
so what impact does that erm basis of your experience what impact does that have when this is the kind of publicity
what impact does it have on the tenants who are living in the flats
well c certainly i mean obviously it has an impact on individuals who feel
yeah
cautious and er suspicious and also angry about being labelled in that kind of way
erm but at it at its worst i mean the worst publicity followed this incident of a an elderly lady having her fingers broken and money stolen off her by some lads in their i don't know late early teens i think
erm and that brought everybody down
i mean all the cameras erm all the newspapers from the sort of cheap tabloid ones right through to sunday times observer
i mean the place was just UNK with journalists
and er not much of the publicity was fair or accurate
and that did result in a group of people getting together and saying we want to do something to UNK this bad image and show the good side of
mhm
erm and they put in an awful lot of work in setting up the festival
which was very much a local affair
kids from the local schools erm small stalls with UNK stuff erm local bands local music local food
er it was it was great it was er it was coming out and saying there are lots of good things happening in this area
mhm
and we're proud of living here
and the press did come down i mean it got some coverage
the festival i th went on i think for three UNK
mhm
erm
what years were they
what years
it's very hard to remember
seventy seven i would think it was seventy nine eighty and eighty one
mhm
as a guess
erm
who was actually involved in organizing that
was that something that came from i mean to what extent if at all were erm tenants of the flats involved in that
well the tenants of the flats were very heavily involved in that
erm i think at that stage robin was the chairman of the tenants association
mhm
and he was very active on the committee
i think stan may have may have been around
stan during the festival as well
erm but yes lots of people from the flats either taking part in terms of sitting on the committee and doing all the planning and getting all the various UNK that you needed to do all sorts of things
erm or just being involved on the day helping out on the stalls
or just taking part by coming
it was very much a flats activity
mhm
erm again a little bit of support from people who worked in the area
but you know of the practical kind that you need
somewhere to meet telephone to use how to get publicity out
erm but it didn't come from professionals at all it came from people wanting to make some other kind of statement about what flats were like
mhm
by the third summer i think it had UNK its UNK and it had become much more like a mini UNK fair
and i certainly didn't particularly enjoy it i in the final year
it was too big and it was divorced from the flats and the people in the flats
but it served its purpose
so you'd say that as a b er as a result of that it did it did er so it did when you say it served its purpose it did improve the image
it did improve the image and it improved people's confidence i think in themselves and in the area
mhm
and must have been i think it was one of the things that helped to lead to a more settled period
mhm
people not moving out at quite the same rate of knots
mhm
erm moving again
erm one of the things that is said which is that in the flats an exceptionally high proportion of tenants erm are UNK for are on benefits
and obviously that adds certain constraints to sort of erm income
what kind of impact do you think it has actually an area that you ju that the flats complex in which there's basically not as mass relative poverty
well it obviously reduces the amount of er of cash that's sort of flowing round the
mhm
and obviously it's had an impact on the row of shops out on road for example
if you look at erm the turnover of shops down that road then that must say something about the amount of money in the area
i think i mean UNK really i think they're at last getting erm the kinds of shops that best suit the area on road now
i mean for the first time there's a erm a sort of asian wholesale supermarket
opened up
erm t to me it's amazing that has never happened before if you think of the asian population certainly in the area
erm i dunno they always seem to get it wrong
i mean they put the UNK shops on road
that didn't really deal initially with what the population needed which was cheap decent food and cheap decent clothing
it's perhaps improved somewhat over the years
er lack of money cuts down everybody's options
i mean that's what it does it reduces people's choice
er it also had practical consequences
well i think partly the reputation of the flats and also the general knowledge that not very many people in the flats have much money
erm had an influence on credit
people couldn't get it
i mean they would go right through the process of buying something on credit and it would be fine until it got to erm where do you live
and as soon as er an address on the flats was given out the offer of credit was withdrawn
mhm
again because it was seen as being you know an area of bad payers
mhm
bad UNK
erm not correct i'm sure not accurate in terms of the numbers of population
but that's what that's what shops in town believed
so what you're saying is it was not related that credit was refused not because of that fact that say people were actually on benefits cos er the same person actually somewhere else would probably get it's the very fact they actually live in the flats that actually has largely accounted for people not being able to get credit
yes i'm sure
yes
yeah
it was also er i it also made the area a target for er money UNK of the worst variety
erm i mean obviously you've got people up in the flats who at times hit absolute desperate rock bottom situations
erm you know no UNK gonna give them a loan
maybe they can't pay the UNK bill and they're in rent arrears and you know it's christmas and the kids want everything they see on the television
y you know it's it doesn't take much to push someone into the situation where they're prepared to take a big loan from a money UNK to try and clear all their other debts
and er unfortunately that's usually pretty disastrous
er the money UNK that focus on areas like the flats er charge UNK rates of interest for UNK
and aren't UNK to using fairly unpleasant methods to er to get the money back if you begin to default on payments
er a lot a lot of those merchants used to probably still do UNK round the flats
UNK on people's property
i think what never UNK to UNK me about people in the flats on benefit is how many of them do manage how many of them never owe a penny
how many of them turn their kids out erm you know in decent clothes properly fed
i mean i don't think i could do it
i find it extraordinary
i mean i know how some of them do it
they do it by going without themselves
erm jumble sales have always been popular in
there's many a mum you know who'll UNK herself from a jumble sale
maybe not UNK her kids but UNK herself from one
erm and nights out on the town you know trips to the pictures that kind of thing are rare events to say the least
it's extraordinary how people do manage
mhm
without erm you know
mhm
UNK to the things i'm sure i'd resort to like UNK or the methods of gaining money
a lot of people who i'd just describe as having i dunno people with real dignity and real sense of pride who manage to bring up their kids and survive in a decent way in quite a hostile environment
you know poor housing and no money are two critical factors that operate against people round here
so i've got a lot of UNK for people living in these flats
having said this now about a hostile environment
that people were in the flats were operating in a in a hostile environment you said low income and bad housing
what do you think can the can they force someone actually in that situation
what th what the consequences
yeah
and be
i mean you've spoken about how UNK some tenants are
yes
and how well the they've done in that situation
well if you add to those two factors erm isolation and loneliness erm then the consequences can vary i mean certainly there were large numbers or quite a few elderly people up in the flats who survived who survived very poorly really
both in terms of social contact and er and also just in erm in literal terms being properly fed and you know keeping warm over the winter
erm i mean they didn't venture out the flats they didn't know who or how to contact for help and some of them you know were pretty bad over the winter periods
but you only find out when something dramatic happens
a lot of very young single mums if the didn't have relative in the area found the pressures of living in the flats on benefit er pretty severe
er and we all know about non UNK injury
and i suppose broadly speaking there are two kinds
i mean there's the sort of UNK non UNK injury that you're never gonna be able to do anything about and it's best just to take the kids away and break the link completely
but there's a lot of non UNK injury that results from someone being unable to cope with the pressures they're under
and certainly that occurred in the flats
and given you know just a bit of help be it financial or erm housing or help in terms of contact and support and er you know having people round you can call on
for help even if it's only in the emotional kind
just a little bit of help can er can bring those families back together and prevent those situations happening again
but yes i mean there was b UNK went on in the flats from time to time
er not helped much by er blues parties that went on
mhm
there was quite genuine concern you know when blues parties went on for days and days and days
erm about the risk
cos you know you you're UNK up with the noise it's quite easy to er shake your three year old or your
mhm
your six month old baby under those sorts of pressures
blues parties was that has that been a major problem in the flats
i think it's been a continuing problem in the flats
erm it perhaps hasn't been as major as people might er have thought it should be
er people are very good actually at UNK them and er and taking them in some ways for granted
so it's part of you know part of the penalty if you like of living in the flats
erm there was a UNK point
and certainly when that was broken then people did start to come out publicly and complain
er i mean they there were one or two that just went on literally for days and days and days and days
and that erm led to a lot of people coming down to the probation office asking you know what if anything they could do about the noise up there
and i in sort of legal terms i mean there are UNK that you can take against noise
but they're so long UNK erm you know you might sort of you might win at the end of the day but the blues party will have stopped six months ago
you get any sort of legal action
erm i mean that was quite odd really we had er quite a few white tenants coming in to one end of the building erm just saying that you know we just can't cope with it any more
and we had one or two er black lads coming in the other end of the building saying we know they've come down here to complain about us you know don't you listen to them but where else are we supposed to go
so a lot of sort of tracking to and fro between one end of the office hoping that the two groups wouldn't meet
and i UNK i mean all that happened with that particular one was a couple of erm of er black i think they were youth workers i'm not actually sure
but black professionals who had the respect of the young element in the flats
got involved and UNK it down a bit and er and found some of the people some premises and i think got them some money from duke of edinburgh award scheme or something to buy music equipment
but i mean they spring up every summer
and it's hard you know ho how do you deal with it
i dunno
no one no one could say that they could UNK noise and it must be awful to live next door to it
erm but it is it's a it's a cultural it's a cultural issue
you can't i mean you can't just UNK it and it will go away
it's just spring up somewhere else
mhm
lots of suggestions old UNK were going to be used as a sort of permanent blues club
there was an idea of using part of the forest for a an area for blues
erm but of course the other problem was that blues parties erm were also places where a lot of UNK was smoked
so you can't actually sort of get a licence to have an all out blues party with UNK
so it still wasn't gonna meet the actual need that prompted them to occur in the first place
er it led to s to trouble at times but as i say less trouble than you might imagine
mhm
erm do you know in the flats erm different ethnic groups
what kind of relationship did they have with erm white tenants has there been much racial tension in the flats or has that been UNK
i don't think there has
i think there's been surprisingly little er perhaps it's a slightly UNK notion but i think it's got something to do with you're all UNK the same kind of misery together
you know
it perhaps UNK and dilute that kind of erm of racial tension from building up
erm i mean you know it's sort of there were certainly there were certainly groups of black tenants and white tenants who mixed and there were certainly groups of white tenants who wouldn't mix with the black tenants and vice versa
and here people can operate erm have that sort of UNK attitudes but that's not the same as saying that they had sort of hostile feelings
erm no surprisingly little
do you kn do you know prior to the eighty one UNK
yeah
erm you were telling me when we had the preliminary interview about erm what happened a few months prior to the UNK that occurred in the late summer
erm when a car went past
yeah that's right
cos i happened to be out on road when it happened
mhm
it was just this car well it was very quiet that not much traffic about
and this car went th right through the through road
with all the windows open
driving fairly slowly and shouting erm racist UNK out the window
but there was also what certainly everyone judged to be a UNK off shotgun pointed out one of the back windows
erm and i mean the people who saw it everyone was UNK
i mean the white people who saw it were UNK
and everyone was quite fearful i think about whether sort of outside influences were gonna sort of introduce erm you know race UNK inverted commas into the area
er it was reported to the police and everyone was a bit UNK
about the outcome of that
i mean they did get the guys
and i think they were charged with something minor like threatening behaviour or breach of the peace something like that
erm it was felt that it UNK something a lot stronger than that
er i think the difficulty was there wasn't much they could charge him with
erm some people around particularly a the asian population around w then became worried about what sort of support they would actually get from the police in real terms if UNK came into the area
and started to UNK up you know racial UNK
erm by that time i mean the there had been lots of problems in other cities
there had been you know what was termed incidents resulting from racial tension
in other areas
so it was kind of an issue that was felt not to be happening in but there was fear that it could it could be introduce you know as i say from outside
i mean a feeling that it wasn't naturally in the area but it could be UNK up
by UNK coming in
erm and that's you know i think that's was wasn't an entirely unrealistic fear
there are always gonna be a set of people in any area who erm who will UNK on to racist attitudes and racist acts if someone comes in waving that as an you know as an organized activity
as i say it was followed i mean it UNK there was no link between the two things
at least i don't think there was
but it was followed a few months later by sort of mini riot
mhm
so could you tell us a bit about that
what actually happened when these UNK took place
what sort did it
was it a sudden UNK was there some kind of build up or
there was a build up in that i think we were one of the last towns to have the problem
i think ours came on the sort of third day of the riot so you'd already had erm birmingham going and er i think bristol as well had gone by then
so there was obviously a lot of debate around you know is it going to happen and if it does happen well it'll clearly happen in
erm i it was strange i know i can't explain it UNK it was just we certainly we felt in the office that we would somehow know if and when it was gonna happen
and that seemed to be a feeling that was er generally shared well certainly shared by some of the people in the flats
i mean the first couple of days we spent a lot of time just trying to cool people down and stop them UNK and er and stop them going over the top
erm but then there came an afternoon where y there were little sort of UNK of mums with UNK you know dragging the kids behind with the UNK loaded up with their sort of precious possessions heading out of the area
and if people had relatives living elsewhere you know that's what they did on this particular afternoon
erm and it went up that night
i mean it was it was a very small affair fortunately i think sort of UNK it too much by giving it giving it the name riot
but there was a lot of damage done to the shops right down the length of road
and just as bad even worse in terms of personal consequences all the sort of corner shops in particularly the asian off licences come UNK were i mean were just UNK
not a thing left
smashed up UNK
and a lot of the UNK didn't have any kind of insurance at all
i mean we had a lot of them are run anyway on credit there's no real capital lying behind those businesses
and so they lost everything
that was it those particular UNK er didn't start up business again
so they were finished
they were finished
yeah
and apparently even now if you try and get insurance on road for your property erm unless you're prepared to pay a UNK high premium you can't get it
it is to the area is still treated differently for insurance terms
to other parts of the city
so that as a direct result of what happened in eighty one
well that's the only thing i can think of
it was described to someone who's recently set up a small restaurant on road as being a high risk insurance area
so er it seems likely it's a consequence of that
erm i mean one fact that emerged after the UNK when the actual arrest figures were analyzed was that the vast majority of people who were arrested at any rate didn't come from the area
very few came from the local area
and they came either from other parts of the city or even from as far away as birmingham
so there w there was certainly some element of people like you know organizing themselves to come down to either intent on creating trouble or erm you know ju just to see what was happening in
really not many local people at all involved in it
and you don't smash up your own nest do you
i mean you go and smash up somebody else's
mhm
so you're saying that basically it was UNK who erm
yeah
were involved in that
yeah
it was
erm and you said in the preliminary interview the fact that there was some people who actually who lived in the flats who said quite am said quite clearly this is not the time to
that's right
it was a very disturbing erm letter that arrived at some flats that was from birmingham
erm i it was sent to known very radical black activists
erm
mhm
certainly it was assumed that there was some kind of organized network
mm
right
behind it
but it was it was from the bosses if you like in birmingham saying don't get involved in this is a small scale UNK cos this is not the time
and er you know the instruction was keep your guns in the cupboard for now
erm and that was very disturbing not many people knew about that letter and certainly it wasn't something that the that the probation staff who saw it erm told anybody about
er apart from the police i think the police were made aware of the letter
erm a and we you know we kept wondering afterwards well when is it gonna be now
because there were guns up in the flats
there may still be guns hidden in flats
and touch wood nothing's happened and hopefully nothing will
mhm
do you
was okay cos you knew there was some heavy organized er guys up there who had UNK and who had they felt differently that time i guess the guns would have come and the police station would have been attacked
although it was bombed at one stage
you say when did that happen
i can't remember it was it wasn't very dramatic
actually
who was actually who was actually who was actually involved was that the an individual or group or
i d i really don't know i really don't know enough about it
i can't a few people were charged with it
i mean it was something fairly minor a petrol bomb or something like that
was chucked at the police station
didn't do a lot of damage
but of course you've now got the modern police station you know
sort of thing
the cameras on the top
more or less you see them coming a mile off now
erm no i can't remember enough about it
as i say it w wasn't a very dramatic incident
mhm
or it di didn't seem to be received in the area as being a
mhm
erm going back to erm to the UNK that did ta took place in nineteen eighty one
did they have any lasting impact on people in the flats or w was it quickly forgotten
i think the
sorry
i think before you spoke about the fact that erm what happened with the that was erm
oh yeah
i think it was
did that have did that have quite an impact in terms of the UNK
actually i don't think it did have quite such an impact
partly because compared with the national picture as i say it was a very small disruption
and er if you look at what happened in birmingham it was nowhere near that sort of scale
and also i think because a lot of publicity erm was given to the actual arrest figures and to the fact that they didn't come from the local area
and that was given higher coverage by the press
so people were sort of you know UNK if you like from their involvement in it
and like it led again to people i'm sure people wanting to get out
and led to increased instability in the in the population in the flats
erm it led again to questions of policing being of UNK importance
and certainly af after the UNK they were always erm couple of days perhaps longer than that where erm local policemen would be up on the UNK playing football with the local kids
and they were always very UNK and waving chatting away
the police and the and the tenants
erm but that you know that didn't carry on much more than a few days after the initial UNK
erm there were quite a few interesting debates that came up about policing after the UNK i mean initially it was the fact that you didn't see any policemen in the flats at all
erm after the UNK the debate seemed to get much more complicated
i mean there were there were still quite a lot of tenants who wanted to see police UNK in twos and threes through the complex
but there were also a lot of people who felt that the presence of er of police in twos and threes actually UNK problems in the flats rather than UNK them down
er and one had to have sympathy w with the police who who's response was well you t you tell us what's the right thing to do
i mean either we're not there or there's too many of us there
erm UNK after blues parties certainly seemed to sort themselves out
erm i mean maybe not to the good of the participants
er there were a couple of times when the police were called and actually turned up and what people believed would have been a minor fight then developed into a you know a major UNK
involving you know just eight or nine people
and it was that kind of debate that went on the last few years
how do you police erm an area UNK
erm the debate still goes on
when they shut the debate sort of shifted to outside the law centre
funnily enough
because the was er was a well known UNK of erm less than pleasant activities
heavy drug dealing and heavy UNK
and there's also the pub where the police the police always knew they could find who they wanted in the
and if they couldn't find them there they had a number of UNK in the
who would er tell them what they wanted to know
when the was shut some of the these from the came to the just across the road
erm and a lot of them UNK themselves out on the pavement erm in groups of s thirty forty people along avenue
and again residents around here contacting the police being very concerned about their safety etcetera
at that stage the UNK response was if we come in we'll UNK it up
so they didn't they kept to their
it was a very hard judgement to make
erm the f the first thing er first of two things that we said we'd look at just now were erm the kind of work that you did erm with clients in the flats
the kind of problems that they had
and how
yes i suppose that perhaps there are two ways of approaching that question
mhm
the first is to just describe briefly the sort of range of offences committed by people who happen
mhm
to live in the flats
and then secondly t to just sort of mention the erm perhaps the more traditional ways of working with people once they've been sent to you by the courts
you know having been labelled
mhm
as an offender
erm i think i probably outlined in the previous interview erm the range of offences but very briefly it was everything from fairly minor trivial offences erm prostitution UNK petty theft
er through to quite a lot of violent crime
er street UNK through to armed robbery
and also of course a lot of crimes that had their that were basically crimes of domestic violence
or family disputes a b hs UNK bodily harm
erm going right through to a er a murder o on one occasion
so that crime the full range of crime you know wh was displayed by some people living in the flats
erm all those i've mentioned before i think the number of people who were convicted of petty offences and maybe had never offended af before and didn't UNK ever again was probably quite high
offence UNK by stress poverty
mhm
UNK to find a way out of the financial UNK that they were in
lot of shop lifting was for that reason
a lot of prostitution was for that reason
and some people are very unfortunate and get caught first time
others do it dozens of time and never get caught but that's another story
so it was a full range of offences and i mean there isn't a typical way of working with a typical kind of offence
erm part of the probation officers job if you like is to hopefully with the cl
eighty nine i mean nine ninety one
i'm ninety one
and

did you have to take a lot to the UNK shop
they used to take flat UNK women's UNK or anything

you see
this d that's true my duck
yeah
now what about at home h how did you do your cooking
what did you cook on
fire
and i lived in a back to back houses and concrete floors no carpets on
that them back to back and on saturday night were the when our mother when they used to go out
next door they'd got a lot of kids and they used to play marbles and they used to UNK on these concrete floors
and if they'd had a row you could hear him
i wouldn't half
and was used to have to er i'm talking about on the green now we used to have to go er right out the gate half way up the street for water and the UNK it was hard to pull up
and you'd got to take a knife in one hand paper in the other paper in the other for business
well must have been hard doing your washing then
what
well we did it
your washing
we did it
oh aye boil them on the fire oh aye we
i always kept the kids cleaned
and can you think of any ways you managed to spin your money out
well when i went to live at the kids are growing up do you see
and er one of the daughters used to work at lane ah that's it
lane
now tha this place at lane they used to make UNK machines and that
and she'd got to say whoever er work for least money got the job
now they used to call er black sheep players angels
but the other place UNK er anybody who worked for less they did
while we were bad off she had to take that job my eldest daughter
and when she come back her had were covered in UNK with er bits of stuff of the machine
but she left there and got another job in
and er the other daughter when we lived up she had to go there for six er and i used to ge had to get up and bring her right down the lane and then i'd got to walk back up that lane meself you see
i'm still here
well thanks very
eh
much mrs
eh
thanks very much
i ain't bore
you want me to start again
yeah
right erm could you tell me about how you left school please
i were let good
well it was nineteen thirteen i know that because i was thirteen
you see i were born in nineteen hundred so that means to say that when it's nineteen ninety eight i'll be ninety eight i think they did that so i could er reckon me age up more easily
but nineteen thirteen i went to this examination and it was called a labour examination and if you were able to pass this examination you could leave school at thirteen
well it'd probably be the june or july before i went in for this exam which they didn't hold very frequently and er then i had to pass this exam and that i could leave school in the august bank holiday
so i left in the bank holiday and er i went to work at er the first job me father worked there
and on street
and er me job there was turning UNK what you'd call UNK you know UNK socks from one side to the other on a piece of wood you know you'd pull the stocking onto this wood put your finger on the back turned it over and threw it down
and er we used to get the work come to us all jumble up in UNK and throw it onto a bench and then of course you'd got to pick the top before you could turn it
we did that and we counted it in UNK of five dozens tied them up with two other stock socks tied together and when we'd done i'll know this UNK right two thousand four hundred socks we got six pence
that's two and half pence in today's money
but strange to relate er i can remember on you know a number of occasions earning a golden half sovereign you know real gold it was then the you know there was the gold coins
nineteen thirteen fourteen fifteen
and so er it was a reasonably good wage but when i first started of course i wasn't on piece rate you used to get a penny an hour when we worked saturday morning got about six and sixpence a week
and er and that's how i went on
now in nineteen er nineteen fifteen the of course the UNK started and i can remember this so well because the day after me birthday er there was a raid a UNK raid on and i saw this UNK and that day the thirty first of january nineteen fifteen when this raid was i UNK i went to work at six in the morning and i finished work at quarter to nine at night
this wasn't regular the real hour was half past six until six o'clock but when we were very busy you could stop you know as long as you like UNK ever bother
all the boss used to say well if anybody comes round th that you don't know just go and hide in a UNK
you know in case there was any inspector or anybody but er i don't remember anybody ever coming
we just worked as long as we liked and it and it was hard work of course it was turning these socks like that two well it was hundred dozen pays that's two thousand four hundred
and you used to get sixpence for that
so how much could you earn in a week
well that's well i cou i could earn a lo er a golden half sovereign
that was it
did this go to your did you live with your mother at the time with your parents
oh of course oh i was only fourteen aye
of course and that w oh i and ti and so anyway i started er work in august nineteen thirteen and er when december came around er there was a strike
and at that time the hosiery finishing union had perhaps got eight hundred er nine hundred members spread over perhaps eight factories
and er there was a er one of the prominent factories was at
now it er they said that this chap had g had gone to work after an illness and the boss said well er you've been away six weeks he said there's no job here for you now
he'd worked there years and years
and he got the sack so the firm came on strike
and er then they started UNK and when they started the rest of the firms all came as well then and i remember er going down on the picket lines and er they'd be all the members there
you know i don't know who wouldn't go
er with the addition of a lot of members of the public who UNK and knew what was happening
well they got these UNK and i could tell you a story about that as well
now a man as i used to visit older than me now er the UNK used to be UNK with police to their homes like from this factory
they'd sometimes er take them in vans depending where they lived and how many of them but where there was a single one two police used to UNK him and they UNK him what where we what they call the UNK
and it was a real big UNK at back of
and er now this chap him a wan he was about ninety and him and his pal they said well we'll lie in the there were a lot of bull UNK we'll lie in these bull UNK he says and we'll throw bricks at them as they go by at these two police and er this UNK
and er he tells me he says well we night that we were going to do it meeting them from work it w it was getting dark of course december he said that there was only me turned up
he says er and he says me pal didn't come he said well i thought well i've come here to do it and i'm going
so i said i went and lay in the in these bull UNK and i got half a brick yes he says and i saw them coming and he says and i threw it and hit him this er UNK with this half brick
he said of course i UNK through these bull UNK they never saw me they never caught me and they never ever knew who it was who'd done it see
and he always tells me he said that er he had no sleep during the night he thought he'd killed this man you see he says i seen him drop and i seen blood
so i thought i've killed him
and er so he never had any sleep that night well that was the that's a story about them days
how did you feel about trade unionism then
well now everybody had to be in a union in our factory it was er it was they were closed shops all of them
and er y and it's surprising isn't it
there was you know little firms like that and yet everybody was in nobody would ever try and er and er and er and escape paying their contribution but there was a law you couldn't join a union till you were sixteen that was the law then in then but er when this strike came back and we came on strike in december er we lads who was under age joined the union they give us all six bob a week the union did
un until they were broke you know after a week or two they got broke
and so th union er issued er a leaflet affair and said that they'd be pleased to receive loans from any of the members
would any of the members lend them any money
now the co op allowed of course there was individual co UNK then this was co op it wasn't like what had a big co op
but they allowed all strikers er to have er free credit free credit and er well of course this six bob was what we got o practically on an ordinary weeks work was about as well off on strike then and we was going to work you see
but what i was going to tell you about this loan and i was there on this friday morning when we were drawing our money and the men were bringing their s life savings to lend to the union
and i saw one man the fact that he was me uncle don't make any difference but he was and he was very religious very christian man s sunday school superintendent
but i saw him with his cap full of golden UNK and turned on the table and lent them all he'd got
and everyone were paid back you know
that that's good isn't it
mm
now so anyway the strike er never reached a successful conclusion this firm had it's UNK and er eventually closed because it couldn't carry on
but every other factory agreed to take so many each of the men so they'd nobody be at lose their job
and they did
and the factory where i work i should think we took about fourteen of the men at this factory
but no man was unemployed
was it mainly male labour then
well it were main i no really there was er well pretty equally divided then
and the general run of hosiery is that there is of course that there's a lot more females than males but in our side pretty equal
the finishing side and so that was that
er you read a lot about women in the hosiery industry not being as willing to join the unions was that true
well in them days everybody used to be in anyway there was no question
all the women were and that's true of the hosiery industry of course you've got a there's a big distinction between the hosiery industry as such and the hosiery finishing industry which was then the they're amalgamated now but there were two entirely distinct unions in tho er as a matter of fact they n they never met together
course the hosiery union was as it is now was always right wing and the small finishing union was really er left wing you know
but we was all in and they was er they wasn't fifty per cent organized anyway near
now of course that's er the story but i went to them afterwards you see
so anyway i er the war came and went but before it went i was in went int eh army of course
at eighteen i was called up for the army and i was three years there
came back in twenty one
i don't think there's anything really amazing about me army career i didn't
i don't know whether i was a good soldier or not but i went to egypt and the UNK
i had a good look round you know
UNK
er right are you
we're still going
switch er as switch it off a minute while i er
er i nineteen eighteen in the army they er came round er asking for volunteers to relieve the british troops er on the russian front where there was fighting the russian revolution
and of course you know there are twenty odd UNK at where they were fighting and er they made big UNK of this because er the people who did volunteer knew there was a few volunteered they gave them er white bands to wear round the arm to show that they was members of the relief force you know
and so it were good propaganda this er this people were saying well they're prepared to go to russia and fight the russians to re you know release our lads they're trying to UNK
and er but of course that didn't last long because of course you know the story of the jolly george when that really stopped UNK intervention didn't it
you know that
i don't know about the jolly george
don't you should do
i well i could tell you the inside story of that but i'm not going to but i will tell the outside the public story
the jolly george er was a ship that was loaded with arms er to send to russia to for our the use of our troops in russia and the sailors refused to sail it and there was quite a to do about this because they'd got the steam up and it was ready to go but they never went
and it never sailed
and that was the real reason why it was stopped because the other dockers were going to refuse to allow ships to leave the ports with arms and that's where it really stopped but you never heard you don't hear about it now in history
no
but anyway er and then of course i we went to the east well we went to ireland first there was trouble in ireland you know
i went to ireland but we was only there about three weeks
the reason why we was there b it was because er there was so many UNK in our lot
but they took what few they'd got left on our regiment to ireland so nobody UNK desert while they UNK the others up and took them to ireland you see
and then so we went from ireland er to er to egypt
come back through england and went to on the boat
we'd took incidentally which is not UNK it took us ten days to get to er egypt to get to UNK from er plymouth we went from plymouth
and er the date was december the fourth now december the fourth and that was the day which er you wouldn't know this but er that was the day when fought er joe you know for the european UNK
i don't know of any boxing match that's ever captured the interest of people and it was that night course we never heard the result not until we got to egypt you there was no wireless you see you didn't know what was happening at all
and er if you were interested in football you'd never know till tuesday morning what had happened on that saturday the previous saturday
i mean that's how communications were in them days
and anyway so we went to er over to egypt and then it was when we came back and i the other morning on the radio they was talking about asking people to ring in about i've never rang in i never bother ring er how they spent their twenty first birthday
now my twenty first birthday i'd never had a copper for weeks w e hadn't got anything at all and all we got really was the old fashioned dog biscuits
and i was in UNK and er and that was it that was my twenty first birthday there you see
and anyway when we got back to england er we went to aldershot and wasn't there long
but while we were there they had several meetings because of course we were going to be UNK anyway and the colonel er of the regiment he had us together and so did the officers and warned us that when we got back to civilian life we must er beware of these UNK who tried to er create suspicion amongst the troops who were coming back and telling them that they ought to join er these revolutionary parties
warning us all about this so well i thought well if they warn us something must be good here if they're warning us that it's bad you know
and so when i er i UNK i went back to work
and there was a lad who was about a couple of years older than me he'd be about twenty three he'd been through the war and er he was a real revolutionary he was re and he was very intelligent
so he started me on the on politics and he was very good
he'd got the one of the quickest er turns of er of brain you know he could switch from one thing to another and he was most remarkable
he really was
he died pretty but he's got
and he was a member of the independent labour party
so i used to go with him and UNK he was a he was very good on classical music although we never went into this although i'd got very close to him but i'm sure he were brought up in an UNK you know and never talked about this but i'm sure he was
but he was a real first class tutor
well so we went to the i l p and er at this time we started getting er a class together in the where i worked there was a hundred men and hundred lads approximately
every man had a lad working for him you see
so at this er time we decided we'd start er a little class in this we did
and we got the union to er all they did was to help us was to pay for the text books that we had
if you see we'd got about er twenty eight thirty in this class and er they bought the text books and we joined a national college of labour colleges
now you've heard about them of course you must have heard about them
and er i think er the UNK of the working class movement s i is from the date when the n c l c was abolished and opt into the general council of the t u c
you see the t u c education er department is er rises from the UNK of the n c l c but of course the n c l c was really good first class tutors
we'd got two in and they was really first class
i could say a lot about ho but anyway we started this and we used to go to the i l p and we used to get packed meetings there on a sunday night and s then about nineteen course we had the general strike and through the general strike we was both in the i l p and we were doing everything we could you know distributing the illegal leaflets and er newspapers that we UNK on a hand UNK
and er so i spent several years in the i l p as a secretary and at that time met er the people who ran the place
he including UNK he was a big man in the i l p you know
till he formed his new party
as a matter of fact i've been i've got a book now from the library we got last week that er about UNK and er and his daughter and it's good
are you right
yeah
there was a s an indian student came to and he was a prospective labour candidate but the labour party prevented him from being a candidate er because er his main theme in life was to try and get india free from you know the british empire
and er he was having a conference in course with dropping out of the labour party the labour party finished with him and didn't bother and UNK he someone i don't know who it was it wasn't him himself but someone told me that he was looking for somebody to organize this conference in so i said well i i'll do it
and er so this student came to and i organized a conference and took the chair for him you know and er and helped him every possible way
and he er and he was really delighted of course so he said well i'm holiday and i'll come round with the caravan so i had my holiday which didn't make much difference because there was had to you know we weren't working really and i went round with him for this week all round and the villages everywhere
on the theme that india must be free you see
and i can remember having a rubber stamp made and every letter that went out i insisted every one should have this frank on india must be free
and er now this chap was you never hear of him
well his name was a very brilliant man well w he'd be nearly as old as me of course
and er i've heard it mentioned about him on people who have interviewed him on television
and they said he never said much to them well he perhaps didn't he wouldn't do because he was like that you see but UNK before interviewing him on television er of course the war came and india was given freedom and er there used to be you know the sweet people who used to have a big factory on road was a very famous sweet in them days i don't think they are now but was a very good sweet firm and they'd got a daughter cos she was in the during the war the anglo soviet friendship er she was one of the course they'd got hundreds but she was one
and er the years went by and al all i know is that he said ooh she's married a london doctor you see
so i was UNK through the bus station one day and i met this girl and er ooh she said i'm glad i've seen you she said
she said er i was at a reception in london at the indian UNK and when er i was introduced as coming from she says the high commission said to me you come from
she said and it were of course
he was the first high commission for england in england said you come from she says yes he says you don't happen to know jack do you
she says i do know him well he said well i'll i am pleased he's alright
says yes
he says well you tell him from me that i shall never forget
you see that was nice wasn't it
mm
and then he went from england as being high commission he went to russia to be the first indian UNK in the soviet union and that were
do you remember much about other members of the i l p at the time particular names
oh yes
oh yes i do
turn the fire up cos it's not very warm in here
aren't you he says he's always warm
i'm fine thanks
and i'm warm enough
you'll see
are you warm enough in there
can you find plenty to do
yeah i can looking after you
and anyway er switch it on
er i l i left it on i can cut that bit out when i
i do oh i don't know i'd leave that i mean what were
talking about other people in the i l p
oh other people in i l p
yeah
now in this little booklet that i've got about the er the UNK history of the UNK debating society it mentions a very brilliant man by the name of w h now i was very friendly with him because he was th president of the i l p and i was the secretary
and he was a brilliant man
i've met a lot of brilliant people and was one
he was great
he was a salesman for the pencil firm you know a big pencil firm
and i always remember he said to me he'd placed the biggest orders for UNK of course in them there were no ball pens er he received that from the london county council by accident
it was di he used to he he'd got an office in london and he went every day to london catch the train about twelve o'clock catch the train back about four
he'd only go for a couple of hours to his london office
a b on one day he went earlier and he had his lunch in london he said and there was another man on the table and er the both reached for the salt together and upset it and there was apologies and talks and then he discovered that he was the buyer for the london county council
so he placed an order with him for all these and he had to come back to the factory UNK the factory to meet this terrific order he'd got for UNK you see
that was
and he s he said to me he said er at that time after the war the UNK the UNK had er UNK er working class flats in vienna something UNK of
and we'd seen photographs of these and they were marvellous and he said to me i should like to see these UNK these flats he said er i'm gonna convince the board that it's necessary in the interests of the firm for me to go to austria you see
so he said but any road before i go he said er and my first nineteen twenty nine this was and we went together on holiday on the continent which was UNK of you know for working class people but we went in nineteen twenty nine
we went to er UNK and he went from UNK at the end of this week's holiday to austria for the firm you know
and er i don't know where they've gone now but i had some lovely photographs of these flats
an then a few months later he said well oh he said i'm g i'll go to canada he says er i'll tell them
and he went and told them how necessary it was for him to go to canada in the interests of the firm
he said but i said are you going
he said i'm going he said but he said i've got to i've got to take the s the this UNK ran this firm and his name was if i remember right
he said i've got to take his stupid son with me
so he had to go there to canada you see and er and
and it says in this booklet that w h was for one for a period the prospective labour candidate for er central as was then
he said but he never fought the election well now i know he did that's a mistake cos he did
because he told me about the chap who was his agent
this was before i was associated with him was his agent
and he said but the way i'd like to do it he says i i'd love to fight it again with er with you as me agent instead of i'm sure i could win it
and i remember going to the empire to a debate we took with
and er i think the liberal was norman you know the great barrister
and er a tory
and he were a lot better than the tory and he held his own with which was saying something saying something
but anyway he died in his forties of er UNK he said sugar UNK and he died which is a pity
but his son i kept in touch with his son for years he was an architect
he was on the trades council
and er he always used to say of me he say well you know er he was on the executive he said of the trades council
he says you know go ho i go home he says and i could never make out UNK you praise me or criticize me
he said i i'll never really know and i think now what was he was he UNK me or blaming me he said and i'll never know
you know it was fun though
very nice lad
what did you think about the parliamentary labour party at the time
well now the parliamentary labour par what happened was that er oh i went to a conference at the i l p in carlisle annual conference
and er it was real great event and of course UNK was to speak in there
on the committee of the i l p at that time and john and then er and then an mp from er birmingham fred
one of one of one of the most UNK speakers i ever heard he was
and er it was at that time that the independent labour party left the i the labour party
you see the majority er at least half the er labour mps also was in membership with the i l p
but when the i l p wanted to lay down more UNK lines the labour party wanted to throw them out anyway and so the i l p UNK all decided that er the best thing to do was to leave rather than get thrown out
and which is different for today but that was what really happened
well and so it split the labour party and the from er at that time you know we got five hundred members in with the labour party
and er we had our own hall in street
own hall
where we had meetings packed every sunday night and dances you know people more was er much more UNK then the people were i don't know about the m p but the people were much more UNK
i mean during the er UNK the general strike i know that there were pubs in you know ordinary working class pubs and they used to close with the singing of the red flag
you know amazing change
my view of the general strike is that if we'd have had a UNK we'd have had a revolution
the people were r they really were ready you know i think so
mind you some people living through that you know george
no
don't you
i had a letter from him last week er a lengthy letter
well george's secretary at the UNK debating society after er tom UNK had er died and er george takes an entirely different view of from me of the you know
he's more right wing than me he's a very far he's a good socialist he's a very fair man
but he we don't share opinions about the general strike
he don't think it was but i i'm sure it was
i UNK remember being with our newspaper being chased up road and you know the police were chasing me of course i were only young i could run faster then
but in any case i'd chucked all me things in the UNK you know and that's so when they caught up with me i hadn't got any newspapers
i'd thrown them away
how did the newspapers at the time respond to the ge general strike
well there were no newspapers
the newspapers
er well of course they were opposed to everything working class there was some er some sympathy from the old journal and the evening news was a lot better course it was it was a liberal paper
and it was pretty liberal too
er but of course there was no newspapers er printed at all then and i've got there was a UNK paper what did they call that
and there was our paper the british worker
what did he call his paper
i've got one upstairs
what
UNK was it
was it UNK
no
i've got one of his papers upstairs somewhere
somewhere i've got it
you know that was i issued during the time
the general strike was a was a great time
was a great time
they could have gone over the top you know i think i'm sure they could i'm certain they could
i mean you know what happened when wh when th general strike was on there was er nothing entered unless it'd got a permit from a trades council and you know that don't you
didn't you know that
oh yeah
when they got to bridge they if they hadn't got a permit they had to go back the UNK be there
the trades council it would be
and one of the UNK debates during that time there was whether to allow beer UNK over
w who you know they allowed food UNK through and the great debate was beer food
you know and they came down that it was food and they allowed the beer barrels to proceed over the bridge
you know they were UNK buses and everything up then you know
so was much more UNK then
was good then
mm
and the tr how did the trades council organize
trades council was all for it
it was well up i w i wasn't a second at it
they were a well organized trades council
very well organized
and there was real UNK they was good
aye and there were very few people caught you know for when the particularly buses which was a UNK firm they used to tip their buses over
they'd never let them run from to
people had to get out and they'd turn the bus over time and time
i i've got a paper somewhere that refers to this business i don't know where
go on are you are you right
yeah i'm alright
right
well of course came the war and er like for about twelve years like before the war i'd been president of the hosiery UNK association
and then in nineteen forty two the secretary the very well known for a number of reasons secretary of the hosiery workers his name was he was the j p and he was er i wouldn't say he's a UNK of the tory party but he weren't far off you well he died
and er they advertised er for a secretary
well i was very reluctant to put in for this job i didn't want to really but i was you know people said put in for it you won't get it if you put in
and er i thought well i won't really and i probably didn't like losing anyway you know i was never a good UNK i don't think and i thought no i shan't get many votes and i'll look silly i'm not putting in for it
but anyway there was so many people and one chap who he was as a matter of fact he was organizer with communist party for whom i've got the very greatest respect the very greatest respect
because er his name was les and he got er and the whole family was real UNK labour supporters at
and his brother he was in the er spanish civil war he was an officer he was a miner but he left to join the spanish brigade and er he came back and of course but after the general strike they wouldn't neither set him nor his brother on the pits you know
and he never got into the pits so les and he was er was a very fine marxist that he could tell you anything you know about marxism
and as a matter of fact he if er if ever you went to see him about anything and said what about this les
and he'd say well and he'd got a whole string of UNK books and he'd reach down and pick one and turn to the right page straight away says this is what UNK said and he said i'll stand by this you know
but les was a great bloke
but he got down the pit after you know whe after the war
er they had them all back like when the pits was nationalized all these people who'd been sacked you know got back on
and so these two brothers they both got back on but unfortunately er les he was made a full time official of the miners when he retired full time official of the miners union
er but unfortunately les died
very great loss to that was
very great loss
and er but his brother's still alive and is a retired miner
aye
do you remember many people going off to the red brigade
to the international brigade
oh yes quite a few quite a few
now talking UNK the UNK i'll come back to that again because there was a lad there and he was in the independent labour party and er his name was eric and er this UNK will tell you said he answered more questions when he spoke and at nineteen he was he spoke he answered more questions than any other speaker had ever answered at the UNK you know he got a record for answering questions
but he was a very fine lad
and he were nineteen then he went and he got killed
eric his name should be remembered but nobody now will know but he was in the i l p
i tell you he was a very good bloke
and he got killed oh aye
UNK you know UNK
in fact i've got to i'm going to interview him
when
soon
i've not fixed up the date yet
and where you going to interview him
i don't know yet i've
at his er at his work
where he is independent UNK you know
mm
oh i was very i haven't seen him for a while being ill you don't but er he was always sending messages of good will when i was in hospital
UNK a very he you'll enjoy him he'll be good
he'll be your star turn you must see him when you can
but the best thing to do is to see him at his off where he works he's a UNK you know that do you
mm
good too
i've got lot's of clothes he's made me
what about UNK in
do you remember fascist meetings
they was never strong in you'd think it would be in a place like this but they weren't
er i remember a debate they'd two debates there was one on the market square and there was one at the UNK between the black shirts er and of course the UNK platform was open to anybody didn't matter who they were any shade of opinion
er no there was never really active in
the new party made some members when they started but when they turned themselves into the fascist party er they rid of themselves of many of these er new party peop was in the new party you know
he was a very brilliant man you know
his father was editor of the UNK and there was a very you know intelligent family really
but he joined the new party and so it er he UNK his guns for a long while
yes now then where are we going
talking about the formation of the national union
oh yes aye that's right
so anyway i put in for this job and there were people who ought to have got it before me er for instance er there was a councillor at er at tom did you know tom
well he was a councillor at and a leader of the labour group on the council at for ooh about thirty forty years
his father before him was a fine man too he was a prominent member of the co op
and anyway he was one of the candidates but what i didn't know at that time there was a real UNK between the women and the men
anything the men wanted the women would oppose and vice versa
so of course when tom was put up and er there was about five of us put up for this job they was all members of that union and i wasn't
i was a member of the other union like the hosiery UNK
but because all the men were supporting tom all the women was in a vast majority was opposed to him and they'd vote for anybody and it happened to be me you see
they didn't know me
and er i got they'd got about twelve hundred members and i think i got about a thousand of course there weren't two of the men that knew and they voted
er and so i got the job like dead easy you see
i've got an interesting point that i relate about this job that when i went to see them about starting this job they said well they never told me before i got in they said er we've er we've got no money so we can't pay you a very good wage but er we'll start you off with five pound a week that's all we can afford well i was earning more than that during the war nineteen forty two
and so er i thought well i don't know you know i don't know
and so i said saying to my wife well i said er i've got i'm going to get involved in bus fares to and from office and i'd got two kids at that time and i said er i don't know when anne said well no good cos she was a good socialist and all and says right no good letting money stand in the road as it will get by
here take it
so i took it for a drop you see
but there were true to their word
well we formed the national union that UNK have you read any books on that aye formed that about nineteen forty five i should think guess that'll be it about forty five
and er then i left them in forty six and went back to me first love and er it was a little self contained union
i think it was one of the best in the country and i'm serious about that
not because i was there but it was
and then we had a wage structure that was second to none really
we had a cost of living bonus when it was practically unknown to have a cost of UNK which we'd had er since er immediately after the first world war nineteen time
we had a cost of living bonus and er our wages rose with the cost of living er every month not every year
every month we got this cost of living course it didn't er it didn't er UNK like it did in more recent years but it was a safeguard and we always got increases on top of that like piece work increase and er it was a it was a good union it you know
with we got UNK that no other union not of it's size ever had
there was two thousand we er you know was more than a union it was it was a first class friendly society as well and it was friendly
as a matter of fact er as the years went by we got this UNK fund and we used to give all the old w as a UNK we got a pension fund i know it don't sound much now but at that time like during and just after the war we paid twelve and sixpence a week pension to all everybody who'd retired from the union after they'd done time and we also gave them extra grants and took them on er you know UNK until a time i said well we're spending all this money on UNK we could buy a bungalow at the UNK and let them all go you know pensioners go in their turn free
and so we did this and we had this bungalow at UNK which is still running we've been down we went down a few weeks ago
and the pensioners go down to this bungalow free and it's in lovely spot and we gave something like two thousand pound for it
and i was very friendly with the manager's secretary of the co op UNK at that time who was a big noise in and er he UNK it for us at wholesale price you know and everything they UNK the bungalow
put the carpets put everything in and er and we paid for it and they still go ad now course the national union's taken it over but when we joined the national union there were two things that er i UNK before we'd join
and one was that this bungalow should be retained completely er by members of the hosiery UNK in spite of being a national union which of course has still operated and secondly that er nobody should go to this union until er at least when i've finished that they should be voted for and they weren't going to impose anybody on this union they'd vote for somebody from among their own members which of course operated and that's operating now
see
and er i'll show you a little booklet i've got somewhere on that about the nation about his bungalow
which perhaps not revolutionary but to me it was er it was but of all these things that er we've done lots of things you know but the thing that i that stands out in my memory is that er it'd be about nineteen forty eight there was a one of the old members who i worked with was lived alone and he was very ill
so i went to see him and the neighbour said to me well i said god it's cold i said why ain't he got a fire
she said well she said the truth is you know we keep bringing sticks in and that but he's got no er he's got no fire he's got no coal he can't he can't make a fire
you know there were only very few UNK so i said well we've got this money in the UNK fund
so i ordered him a load of coal
i went down to the straight away to the coal dealer and said take him a load of coal and he took him
well i told the committee and they were delighted and so was i
er and that's one thing that stands out in my of course he died but the point is at least he died with a fire
and er i think that's good you know
i'm UNK enough to think that's good and er and er and lots of things like that you know but that th really stands out
i remember the man very well and alone
and i tell you one of my early UNK when i went to school i'm going back now was er across the way from where i lived was a family and their name was i remember the name although i'd only be about nine
i remember their name
i'd only be nine
and er he and i know where he worked at brass UNK on road and he fell ill
and he died
and er of course there were no pension no UNK pension no nothing at all
and so there was er old age pension state there was nothing then you know nothing at all
and so er they had to go to the UNK you see and i can see it now in this er this UNK street and this er cab er drawn by a horse of course UNK cab
and i can see this er this woman with her three children go off to the UNK and er they was crying but they were waving and then all the neighbours was out waving to them
now that's er a recollection isn't it
going to the UNK yeah this family mm
do you do you remember ever having long periods of illness yourself
at all
i only had one illness in my life until last year
and er i had er in nineteen sixteen i had er what they called UNK fever which now they call UNK fever you know
i had s that for sixteen weeks
and i never went to hospital because me cousin was a nurse who'd er you know got married and so she er UNK to nurse me which she did and er the then er health people in allowed me to stay at home because of this you see and i was at home and er that was in nineteen sixteen
and that's the only illness i that i ever had
and did you find it difficult managing without the money your parents
well me parents they got they was alright they you know what i mean they weren't wealthy but they were they'd always got enough to live on
me dad had got a decent job for them times you know he i think he got thirty bob a week which was a lot of money
but he was alright you know what i mean with the i never really knew want there were lots of things that i wanted and never got of course but i never really i could never say i wanted and i never went hungry not even at any time you know
did your mother work at all
she worked at home she used to make er bags you know er shopping bags and she was a very good UNK and a remarkable cook and everything
she could do anything she was a wonderful woman
and er a very UNK christian who never went to er chapel like in her later years but she was she was a good christian lady
aye
and she died of a cancer and er so did me father and probably so shall i but if a cancer don't kill me summat else will
erm you started work
at
yeah it's on you started work at in nineteen thirteen
that's right
er how did you go about getting the job
well jobs were weren't particularly hard to get in nineteen thirteen and er well in any case me father worked there and he'd worked there many years so i it was the normal thing that you usually followed your father like
although i wanted to go down the pit because you got more money you see
in those day
nearly all my friends were down the pit
oh really
oh aye
cos i thought the pit was quite well known for being a poor payer
well i it wasn't so bad as where i er as when i went
and they didn't work so many hours i worked er i don't know whether i told you this last time but er i worked my normal week was sixty six hours sixty six hours for five shilling
was this when you started
ah nineteen thirteen
so when you started did you receive a wage rather than piece rate
i received it was it was yes that's right until you get into the job yeah
five bob and then you get on a piece rate
i must have told you before that what we got er we used to turn and bundle two thousand four hundred i told you that didn't i
mm
did i tell you that story
what did erm
for sixpence
what did tu turning a UNK actually involve
why did the socks have to be turned
why because they was UNK on the wrong side
erm you see they were UNK on the wrong side you know they were of course it was easier to UNK than it would be if they UNK them on the right side you see it was technically i far superior
and so that's what they did
so how many departments would there be at the time
well there'd be dying and UNK and UNK sorting UNK packing drying all kind you know that that's about total number of departments UNK
would each department have it's own foreman then
oh yes oh yes even if it was a department of only ooh five or six people there'd be somebody in charge
always be a charge hand foreman
yeah was a is a was a charge hand different to a foreman then
we well a foreman usually was over more workers than a charge hand was
you see you could have a charge hand over er two or three people really he'd be working with them but he he'd be the charge hand
i mean the chap that the management would come to and say well has there's this particular lot of work gone through yet
or and he he'd know this that'd be his job as well
i see
th er th did i tell you about er how i how i started at how i left school
taking the labour examination
that's right that's right
yeah
er go on glad i've got that bit
yeah so how would the workers presumably the er charge hands and UNK were promoted from the shop floor
how did you feel
usually pretty fairly
how did you feel about pi your own people sort of being transferred into positions of authority was there much UNK
er well n not really because they had to be in the union
mm
you see if they wanted to be a foreman he'd still in the union
so it didn't make a great deal of difference really you know you you'd still got er some jurisdiction over them even though they were the foreman like
yeah and what was your father's job at
well he was a foreman of the sorting room
you know and he was when i started there in nineteen thirteen
and er th that was it
how much would he have received for that
well er i his wage round about er first world war s UNK fourteen thirty bob a week which was a good wage
mm
and you were earning about ten bob a week then
well at that time i was getting as much as ten bob a week
s and was that the whole wage for the whole family or were there other members of the family working
oh no other money coming in oh no
did you have any brothers and sisters
i've got one brother but he was younger than me and at that time he were going to school anyway
so was the s the family standard of living reasonably high in those days
it were reasonable quite re er as a matter of fact we could afford to go on ho my father could afford to take us on a holiday every year
where about
to the UNK
whereabouts
well we the main place was UNK although we was at blackpool when in fourteen when the war started
went to blackpool one or on one or two occasions but me mother suffered with er with her heart and the doctor said well don't go to blackpool again the UNK too strong
so we didn't you see after that
yeah
did your mother work at all
not until er when was it ooh i think not until er me brother and i were married and her and me father were together and she used to do a bit of homework er making these er kind of leather bags
mm
you know sewing the leather bags
so as a youth and a child she didn't take
no
do any work to make end ends meet
never done any work at all after being married no never no
she was a lace UNK
she'd been a lace UNK before she married your father
she was a lace UNK yes that's right
that's right
yeah you just mentioned the wars you remember much about the war in
well th i must have told you because it's one of the things that er stand out that on the day when they dropped the first bomb in i and i and it was er it'd be the thirty first of january but i don't know whether it was er fifteen or sixteen nineteen fifteen or nineteen sixteen
on that particular day i was coming home from work and it were quarter to nine i'd just finished work
and i'd started at six in the morning
and i'd been there from six in the morning till quarter to nine
and there were two of us worked together a lad my age and myself
and we was walking down street when a soldier was coming and he said er you want to er you want to make UNK home me lads the UNK are about you see
well you know what kids we kind of laughed at this you know we didn't take it as serious
so we UNK home and by the time just when we got home perhaps by you know we'd get home at nine by quarter past nine er we saw the UNK come over
you could see this UNK
i remember this
was this the one that hit UNK was that cos UNK was bombed wasn't it
aye that's right
UNK and er and the water fountain in street
mm
that's right that's the one
did it drop any other bombs or
er there was er i think there were thr i think there were three killed in street three people in a killed in a house in street
er but everybody in went down to see what had happened like you know to see UNK
they'd never you know imagined that anything like that could quite happen so we
mhm
well i went down and had a look at it as a kid you know
i remember seeing UNK
with
did
er a tear in it's side
mm
did it upset people or
not really i don't think so
it were a talking point but er it wasn't er n nobody seemed unduly UNK about it
mm
go going back to before the war erm last time you spoke you mentioned a s strike in nineteen thirteen
that's right
erm what how did that come about
well it came about and i believe this man's name was but i wouldn't be too certain i think it was
and er he worked at
and er it was said that he was he UNK been away ill
well when he went back to work er they didn't let him start
and he hadn't been off long perhaps been off three or four weeks i would say
and the boss said well you know he hadn't got the work for him and he couldn't start then
and so what happened was everybody UNK tools at and come out on strike you see
and er it got very serious
so after a fortnight thereabouts the union had a meeting and decided that everybody in the industry like which of course there was only about a thousand of us any way everybody would s would stop until this man could start at work
so that's everybody came out
mm
and er but this was a very determined man everybody knew that one of these although he he'd got probably er the best factory in the city
like for quality of UNK
the workers were good his machinery was good
but any way he decided to s to take UNK
and er he advertised and got quite a few
not they weren't members of ours and they weren't er skilled in the trade but hey were just people who were prepared to work any way and UNK through as best they could
would they be local people
oh aye
and er the police used to take them in black UNK some of them
some of them had to walk because you they couldn't take them in any UNK at all because er it was over what they call the UNK you know and the big UNK and UNK i told you about a chap hitting them didn't i
mm
yeah
hitting somebody on the head with a brick
aye
and there was quite a few court cases
what court cases against the strikers
yes oh aye
because was there was there much violence
well there i they used to s you know invite everybody you said to you know everybody down on the picket line well we were kids we used to go like re to be quite honest like we went because it were you know a bit of fun really
but there were police on UNK charging them
and i always remember now whether this is true i wouldn't know and i don't think i've ever spoke about this before but i thinking about it just now it's just struck me i remember one chap saying well now if we put some UNK wire across the road about two foot high he said no horse will jump over UNK wire now i don't know i don't suppose that's true i don't think it is but this chap said that
so they went and got some UNK wire and they UNK it across this street you know street at
i could remember it but i just couldn't say now whether the police were stopped in their tracks
but there was a lot of police there was a lot of er UNK you know ooh aye six or seven hundred UNK
we and they used to go there when the UNK came out
yes so what was
and there were three UNK lived in er in one house in avenue
and so every night when they got home there was all kinds of people i mean you know say miners and anybody as well they all surrounded this house and when the police brought him in of course they were UNK and all this business you see
well one night he got really rough and er they broke these windows
and at the court i can remember this as a kid at the court of course i wasn't in at the court but i remember the story the UNK er picked out people and said they and they and they threw stones you see through the window
so of course these chaps well i don't UNK they were youths and chaps and that denying it
and er i always remember the lawyer who was acting on behalf of the union er said to these UNK how would it be possible for you to see it though your window who was throwing the bricks seeing that the windows are so black and UNK you can't see the curtains that's hanging up from the outside
so you couldn't possibly see who was throwing er the windows were too UNK
and they got off
got off
was the was the lawyer paid for by the union
oh aye oh aye
i don't remember but he must have been
and but any anyway we got er i've probably tell you this before the co op allowed everybody to have er credit until it was over and there was a n there was a preacher wh who er and i don't know whether a UNK or a UNK preacher i think he was a UNK he was a UNK and his name was
and er he was he you know came and spoke and he was very good aye
was your family religious
aye religious aye
what UNK
UNK
they when i was younger used to go regular but they didn't go regular you know as years advanced
but er m anyone ask i remember me mother was a great christian really
although she didn't go to er but me dad did always you know believe in the UNK
was the church very important in the community then
oh yeah
particularly
particularly the non UNK
mm
oh yes
oh yes
how did you fell about the church of england and the
well they always er regarded the church of england as er a little socially and erm politically they'd er erm the tories of course m mainly the church was tories and er like in wales the non UNK was er more UNK inclined
so was there strong connections between the UNK and UNK churches and the trade unions
yes
well there was between this particular UNK chapel and er in our street it was as it's practically opposite the u present union office
yeah i think i know
you know up the side street but now it's used as a as a store house but you can tell it's a it's an old UNK and they used to get full you know
the they used to the non UNK whether or not i couldn't speak for the church of england but er there'd be a lot go you know i in the evening there'd be several hundred at every one of these places and there was there'd be ooh four or five non UNK places in
little place like that
and they'd all get full
oh yeah it was very strong
yeah you said your uncle was a religious man
me UNK me grandfather
was it your grandfather
now he was very religious
he was er me mother's chief objection to him it was me father's father me mother's chief objection was that he was always talking about UNK and she couldn't stand this you know
and they said he's UNK ah your UNK always talking about there's going to be a revolution
but he he'd got a little mission er on the side of the at i've i went with him so i saw it
