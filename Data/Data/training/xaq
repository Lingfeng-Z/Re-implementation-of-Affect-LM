but i do you know i've been back since but i just couldn't find it now but there it'll be but on the side of the er at he used to UNK at this mission there was only him you know used to UNK and i don't know how many other people were at it wouldn't hold above er wouldn't hold above thirty
a little tiny place
but he used to go there he used to nearly live there and er you know
he was always preaching there he was the man who ran it
ah
was politics important at home in your childhood
well it was for well me dad was a l me dad was a liberal
course there wasn't no labour pen men then you know
but when the first labour man put up for in the area west 's constituency now as near as possible
er put up there you wouldn't know of would you
no when would
no
this be
well probably nineteen fourteen
and er i think it was er in the election in er perhaps twenty two er got in
previously they'd always been er very UNK liberal well know UNK sir james and he represented the teachers
that was that was in that union
very er able capable man but anyway and he was in for years but er beat him
were he was a an ex west councillor
i don't know whether he went to jail over the job you know in east and west
and er i think they were most of them went to jail and i think did but when he came down here he beat
one of his chief claims to UNK was that he got about thirteen kids you know but a very capable bloke
so did the labour party have UNK working class support in
they did yeah
in then
oh yeah be in and yeah
n nobody strange well this is strange to relate
nobody ever stood a chance of getting in unless they were labour
you know i mean after the after the liberals had er lost the m main support er and the labour party came into UNK nobody w you know you it'd be almost impossible to put up in and
but one time one man put up and i don't know the reason why and i couldn't tell you the year but his name was er the honour somebody
and he came he became a prominent UNK perhaps in the thirties
but he got in this you know they moved w you know would
mm
he was a barrister
a barrister aye probably the greatest that's ever lived you know
was he a liberal mp in then
he was a liberal yes
i heard him a few times he was very entertaining very entertaining nice bloke really
ah
now going back to this strike erm
yes
presumably if all the finishing companies erm
supported us
had to come out on strike then er all the workers be on strike fund er did you and your father receive strike money
well no member of the staff came of strike that was the understanding you see
i mean they stayed in to you know see the work through the processes rather than it all get ruined because of course you know they weren't er they weren't great er individual UNK and er UNK companies
i mean the bosses hadn't got all that much really you know they weren't like they are today
i mean they got a lot better living what we got and they was alright but the you know you'd never call them UNK because they weren't UNK really
mm
er about this strike and er but time went on and it became obvious that er nobody were going to win only the boss like this boss course he was he was UNK through and so they called the strike off and every person who worked at er every firm had a meeting and they all decided to take so many and every firm took so many of the workers and so nobody was ever unemployed as a consequence of the strike which was very good
was this a management decision or a union decision
union decision
and the union had the meeting and the union went and told the boss that we're having so many more men here and that was it you see
mm
and that that's what operated
a very fine thing and you know until er until the day i left in nineteen forty two they always referred to these chaps in the forties like say i was er a as being er ooh he's a man
you know or f or you know always it was that they were men cos they came from during the strike
mm there's very
after the war well i know you did military service
aha
after you came back from military service did you carry on working art
yes oh aye
did you
yes
was it easy to get your job back
er ye yes and n no really
everybody coming from military service er was er got the job back there were no question about that at all you got your job back
but i'll have to tell you a bit of my history
nineteen er nineteen eighteen i joined the army compulsory you see
and i joined up on march the fourth nineteen eighteen
and er the war ended as you know in november eighteen and er when the war came to an end the government introduced a form of service whereas if er we youngsters volunteered say if you volunteered for two year they gave you twenty pound and two months leave you see if you volunteered for three year they gave you forty pound or was it thirty forty and er three months leave
and if you volunteered for five years i know you got fifty pound for that which was a hell of a lot of money a year's wage in some UNK eyes that was you know
and er so er i said to my friend like me UNK i said well look we haven't been in the army a year so we've got to be in two more years before it comes our turn our turn to be UNK so we just might as well sign up for a couple year get two months leave and twenty quid because we shall do that if we don't
so we did this you see
as a consequence of which well we went to egypt and the UNK this business we came back and er the b the UNK brother he ne he never liked me ever this UNK when i were a kid you know he never liked me at all i never got on with him and er mind you there's a long story about that but it's a silly little thing that er that i really upset him with
it'd be no interest to this but er
go on go on
you see we was working together and you know a few benches from each other and of course as i told you the lads worked with a man
and in the football post er cos everybody used to have the football post then not like now and so everybody knew what was in it and er there was like a who and why column in the football post and one of these was who will stop county now you see because they was at top of the second division or something like that and the team that was next to them was city in them days you see
and so er and somebody wrote back and said to them a yorkshire team with the same ambitions you see
well this bloke this UNK brother er his brother was the mayor of for several years the only one that's been during the war the first world war
and he said er well ha it isn't in yorkshire says well er it is he said it isn't it's in lincolnshire
and so we had a proper argument about this of course he was a grown up man i were only a kid you know
and er so one bloke brought a map the next day to prove as it was in he says he's right it's in yorkshire
and he never forgive me for this you see because he were a big noise you know he he'd got a big business in
and er so when i came back after the war he says er i object to him starting he's not come f direct from UNK he volunteered for the army
so you can't volunteer and then come back like that and well that was that
but of course he was the only one who thought this everybody else said ah how ridiculous have him back
so that was the end to it you see
mm
so
yeah and so had wages increased in
ooh aye was wages increased
you know i would think we'd be the first er industry to my knowledge to have a cost of living bonus
and as the cost of living UNK went up our wages went up
a but seeing that the official figures were published every month our wages went up or down every month
and or remained stationary but they mostly went up a copper or so every and this was er a real UNK in the side of the employers you know they wanted to get rid of this and they couldn't
and er when i left about seventy two they were still every year they come to try and get rid of this cost of living but we did er concede that we'd only move annually
and so the wages went up and down annually like as distinct from monthly which was a bit of a job for the employers to adjust every month
when so when was this introduced
when was the cost of living UNK
oh UNK i during the first world war
was this did this occur for the whole hosiery industry not just
oh yes
the finishing
oh finishing
finishing er finishing only
finishing only
finishing only and er then after a few years the manufacturing side of the industry adopted the cost of living different from ours but they adopted a cost of living bonus in a degree rather different from our
how were the employers persuaded to introduce this through threatened
well
action or negotiation
well they never threatened any action on the manufacturing side they you know the manufacturing side didn't
mm
but anyway seeing that we got it and all this business and er eventually they got it but they didn't get it in nowhere near a as good as ours and you know
well how did the UNK get it
oh well they got it during the war
when things were pretty easy
i should think at that time the employers thought well we don't want to be arguing about wages every five minutes during this war business you know and they all got b you know they got bags of work you know that of course don't you
no end of work during wartime no end of work
yeah was this when utility clothing was that
pardon
was there utility clothing during the first world war
no
no there weren't second world war yeah but not first world war
er
so was a lot was a lot of lot of stuff made for the army then
oh yeah lots of stuff made for the army and they didn't know i mean the manufacturers s sent the work to the hosiery UNK yards they didn't know what they were sending or what they got they just UNK it all out and that was it you know it were i could a lot of things about that
what were the what were the main major products at the time
was it mainly just socks and stockings
well ours was UNK ours was UNK
ours was UNK
what about other local companies
well er the majority was UNK er but there was shirts and UNK and as a matter of fact there was one small section of gloves made gloves
and there was a lot of fabric quite a lot of UNK fabric you know
you know to be made up into UNK and garments
and would a all these companies be included under one finishing union
er all those that finished was in the finishing union yeah
how come how did you get to be involved in the union after the war
oh well i b it were we all had to be in the union anyway and so we used to er we used to go to the meetings a you know as youngsters and then when we came back from the army we'd got to the union meeting as well
and er when it come to the election of a shop steward about in ni nineteen er i think it were nineteen twenty seven it were nineteen twenty seven er i there were two hundred in our shop and i got elected shop steward mainly i think because a lot more most didn't want to be bothered you know but anyway i and so that's what i retained
and it was were you shop steward for the whole factory or just part of the factory
oh no only nobody was shop steward for the factory
but he person who was shop steward for the finishing department more or less assumed responsibility for the other shop stewards because the other shop stewards would perhaps only have fifteen or twenty you know members er under them
so what areas would
i'd got two hundred see
what other areas would there would be involved in then
well th the UNK would have one shop steward like for UNK and UNK you know there's perhaps only be fifty altogether
and we'd got two hundred and then the UNK they were in their own union er at er at that time they'd perhaps got er thirty in the UNK house
and we i tell you we'd got a couple of hundred in ours
so this you becoming a UNK shop steward was after the general strike
how were you involved in
yes just after the general strike
were you involved in the general strike itself much
er aye but not er not UNK you know not through the union
er because of by this time i'd er joined the independent labour party and er we used to run news sheets off you see
i'd been to work all day and i'd been and been running sheets off all night
and then gone back to work next morning
so the hosiery industry didn't come out
no
during the strike
no
and er and although it nobody could ever say that the union was politically motivated er it it's strange to relate that at union meeting when the general strike started and we of course we weren't in the t u c we were too small anyway although i know that there's been unions with twenty eight members in the t u c now
and er anyway we eventually er ah but er the questions used to asked at every meeting when are we going to come out and er so much so that er they made the secretary who was a j p and a tory write to the t u c and er say that we prepared to come out when ever they ask us
and they sent back and now this is what they said to us in this letter i remember this UNK that er if we want you to come out we'll tell you but we regard your factories as our second line of defence
that's what the t u c said
course they were worried because they they'd bit off more than they could UNK same as you say about this like you see
s so how was the UNK do you remember how the strike was organized in
was it organized
oh organized yes through the through the trades council no doubt about it trades council organized it
as i've probably told you before the they used they used to meet and meet daily trades council
and er they used to determine what came through they used to really you know what came over the bridge all UNK and er they'd want to know what was in the van and everything and if the er trades council said no it's not coming it didn't come
was there much trouble over UNK firms in
well the not re not really the chief er the chief trouble er arose from the bus people you know that
they was t that tried to be the strike UNK and there was several of their buses turned over you've probably read that have you in the
mhm yes
in the news sheets
heard about that
oh aye
particularly on the road from to
what was the role of the police during the strike
oh well the role of the police well of course they were opposed to the strikers but there weren't er quite so many police you see and the strike movement was strong and so the they didn't have a great deal of affect
i mean wh where they anybody was arrested they mainly got off you know
right
can you tell me when and where you were born mr
yes number seven road
and erm were your parents from
yes both of them
so they've lived here
well not locally more
my mother was born in and my father was born in abbey in the grounds of abbey in the stables
he was
his father his my grandfather was a groom and er they lived in the erm in the abbey grounds in the UNK of the stables
there were some cottages there
in fact he was my father was UNK in the abbey
which is rather unusual
and what was your what was your father's occupation
my father at first i think in his very early days er was a sort of a farm hand
and then he became erm he worked at the at the colliery as a er an UNK a UNK you see
oh a UNK
and erm looked after all the ponies
and as i recall as a child there were well over a hundred ponies down pit at that time because during the nineteen twenty one strike they brought them all up to the surface and put them in the fields and i used to go with my father to sort of look after them
oh and then this was this was in
the twenty one strike and the twenty six strike
they brought them up both times onto the surface
so you used to go with your father then
that's right into the fields they had er the colliery had a er farm adjacent to the er to the colliery
farm it was called it was rather a big farm as well and these ponies were put into the green fields that sort of on the farm
but this was just during the strike
that's right oh yes they were never brought up otherwise never saw daylight otherwise
and er what did your mother do
well my mother was just a housewife as i recall
erm well as a housewife erm hm we were poor people
the house that we lived in was a two up and a two down sort of thing you know and er i know my mother used to take in washing go out black leading
what
well black leading was a sort of erm going out cleaning the old UNK for people that were slightly better off than we were their husbands might have been a tram driver or a railway driver
they had a little bit higher standard of living
i see
and they could afford to pay the shilling or one and sixpence to have their UNK done
and my mother used to have to go out to supplement our income you see
because er in those days
well we were poor we were poor
no arguing about it
erm and when i say we were poor there were people even poorer than we were much poorer
erm my father was a er a gardener sort of as a erm hobby and he had UNK and erm we lived very well UNK you know on what he really produced
this was in the early days of when we was in road we did move from there eventually
i'll tell you about that later
yes
erm
so you he grew his own vegetables
vegetables that's right yes
and he used to erm things you don't see in UNK today he used to build the UNK for the pits for storing winter potatoes and turnips and that sort of thing in the garden
what were they
well they used to make a pile of these things and put straw on top of them and then soil on top of them to keep the frost out
oh i see
and ev every time you want any potatoes you go and open the clamp or the pit or whatever it was called and take some out and seal it up again and that's how we used to store them
and they would keep for all the time
oh yes a UNK through all through all through the winter
the straw and they used to have a like a little erm out at the top of the straw to let the heat out
it was it was a work of art to make one you know it wasn't easy
and where was the UNK
erm road
near the UNK there was an old UNK it's the road that runs through from church there were no houses there then it's all built on now and there was a UNK like a lane used to come from church to UNK
i believe today it's called road
i'm not sure about that
but it was a little lane and there were all these UNK that were on this erm this little lane and i'm not sure i think my father had two
of these UNK er i don't know how many square yards each one would be but that was his sort of spare time sort of work occupation
and what sort of when did he have ti when did he go to the UNK can you remember
well i this is something that's always UNK me because he worked seven days a week down the mine feeding horses you see had to be fed and UNK seven days a week
and erm he worked shifts er the morning shift or the day shift as it was called which was from erm i don't know as far as i could tell it was from six till two or something like that
and the afternoon shift was two till ten
and the erm night shift was till ten till six or ten till seven whatever it might be
but he used to fit in between
that in my view is er what i call a being a UNK for work
but er as i say there were people really worse off than we were but we weren't all that well off and my mother as i say took in washing and did black leading and all that sort of thing for very small remuneration
erm
how many other er other children
there was just one sister just one sister
i have one she's still alive as well
i have one sister and erm
is she younger or older
younger than me yes just slightly younger than me two or three years i don't know exactly but i should say she's two or three years younger than me
well i know she is
but erm eventually we moved from there and my father er we moved into a company house in village
when i say a company house i mean a house that was owned by the colliery newly built with a bathroom
oh and when how old were you when you moved in there
erm as near as i can tell you i could be about er fourteen
about fourteen
yes
i'd say i'd be about UNK i should be about fourteen
just as i was sort of starting work
yes
can i take you back
yes dear
to before then in
yeah
in the other house as a child
mhm
erm what do you rem you know you mentioned the UNK what
yes
else do you remember about
ooh
the area can you describe what
the area itself
yes what
erm well the house itself as i say was two up and two down it was gas lit
there was no electricity in the house and i can very well remember the gas lighting
there wasn't even a UNK it as a wall bracket that came out of the wall with a little tiny gas UNK that UNK out UNK of thing and that was your UNK for the bedroom
the er the two rooms downstairs and a like a UNK affair at the back erm they were lit by a central gas with a UNK gas UNK you know
which you used to light with a UNK or something like that and they had little chains on to adjust your light
oh which can light to UNK and
that's right yes
well it was always UNK always UNK even the bright light was UNK you know what i mean there was there was very little UNK really when you consider what we have today
erm the UNK now that was just cold water out of an UNK er all the UNK in those days were brown
they were all there were no white UNK as such they were all brown
and then there was a there was a coal fired copper int he corner and er this was for washing for boiling your clothes
oh can you describe that
yes erm now monday morning was invariably UNK
and er your parents or your mother or your father would get up very early that morning to light the copper so that the water would be hot to start boiling it would probably take it could take a couple of hours to sort of re really heat a copper full of hot water
and erm the clothes would be put in there and er they would be boiled
so it was like a large tub
you can imagine all the steam
that's right it was like a huge i say huge i don't know how many gallons it would hold it was a fair copper
and er the fire was underneath this you see in a little UNK and you used to open the door and stoke it up and er more often than not it was fired by UNK which was a residue of the coal out of the coal house you know when you broke your coal up with the lumps the little UNK bits of UNK they were all put on one side for the copper fire
and er when that was done the washing the UNK was always in the yard in the UNK the old UNK with the wooden rollers and it was quite an effort to turn and we children very often ha to give a turn
was erm always kept in the yard there was no room for it in a small UNK and there were big old wooden rollers
and as i say you used to have to erm children used to hav well the elder children had to give a turn with the UNK
your mother fed the clothes into the rollers and you had to turn the old UNK
and this used to squeeze out the
that's right that was that was water you see
erm used to have a also have a wooden tub and a UNK
what was a UNK
well a UNK er it's sort of made of wood and got a got a handle UNK which you held in one half of it in each hand it had a stem and on the on the UNK itself was a sort of er piece of wood that had been er cut out to have about four i think it was four legs on this you see and you used to stand over the UNK and
oh and
UNK it you see
and so and s like scrub well scrub
well it was it was that's right it was getting the dirt out of the clothes you see
and then of course there was a erm also the UNK board which was a UNK board which you used to rub the clothes on like that
that was wash day
erm
and these were kept a in the yard you had
that's right all those were in the yard that's right yes
along with the UNK the UNK u hung on the on the on the toilet wall nine times out of ten
it was a big UNK er sort of affair you know
that you hung onto this wall and that was brought in once a week for bathing in front of the fire
on the
so that would in the in the lounge would this be
lounge we didn't call it lounge then dear
it was the back room
lounge wasn't a word that was heard
it was drawing room for people that had them
oh i see
very seldom you heard the word lounge
oh no it was a that would be a UNK if ever there was one because there was room for a table and four chairs and perhaps a UNK and that was it
i mean a room half this size and this is not a big room
oh no they were quite small and then there was the parlour
and that was invariably reserved for sort of erm weddings births and funerals and perhaps on a at christmas you'd go in there
otherwise it would never be used
UNK enough you had a room there a nice room the front of the house er lots of people who were fortunate had an old piano on there and they'd have the usual weekend UNK where you very solemn music for front parlour
er i mean this would be considered to be a front parlour and you live in the back room
and it's the same size as the back room
yes that's right it might have even been a little bit bigger than the back room but very seldom used
and they very seldom had a fire in it at all
and as a child did you know that you didn't use this room to
oh yes never used it we never used it
yeah you say you could go probably weeks and never go into it
there's a door like that to come into to have a little er there wasn't a passage because the front door was straight onto the street in this room
the parlour door went straight onto the street because it was a terrace you see and you go into the into the front room here and you have another door into the next room and another door into the UNK at the back
and then there was a yard and then there was a garden
and what sort of size you had the garden
oh yes only a small garden there was small terraced gardens you couldn't er UNK them to any great degree for growing or anything like that
flower gardens they used to use them for some people would probably grow small things like UNK and UNK and things of that nature
but erm all the houses were the same
all the houses were the same sort of erm one two three four there was perhaps four or five to a block
and then there was four or five again and four or five again over the street like that
but it was erm it was a happy time for in many respects you know
and although as i say people were very poor they seem to be very happy some of them
erm i remember all of them i know all their names i can remember all the names of these different people
and er one old lady that only recently died about three years ago at about ninety seven and she was there when i was a child
er she'd just recently died an old lady named mrs lived at the first house
used to get a sort of entry you know round the top and there was these four or five i think five four or five cottages
little houses that er were there
and quite big families were brought up in some of these houses with only two bedrooms
it's amazing really i don't know how they used to and there were only two of us
we had to share a room
but when you've got four or five or six children in a house you know with two bedrooms
however you said there were quite a few families with twelve
ooh yes
i had erm two of my mother's no my mother's they were both brothers my mother's brothers had eleven children each
and they lived in smaller houses than we'd got
however
and the
they survived i don't know
erm my mother we were a little bit better off than they were and er i remember going to a child with my mother to see what would be my aunt you see and uncle and the only time i ever remember seeing my aunt with eleven children was sitting at the corner of a table with a sort of a UNK apron on and just sitting there and i never saw her doing anything
i supposed she was too UNK to even
yes
walk about
and were the children all in the house
yeah well they'd be in and out the yard and everywhere i'd wherever they used to be i don't know
but they always used to say there was two football there was a two football teams between the two families
that's how they used to count them up
yes
yes and some of them are still alive today
yes
and they lived in er in street which are all gone now
wh how far was that quite near
that's no it was quite near
in fact it was a s that was the erm street that the school where i attended there was a school in this erm in street
it was called the street school
later it was called the school
that's where i had my UNK education
and how was
and that was next door to the UNK
can you believe in building a school or a UNK next door to a which ever came first i don't know but the there's the school was there the UNK was there
and don't know if you've ever UNK a UNK in full production have you
no
well it's horrible
to say the least it's horrible and yet there we were a school and a UNK side by side
and how far away from your home was this
erm oh i should be a good mile a good mile and that's another little story there
that you never hear or see today
we used to have to pass on the way to school we used to pa pass a UNK in road
and erm my mother used to UNK and we used to take the clothes basket with the tins of dough ready prepared by your mother and we used to take them to the UNK at lunchtime when we were coming back from our from our meal the midday meal from home leave them at the UNK and so the baker had finished his morning's baking with his oven of his own bread you see
and he used to put them into the oven while it was still hot to UNK for him used to pick them up on our way home from school
oh was this quite a usual thing for
ooh usual that were yes oh lots of people did that
you paid your mother paid
you paid a small fee you see or a small charge to have this and the your mother used to put the dough in the tin and er a little s bit of paper with the name on it you see with a name on it and that used to go in to the oven
and then we'd pick it up on our way home from school
and how often was this
perhaps once a week twice a week twice a week sometimes
how many UNK would
and i oh i can't remember any anyway we used to take the clothes basket
children used to take the clothes basket
whe and you know put into the clothes basket and then pick it up on our way home from school
on our way home from school we should be UNK all the UNK the nice UNK to eat
yes it's er i think i'm not sure if the UNK is still there but erm it was a man named
i remember him very well
and in the winter time we used to love to UNK in the UNK coming home cos it was so warm
so warm you see
what er can you remember any other shops in that area
oh yes i can
the butcher on the corner of street the little tiny UNK where you used to go and fe your mother used to go and fetch her UNK and if she spent three shillings in the shop she was a good customer
erm there was also a fish and chip shop er that was as well on the corner that was there years and years and years
erm and then there was a miss kept another little tiny grocer shop there
oh i know all the shops
but the butchers shop was er a very well known shop and er i remember very well we used to go into there er of course when things were re were really poor you'd go into the butchers shop in the middle of the week perhaps about thursday and erm they used to sell they used to cook their own UNK then of course you know pressed beef and all that sort of thing and i remember this beautiful big white erm well it'd be a UNK dish affair on a stand used to have a big piece of this pressed beef in it cutting it off and all the little bits used to fall round the side well them come thursday when only got a shilling in your pocket or your parents had got a couple of shillings left you got to fetch two UNK of the bits of the pressed beef that had fallen round the pan and that was a meal
how would your mother serve that up with
well i don't know i don't know how she'd i suppose we should have it on bread and butter or something like that you see or with bread
i mean and lets face it you came home from school er i think we used to come home about half past four from school summertime and the first thing you come into the house and you get a great big thick slice of home made bread and jam which your mother had also made also made
and that was put into your hand and you were sent out to play
we were playing marbles at you know and at and at this time of year or whip and top and that sort of thing
and then you'd come back later and have a sort of tea but it would still be bread and jam you know what i mean
er as you got older of course you got different meals but as youngsters we ate a terrific amount of bread and jam
what sort of jam
well there was all sorts whatever was on the go there was UNK jam that my mo we used to later years my father grew UNK and that sort of thing UNK jam my mother made all sorts of things like that
she was a good provider my mother was
and erm in her particular way she was quite a good cook too
they had to be they had to be
they had to make things
yes
and going back to the taking of the bread to the erm er UNK erm if there was a fire going they didn't do that because they were baked in the oven but in the summertime we did it more often than in the winter because if there was no fire you see there was no gas cooker or anything like that all the cooking was done on the coal fire and the oven at the side of it
and the hot water system was a little boiler at the side of the fire as well and you used to have a UNK and take it out of the out of the er out of the boiler on the side
that's another thing you see that today you had a tin UNK and it ever the UNK sort of UNK or developed a hole in ti you didn't UNK it and throw it away you used to go and buy what was called a which was two little tin UNK with a little bit of i can't remember if it was f a fabric or rubber two pieces and you put one on one side and one the other and then a little screw and bolt went through UNK and bolt went through it and tightened it up and that stopped your UNK and that UNK then lasted a lot more a lot longer time
and they sold
now today it would have been thrown away wouldn't it
they sold these UNK shelf
oh yes i can see them on now cards they used to sell them on cards
you know like erm they were they were fixed onto a card with something like UNK or something like that
and they cost a penny of three UNK one of these they were called
and it was like a tin UNK which i can remember ever so well the tin UNK
you didn't you didn't have a kettle then it was
oh you had a kettle oh you had a kettle as well yes you had a kettle which you used to maybe boil on the fire
er if you were er some people had a gas ring you know not a cooker a gas ring those sort of ring that you can boil a kettle on or you could have a UNK
i can remember very well having the first cooker we had gas cooker we had
that was an innovation
was that in this house in
that was in yes that was in we had a gas cooker put in there
and er i can er no electricity hadn't been put in that house because the one we moved into at that had got electricity in it then
er but no gas
cooker was all electric th they'd got no gas mains up into the into the old village in those days you see
so we were all electric there but erm this house at it was erm it was a great time really that we i mean the kids were happy together
they played i mean all sorts of games that we played they don't play today
yes what can you tell me about some of those
oh course i can erm there was a game that we called er tin UNK you probably won't well you never hear that expression now and er we used to get this old t any tin can and er you somebody would kick it you see and er the one that was sort of one used to have to fur and fetch this tin an bring it back again and then was should all hide sounds a daft silly game i know but this one had to find us and the first one he found it was his turn next to fetch the tin and then find us again
you played that for hours
where would you play this
well that we had a favourite place for that was at the corner of road and road by the chapel the chapel and because it was on a hill slope on to
there were no houses it was all fields beyond there
and erm we used to kick this tin down the hill and er as i say it would roll down and we would all go and hide anywhere back garden front garden over a wall round a corner anywhere like that you see
as i say the first one that was found had to it was his turn to be on next
and then there was another game we used to play was called peggy
and er the er we used to have a piece of wood a small piece of wood that was shaped er like a sort of almost like UNK at both ends
and you used to er stand this on a house brick like it might be on there and you had another long stick and you use to hit it on one end and as it flew in the air you see it used to fly up then you used to have to hit it as far as you
oh i see
could
again you used to drop it and whoever was what we called on had to fetch this UNK back again put it onto there and then come and find us again
that was a sort of similar game to the tin UNK
and you used to where did you get these
we used to make them ourselves
oh yes
you used to make
we used to make them ourselves
if you held a got hold of a an old sort of UNK shaft that was the ideal thing for the stick to hit the UNK with you see
fly in the air and hit it and away it goes if you missed it you missed your turn
erm another one we used to erm do of course that was a bit more UNK as we got older what was called er spirit UNK
er you won't know anything about this
what happened you used to have a pin and a button and a UNK of cotton
can you see what's coming
no
didn't think you could anyway you tie a piece of cotton onto the pin with a button on the end of it
and you'd stick that into the UNK window of a house
okay put it into it and you'd tie your length of cotton or black thread onto the piece of cotton with a button that's UNK down and you'd go across the road into somebody's front garden behind a wall or behind a hedge and just keep pulling the cotton to tap on the window
this is true you know
and out would come the people to the door course they couldn't see anything or anybody back they'd go and then you'd do it again
this was t i mean when you think about it er it was good fun and er eventually people realized what was happening and of course they knew what was happening but that went on for a long time
they called that spirit UNK
if there was some old people here now they'd confirm all that i'm telling you now
did you get up to any other UNK
oh yes lots of them lots of them
there was another one that i consider today was very highly dangerous
we used to get erm at the chapel meetings we used to get erm paper newspaper and put up a s UNK a UNK you know a UNK and put a match to it
and it used to UNK you can imagine what the noise was like in the chapel
this is true
and they say they're all bad lads today don't they
but this used to happen this used to happen
aye we've done all sorts of things there was er i used to go to chapel as well i we were we were UNK to go to chapel
three times a day well twice a day as we were young as we get older it was three times it means we have to go to evening chapel as well
this was er your parents
that's right we used to go to road methodist and erm we got up to all sorts of UNK there you know
and er but we were we were we were good boys at heart
we never hurt anyone i think it was just sheer UNK more than anything else you know
we used to UNK the poor old superintendent UNK at the er sunday school
all sorts of ways
but er i could er i could go on for a long time on that subject but time's short dear
this is
time's very short you know
the UNK they used to be every easter time an anniversary for which the boys invariably got a new little suit and the girls had a new UNK
that was your annual affair and the er the er the chapel itself was at the end of it used to put up a UNK platform if you can imagine it you know at the end of the little chapel and the erm the younger children was on the bottom and as you got older you graduated to the top and er i don't know why it was though but er i always had to say the collection piece
what was that can you describe it
yes well at the end of the er service or anniversary whatever i don't know if it was called a service or not
erm there was an appeal for the for the collection plate that was going round
and we the used to pick on a on some sort of a nice looking little boy or little girl to say the collection piece that was appealing and i can't remember what it was now but er probably about four verses of what they called a collection piece just before they started to collect you see and erm i think i said that three or four years erm running almost so i must been pretty well good at it
but erm it was
enjoyable
erm the er choir master there was a er mr and he was a wonderful man
he was what we called a school board man as well he was that was his official capacity and in those days if you weren't at school they used to erm send a man round to see where you were you know and why weren't you at school
and they called in the school board man because lots of schools in those days were run by boards or erm governors i suppose they'd call them today
and er he was the choir master erm and he and he used to put us onto we used to have various plays you know erm maybe two a year or something like that
this was through the sunday school
that's right through the sunday school yes
and erm i remember re one play very well
and in fact i've got a photograph of all the somewhere about the house
and erm one of the girls that was on there became a very famous UNK in the country erm UNK you've probably not heard of her she's sort of a bit before your time but er she always used to sing land of hope and glory on the last night of the UNK a few years ago
and erm that was the spirit that was in those days you see erm they said i've got nothing to do
we'd go to choir practice perhaps one night a week er band of hope another one
now you're going to say what's band of hope aren't you
that was a sort of UNK league you know erm where they used to erm er sort of er tell you about all the UNK of strong drink
and it was like the old similar to the old UNK that were
erm it was called the band of hope
and signature tune if that's what you like to call it was dare to be a daniel dare to pass a public house and dare to make it known
i can't tell you any more than that but that was the they had this tune that went with it
and these ladies used to tell us all about his and try and bring us up into a clean way of life which wasn't bad wasn't bad at all
did it what did you think about did you mind going to sunday school
well i didn't mind till i got a bit older then i sort of started to kick and er as i got older that's another story
but erm er we used to have to go sunday morning
and in the afternoon to sunday school
as i say we got older we used to go on sun at sunday evenings as well
but when i look back when i think about it probably ke kept us out of UNK you know
cos what would we have done if we hadn't had done that
there was no such thing as radio television
and of course all your other friends of the same
same yes
the UNK used to be full the UNK used to be full
and if we weren't if we hadn't hav been i mean that's probably one of the problems of today i don't know
you see there's too much spare time on their hands
we didn't seem to have any spare time
there was different th different things that we used to used to do i mean erm that was sunday taken care of
it was a sort of a as you grew older mind you it was i it could have been a little bit of a miserable sort of day
because erm even when radio came er there was only sort of chamber music on the radio you know
and i think the stations used to close down at night like on sunday evening
and er we thought the heavens opened when la radio UNK came on at er sunday even all day sunday when we could tune to the sort of dance music and the singing and all that sort of thing
but on b c which was the only station operating at that er time erm er sunday was a UNK day
if you weren't a church guy
but we used to en i used to enjoy going to it as i say until i got older and i wanted to sort of stretch my wings a little bit and i did other things
but as a child it er to me i thou i think it was er very good
it's a pity really that er it hasn't been kept up
i think for them today
how's the and what sort of time would you spend how long would you spend at sunday school
well you'd go to er i should say in the morning service that was a service you used to have
did you go with friends then
you'd go at eleven o'clock
my parents used to go occasionally not all the time er eleven o'clock probably till twelve
and in the afternoon i think er it was about a quarter to three till four and that was er sunday school
and we were taught sort of er religious knowledge and all this sort of thing you know
and in the evening that was a service again probably from six till seven
but you see er you know you'd got to do that so in between those times you couldn't do much else could you
apart from getting ready to go and then coming home again you see and your meals and that sort of thing
it was sunday pretty well taken care of
but erm during the week time in the week you used to enjoy yourself in many ways
i remember saturday as a boy i er i used to run UNK for people for pennies like many more did
you used to do what with that
run UNK
run UNK
UNK for pennies yes
that would be what would the UNK be
what can you
oh going to grocer the UNK and even UNK a quarter of tea for an old lady you see
er you did a lot of it voluntary but the better off person perhaps would give you a penny
no more and i don't mean a new one i mean the old one you know
and erm you were very or even a ha'penny for that matter and you was glad of a ha'penny
and when you think of what you could but a penny bar of chocolate and get a decent size bar of chocolate for a penny
you could buy a UNK of sweets
so you used to spend your money on sweets
think that right anything like that you see yes
and erm i used to help a ma and there's another funny one
there used to be a man used to come with a horse and UNK selling UNK and his name was t
his shop was on the top end of road when it was road
and he used to come to with his black horse and UNK and i used to go to help him on a er on a saturday morning used to get to about perhaps nine or half past and i'd go the rounds with him and all i used to do was to er take the peoples things that they'd bought up the entry you see because they were all entries then
and erm when i'd finished with him i'd perhaps get a two or three UNK apples or a UNK or something like you see
but the highlight of it was that i used to get a ride on the UNK and i used he we used to finish up the round at the bottom of erm road and street
and then i used to get on to the UNK and sit beside him on the box and then we'd go as far as road which is quite a stretch and i used o walk back
but i had the pleasure of riding on that UNK all that way
that was a boy of course little boy i wouldn't be probably eight or nine years old
used to enjoy it
that used to take card of many saturday mornings
another thing we used to do regularly as well we boys er there was a erm a UNK merchant in erm er road well i say merchant it ti it was his house and he had a garage at the side of it and he used to sell UNK
and the UNK used to come to the erm station at er in UNK baskets in sacks little tiny sacks used to be little UNK bags sort of thing pressed into it UNK you know what UNK is you've seen UNK haven't you
and er we used to make about six trips with a two UNK trolley from station to his house two UNK do this job because it was very heavy work you know
and we'd perhaps make about six trips and i think we used to get sixpence each for that
not every saturday morning but we used to do this job
he used to call on two of two boys but there was a boy named i remember him very well and i used to do it regularly for this sixpence
and er it could take all saturday morning to do it you know
er but we enjoyed it again it was sixpence and it was a morning you'd been doing something and that was it
how did you
er
find out about these little jobs
oh you were you were asked somebody i don't know how it came about but erm if you found there was something going you went to do it
i remember another thing i used to do erm estate before that was built erm there were all f open fields
it was like a sort of common land
and it was called the UNK field
and road wasn't built on that was a an a path like a rough cart road and er saturday afternoons in the summertime there was a coal merchant had two horses a man named er he lived in street
he UNK the horses near those UNK where i've just told you about UNK father had UNK
and i used to go and take these two horses and stay with them on a saturday afternoon UNK on this UNK field all saturday afternoon
i think we used to get threepence for that saturday UNK work for UNK these horses
but i was so small i can remember very well going down this what we called the middle pad this UNK it wasn't road i think it was called middle pad
it used to lead to station and er i've seen these two when i've been walking around i've seen them take their head up and lift me off the ground
i was so small you see
yeah
but UNK we'd stay with them all saturday afternoon
one UNK do it one week and another UNK do it another week you know
and er we'd get the UNK sum of threepence of doing that
erm i graduated from that to taking newspapers which a lot of us did
w would you when would you do this
twelve you weren't allowed to do it until you were twelve
twelve to fourteen you did that and i took papers out for a UNK called on erm
i had two rounds in the morning and a round in the evening
and the two rounds in the morning you did the bottom half of for the first round and you went back to the shop and you got another bag full of papers and you did the top half of if you know it
and erm like such streets as street road street er road street all those streets you did
that was the top half that was the upper UNK th they were funny
the so called better off people lived at the top half and the poorer type of people or the poorer class of property was on the bottom half UNK enough and er
what sort er you were saying
sort of UNK
better off people what sort of jobs
well sort of well you see er when i say that i mean erm er insurance men UNK and UNK was a very good job in those days you see
UNK was looked up to in those days he was an educated man
a really educated man if you if anyone had any forms to fill in er it was the UNK you invariably went to because he was considered to be he could read and write you see
er and lots of people couldn't
er bank clerks this was the top half er shop keepers erm and sort of the further you went to they the better the people came because they were top half i mean i remember tom williams the professional UNK he lived up there
er the bank manager lived at the top half
erm and various people like that you see and it seemed to sort of you went up the scale
yeah
funnily enough like that you see i don't know why dunno why but erm it was so
and you the other half i mean what sort of
well the lower class of course they were the UNK class and the out of works and the very low you see the people on probably a wage of two pounds a week and less
and when you think of a UNK earning a pound and thirty shillings a week you know
yes as a as a as a UNK or a erm what they what used to call them that worked on the line there was a special name for the li the people that read repaired the lines
they were very poorly paid on the railway
well look at a miner i mean if he worked three days a week he might only get thirty shillings in tho very seldom worked a full week
and you got to bring families up on this you know
why didn't they work you said they di very seldom
the work wasn't there the work wasn't there
so
if they didn't want the coal they didn't go to work
not like ti is now UNK it you know and here we are paying interest on a UNK million pounds worth of coal
oh no if the if the if the if the if the owners well they were privately owned then the mines were and if they didn't want to er get the coal out you didn't work
if they couldn't sell the coal
so this would affect your father then
on no my father was fortunate you see because he'd got to go to work because of the
because of the horses
he was very lucky
he had to go you see but i mean er later in my lifetime when we lived in the in the village at i can remember very well the er the miners there er going to work and then coming home again going to work and coming home again nothing for them to do
there was a special system they had of erm of giving out work
i forget what they call the men but the men used to sit in groups i can see them now UNK in groups
and this er oh dear what was the name of it they had a special title for the man that sort of ran the stall as they called it for getting the coal out and he chose who he wanted to go to work
you were you were new
but erm it was rough but it was er it was a good way of life in some respects you know
was there much can you remember much unemployment
oh yes oh yes a lot of it in the thirties tremendous amount of unemployment
in fact it was far worse than it is today you know
er they UNK about it today but when you think there was very little dole in those days very little dole
i mean i can remember the nineteen twenty i weren't sure whether it was the twenty one or the twenty six strike and my father was erm on strike you see but the ponies had to be thus cared for in the field an i don't think he received any pay and i remember very well erm going to the my father applying for relief and er we had to go and face the erm court of UNK
and i can remember as a child my mother had to go my sister myself and my father
and we were called into this long room at the erm it was at house at and er there was all these well i considered them to be old men they couldn't have been so old you see but i was only a boy
and my father was a applying for this relief
this can you just explain the relief was
well the relief was for money to live on you see
yes so this was through the
well it was it was charity you see
it was the local council money sort of thing government money
government yes
like it would be d h s today you see
and erm anyway they went into all your means and what you'd got and what you hadn't got i think my father had to sell his cycle
and then we were down to five shillings a week there was four of us you see five shillings a week relief
and erm the UNK was that you had to pay it back though
and as i recall on a saturday morning i used to have to take the er one and sixpence each saturday back to this house and they used to issue us a little receipt and i remember my father keeping all those receipts until it was paid off
and when you think of a man earning about at the most two pounds ten shillings a week one and sixpence was quite a UNK amount out of it but eventually he paid it all off
erm and during that strike erm we were fed in a soup kitchen
and i presume you know what a soup kitchen was like
no could you explain
yes erm well it was the back UNK of a er a local person's house now these people er it was a mr and a mrs
that er lived in this house and they were the real grass roots of the old labour party the real UNK not like the ones that we know today that only pay lip service to it
they were the workers and er they sort of opened their kitchen up or the back UNK they went round to the local butcher UNK and begging meat to the UNK for peas UNK you name it all went into this big huge copper which i've previously described to you as a washing copper and they boiled all this soup up and we kids used to take the a jug and er we had to find the biggest jug we could in the house that we could get well the biggest jug we ever had was the wash hand stand that was in the bedroom that's the wash hand stand jug
you probably don't remember it but there used to be a bowl and a big jug for washing you in the bedroom
you used to fill it with hot or cold water and use the bowl
well we used to take this wash hand stand jug fro the soup and er they'd fill er this with UNK soup and er a UNK of bread
they didn't use to cut it in UNK they used to break you a piece off a big loaf
and er the reason we took the biggest jug we could find it wasn't so much to feed two children in the house you're parents also wanted a bowl because believe me in those times we were we were hungry we were dear very hungry
but er we survived it and erm er another my father was a was a born UNK and er during his time he used to go and do a bit of er UNK
and i remember very well he had a big heavy coat and my mother put him in a very big pocket on the inside of the coat and we always called that his rabbit pocket because he very often came home with a rabbit
also as very rare UNK at times we used to get the odd UNK and the odd UNK
and of course during the strike period er this is one of the things he used to supplement our meals with you see
where would he go to
well he'd go er we lived at this t time in road well you went up the top of road and then you were across and on into UNK
now beyond UNK there were all fields there were the two railways the old great central railway on one side of UNK and the old great northern railway on the other side of the forest
well my father when we lived there he worked at the colliery and he used to walk home and during he s before he m before the strike we used to have these pheasants and things and rabbits which he used to catch because early morning he seemed to know exactly where to go to get a UNK that was UNK in a tree you see or a bush
the rabbits he used to put a UNK down for and erm if we were lucky we got one
but during the er strike he used to go out UNK to get them and he used to go onto these fields
he would probably have got shop by the local farmers if he'd been caught but er he used to go on these local fields and er and er UNK rabbits you see or get a rabbit
and that used to supplement our meals
and he wasn't the only one that was doing this you know my father wasn't an individual just on h his own there were other men did this sort of thing
and er that's how we survived the strike as we did
er we got through it erm and when you think there was no money from anywhere but that five shillings a week that we got from the from the er i think it was called the board of UNK i'm not sure and er we survived
erm i did know at that particular time know what it was to have holes in my shoes and a piece of cardboard put into it to protect your foot from the hole
like a thousands more and another thing we knew we very often my wife and i were talking about it only the other day there was an old saying that er UNK out of prison
i don't suppose you now what that means at all do you
no what does that mean
well that's when you've got a hole on your trousers and your shirt was UNK through
oh
and you was you was told that UNK white was out of prison
this is true dear
b my wife and i was only discussing it er day before yesterday i think it was we were talking about it because we were talking about this sort of thing
would your mother did your mother make clothes for the family
no i she had a machine we had a sewing machine i could tell you a story about that but i won't
er she had a sewing machine she used to make er sort of shirts but not suits and things like that she didn't she repaired them
you'd have a patch you see and your trousers would be UNK and er i had no brothers to sort of hand me downs so of course mine we went had to be worn out and erm you're normal UNK in those days was a er a pair of trousers and a jersey you didn't have a suit as such
er when you did get a suit it had to be kept for sunday for going to chapel you see and if you were going to have a new suit it would always be at anniversary time you didn't get one every anniversary
this was easter time this what you call an anniversary
easter time that's right round about now
yes
round about now
and erm that's when you er when you had your a new rig out as they called it in those days they called it a rig out new rig out in those days
might get a pair of shoes and a two piece coat and trousers you see but invariably your school UNK was a jersey and er a pair of trousers
and er never shoes they were always boots didn't have sort of half shoes it was always a pair of boots that you had
and er stockings and er
you ha you wore stockings then
wore stockings that's right yes you wore stockings
erm and i as far as i can remember i think such things as UNK were unknown
you know a pair of UNK and UNK
you'd wear er you might have a little UNK in the wintertime but erm i think they was virtually unknown
and when i think back you know when i think about it and in the lower class of family even UNK were unknown
a lad that wore UNK was considered to be a bit of a UNK type of a lad you see
you'd go to you'd go to bed in a well if you were lucky you had a UNK or even in your own shirt that you was as a young man you would
mm
you know how that change has taken place and i as i say we were we were compared to some we were well off we'd got a tap in the house so many people hadn't even got a tap they were in the yard and that tap was shared by a dozen families
that's that up to recent times was happening in
and in this the street where you lived did most people have UNK
oh they had a tap in the house everybody had a tap in the house and they had their own toilets
toilet
and the and the toilet the toilet was adjacent to the was built on to the house
but a lot of them at the bottom of the garden
you used to have to go right down the garden
but ours was we had the house the s the UNK if i can describe it and then there was the coal house and then there was a toilet
as i've said to you the old UNK used to hang on the toilet wall outside was a whole row of them you know these big UNK bath things that were brought in on maybe on a friday night
and the youngest was UNK first to the eldest and as the young one was UNK bed upstairs to bed upstairs to bed you see and so it went on
can you imagine it
not much
oh dear
but erm i erm i recall as well the shops that we were talking about
i'm not sure the UNK shop erm now er they did credit trading in those days and most people took the credit
you used to have a little book and er the grocer would write it down what you'd had in the book you see and then you had to pay for it on th at the weekend
and if you didn't pay for it at the weekend you got no UNK next week
mm
and erm that's how it used to be so o obviously you had to pay like that but er i can remember the UNK coming to
it was called i can't remember it opening but i can remember the UNK association not the it was the
and that was on the corner of er road and street at
and they had a shop on vale as well and a shop in erm on big s store on road at but that was the UNK independent UNK you see like they all were in those days the UNK the UNK and so on had a UNK had a UNK had a UNK at er they've all had three shops
and this was a wonderful old grocery shop er plain wooden floors you know no tiles or anything like that just the wood floors and i can see the barrels of apples and the barrels of this and then the oranges and the all the UNK and the bags of flour and the bags of sugar and the and the grocer weighing the sugar up and all this sort of thing
and the tea in tea UNK loose tea in tea UNK and you used to weigh it up by the quarter
so everything used to be weighed
weighed yes very little UNK
well it was more it wasn't profitable you see the profit lay in the er in the in the packaging of the goods
i mean i the new innovation is just coming round today i see starting the same thing all over again you're weighing your own products at the
you see it's a little cheaper see
but erm and all sugar used to be packed in thick very thick blue bags heavy blue thick bags and there's an art in doing it as well in folding the bag i've watched them hours and hours
and er they used to pat the butter
the butter was all loose there was no UNK butter it was all c came in tubs you know
and the and they used to pat the butter there was one firm that specialized in nothing else the
and er you could hear them UNK this butter outside a shop you know it was a lovely sound on marble UNK and they were UNK away at this butter
but
and how would they s how would they sell that
how would you take the butter home then
buy it by pound yes they wrapped it up in paper UNK in UNK paper yes they'd pat it into
they wrapped it up in paper
a square
oh i see
and take so much off and pat it up and then wrap it very nice and neatly
when you think of the work that the old grocer used to have to do you know make you a three corner bag out of a bit of paper to put a UNK of UNK in
i mean can you see it really when
yeah
when you think about it yeah
and of course they sold almost everything the grocer sold almost everything
and er the then again that that's all changed
erm even the chemist shop as such has changed
that's been sort of UNK when you when you think that you used to have to buy didn't have to buy your tea but you used to buy a tea from the chemist shop and the only person that sold it was a chemist that was
which is sold everywhere today you could only buy it in a chemist shop tea
along with tea that was another brand that the chemist used to sell
was a UNK tea they called it UNK tea in those days
to sell it of course but erm that was another UNK of it
did you go with your mother then shopping
oh yes
and i could tell you another story as well i maybe used to pinch an apple out of one of the barrels
but the shop the store manager knew and it was paid for
oh i see
you see he knew
ah
as a child i can remember it ever so well doing it mm taking this apple out and invariably used to have one when i went in
but me mother used to pay for it you see
it was an understood thing i think the kids used to do this but the parents used to
use used to pay
used to yes used to put it right yes
he told hadn't he the manager
but erm those were those were school days
the school itself as i say i went to er street school
and er in later days it was called the school
it got rather sort of UNK
what sort of what time did you start school can you remember
nine o'clock in the morning er till twelve
we used to have a lunch break at around about half past ten i think ti was we used to go out for a quarter of an hour into the school yard to play and have your lunch
you used to take your lunch with you as sandwiches
erm i can recall my first day at school
it was a miss was the he the teacher
and a miss was the head UNK
this was the junior school we went at five
and as i say you took your little wrapped up lunch invariably in newspaper because they was no such thing as tissue paper int hose days you know that wasn't hardly available
and erm you used to cut it into the basket in the corner
and
what everybody had to put their
everybody yes the name your name was on written on it you see
everyone put their lunch into the basket in the corner and in this first class there used to be a UNK and i remember we had very big cards well i say very big about six inches long by three inches wide
and each one had got different letters of the UNK ion it and that's how we learnt the UNK
with these cards
i think there was three or four classes in the primary school
then you graduated into the sort of the er erm upper school
and you say in this class this is when you first went to school they had a UNK this was for playing in
that's right playing in the UNK that's right a UNK in the corner for UNK we kids to play in you see
and er i remember this miss very well she was i skirt down to her UNK sort of thing black skirt you know and high collar and sort of tied hair very dark person but she was a very nice UNK lady as i recall now
and erm i think you know you owe quite a lot to your first teachers quite a lot
and er i as i say i moved up into the next er school
can you re remember what sort oh this was a different school
no same in the same school in the same school yes different
sort of department sort of thing
the primary school was a small school on one side and then we moved over to the boys and the boys school was on the top floor and the girls school was on the bottom floor
and we all used to we both schools ended up er used to use the same assembly hall
and erm we used to go into the assembly hall every morning for prayer and then we should just go up to the erm we used to go upstairs to the er to the classrooms which were off a long corridor
there was one long corridor and all the classrooms were off this corridor you see i should think there'd be er five classrooms it was it was no sixth form
can you remember what sort of s how many children to a class
oh yes i can about forty or fifty of us to a class
and erm the first class was a mr erm mis was a miss
a miss that's right she took the first class
that was one of the UNK from the primary to the upper school
and i remember her very well and the next class we went into was a mr
can you remember what sort of lessons you did
oh yes we did er we did everything all the three UNK and everything else
and as we got up into the classes we also had a woodwork er centre and metal shop there
and we also had a swimming pool about a small swimming pool
er only a small one erm it was real a UNK er swimming pool but erm the less
this was contained in the school grounds
that's right yes well it was a school yard it wasn't they weren't grounds a as such it was a yard
an UNK yard
and erm we erm when you got to about the third class i think you was allowed to participate int he woodwork and metal er class you used to go across for half a day a week
and other schools in the area used to use this facility as well as well as we did
and the pool too
like from road at and er i think i'm not sure whether or didn't use to use it as well
there was quite a few schools used it
road schools they used it
er the woodwork centre as well
a man named was the er principal of that er of the woodwork and metal i think there were two teachers there two UNK if you'd like to call them that
and what
erm
what would you do in this sort of would you make things that you could take home
oh we'd make things make things that's right yes instruction
they taught you how to saw a piece of wood and how to make a joint a UNK joint or a UNK and joint
er i think i the height of my erm efforts there was i made a needle box a UNK box with all the UNK in and we french polished it and all this sort of thing
and i also made a couple of erm copper UNK and beat them
and we also did a bit of leather work to where we used to hammer the leather and put colours on to it to make UNK and that sort of thing
these are things they don't do at school today do they
not much of them anyway
not in that class of school
and would these be with the with the idea of teaching you almost like a trade you know sort
no not a trade just to make you handy
no it was just it was just so you i mean let's face it er my father used to mend our shoes repair our shoes in fact i've still got his UNK iron now
you don't know what a UNK iron is do you
no
it was cast in heavy metal and er it had er sort of a sole on one e part of it and a heel on the other part and then there was a small children's sole
and er you sort of pull the shoe over the sole and er then hit my father would sort of shape a piece of leather around the sole of the shoe and then er he would sort of UNK that went through the UNK iron which was iron of UNK that went through the UNK iron which was iron of course would bend them over inside your shoe just like a normal UNK repairs shoe
then he'd have a then when he'd done that he'd have a erm oh i think they used to call it a wax ball er to rub round the end of the sole and have a an iron that he would rub this wax into the UNK between your shoe itself and the leather to seal that off and make it UNK
and it all our shoes were repaired on the UNK like that er he had no shed ad there was no UNK were we lived at anyway and er he'd always sit in the summertime in the UNK repairing shoes
where UNK he get the material for
he'd buy that from a UNK shop from a shoe UNK shop
erm of which were there were many in those days er not so many today of course but er ooh i should say there were probably on vale which was our nearest sort of shopping area to where we lived there were probably two or three erm shoe UNK including and you could go and buy leather there
get a small piece you could buy a i think it was called a side of leather or a whole piece of leather and cut yourselves out of it and erm leather wasn't cheap even in those days it varied in UNK
in UNK shoes it was a thinner leather and the men's shoes it was a UNK leather
that's another thing they used to do in those days they never do now a lot of men when they bought a pair of boots they had them what they called UNK
and they'd buy a brand new pair of boots and take them straight round to the shoe UNK and have an extra sole put on from brand new to make them last longer
you'd see men walking round on their shoes about an inch thick you see
and the moment that sort of sole had worn off that the shoe UNK had put on it wasn't allowed to go any further than that it was taken off and another one put on
consequently their sh their boots lasted them almost a lifetime
and er on your on the better shoe like you what we call might call a sunday shoe you'd have a rubber heel put on i don't mean just a complete heel but a round disc that was UNK on to your heel if i can explain that to you
it's like a UNK round disc that UNK on and as that wore at the back you used to just UNK the screw slightly and turn it round until a little bit more of it wore and then you turn it round again until the whole thing was worn down
then you replaced that was saving your UNK
this was for UNK sake you see you couldn't afford to buy shoes like people buy them now and just throw them away
er a pair of shoes if you bought it had to last you a long time
and these were the things that did
and the only time you would get a new pair was if the top part of the shoe
that's right if the sho if the top part of the shoe went that was the only you got a new pair or if or if it burst around the sole and the UNK
er there was there was a erm a stud that was called a
er that was the name of the manufacturer an you used to buy them on cards they were all sizes and the big one you used to put onto the tips of your er soles just in on the tips to save the front of the shoe
and the er if you didn't have your rubber soles which er a lot of people didn't really like i think most people thought they were a bit UNK most men did anyway and they used to have these little metal tips put on you see or a metal sort of cross section across the heel that was to save your shoes again
would women's shoes have the metal soles
oh yes women yes they'd have little tips little put on but theirs were little tiny ones
erm we boys my father used to s what we call stud our shoes and they were round sort of metal UNK and these were sort of knocked into your soles to save the leather
this was innovation all the time just for UNK sake you as i say you just couldn't afford although you could buy er a beautiful pair of shoes for twelve and six that was a lot of money
where would where would your parents buy your clothes
would you go into the city to buy
oh no local shops local shops
i don't think i ever i have ever anything out of the city at all
er th the main shopping area for us when we li well it was when we for both places was
well main street UNK for almost everything
there was everything that you particularly could want from a grand piano to a pin sold in main street
i mean there were erm UNK stores there were furniture stores there were all the UNK shops UNK shops UNK shops UNK shops UNK shops er seed merchants er bakers UNK erm i can't say there were wallpaper UNK shops and paint shops as such because there wasn't such a thing as a wallpaper shop UNK it usually went to the hardware shop for wallpaper and paint
and paint wasn't as you know it today there were perhaps three colours in UNK green brown and cream
everyone's house and that's another thing if you wanted to paint as your house inside the cupboards and the doors they were painted brown and that was a UNK job they were never done again not like you do now with this UNK up of paint every so often
er UNK erm you invariably did that yourself or there were there were UNK and UNK about
erm if i remember correctly the pre war price for hanging a wall up a roll of wallpaper was about sixpence a roll and that included preparing as well
and if you wanted ten rolls of wallpaper they'd paper your room for five shillings
in fact i have a bill somewhere where the next door to me at the shop on street was UNK from top to bottom and the total bill for the paper and labour i think is under three pounds and that included el e eleven rolls for a staircase
so most rooms were UNK you didn't leave the walls just painted
oh no there was no such there was there was UNK as it was called er not like UNK is today there was this UNK that was called but er oh no that was that was for the UNK the UNK was whitewash
people used to whitewash their UNK
erm with whitewash not with er UNK that was too expensive they'd buy a packet of a packet of which would make so many gallons of whitewash and you'd whitewash the ceiling
but er if you had to paper the parlour was always UNK in the ceiling but he kitchen was always UNK because we had these if i explain to you these er UNK that er weren't very successful burning coal you know and the smoke would rise and before you knew where you were the ceiling was black again so sort of every so often up went the whitewash brush and you'd whitewash the ceiling
but erm the UNK was always inside a house was always brown like this is as you can see it's woodwork it was it was a colour like a UNK brown
and er i never remember er my parents painting anything in the house at all
i don't think my father would've known how to use a paint brush anyway
you know what i mean i it wasn't done wasn't done
th when the house was built it was painted and i think that used to last it's lifetime
mind you it was paint then it wasn't like it is today it was sort of good lead paint was put on and it did last
and that's another thing i mean where erm as i got i mean cleaning was sort of a spring clean was UNK and that was it
you had a turn out then and i think it lasted till the next spring not like taking curtains up and down like people do now and UNK for the carpets course the carpet would be taken out and beaten as you as you know they weren't they were UNK onto a line and beaten with anything that was handy
there was no such thing as a UNK cleaners or anything like that you know and er that's just how it went on
it was an amazing thing really when i when i look back and think about the UNK side of it because those UNK were had to be seen to be believed because they were if the wind was in the wrong you we the room was full of smoke
and the kitchen was just through there and er my mother when she used to UNK and cook er the blue smoke would be everywhere and er it must have been terrible when you think about it you know terrible it must've been
but er they managed they managed they coped
just going you were talking about UNK with going back to the school we were talking previously about school
yeah
h what were your can you remember
excuse me
what the classrooms were like
how were they
oh very vividly
erm now the it was it was a it was a mixed school but the girls were all on the it wasn't a mixed school in the sense of the word there was mixed in classes
there was the boys section the girls section and the juvenile section
now the juvenile section was on one side of the yard the school yard
and there was this long building on the er the other side of the er yard
now the down floor or the ground floor er th was the girls and the assembly hall the big assembly hall and the boys classrooms were above the girls you went upstairs you see onto one wing
and there was a very long corridor with a mo what must have been i should think five there was no sixth form so there'd be five classes five classrooms off this long the UNK perhaps as wide as this room which is what thirteen feet
and er the classrooms were off this with sort of wooden petitions and glass in the door
and erm the er the first class was right at the very far end of the corridor
that's where you graduated from the junior class as a boy you'd move up to that first class on this er this long corridor
and each year you moved up whether you were good bad or UNK you moved up one class you see
you were you never stayed in the same class two years
erm you came up this that's right class one and then class two and then class three class four class five that's right to the very end
and the UNK room was at the very end of that corridor where the fifth class was
er and we called er his name it was a mr we always called him UNK it was never mr it was the UNK was the headmaster
and er he used to pop in and occasionally take the fifth class whether it was because it was near to his office i don't know
but erm that was your final one and er that was run by a mr i remember mr because he was also the sports master as well
so each class had mixed ability groups mixed ability
oh yes oh yes it was just d if you was if you was behind then it was just too bad
because erm even going back to those days it was the bright ones that were pushed forward and the sort of dog take the UNK most sort of thing you know
and erm i think i was in the middle somewhere i wasn't er brilliant but i must have been somewhere in the middle i suppose
i can't complain i had a reasonable education there as to what was available as to what was available
but erm it was good the school life was very good because the teachers they were they were excellent men when i look back and think about it they really were
and er what i see of the modern teacher i'm probably looking out with three different eyes they don't seem to come up to the same standing as those men were at all because one thing that i remember very vividly about them all and they were family men what i call family men
and er i don't know they seemed to be sort of more UNK wide in many respects
probably weren't i don't know but they seemed to us i may be looking at it from a child's eyes but er that's how they seemed to be to me
i mean er i remember one year we had to we was asked to write an essay or a composition as it was called then not essay composition
as to what we were going to do in our school holidays and if i don't let's see the teacher was named it's be the fourth class and er two of us decided we were going to and this was before the days of UNK as such we decided we were going to go UNK
we didn't call ti UNK we were going on a walk
and we described what we were going to do on this walk and where we were going to go and both sort of referred to the same composition and there was a prize for the for the one that was judged the best
anyway this boy and i was judged to be the most original and the best you see
and er the prize was a erm a trip into the with a teacher on his motorbike and UNK he'd got a motorbike and UNK
and er he UNK he took along on this UNK right out to into the he showed us the erm major oak i can remember it very well
and he came when we came back again he brought us along the erm main road back and er and er he we visited er bridge
now this was the old wooden toll bridge before the new bridge was built i remember that being built in nineteen twenty eight
and erm this was the first time that i'd ever been sort of as far UNK into the country as this and to go and see the erm er toll bridge at that was and top go over it because it was a long wooden bridge that used to go over and er we thought that was absolutely fantastic
that was our prize for writing an essay but he was a human being this teacher he seemed to be so friendly towards us you know
although erm on the other hand i'd plenty of strap what we call strap you know
was what form of discipline
yes oh yes
the cane and strap you used to have the teacher used to give us the strap the headmaster used to give us the cane
erm
what was the strap can you describe
oh yes it was a leather er erm a piece of leather with three UNK on it and a handle to it and er you used to have this strap on your hand
not your body at all
and er it varied from one stroke on one hand for a certain thing or one on each hand up to i've had as many as six strokes of the strap
what would you have done wrong to get say one strap
one strap
erm talking
persistent talking you would get two
in fact i had it six for talking in class i remember very vividly having six strokes of the strap on my hand
so
oh we used to shake our hands we didn't use to go home complaining
we didn't report them to the authorities or anything like we knew we'd earned them
i had strap many times i remember once on my desk in my desk they were lift up UNK at the time and it and it was teacher was a grand fellow and i got under my desk underneath my desk written underneath it erm god helps them that helps themselves but god help them that i catch in this desk
and of course we used to have desk UNK inspections of course we used to take that down before a desk inspection you see this we had a surprise inspection and lifted it up and saw this and read it out read it right he said and we'll go god's going to help you do something else come out
and i had three strokes on each hand for that
so he'd hit you in front of the class
oh yes oh yes oh yes we used to get punishment in front of class
now anything really deadly serious that took place then you taken to the UNK room and he dealt with it
what were these serious
cane
with a cane
now being late the headmaster always dealt with you fro being late that wasn't a teacher's responsibility at all you used to have to line up all those boys that were late you used to have to line up outside the UNK room one at a time i jus on each hand you used to have a cane on each hand
never on your UNK like you see in the films that sort of thing always on your hands never anywhere else never got hit your body
erm
after you'd had this erm punishment UNK you expected to go back to your lessons straight away how long did it hurt did your hands
immediately of course it hurt
your hands were red you used to shake them and go back straight back to your work
and i never remember any boy ever cry
you didn't cry nobody showed it like that
and er i think in the junior school it was in the UNK you didn't get punishment there as children in the first school you stood in a corner that was your punishment
like i see it done today i think that sort of thing you used to stand in a corner
but erm oh no we er we took it and that was it you accepted it
accepted it
and er another thing that we never did in those school er very rarely did a boy erm oh what did we use to call it
when he UNK going to school play UNK
he very rarely played UNK a boy didn't it's er in fact i er i don't think i ever did to my knowledge played UNK at all during school
it was a very rare occasion er you had to be ill to be off school
you never thought of just taking the day off
no never
never even your last day at school you didn't take it off
you were there
why do you think that was
well i think it was the discipline that you'd got in those days
it just wasn't done
er school days were school days
you went to school at nine o'clock you came home at twelve you went back at two and you came home at half past four
and erm we never thought about playing i suppose there were odd boys that did this sort of thing but er they were very rare very rare
in fact you the classroom was always full there were no spare seats at UNK or anything like that and if one was empty you knew something was really UNK wrong
er i think one of the greatest er causes of s UNK it wasn't so much ill health er not on the part of the pupil i think it was more er if something was wrong within th family particularly if you was an elder daughter or an elder boy you see and erm if your mother was ill or confined you see you were probably kept at home er for those sort of reasons to either look after the younger children at home or to help to look after home
i mean there was no such things as home helps and that sort of thing in those days it was a case of doing it yourself
and i think where youngsters were away from school that was a greater reason for them to be at home to look after home whilst their parents were ill or if probably one of the other kids were off ill or something like that you see because in most families there was what three and four children
i mean ours was a UNK small family with two
and erm as i told you before we had i had two UNK with eleven each
and erm i should say the average family was around about four mark four and five children mark
so what elder children had res had quite a bit of responsibility
oh very much so very much so
very much so
very much so
in fact my own wife she came of a big family and she had to look after most of the younger children until they started work you see and then it was the next one that had to look after them again you see and so on and that's how it went on
but erm er the school days i think were really the best days of our lives but they we were the UNK days anyway because i enjoyed them and most kids enjoyed school in those days not like it is today
and er we had some marvellous school parties
erm when i say parties that's probably not the right word because erm party indicates sort of food and games we had concerts and we used to put on these concerts the pupils used to put them on ourselves and our parents were invited to come and watch these concerts
what at christmas time
no that was a special one
er the christmas party that was always a special party
the whole of the school would join in that boys and girls were together they were se UNK in the hall you didn't sit next to a girl or anything like that the boys were on one side the girls were on the other side
but the christmas party was something out of this world
you used to have to take a er a erm your own cup and erm that was for your for whatever we had we i don't know i remember we had UNK or pop or whether it was tea or we had er we had to take a cup and er most of us invariably took a big UNK with us
now you might ask what the big UNK was for
and i assure you it wasn't to wipe your nose it was to bring home any surplus cakes that were left on the table
and you were you were invited to take those home and they used to say put them into your big UNK and wrap them up
erm either for the younger children that were at home or your parents to eat
and er nearly every boy used to take a UNK along with him to the that was to the christmas party because that was the only party you had a meal at school
and er as i say we had a concert after this but th i can't remember whether they were professionals or whether any good amateur people
but we had some fantastic concerts we had a stage at the end of the assembly hall and they used to put on this erm concert for us singing dancing and the piano i remember that very well the piano
and er it would you would have tea at about er half past three and probably the UNK start at about half past about five o'clock half past
and we should come away about sort of seven o'clock in the evening it didn't go on till late at night you know like some of them do now
you'd go with your parents
no on your own no your parents weren't allowed to that one that was that was children's party
that was a it was a party
and er the UNK and the tables were all laid down the assembly hall and then we had a er after the erm when you had your meal which UNK of sandwiches and cake that was all
it wasn't a knife and UNK effort at all
and er we'd have to clear all those away and the chairs would be put into rows as i say the UNK sit down one side the girls would sit down the other
and the junior school would sit on the floor in the front and that's how it used to be arranged
that was every christmas there was a party of some sort put on for us at school
but erm mr was he was the headmaster he was another great character a great fellow he was a very big he was a tall man about well over six foot high
i mean i can't remember really but i should say he'd probably be about six foot two or three
he always used to wear a bowler hat and very dark clothes
and er he'd only got to sort of look at you and er that was it
with him
but the discipline was at school w it was when i look back it was marvellous we were never really bad lads
we got up to UNK obviously like a lot more youngsters do even today but er there was none of this sort of vandalism we didn't use to destroy anything
erm if we broke a window it was UNK
i mean i walk around the town and i see a factory or a shop or a house it only got to be empty about a week and all the windows are smashed
we did nothing like that
we broke windows accidentally we were throwing erm in fact i was only talking about whip and top the other day and erm er which was a game we used to play
and there was the erm there was a top called the window UNK and it was a special top that had got a long stem on it and a big round like a UNK it was like a UNK almost
and erm these things used to used to sort of wind the r the spring or the leather UNK around th top and start it off to spinning you know and then you'd keep UNK it like that and you could make these things jump into the air in fact a friend of mine was telling me we were talking about it the other day
he said he saw one boy hit one of these tops and it went straight over a house top
so high
now these things used to break windows obviously you can imagine it can't you
and that's why they were called a window UNK these tops
and it you broke a window you had to pay for it
or your parents did
there was none of this running away and i haven't done it and this that and the other
you had to accept the responsibility if you broke the window and your parents used to settle up for you
you got a good hiding for it but that was it
you used to break windows but it wasn't done like you see now people kids s picking up bricks and just breaking a window for the sheer UNK of it
and that wasn't done
erm but erm we we've gone through the games haven't we the marbles and that sort of thing we played that
can i talk about your erm school holidays what
ah
say the summer holiday what would you as children have done in
that
your school holiday
well easter er and er UNK wasn't a holiday easter was a holiday
now easter was taken up with the sort of playing in the streets virtually
er whip and top and marbles and all those sort of things we used to do
come the summer holiday which was august bank holiday for this i think we were away from school a month
now er first few days you'd be feeling your feet of course you'd be playing all sorts of things you know being free er in the street and all this sort of thing
and erm er where we lived it was adjacent to what i call well
now as a as it as it's pronounced there is the town but this was called well
now this was a li a piece of common land adjacent to cottages which was on the sort of the north side of
and er there was a sort of a cliff a UNK cliff and er out of this cliff side
right mr erm have you always lived in nottingham
well i live in live in nottinghamshire born and bred at a place called which is it's about er twenty four miles north of nottingham
a small mining town
brought up well as i was actually born in the village and that's where i've come home to UNK when i left the army
so you when did you join the army
nineteen er s nineteen seventy two
i came out in nineteen eighty four
and th did you join group four then
yes i was i had a month's terminal leave er i'd er i'd heard that there was a job going er phoned them up on the on the monday had an interview tuesday started the friday
so were you a sergeant when you started
yeah
yeah everybody starts off as a sergeant
and er you do you do probation for three months in which time you're UNK thoroughly
and if your if your UNK doesn't come up to scratch then you can be UNK it's in your contract
and er i've been with them ever since just come up to two year period
i've enjoyed it quite a lot
seen a lot of other things i wouldn't have seen if i'd have been working down a pit or behind a shop counter or something
met a lot of er different people
is that the sort of thing most people
well at the moment with the mining industry as it is unless you've got had you've got or had a relative working at the pit the local you haven't got the s chance of in
when i left school er if you went to the pit it was the last of the last jobs
but now to get into the pit it's one of the jobs to go to
i would say ninety five percent of people in the village are employed at the local colliery
mm
erm er
erm what was actually you brief when you move onto the flats
well our main brief was that we was to try and minimize and control the vandalism or any property belonging to the county council
er to make sure none of the empty flats was broke into and items removed such as copper tanks electrical fittings
to reassure the remaining tenants who were left behind or moving out er mm
tt
what's the word
well try and look after flats for the council
as
erm make sure there was no vandalism done
but we found out that most of the vandalism was done in the daytime when we were away
and er reassure the tenants that are left behind
so when did you actually move on to the flats
we started the contract in april of last year
i think it's the around about the first or the second of april
er so that's over a year now
about what
fourteen month fifteen month
mm
so what's you what are what are your actual powers
well we've got no s we've got no more powers than what a normal person civilian has got
er our main thing is if we see something UNK happening which we justifies erm the police being called then we will call the police
but if we see an office that's being committed by y somebody breaking into an empty flat or we actually see somebody breaking into a occupied flat then as a as a citizen you can enforce a UNK arrest
we've never arrested anybody yet i think erm the uniform does the job
and it UNK more people than u use actually having to er resort to different means
but erm the police react very quickly
if we say there's somebody suspicious knocking about the flats or there's a person on such a walk doing something we think's a little bit er UNK then they'll UNK they'll send somebody round as quickly as they can
so you've got quite a good relationship
oh we've got a fantastic relationship with the police
because also we can act as eyes for them as well
er i don't know but i would i would reckon the crime rate since we've been on the flats even though the flats are UNK out h has dropped er dramatically
erm as you know yourself you walk round the flats now it's dead
there's hardly anybody about but if you was here a year ago this was a little island on it's own little concrete island on it's own
and there was activity twenty four hours a day
you could go out to the UNK you could talk to somebody twenty four hours a day
if you was here
so you think the UNK certainly gone down since you
in number wise
well in the way people act
well you i it took a while for us to be accepted about six month i would say six month
because when they first saw us we was eve everything from the d h s to the police to the probation office
anything that could check up on people and UNK that's what we was called
gradually the people realized that we was here to look after the flats
and we weren't gonna you know bust the door down at six o'clock in the morning and do a drugs raid
or other UNK things that's going on
and they accept us for what we are and we've got a good erm relationship with the people w who are left in er the flat complex
mhm
er you said about breaking into them and things like that erm er a lot of tenants we've spoken to er seem to be er they seem to thing there's a lot of flats
er do you do you get a lot of breaking into flats
when we come we come on duty
approximately we a we start on at six o'clock
by which time the tenants have come home from work or they've been out for a few hours say they've been out from twelve till six
and they come home they find that the UNK been broke into and that's the first thing we know about it
er we've had one or one or two erm break ins while during the night
but on such a large complex like this we can't be everywhere at the same time
and er the problem is we get round who do you know who lives in what flat
erm if we see you know if we see somebody walking down a UNK and he's got a stereo in his arm arms should i say and he puts it into a car then obviously it a it UNK our suspicion we'll take a quick note of the car's registration number and we'll pass the relevant information through to police station
it's up you know and they'll act on that
erm we had one morning one of our sergeants saw what he thought was a break in
was in the
we got on to the phone to road police station and within possibly two three minutes there was four five police officers round there
and it turned out chap had been locked out and he forced one of his windows himself to get in
but they surrounded the flat cos they thought that it was a UNK a burglary was in process
so er we achieved something there even if it you know it put the UNK up the chap police looking out the windows and you know saw our reaction when the police turn up it makes them think again
erm what actually happens if someone comes up to you in the night and says my house has been UNK
what do you do
well first thing we do is we'll if i've got two sergeants at the flats i tell the UNK to go back to the flat and wait for the two s two sergeants turning up
they'll go back to the two UNK turn up
they'll go in with the with the UNK at the same time we'll inform road police station
and then erm it's up to road police station to deal with it
if we find a flat that's been broke into
and it's an occupied flat then we will not enter it or we will not enter it until we've had erm till road police UNK been informed and then we'll work on their advice
and then they'll say right we'll have a bobby in there in ten minutes or we can't get anybody there till such and such so what we will do is we will secure a door until somebody can come and have a look at it
erm if a UNK been smashed then we'll get the window UNK up to secure the flat the best possible way
you do all that yourself do you
no we we've got er a contact phone number and er a contractor comes in and boards it up
or UNK the door
if we can't put a clamp on it then we can't do a clamp
say the UNK been UNK then er we've got authority to contact the board the people who board it up
and then they'll get the flat secure
now in what other things go on in the flats that you get involved with
er what other things go on in the flats
fires
erm unknown people have got their little things about setting UNK on fire the rubbish UNK
what they normally do is they get some paper they light it they'll drop it and it falls straight into the rubbish UNK underneath
appropriate action
er nine out of ten you can see it
cos there's smoke
well i mean first of all you'll smell it
you find out where it is and you inform base which is here that there's a fire say in one of the UNK and er the fire brigade will be informed
and the fire UNK turn up and deal with it
and we put in a report to the county council in the morning saying there was a fire
erm we've had a couple of flat fires
there again er there was smoke seen coming out of a bedroom so we first of all informed base again that there's a fire in a flat secondly we did was break down the door
cos we took it that there was somebody probably take it that there's somebody inside the flat
until either the emergency services turn up and say there's nobody in the flat
or that the UNK turns up himself and says there's nobody in the flat
er and this case the there was a fire in a flat the chap had gone out to work we didn't know he'd gone out to work so we broke first of all we informed the fire brigade was on the way we broke down the door quick look in the flat best possible way we could look and the fire brigade turned up and dealt with the flat
we secured the door
erm we've had one attempted well one UNK attack in the period which we've been on the flats
er disagreement between er two partners er one partner set fire to another UNK flat by smashing a window setting UNK the curtains
we were i was i was UNK at the time with me partner
we heard the glass being broken
so we moved towards the sound of the glass and there's two people in the garden so we went down to have a look at them
as we as i approached them i saw flames coming from the curtains
and the two people in the garden started to walk away
so rather than cause er an incident there and then i informed my partner to follow them back to wherever they went which time i got on the radio back to control that we required the police and the fire brigade
er but he followed them all the way back to a flat on th on the on the complex
the police came and dealt with them and the arrest was made
so therefore in my mind we saved probably forty fifty family lives that night
and er it was a good night's work
the fire brigade eventually turned up because the police had cancelled they tu turned them ou turned them out again
and things settled nice and quietly and all the blue lights come flying down here and so we had to they was about to chop down this blokes door and we said whoa
said the UNK out mate
and we showed them where the fire was they checked that out
because er under no c circumstances if we have a fire do we say the f we put the fire out ourselves
even if we've had a fire and if it's burnt itself out then we will we will call the fire service to make sure it is out
and they're the specialists we're not
erm do you have much trouble with erm UNK and UNK and
when we first moved in april last year it was a bit cold
problem with the UNK is that they're heated
the heating pipes coming through for the central heating and the hot water
we had one or two one or two UNK knocking about and we just asked them to move on and they moved on
we've had one or two UNK that's run away from home sleeping in the in the UNK
there again rather than wake them up and the they do a runner we get on to the phone tell the police that there's a juvenile or what looks like to be a juvenile sleeping in part of the flats but where it's a UNK an ou UNK erm even under the stairs then they'll come along and check it out
nine out of ten it's a UNK
and they'll just they'll UNK you know just hand it over to the police and that's as far as we'll go
mm
erm when you're UNK the flats erm have you ever come erm into any sort of physical danger yourself
you and your patrol
no but erm i've had one or two people swear up to us
er i had or trying to UNK us and erm what our lads have been informed is rather than take a situation on like that it's better just to turn around and walk away
if they call you names or they UNK at you or whatever it's better to walk away and live another day than to get your head kicked in and end up in hospital
erm y you get a lot of well we did get a lot of verbal abuse from the young the youngsters
but there again you just let it go in one ear and out the other ear
that's why you've got to have somebody who's a mature UNK person for this for this k kind of job
you know probably if you got a younger person he probably would have been after him square up to him and erm
cos if you ever squared up to one of these or anybody in the flats UNK just come out of the out of the woodwork
and as far as er physical threats what somebody actually being hit
no
i mean you read you read a lot in the press erm about people being mugged on the flats and er break ins and all this sort of thing
are they actually as bad as the press makes out the flats
well before we came on the flats i would imagine they was
but now we're on the flats no
there again how long does it take to UNK a person
ten fifteen seconds
and you can do a lot in fifteen seconds you could murder somebody in fifteen seconds
erm nobody's gonna UNK a person if they see us coming or if they see a bobby coming
nine out of ten they'll wait until we've gone passed or even the police have gone passed before they'll commit an offence
but since we've been on the flats there's probably been half a dozen UNK
some in the UNK some at night
but there again it's people walking through the flats who don't live on the flats that get mugged
erm or people attending the blues walking from one end to the other
you know people who's coming in from o the outside to come on to the flats they're the people at risk
erm but er we've had one or two people come to us and report that they've been mugged there again we get straight on the phone to the police
and let them deal with it
we we'll do the reporting and that's as far as we'll go
but if we there again if we see somebody that's being mugged and we think that we can assist or we can deal with it then we will you have to take every situation as it comes
y erm it's like you don't go running up to something if you're gonna come worse off
if there's half a dozen of them and there's two of you and there's one person being mugged erm then it's better to stand on and watch and report b back to the base here who can inform the police who can get the necessary assistance out to deal with it
and er that's what we do
erm how do you think the people in the flats erm look at er you UNK them
well i think they're helping us erm possibly if this system had been started a few years ago then possibly flats complex wouldn't have got the bad reputation it has today
because i go home and i people say oh where are you working
i will say oh i'm doing a job at flats
and oh flats like then
as if you walk round with a shotgun UNK tank
and i say no it's a quite pleasant place to work
and they say ah come off it we've heard about it we've read it in the papers
one small aspect in the paper of can into a page a full page
but whereas say something that happens say well say take for example where i live in
er somebody being attacked there might make a paragraph
it's er UNK down and people do accept us
and people have stopped us and have said if this i if you'd have been on the flats say six ten years ago erm it wouldn't have got the reputation it has now
because the senior members on the flats that have been living here since it was put up when they came to live on complex they UNK it was the place to come and live
and they was proud to come and live in it
but er things have deteriorated
till we've got the situation we've got now
do you erm have you got to know people a bit on the flats
we know one or two people erm more or less by face not by name
er there was quite a few people moved out now
there was a an old lady down we talked to she's out most nights
there's one or two people knocking around that'll talk to you
erm we more or less know the young the young UNK element as such
er and they seem to stay well clear of us when they see us walking round
yes we know quite a few
in those areas
you said you got quite a good UNK
well i think we have now
yes
er without having a good relationship with the people in the flats er if i mean some people if they say see something going off they'll turn their you know turn their back and they don't want to know
there again on the other hand if some one or two other people see something going off they'll come and tell us
as i've said before we can't be all over the flats at the same time
so we rely on to a certain degree on a bit of help from the tenants
now how do you patrol the flats
erm do you go out in teams
well at the moment we've just started a new patrol programme and er we two sergeants UNK the UNK
and i had one sergeant downstairs UNK the er street level
er the sergeant downstairs if he sees any trouble or he finds something that's going off or UNK into something then he can radio back into base again
and then we can take appropriate action from there
erm the two lads on the flats there's two of them together so that anything that they meet or come up against they can handle themselves
but in our time it's very quiet now so we've moved into a different routine again where i have two sergeants out at one time changing over er frequently so they don't get bored
is it is there not that much to do now in the flats
well yeah there there's a there's a lot to do erm with half the flats being empty and or say two thirds of the flats being empty
erm you've got quite a few people walking through
erm these people are possibly the element we don't want on the flats
cos they're walking through the area and they'll if they've had a few pints let's go down oh we'll walk through flats and we'll smash one or two lights up smash one or two windows
erm i wouldn't say it's gone quiet at night we've got to be more aware now anyway
than what we had we was doing last year
as i said last year there were quite a few people out on the UNK so it was very rarely you got anybody walking through
now two thirds of the residents have gone there's a lot of UNK open there's a lot of windows there to smash there's a lot of you know try setting fire setting fire
so we've got to be more aware during the like what we call the silent hours
erm just really
erm d now the flats are UNK do you find there are as many blues on the flats
well erm at the moment we've got one blues on
erm and that is not half as what it was last year
but then again we can say that we've had a quiet week saturday and sunday or from friday till through till monday morning it can be packed out with people just visiting the blues
do they do they seem to create much trouble these blues
yeah
er as i said before if we get some verbal abuse from people going to the blues then we know that it was UNK coming in
they just accept us for what we are they know that we're not gonna upset their lifestyle we're not gonna start UNK their place at six in the morning
they accept us for what we are and that's it
mm
so you've got no powers to go sort of talk about their noise
no
if somebody comes and reports to us that erm that the UNK loud all we'll do is refer them to road police station
and let them do
erm do you have erm much to do with the housing people
that are on the flats
yeah we've got the daily you mean the council staff
yes
yeah we've got the daily contact each morning with one of the one of the er council employees they'll come up approximately between eight and nine and we'll hand over any incidents reports that have been made during the night
and we'll er inform them of erm the state of the flats during the night whether it was quiet busy erm anything we've seen knocking about erm and things in general
so does it work quite well for them
oh yes we've they are UNK and if we wasn't keeping a good erm a good liaison with them then i don't think we'd be here now
erm wh what what's it like working on flats i mean have you worked anywhere similar
no i haven't worked anywhere similar in this employment
er but working on flats taken to the job
erm when i came on to the flats i came with an open mind and i was gonna you know take things as i as i met them
erm we treat everybody the same we look after everybody as i say the best we can
erm and it's just a normal job
yes t to a certain extent i expect
erm there's nothing hard about it there's nothing easy about it
erm the best thing about this job is you don't know what's round the corner
as i say one day it might be quiet and the next day something might happen
erm since we've worked the flats i think the lads who've worked up here have dealt with a very broad erm a very broad aspect of incidence
and th they will they will have dealt with more incidents up here than i would imagine any other erm place of employment that they'll go to
and it probably beds them in slightly to go off to somewhere else
is there anything you haven't worked with on the flats yet
well we haven't had a murder and we haven't ha a rape
and er erm that's about it i think
but er who knows we're probably here for another two years we might find a dead body somewhere
erm it's a bit frightening when you if you find somebody UNK down somewhere
you can see a body and like oh what's that and then you know you're a little bit er relieved when it moves
or it stands up or you know you go and put it in the cupboard and all of a sudden there's a there's a there's a face looking at you know
yeah you're hoping your heart er beats rising
i think personally erm i mean yo would you like to live on the flats
no there's no gardens
of such
erm the tenants are not allowed to keep animals
but er as you know looking round the flats they do
erm and i but there again if it was a controlled access to the flats and people wasn't allowed to wander through the flats
er probably yes
erm but then again if anybody's got any UNK which i have it's not it's not a well i don't reckon it is a place to bring children up in
erm if there was probably me and me wife on me own and it was a co controlled access and there weren't people walking through probably come and live here
what do you mean by controlled access
well er if take it as if threw a b a fence all the way round the flats
well that this starts off by keeping the UNK out
they do most of the damage knocking on doors UNK writing all over the place
so what i mean by controlled access is nobody comes on i within to this flat complex without er the se the security team knowing
so say for example you was a UNK
and you was say i'm going to come to the exit point i'm going to say come in here
and unless has told us that you're coming then you don't get on the flats
that's one way to keep traders out
i mean how many times has somebody knocked on your door oh i'm joe UNK i've come to sell UNK
you know
and people don't want it
er it's like kids or people walking through from road to road
they'll ni they'll nip through the flats
they'll deposit their rubbish you know
if they've had a few UNK they m they may leave something else behind
people don't want it
erm and that's what i mean by access
controlled access
erm aren't UNK in my view in my view only in UNK of this size it should be a controlled access
and er you just don't get bad people wandering round the flats
the only people you get on the flats is the people who live on the flats and the people who's been invited into the flats
erm and that's my view
and that's right down here
wh what what's this
and this is all sealed up as well is it
yeah it's all sealed up
all these doors
we used to have a UNK here
yeah
frightened the living UNK out of him when i opened the cupboard
you say you don't get any trouble on
no
see it's all UNK up now
i opened it one morning there was somebody looking at me
you were saying about blues at er night
is that weekends is it
er you get what you call a small blues during the week but friday saturday sunday and monday you can expect er large blues
is that on the flats or is it the
well you got one on the which has got nothing to do with us
then you've got one on walk
let's have a look round here check this
yeah
so what they're doing now is UNK the UNK off
it's a bit of a so you can't get through
it's a bit of a pain in the neck cos we can't walk round you see
the whole UNK been sealed off
yeah the whole UNK been sealed off
which one's that is that the
it's erm d UNK i think
and after fourteen months up here i can still get lost
yeah
and whereas before we could walk round in a on a circular route yeah that's walk
so you have to you're just doubling back on yourselves
yeah just d doubling back on ourselves
but erm er when the w winter comes on the wind starts UNK round this place it er cuts into your ears a bit
you can feel the cold
you not have any trouble with UNK on these UNK
well we've had one or two as i say i found a chap in number fifteen the UNK i just asked him to move on
er next night so i frightened him i was gonna nail it up while he was inside and he soon come out
you've not had anybody tear the tin down and
no well not as far we've found
er nobody UNK the tin down
you'd probably come in the daytime and you'd find some of the UNK been ripped off a bit you might find a find a UNK been ripped off
and then you know when you check up on it the following day you probably find the council's been back in and forgot to secure it so we've got s a nail and some nails and a hammer and we'll er just re secure it and let the council know in the morning
walk completely empty
it's all this one side of the flats isn't it
yes it's all this side er phase er one two and three
how do you find it on the parts that are still UNK i mean the
well they're more or less no different to what we're walking down here now
you might see somebody UNK about later at night or in the morning
it's not very lively
no
no
creeping off to work
it's the main problem we get to face in the daytime now is the windows being smashed
and obviously you can er ascertain that er when more windows get smashed the locals are gonna start complaining to the council that it looks a bit of an UNK even though it's an UNK now it'll be a greater eyes UNK then
but we're not on the flats in the daytime
yeah
so there's nothing we can do about it
and most of that goes on in the daytime
mm
does it
and this is walk
walk yeah
number six is the UNK
you can walk down here don't walk down here at nighttime if it's er if it's UNK a block
alright then
the lady lives over the blues must have a set of UNK somewhere
and she's got three UNK so she moves out at nighttime
yeah we don't erm UNK them
if we see there's quite a few on the UNK and if we know that they're UNK then we'll turn round and we'll walk back the other way
it's better to walk b back and look at them for a d you know from UNK than
yeah
try and push your way through
on to
there's a cupboard there that's been ripped open i mean is that just part of the vandalism that goes on
well no knowing our it's probably the er electricity board's come along to read the meter somebody's put a screw in it and they've got a UNK and just opened it up
that's not vandalism
quite a lot of flights around
oh yes
our biggest er threat when we first come up here was the dog muck which was on the ground
i think we've walked past the one that's been set on fire
i dunno
you walk round the flats and you know you walk round them for fourteen months and all of a sudden you have to stop and think where you are
play area
er round about christmas last year this flat down here bottom of they had all their present in there
ready for the christmas party and some er some UNK broke in an nicked all the presents
obviously it was an inside job cos nobody else knew the presents were there
did they get them back
no
there was a lot of toys and that appeared on the flats all of a sudden
was that over night that
in daytime in the daytime
anything happens on the flats it'll happen in the daytime
cos they know they know that we're not here
let's have a look along
come right on the UNK you see we can look on the back of these flats
yeah
right
what walks this
is this
er i think
have you had much vandalism on the play centre stuff that
no not mu much as what you can call vandalism you know people UNK paint on the UNK up windows and that
look down the back here see if there's anything
the boy's club no
nothing to do with us
of course we can see the back of the flats over on and er wrong on and
you've got to look at them from different angles see if there's any smoke UNK out from anywhere or somebody's hanging out of a window
you were saying about you had a bomb scare once what walk was that on
that was on
what actually happened there
well i don't know really
all i know is the reports which the lads filed
er a chap er reported to our lads that there was a suspicious something suspicious UNK up to his back door
er they went had a look took the appropriate action and er phoned the police and handed it over to the police
er which in turn the police brought the bomb disposal out
and they dealt with it
it was actually a UNK wasn't it
yeah it was they call erm a UNK
a UNK er UNK device
if we'd kicked it something like that
they the leads carried out the proper procedure what's laid down for them
and they did quite well
the police UNK them
i think even when the police turned up they hadn't got a clue what to do with it so it was a good training day from this leads down onto the UNK
terrace down there and walk there
do you actually go down the UNK
oh yeah we go down the UNK
drop onto the walk level at night time
you say it gets a bit UNK about two o'clock
yeah we get the people going from over to the
there's a couple up here at number twenty a deaf and dumb couple
we were walking round here about three o'clock one morning there was water pouring all out the UNK of the concrete
went upstairs and there was water pouring out the UNK
tried the alarm their alarm like obviously they hadn't switched it on
so we had to get the UNK down to kick the door in and you can imagine at three o'clock in the morning some deaf and dumb couple there's this big coloured bobby le leaning over and UNK them up
the first thing they do is switch the bloody lights on
there was about four inches of water inside
all we heard was one scream for a bobby like you know and they turned the lights on
had all the pipes burst
well what had happened apparently the er UNK inside the system had stuck
and the er UNK wasn't working properly
do you get much trouble like that with water and stuff
oh we deal we deal with all sorts on here
er water lights for any you know the light bulb goes first thing they do they come running to us you know me lights are out
well right love we'll inform you know we just phone up and let them know what's happened
this all goes on the report in the morning
yeah it all goes on the report in the morning
flat over on bottom left that's where we had the UNK attack
it's all UNK up now
and as i as i told you before we was on the main UNK heard the glass smashed we come down a UNK on come round the back saw the two or saw two persons in the back garden asked them what they were doing buy which time the curtain went up in smoke well up in flames
i dealt with the fire while the other sergeant followed them back to
and the police come and we handed everything over to them
the flat was alright then
yes well we save we possibly saved that time most of was completely er occupied so if we hadn't have seen the fire there could have been forty lives or forty families at risk there
i think it's anyway i keep forgetting where we are
you can imagine
yeah i think that is
yeah you can s you can imagine walking round here for fourteen months and then one w one back of one UNK looks like another UNK
have you had any trouble i mean i mean i don't know if you've seen erm but does to a deterrent and there's trouble with UNK on the walks have you found any trouble with UNK
yeah you get one or two people with the UNK
all we do there again is we'll tell them to stop if they don't stop we'll get on the on the phone to the UNK and let them deal with it
yeah
we got erm no authority to
UNK
stop them
alright then
yeah
and just get the registration number UNK phone it through to the police and let them deal with it
yeah
down on to i think
yeah i can see it's cos i can see name plate
alright
and two out on a limb
alright then
she's gone
has she gone has she
went this morning
this morning
yeah you'll miss her
aye
got nobody to talk to down here
i've got no UNK in the corner
yeah UNK has moved out
is this an old lady
yes we got her moved out a little bit earlier
she was a sitting
she didn't know what she was UNK entitled to claim for
so when we got the council's bloke to have a word with her went to saw he a fortnight ago and she's moved today
last time i seen he on monday she was happy as punch she was going
have you had any break ins or anything like that recently been very quiet
it's been very quiet with break ins
we've had one on
let's just check no it's been quiet on break ins at the moment
probably er you know people's probably got a bit of money so they don't need to break in to anybody
one on walk
but that was a bit dubious
see there again we can come on here and we can look down the back of
there again make sure nobody hanging out of a window or somebody doing summat daft walking a to along top of roofs
have you ever caught anybody on the roofs
yeah we've seen one or two up there but all we do is to tell them er to get down
if they want to fall off that that's their problem
er y you know especially if they're living in the flat you know above
er we've got authority to pull them off
is it you were telling me about you caught kids UNK was it
yes that was over on walk
we passed that way back
yeah there was about three kids three kids in a in one of these cupboards and they were UNK butane gas
i phoned up the UNK told them about it and the UNK the isn't a lot much they could do
they've come down and give the lads tell the lads off
but by time they come down the lads had gone you see so
waste of time
obviously that had a fire risk to it as well
well it does i mean with these light being UNK they give off a small charge when the you know when the lights come on
you've only got to have the gas build up and bang
that's what happened apparently at about a fortnight afterwards
er couple of lads UNK butane and somebody struck a match
and they went bang
we went a lot quicker than what we normally walk round in
we normally take it a bit slower
i've walked down shall we go down onto s ground floor
like this
right down on to street now
st street level
between the flats and come out the other end
i mean what sort of things happen down on the ground level
oh you might get er an abandoned vehicle
see a vehicle that you recognize is not off the patch they'll radio it through to the base to our base
UNK get on phone and the UNK stick it through computer
computer
do you get many abandoned cars
one or two we used to we had one or two when we first came up here
but it's all quiet now
get this sorted out
it tends to stick on it's never done that i don't think yet
yeah
now have you had a chance to look at anything since last time
i haven't and i've meant to but
ah
you know
i've been like mad busy w one thing and another
yeah
oh i know what it's like
even of an evening
well mainly cos of me mum of an evening cos she's not been too good so i've been up and down
oh isn't she
yeah
yeah it's erm
can't seem to get a chance
it's really
i mean i want to
yeah
to get i and do some of this and do these
yeah
problems
yeah
it's getting the time to do it
but you need to be
mm
when we cover something in the lesson you need to go over it yourself
yeah
work out the exercises in it erm maybe get a little bit stuck sort it out yourself and then think oh yeah
yeah
i know i see how you do it
and maybe if you're totally stuck then i can go through it again next time but
yeah
it's really the more you do
mm
on your own
because when it
well
comes to the exam you're gonna be on your own
yeah
i'll have i mean i'm having er a weekend in UNK so i might er take stuff up with me you know for the odd
yeah
UNK
kids are on the beach and that
so i can work i can still work through on these ones
okay
you happy with the trig then
erm yeah i'd say it's trig and geometry and the bearings using trig with the bearings is the
yeah
thing that i need to
okay
cos i know they're the things that seem to
okay
have the big marks on
take a take a bearing on me then if north is that window
erm UNK that window
right yeah don't forget go
yeah
clockwise even though it means coming the long way round
yeah
they put it on every question and they all come out of the exam and they say oh it was fifty degrees wa no it was all the way it was three hundred and ten
oh
there goes the marks on that one
yeah
so if you remember nothing else remember that one
yeah
to make sure you go clockwise
okay have you come across anything else that you've i suppose you haven't had you haven't been coming across much at all
no
i mean i had act i wanted to er hopefully have a fortnight off before the exam to revise but the way this UNK looking i don't what i'm going
mm
i'm definitely gonna take a few days off but i wanted
yeah
to get into it properly
you see i've not really got the same trouble with english because well english is a written thing isn't it
yeah and you've been doing that for many years english
yeah
haven't you
yeah
erm
right so right
so you're okay on graphs because there's usually a question on graphs which er if you know if you're okay on them pretty easy marks
erm not too bad i mean we've done a the last thing i done at the night school was a UNK
okay
yeah
is that is that the right name for it
UNK
yeah
statistics
erm there's a lot of us starting
okay what does that mean then
well i worked out at school well actually the teacher worked out
is that
erm no only partly finished it would have
okay
gone to about here
what's
yeah
right
what's the main thing missing from it at the moment
erm well apart from like the next few columns
mm
the bit they give you marks for
er
what's this measuring up here
oh right that's erm
and what's that measuring along there
i can't remember
right
now if you do that in real life
yeah
erm you're doing a perhaps you're doing a UNK of some jobs that you've been doing
mm
to see which ones are giving you the good profits sort of thing
yeah
this was a weight
right
weights and measures
yeah it can be almost anything but if
mm
you haven't marked on what it is erm and then you come make get some interruptions which you're going to do and you
yeah
come back to it next week
mm
yeah what is that
what was this
and it's so one of the first thing to do is to get your axes marked so that when you're putting stuff in you know which is which
cos you can put these the other way up
yeah
you know with almost any graph you can put them whichever way up you like
so
i didn't do that one
no
decide on suitable scale first
right
and watch out with the scale on these on UNK and on any graphs because what happens i mean i was watching somebody do this a couple of days ago
they're marking off along here erm every square is two say
mhm
and they go two four six eight twelve
mm er
two four six f around ten
mm
is where most people go wrong
two four six eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen
yeah
and
and it's rubbish then it's rubbish because the scale doesn't mean anything
one part of the scale it's double and the other part it's not
yeah
and all the results come out all wrong
and it's so s i mean it doesn't need a lo any mathematical skill at all really
mm
it's just a question of you know marking off every second square
but you'd be surprised how many people don't
yeah
they get it wrong
cos it is a boring thing
and you stop concentrating
mm
get it wrong
yeah
so erm mark your axes work out what your scale is going to be to fit it all on i mean that looks like a nice fit
mm
just gone on and a little bit left over
that's fine
erm if it'd all been down here you could think oh well i can make it twice that take it out to about here
yeah
okay
that looks fine a good fit
what about erm graphs of functions
erm
i think we'd better have a look at equations actually
i've done some now where is it
i've done some functions
right
functions
yeah
one function er that yo you're given a function
right
you're told that particular function is equal to that
mm
and then they ask you to find the function and do something with it you have to use that function there you have to use that in it
mm
well there's a definition of a function there
yeah
what's a function
er a function is a set a set sum that you're given
a function of a number
mm
er as a end result that number that's a function but you have to do something with it
er mm
tell me some of the things that happen when you're working out a function what would what would be the overall picture if someone was going to work out a function
erm
what would you
well you given the function
you're given a function okay whatever that is
mm
it might be a bit like a rabbit or something it's a function right
and what would you do with it
er i'd store it and use it with whatever i'm asked to use it with
so you'd be asked to use it with something
you'd be given some input
mm
okay what would you do with that input
i'd either plus it multiply it divide it
so you'd do some mathematical operations on it
mm
and is that it or
either that
would that produce an would that produce anything
it'd produce a different answer
and it gives an answer an output
mm
okay
so the input comes in the function you do something with it
mm
and you get an output
so that's a sort of overall picture of a function
and what's going inside the function
can it be anything or what
pretty much it can be anything it could be in brackets it could be a minus in brackets
mhm
okay i'll give you a i'll give you a number
and
erm three hundred and sixty
yeah
right
you give me all its factors
or a few factors give me some factors
er erm well er twenty
okay yeah
five
yeah
erm ten
okay
now is that a function
mm
is that a function what you're doing
i give you a number and you give me some other numbers that are tied up with it in some way
is that a function
not sure
possibly
right
it's not
yeah
okay
what does your what does this say for a function
when you take a number follow a set of instructions and end up with end up with what
er
you'd end up with
end up with one answer
on answer
mhm
if you end up with more than one answer then it's not a function
yeah
okay so that's the that's the big thing about it
it's an input a set of rules to follow that will guarantee that you get one output
mhm
okay erm so suppose i ask you to square the number
whatever number i give you multiply
mm
it by itself
okay
three
nine
minus four
minus twelve
twelve
erm yeah four fours
sixteen
okay so it's
sixteen
right so if i give you minus
four you give me plus sixteen
yeah because it's multiplied
right
yeah
plus four
erm
what would you give me
er sixteen
yeah
yeah
okay
is that a function
yeah
yeah
cos you're following the instructions and you're giving me one answer
mhm
now you've given me the same answer for two different inputs but that's okay
that's fine
that's still a function
but if you're giving me different inputs different UNK for one input then that's not a function
mhm
so if i say what's the square root of sixteen
and i said four
you could say well it's either four or minus four which one do you want
yeah
two answers so that's not a function
if i say well you'll give me the only ever give me the negative version of the square root so if i give you sixteen you give me minus four
if i give you nine you give me
er minus three
right that's a function
mm
there's only ever one answer
or i could have been a bit less awkward and said you just give me the positive one
mm
the plus four or the
yeah
the plus three
that would be a function but a function there's only one answer to it
thought of as a recipe for any number
okay erm the input need not be a number it can be all sorts of funny things
mm
and you get one funny thing as the answer
but we can at this level we can restrict it to numbers
yeah
erm
it's a few xs in there and there
right now
went down to like this kind of stuff here
right
twelve over three and
okay
now the notation do you understand the notation
where's the notation
two types of notation it gives here
a and b
yeah well erm they're basically different functions different questions
erm those are the same function
but he's given it to you in two different types of notation and you need to know both
so w how would you read this first on
x squared plus four
you haven't read the first bit though
oh
function x in brackets
mm
so that x whatever you use it with has to be x squared plus four
mm
okay how would you read this one
and that one is written out just a different way
that's got the two dots
yeah
right
but he normally sticks to brackets rather than he's got x is it x squared plus four it's exactly the same
mm
he's just wrote it out different
he's used the two dots
right
okay
and
this UNK this notation is mapping notation because amongst other things a function is a special case of a mapping
we won't go into
mm
UNK but you can have they're very often non mathematical
mhm
erm you have four types of matt of mapping
and two of those types er you can they can possible be functions
mm
so this is read a function f such that the double dot is just read as such that a function f such that x maps to x squared plus four
mm
so that any x any number you give to me you give me x i'll g say if i'm the function if you give me x as the input i'll give you x squared plus four
mhm
you give me three as the input i'll give you three plus four
okay
so if you gave me six as the input what would i do with it
six squared plus four
okay and this is in function notation
mhm
where that is what the answer is f of x
mhm
f of x is the answer
f of x is what f has done to x
yeah
someone gave it x as its input and it gave you as an answer f of x
mhm
and f of x in this case will be x squared plus four
exactly the same mechanism
mhm
the same rules for that
it's a different notation and you
mm
do need to know both
both of them mean take a number square it and add four
and that's your answer
okay
mhm
when you find an answer for the function at a particular number erm i would
it's called the evaluation of the function
right
and we'll call it the and we'd have said and you find you find the value of the function for a particular number a particular input a particular value of x
and that's evaluating function
finding the value of the function
given that f of x is x squared plus four work out f of two
mhm
that's two times two is four plus four
okay
and all of these
f of nought
that's er nought squared plus four is four
okay
right
now gets interesting and you need to know what the notation is when you've got more than one function
mm
right
yeah
so this is where you sort of sort out if you really know what's going on
three functions
find f of this g of that h of that
and you won't have any problem with that
mhm
okay is that okay
these are them there
let's have a quick look
erm so on one a b and c
this is this is one
right
there
there okay
erm
f worked out at a half
problems one
oh
f of five
f of five is one
what was it two x
right two times five okay
right
so all these have been marked and they're okay are they
yeah
erm right
now five
these ones here though i was surprised i got them right
mm
because i was like well it wasn't quite UNK but i just done it anyway and it
follow the rule
yeah
tells you
square it multiply it by two subtract whatever it is just do it
yeah
and you get the answer
erm right
i think three might be on another page
f maps to next prime number greater than x
find f of seven
what UNK that a
a on three
well f of seven was eleven
yeah
right
f of seven what's the next prime number well it's not worth trying the UNK nine obviously isn't prime so eleven is the next one
yeah
okay
f of fourteen
it's not fifteen
that was seventeen
seventeen
yeah
and f of three next one up is five
yeah
ooh no
no that's erm it's not five
why not
f of seven is fine f of fourteen is fine right
we need two people for this to work out this function
we're both doing the same job we're both the same function which is find the next prime number up from whatever number you're given
now f of f of
mhm
three
yeah
you work it from the inside out
what goes into this f of is whatever came out of that f of
yeah
so i'll be the inside one
mhm
the one that works out f of three
right so you're the UNK if you like you're the outside one
you'll come along and you say right i will i'm going to you're going to take as your input whatever i give as output
my input was three
yeah
and so f of three is five
mm
and that's what i hand on to you as your input
mhm
okay
so you've now got to work out f of five
function of five
and the function is find the next prime number that's greater than
well don't i just go the next one great than three
no because that's what that's not your input that's my input
yeah
that's my input
mm
you're waiting there
mm
you can't do anything until i've produced my output
right i'm that first i'm that function mhm
and you're this one outside the gates if you like
yeah
outside the brackets
mhm
waiting until that one's been worked out
oh if that's one's five then they go to the next on e after that which is seven
seven
right now a function of a function there
mhm
it's the same it's the same function
i think it's probably easier to see it when you use a different function
now we don't he hasn't given you any of those here
er i'm pretty sure they do give you them
just check the level
yeah he hasn't
if he gives you that if he gives you f of f then he can give you f of g and i'm pretty sure that you do need to know that so i won't bother checking
i'll just give you some on those
mhm
and you can see what this is in function notation which is most commonly used and it's easier to understand than the mapping notation most people find
yeah
so think of a function keep it nice and simple cos you're gonna have to work it out
yeah
okay
think of a function
er x squared
f of x equals x squared
plus ten
plus ten
well do you want to make do you want to make it plus one
yeah
plus one might be a bit easier
okay
and i'll think of a function
which is three x minus two
okay
right
okay
now what i want you to do is to find f of g of x
and to find g of f of x
now we'll try a few examples first
mm
with actual numbers
before we go into that
yeah
what's f of g of three
how would you work that out sort of talk about it before you get started
what are you going to do with that
er m well if function was three it'd be
function isn't three input the number that's going in is three
mhm
right
g three
g of three
g of three g of three squared plus one
g of three
so that f has got to wait outside the brackets till the stuff UNK been worked out
mhm
so we'll just leave this down here
waiting to see
mhm
what it comes to
mm
it's f of something
it doesn't know what yet
mhm
right so what's g of three
g of three is er g three squared plus one
it's not g three squared
g of
it's just no g of three is three squared plus on
yeah
right
it's very important to be precise and know exactly what you're talking about on these cos you'll get
mhm
you'll just finish up with rubbish if you don't
yeah
and it's why they put these in
mm
to m to sort out if you were really on top of it and know what you're doing
mm
okay
so now we're looking for f of three squared plus one
and what's no we don't
that's right not right
i should have checked that before i wrote it in
g of g of x is three times x
yeah g
three times x minus two
g of x is three ti three x three times x
so it's three
minus two
times three minus two
mhm
okay
erm let's change that let's make that four so we don't get confused with this three that's already in there
yeah okay
so it's three times x which is three times four
mhm
plus two
okay
minus two
g of x
right so it's three fours are twelve take away two is ten
well okay
that's what we've got so far
now we want to do f of that
now what does f of that come to
the function of that is x squared
well that's x
that lot is x
so it's ten squared
so it's three times four minus two squared
plus one
plus one
so that's f of g of x
mhm
now i'd like you that's f of g of x to work out g of f of x
mhm
er the same x
g of f of three
of four sorry
so right
what's that going to come to
g
that's what that's what f of x comes to and that's what g of f g of x comes to
right so first of all i work out what's inside these brackets yeah
yeah
leave the g there
good
now f of four is four squared plus one
right
yeah
don't work ou yeah that's great
don't work out what that comes to leave it as four squared plus one
right
okay
so then g of x er is
now you can only write exactly what's on there in here
mhm
because that's what g of that's g of UNK number
mhm
and this is g of the same number
so you don't need the g on it now
when you went from there to there the f of four disappeared
yeah
cos four squared plus one is f of four
right
so when you go from there to there the g will disappear
mhm
and the brackets
yeah
okay
that will all disappear
yeah
hello
hi
how are you then
fine thanks
having a nice rest are you
well i am now anyway
i mean you know in general are you sort of sitting back you know letting the house run itself and everyone rushing round
oh well not quite really no
you get some UNK here sometimes don't you
thanks very much for
okay
the coffee
so what would g of seven be it would be three times seven minus two
but what's g of this lot
well is it i'd have to work it out wouldn't i
no
four fours are sixteen but th that would be seventeen
okay do it like that
so it'd be three seventeen minus two
right so write it as about here write it as three times seventeen minus two
okay but there's no reason why you can't write it as we're doing g of f of that was f of and g of is
g of f of
that's x so we've got three times four squared plus one
yeah
minus two
minus two
yeah
yeah okay
right
that's i put them just
that's fine
now
so it helps to put that in the brackets
it helps to put that in a smaller bracket when i go three times that minus that
yeah
right
g of f of x is going to be what
it's going to be g of what's f of x
x squared plus one
right what do you do with when you're doing g you do three times it
minus two
and then subtract two
right
right now you worked out f of four
mhm
g you worked out g of f of four
this should be a general thing now
er g of f of x is equal to that
so if we put four in there we should get the same answer that you got
three UNK minus two forty nine
is that right
looks about it
yeah
mhm
okay
so if we put four in there that'll be seventeen three UNK
yeah
that works okay that
yeah
and g of f of four would come to forty nine
now i'm pretty certain that you do that and it's a bit of erm there's qui quite a bit in it
getting sort of
it does the functions can see seem quite advanced really don't they
or is it just cos it's fresh stuff
er
bit like algebra isn't it
but they're not so much yeah
they're not so much advanced as they are very basic
mm
they're more basic than algebra
yeah
more basic and the more basic things are the more strange and sort of
mm
more awkward to get your head round it
er just see what they say on functions here
look in the table
page eight
coverage of topics
topics relevant to basic level
higher level intermediate level
so intermediate UNK equations by graph
they're all on that
want to look at on the graphs
bearings UNK probability i can't see functions
should be right at the beginning
erm UNK off
it still ne yeah
drawing bearings UNK
functions fractions
functions
functions and UNK of functions at the higher level
n e a level r
you're doing q aren't you
yeah
are you all doing q at on your night school course
yeah
they might have just threw in a bit er more from paper three
erm
cos he UNK that paper three does give you some
well i thought that functions came into it i must say
this one doesn't give it and er
is this one er
oh this is an eighty eight
eighty eight
i mean they can change in a year
can change in a year
in this one
er probably the best way to tell is did he give you a syllabus at some stage
yeah
he did
mm
it'll be in here
cos it's
on definitely on the higher level
it's just that i i'm quite sure that you need
see he's given you a function of a function
mhm
f of f of erm and i think you do need it on that
but erm
see i don't know where he got it from because he didn't give us th questions out of this book
no
he he'd obviously done them in school
yeah
and brought them in on you know erm sort of
are you reasonably happy with that
yeah
i mean at first i didn't know what you mean but i do now
so it's getting used to for a start being able to read it
mm
cos it's UNK
mm yeah
isn't it
it's just
mm
funny UNK and you've got to sort of like when you first see x squared and you think what's that
x with a little two up in the air
yeah
erm then you gradually get used to it and when you read it you've read it several times it means something to you then
so this'll come to mean something
erm er they're all okay they're all okay
he's only given you one of those
do don't bother about that one
er when do you see him next
wednesday
UNK tuesday
tuesday
ask him whether you need to do that c whether you
mhm
need to do that
yeah
g of f of x
mhm
erm if you do we'll have a look at it a bit more
right
erm i think you're okay on the basic functions
you've got that
mhm
so we'd be better off spending the time on graphs
now he give me that
three posts on a building site
er let's have a look
er one right you okay on number one
i haven't even read it
er the cash price for double glazing the windows was three nine five oh
he decided to pay by hire purchase
pay a deposit of twenty percent
calculate the amount of the deposit
well i mean i know that twenty percent is twenty pound in a hundred but what's a quick way of doing it on the calculator
what is the quick formula
have you got a well there are several way of doing it but have you got er a percent button
that's one that's probably th simplest
which you don't tend to have oh you have got one there on the equal
erm what's that
shift and UNK shift and equal
mm
er let's see
one hundred plus two shift percent
is there an alt or a another funny key that you use instead of
not that one
one hundred erm maybe it'll only work with the times generally on scientific ones they don't use the percent
mm
times
something to do with a hundred times the amount isn't it
two see you've got a percent key marked there how do you get
mhm
these upper ones
oh you put it into a different mode
ah yeah
that's what you do
mhm
you put this into a different mode and it's not worth messing about with that at all
no cos it mess it up
because you put that into a different mode you can't get back to your normal mode and your UNK useless for the rest of the exam
yeah
so don't use your percent button
mhm
erm right UNK of percentages and fractions
what does four percent mean
oh four parts of a hundred
okay four percent is a fraction
mhm
four out of a hundred
that's it
simple as that
so if i said find four percent of two hundred and forty pounds
right
mhm
it's four UNK of don't forget that times is of
yeah
you don't you don't ever need to know that is pronounced times
mhm
you can always say of
yeah
three of four
three of four is twelve
three sets of four three lots of four three boxes of four
mhm
bags of four
three of four is twelve
four of three is twelve
mm
right
four UNK of two forty is the same as two forty of four UNK
mhm
doesn't matter which way you round you do it that of you can just switch them and get the same answer
which you know from your three fours and four
yeah
threes
so that's all you do
how would you do that on your calculator
er two forty times a hundred times four
no
how would you find
oh two forty over a hundred times four
right
yes
yes
you've got
are you okay multiplying fractions
of ing fractions
yeah
yeah
er not a UNK
not a hun
not brilliant no
not a hundred percent that's
yeah
a fraction so you must have some idea of fractions
right
easiest thing to do with fractions is to multiply them
mhm
it's the easiest thing to do
cos you do what you think you're UNK you know what you'd expect
yeah
is you just multiply the two top ones together
yeah
right
and you multiply
yeah
the two bottom ones together
right so that's
so what's have a guess what would be erm
so nine hundred it works out at nine pound odd
what would two thirds of three quarters come to roughly
just sort of thinking about it having a guess
a half
how did you get that
did you work it out here
no it just seemed to spring to mind
okay what would three quarters of two thirds be
three quarters of two thirds be a half
right
are you happy with that
yeah
yeah
okay
just have a quick look at it
in real life instead of UNK on bits of paper
right if we multiply that up it would come out to a half
yeah
wouldn't it
but i never it just seemed to click as a
what are we doing
erm two thirds of three quarters or three quarters of two thirds
right
so how much is there
er three quarters
how big is that
that's a third
right and that's also a third
it doesn't look it cos it's
mm
it's a s different colour but it is the same size as that
mhm
so we've got two thirds there
yeah
what would a quarter of that look like
if you shared that two thirds out UNK between four people
mm
how much would they get each
about that
great
if you shared out that two thirds right that's
yeah
one piece there two thirds
share that out between four people how much would they get each
er one of these
one of these
okay
mhm
so that's one quarter
mhm
so three quarters would be three pieces like this
mhm
it would be one two three
yeah
that's the half
mm
okay
now what's two thirds of three quarters
here's your three quarters
what would one third of this be
if we shared that three quarters equally between three people how much would they get
between three people
mhm
they'd get erm let's see they'd get that
right
so they'd get they'd get that much
mm
that's one third of three quarters
so two thirds of three quarters would be two pieces like that
mhm
okay
one two
which is a half
mhm
so it does work out
yeah
it always works out with fractions
it's the easiest thing to do with them
multiply one by the other
mhm
leave them there
but it's all this is okay but it sort of makes your brain UNK after a bit and to just see something real that relates to it it's makes it stick in your
yeah
mind
mm
so any number divided by one is just the same number so if we
yeah
so if we got two four o multiplied by four equal to so what it is nine sixty
don't need to do the equals you can go straight on to the divide by a hundred
and if we divide that by one nought and then we do the equals it becomes nine point six
right
okay
good
i say i thought it was about nine pound odd
right
so
so the formula
to calculate what erm
percentage
p percent if you like
well
mhm
we wo won't use x
p percent of thirty five pounds that's thirty five times p over a hundred
yeah
that's it
yeah
good
that works so if you want a twenty
mhm
percent it's thirty five times twenty and divide by a hundred
mhm
some of them you might do in your head like you think well i know twenty percent is one fifth so i'll just divide that by five and that's seven pounds
mhm
erm so you can do that you can work out total payments and subtract that and what it should have been
what about number two
let's see erm the diagram above represents a UNK lawn fifteen by ten with a circular flower bed diameter six
taking pi as three er taking pi as three calculate the area of the UNK
area of a circle is pi r squared
so it's three times the radius squared
mhm
yeah
so calculate the area of the UNK
okay
er so the flower bed has a diameter of six metres
so the radius is three metres
right
so pi is three times three squared
right
okay
well
yeah
three squared is nine so it's three UNK which is twenty seven
right
okay twenty seven square metres
mhm
and then what about b
please calculate the area of lawn remaining
so we have to take away twenty seven metres
square m
all the way round
yeah
is the UNK
area is the short one
that's not all the way round that's just multiplying one by the other
mhm
okay
that gives you a the length by the UNK or if you're working out er painting a ceiling or something
mm
length by the UNK to work out how may square metres then you have a look on the can one can will cover thirty square metres or whatever
mm
okay
so that's okay
so you shouldn't be having any problem with those anyway
in the diagram a UNK each side of length three centimetres put x in inside
given that x is less than three centimetres from here mm indicate the region in which x must lie
mm
now any of these geometry ones have a look if you can't get it very quickly just leave it
yeah
erm you can come back to it at the end if you've done everything else but there's something about these that er i think you're one
erm some people get UNK on geometry and they i'm gonna get this one if it kills me
yeah
it doesn't kill you but it means you spend an hour on it when you could be doing the rest of your exam
yeah
it doesn't help
yeah
okay
er what they're saying is p q p going round this way p q r s is a UNK
what does it mean a UNK
that's the name of that shape
yeah
yeah
cos i've not come across that
okay
i have seen that shape but not called a UNK but each side of length is three centimetres
so three six
they will
twelve
each of those is three alright
twelve centimetres
for the whole thing
the UNK would be twelve centimetres
yeah
yeah
a point x lies inside the UNK
it is given that x is less than three centimetres from p
right
yeah right
and that the distance p x is greater than the distance r x
right
so it's got to be down here
indicate clearly by UNK it the diagram the region in which k must lie down here
clearly shade in the diagram
is that worth about
a point at x lies inside the UNK
it's given x is less than three centimetres from p
so it means it's not ah so it means it's got to be up the top end
but you just said it's down the bottom end
i did
but i'm reading it again
mhm
and it says it's given that x is less than three centimetres from p
well these are three centimetres long
right
so if it's less than three centimetres from p it's got to be up this end
and that the distance p x UNK greater than the distance r x
well that does throw me because then
right
yeah
because it's like equal distances
okay
right
so you get to that stage and you think forget this
mm
right
right
how many marks for it
not many
there wouldn't be many for that
mm
and you could waste an awful lot of time on it
wh what was the answer for that
well i think i'll leave you that one
erm
are you taking the UNK
i'll give you i give you a clue
shall i give you a clue
er
no
it's geometry question what sort of things do you normally use with when you're doing geometry
like pi and stuff like that
you know
mm
what sort of instrument did you normally use
a protractor
yeah
anything else
UNK
that's more like it
mm
erm nearly all of these geometry questions
yeah
wh where there're UNK a UNK comes into it
so don't spend much time on that
cos
mm
you've got lots of other work in this that you should be doing
yeah
right
but if you're really absolutely UNK off then give yourself am maximum of five minutes on that
mhm
and then leave it and go and do something else
yeah
and it'll probably come to you
but erm don't get stuck on those in the exam
right
if you can't do it right away leave it
mhm
right
student asks thirty people how long it had taken them and you draw a frequency table which you've just been doing there
mhm
okay
so that should be okay
that would be a good one for you to try on your own
yeah
erm right i would say just leave that
just forget it
yeah
just forget that sort of problem altogether
mhm
because you can really get stuck on them
yeah
that you'll get you can pretty much guarantee you'll get one and it'll be almost the same as that
there'll be different numbers it won't be a football match it might be weights of pizzas it might be the length to french sticks you know it could be anything
but
yeah
it'll be very similar to that
same technique
i think you'll also get something like this
using the root which is not drawn to scale write down the reading running up there running up there running up there giving the total
find the numbers of litre petrol
now you should be able to do that one
mhm
completely on your own
so this i this is a good thing to work through this one
now look
a field is in the shape of a UNK
use the scale one to ten
make an accurate drawing now if you get one like this
mm
like six and you will usually get one of these on do an accurate scale drawing then go for that
yeah
they tell you what to do an accurate scale drawing
they will often tell you what scale to use as well
which they do here
and then all you have to do is measure off something a UNK or
mhm
how far is this one from that
and put your answer in
if your diagram is pretty reasonable you'll get most of the mark
erm if your UNK pretty reasonable and you measure the wrong thing you can still get quite a lot of the marks
mm
so it's a and it doesn't take all day
it's a good one
yeah
so it's a good one to go for
yeah
right
now probability
if you don't understand it just leave it
yeah
this was the
erm
tree thing isn't it
yeah
erm write the appropriate UNK on the branches of the tree diagram
and we'll have a quick glance at that now
see what you make of it
three blue and one red
and two draws are made at random in each case
draw one a UNK is taken from bag a
and it's put in bag b
well bag a
i think that's a bit nasty that
yeah
bag a contains three blue UNK
mhm
and one red UNK
bag b contains three blue UNK and three red UNK
two draws are made draw one a UNK is taken from bag a and put in bag b
right
a UNK is taken from bag b
write the appropriate probability on the branches of the tree diagram
draw one
and they won't be giving you a lot of marks for that i don't
mm
think
erm i think that's slightly tricky
it's unusual
yeah
erm
i mean you're UNK er to me you'd there's more chance of you getting a blue UNK out
well we're not UNK too bothered about is there more chance or less chance
we want to know exactly
mm
exactly how much chance
erm this is this is real this stuff
this is
mm
erm not you know silly UNK it's probability is based on it's to do with UNK
mm
it's all about getting your money
now there was a bloke called UNK de UNK
who was
sounds french
he wrote to UNK
was it UNK
er yes
UNK
erm who was a UNK a very brilliant UNK
erm saying i've got this UNK problem i don't know whether how much it's worth betting on this
you're a UNK
mm
you work it out for him
for me
and he more or less laid down the whole theory of probability in a few days UNK
yeah
did
erm in the letters that he wrote to this bloke
who then went on to win quite a lot of money cos he could
yeah
he knew what the odds were and everyone else didn't
erm let's say
a pack of cards
you draw four cards out one after the other
mm
okay
now it's gonna cost you a pound to play this game
okay
if you get four UNK out we make sure it's a fresh deck of cards and everything else and nothing's fixed
mm
if those cards that you get are four UNK i'll give you a thousand
okay a thousand pound
if they're not then i get your pound
do you want to play
no
would you know would you play that
yeah
i'd probably i'd have a go
yeah
you'd have a go
mm
okay
well
probably lose me pound like but i'd have a go
you'd probably lose more than that
mm
cos you'd keep having ah it's only another pound
you've got fifty off me
yeah
so far i'll have another go to try and get
mm
that thousand
well you'd need about nearly round about a million goes
mm
you'd think something like three chances in a million of getting four UNK
so if someone had come up to you and said well look you bet three pound to have a go and if you get a four UNK i'll give you a million pound then it's worth it
that's a that's a reasonable that's a fair balanced
mm
deal
that's okay
but usually it's very much loaded in favour in favour of the UNK
yeah
the person who's offering you the game and he knows the odds
mm
you don't
you just think ooh thousand to one that sounds good odds
can't get much better than that
no
but he should be giving you a million to three
yeah
which is a lot more
so we want to know exactly what the odds are on this one
a blue one or a red one
draw one
what are the odds
red
i like writing them writing them on the UNK like that
that's a red one and that's a blue one
right
draw one it's from bag a
bag a has got three blue and one red
yeah
start off here with three blue and one red
mhm
what's the chances of getting a red what's the chances of getting a blue
well there's one chance of getting a red
and there's three chances
well mark the UNK on here
where they've put the
oh right
right
three blue one red
now this looks like a good game to bet on because a probability of one is an absolute certainty
a probability of three is just totally UNK of
mm
you can't have a probability of greater than one
yeah
so this isn't the probability
what's the chances of getting a red
the chances of getting a red
there's one chance
one chance in a million
one chance in three
one chance in
four
right
so the chance of getting a red is one in four
ah
the chance of getting a blue
is three in four
and the chance of getting either a red or a blue if i say here you are i'm gonna you've got this bag and it's got three blue and one red in it
and i'm gonna pick one at random and i'm gonna have this bet with you that i will get either a red or a blue
and what odds are you gonna are you gonna play
yeah
if you've got
there's the bag has got three blue and one red in it
yeah
i'm gonna take one out without looking
mhm
and i'm gonna bet you that i'll either get a red one or a blue one
mm
now i'll pay you ten pounds to play this game and i only want a pound if i win
yeah
i'd play it but it's possible that the red one will go when you take it out
and there'll only be blue left
well it's a certainty that i'll get either a red or a blue
yeah
right
mhm
cos there's only a red or a blue in there so if i
that's right yeah
if i say i'll bet you i'll get either a red or a blue
mhm
yeah
i'm onto a good i can't lose
yeah
so i'll just keep UNK it in won't i
mm
because we add up the UNK to find out the chances of getting that or that
we get three quarters add a quarter
one
which is one
a probability of one is an absolute certainty
mhm
one out of one
a hundred times out of a hundred a million times out of a million
yeah
cos probability is always expressed as a fraction
right
now this is where the tricky bit comes in
whatever one we get goes into the next bag
mhm
so if we did get three out of four chances we get a blue
yeah
if we get a blue one we put it in the bag and what would the bag UNK what would the second bag contain now
bag b it had got three blue and three red so it's now going to have four blue and three red
okay
mhm
looking at this one if we pulled a red one out of bag a and put it into bag b bag b would now have three blue and four red
take that one next as we're down here
blue at the top
now what's the chance of getting a blue
how many are there in the bag
three
and four red
four red
so what's the chances of getting a blue one
three in seven
that's it
three out of seven
and the chances of getting a red
four out of seven
four out of seven
okay
mhm
going back to the beginning again
three blues on red
UNK likely three times out of four it'll be a blue
we put it in the second bag and that's now four blue and three red
so the chance of getting
a blue is
four out of seven
four out of seven
and the chance of getting a red
three out of seven
down here
three out of seven
okay
right
what's the chance of getting either a blue or a red
on this on this pick
erm
four UNK add three UNK how many UNK is that
seven UNK are one
which is one
so it's a certainty that we get a blue or red
yeah
it's just a check that we've got that covered
mhm
that we have got the right UNK
yeah
same down here three UNK add four UNK that's okay
now what's the chance that we'll get a blue out of the first bag and a blue out of the second bag
erm three and four and four and seven so it's
what do you mean by three and four and four and seven
i was gonna add them up to see how
were you
yeah
what happens if i added erm an eighth to three quarters
would the three quarters get bigger or less
bigger or smaller
bigger
so you're saying there's more chance of getting the blue out of out of the second than there is of just
mhm
right and your next one if you put it back is four out of fifty two
and the next one four out of fifty two
so you're saying the chances of getting four UNK provided you put it back each time and UNK them again would be sixteen out of fifty two
mm yeah
no
your o your chances aren't getting better they're getting a lot worse
mhm
aren't they
mhm
with each UNK
yeah
each other unlikely event that's got to happen
there's a good chance we won't even be there
mhm
we won't there's a good chance we don't even get the first blue
yeah
so having got it it's not a certainty that we'll get the next one
we've got to combine these two UNK by multiplying them
mhm
so the chance of getting here is three quarters times four UNK
okay
yeah
which will come to three UNK
the chance of getting here is three quarters times three UNK
now might as well leave them as twenty UNK
so UNK nine twenty UNK there
mhm
twelve twenty UNK up here
this one the chance of coming down this way was a quarter
we can only start off from here
mhm
if we've come down there
and most of the time we won't
we will have gone up there three times out of four
yeah
so to even get a chance of picking a blue after we've had a red
mhm
only that'll one happen one time in four on there
so this is going to be a quarter times three UNK
mhm
and that's going to come to three out of twenty eight
and this one will be what
where one quarter times four UNK
that's it
four over twenty eight
and they what do they add up to
four and three is seven
seven
and twelve is nineteen
so it's six sixteen plus twelve
and nine
twenty eight
right
okay
yeah
twenty eight twenty UNK is one
that's right
right
it means we've covered them all and we've got the probability correct
twelve and nine twenty one twenty four twenty eight out of twenty eight
if we'd have added them
mm
the way you wanted to do and then we added all this lot up we'd find well w the chance is more than a certainty
more than one that we'd finish up there
and very much more than one that one of these would happen
at each stage in your tree UNK
yeah
if you add them up they should come to one
when you work out the probability of arriving at that point
so if we call that point blue red and we call this one here blue
right
that's a blue followed by a blue
and this one is a blue followed by a red a red followed by a blue
and a red followed by a red
that's r
okay
yeah
erm that's a q sorry that's a quick look at it
now the reason this is a bit messy is that at that stage depended on which one you get out of here you putting in the second bag
erm i haven't seen one before like that at this level
yeah
he may be giving us harder papers just to
i suspect that you don't that you don't ne yeah
i think he is
as he UNK up
i think you don't need that bit
erm try it again
do it yourself that one
mhm
but don't when you've made your draw
yeah
don't bother putting the ball in the next bag in bag b
bag b's got three blue and three red
just leave it like that
mhm
when you've drawn the first one just put it back in the first bag and forget about it and go on
and see how you work your tree out
yeah
okay
that's erm
but you need you need to be practising a lot of things now
mm
a lot
erm right
using the distances and bearings draw a scale diagram and measure things
good one to go for
mhm
you should get full marks on that and on that other one
yeah
they're good ones to go for
that one no way
you know
yeah
you can really get tied up in it and you and i'll just try this now
i know i've been a long time on this but i'll i think it's nearly there
yeah
they can be nearly there for an hour and a half
mm
and you keep oh yeah i'll just no
yeah
just leave it
leave it
and what's mrs pink doing
alright again this is the same sort of thing you get
average speed before the car broke down
average speed between then and then
the length of the time that she spent in cambridge
that's a good one to look at
er now he's get UNK and UNK and UNK on this
so that's midlands and southern and northern
that was a northern was it
what does he mean by that
northern paper
oh right
northern paper southern paper midlands paper
oh yeah
erm okay
yeah i think i think have a go at those you should be able to
you should be able to do all of those
i would le definitely leave that
mhm
there won't be a lot of marks on it
yeah
so you can really just you know
mm
you can just throw the exam away getting stuck
yeah
on one of those
erm bearing you should be fine on that and on that
now drawing graphs of functions
have you done inequalities
less x is less than or equal to six
no
no
cos that is definitely on erm
mm
you've done drawing graphs of er y equals
done UNK
y equals two x minus three
things like that
draw a graph of that
no
no
doesn't ring a bell no
not a graph of it no
you have you has he done any drawing graphs
yeah he's done some graph work
erm
yeah
yeah
you'll be given a function like given in that form y equals some function of x
and then draw a graph
there's some sort of graphs here
i d oh these
quick look at that one
yeah this is it
yeah
draw a graph of that equals that for that
no
okay
is that a UNK
no
no
no
let's have a look
no
it's just a graph of a function which happens to be a straight line
erm
my lines i think i've possibly got them
mm
yes
i think so
yeah
i wouldn't have said wrong but not correct
so x is minus one
four x plus one is minus three
one and five okay those points are right
so putting those on the graph you've got minus one minus three
minus one right one point should be here
mhm
you've got nought one which is there
okay
i'll just put a ring in pencil round the ones that are okay
nought one that's okay
y equals three x plus five okay
and you're doing y equals four x plus one
oh i see
yeah
but erm
they're
mm
this one this minus one three just isn't shown anywhere
yeah
minus one minus three doesn't even go down to minus two
yeah
i d i didn't actually complete this
no
okay
in fact i i've got a feeling this may
erm
have been written down to actually do
mm
on UNK separate pieces of graph paper
yeah
that's what i th or well what i was just about to suggest
it would be well worth you doing that because they give you can almost guarantee a question on graphs
they'll give you some
mm
nice standard functions like this that you can feel at home with
yeah
and draw your graph
erm let's see
if you've got any different use two colours there how many have you got
one two and three yeah
i would do them on separate ones
erm if you haven't got graph paper erm pick a bit of s squared paper
mhm
just a normal sort of squared exercise book
i haven't got any with me and i was just looking at graphs for someone else earlier
yeah
erm that's i mean i would really recommend that you make the time
yeah
it's getting
to do that
it's getting very close and you've got an awful lot to do
mm
you've got a tremendous amount to for you not for me to go through with you
mm
but just for you to do on what we've done so far
mm
to UNK that before we can move on really
yeah
yeah erm
erm
i can't find time for you
yeah
you you'll have to make the time somewhere
mm
pinch the times from something
erm to do cos you're gonna you're gonna be struggling if you
mm
if you can't do a lot more work
yeah
er how d how do you feel you're doing with the maths
erm well i feel i like you say i can do with more sitting down and doing it myself so it UNK in
mm
you could do with a lot a lot more
a lot more exercises
mm
and a lot more because otherwise you're gonna come to that exam you're gonna sit down and you're gonna say oh i did something a bit like this with john i remember that
i understood it at the time
yeah
it's gone now
cos you haven't done it yourself
yeah
on your own several times to practise it to shake it up and down get all the bits out of it
mm
and sort of store it away
yeah
where you can just pull it in
you think yeah i know what i'm doing with this
completely in control of it
yeah
okay
yeah
erm
what more can i say
well
you need
i'll
to you need to have a good go at these
go through that paper and
mhm
erm and do those graphs
yeah
and i'll have a good read of this and try and write down things that i've got a block about i mean
do more writing and trying things and reading at the moment
mhm
you can catch up on the i mean you can do those graphs without reading anything else about it
yeah
do one on each sheet of paper
erm UNK might have some graph paper
i've got gr i've got graph paper
right
yeah
okay
great well use on sheet for each
yeah
and do some graphs on that
cos we've got really we've got a lot more that i'd like to cover
yeah
erm we've only had a UNK really of probability
mhm
you can guarantee there'll be one question on that
yeah
erm you could probably do with UNK the statistics bit
erm you should also be practising UNK equations
mhm
changing the subject of UNK of an equation
yeah
yeah
if i give you something like now can you remember how to do that sort of thing
that's
make r the subject
call that three
two erm make y the subject
so that you get y equals something
and again there
r equals something
now in that one erm one this is the easiest one i thought well better give you some easier ones so you can work into that
mhm
erm and make x the subject of that
x equals okay
no
have a go at that one first and work up that way how's that sound
there's more work in doing these but you should be sort of practising equations all the time
yeah
erm doing awkward ones that have got fractions in
so that you're keeping up with the fractions
doing ones that have got percentages in
doing ones that have got maybe a mixture of percentages
i mean it was a couple of years ago a favourite question things like erm what's twenty five percent of a quarter
mhm
er how would you go about that
what's twenty five percent of a quarter
a quarter of a quarter
right good okay and what will that come to
a quarter once one is one
a quarter of a quarter
dunno
one times one
one
one
sixteen
four times don't forget four times
yeah
er very UNK to add them
mhm
especially when you'd rather work with UNK than UNK
yeah
okay
yeah
it's all this sort of the bias that you've got through how you've worked things and fiddle about with UNK
erm when you once y once you've got out of the habit of UNK and thirty seconds and things like that you find that i mean we found the other week didn't you that you were thinking oh these millimetres a bit of a pain
he was much
yeah
happier when it was back in the old feet and inches
mm
but if you try and go back to it when you haven't done it for years you realize how complicated it was
yeah
with the yards feet and especially all the how many yards in a UNK and
mm
a chain and mile and
yeah
then UNK mile and everything else
mm
it's er it's a pain
that's a paper
never mind
that's paper
yeah
that one was for how old is er is that yours
no
oh that's probability it's where it starts
functions didn't we
yeah
and again these UNK i mean my excuse is they're supposed to be like that but these won't mean a thing
mhm
in maybe two or three days time
yeah
but in a d within the next day or so perhaps over the weekend if you can make your notes about what this was put it in your own words what was happening here
what does f of g of x mean
erm just put a tiny note on it
erm you were all right on those
mm
i would ask him about that
yeah
ask him if you need to know f of g of x and g of f of x
mhm
i mean i f i feel that you do
but it wasn't there
yeah
on that syllabus that i've just looked at so
mhm
don't want to load you up with
yeah
more stuff if it's not on your syllabus
right
so that one should be
UNK
how do you feel about it
mm er not too bad but i feel you know i need to
you really
i need to work on it
you really do i mean and what's the last time
it's remembering the formulas and stuff that's er is the is the major thing because i know like in the class i've not actually had a lesson where i've done bad
but it's memory of er
if you just have that one lesson and he explains it to your properly and he sets you some exercises on what you've just done half an hour or an hour ago you'll get through them
mm
but if he gives you the s exactly the same numbers even same exercise same number
yeah
if he gives you
yeah
a month later you wouldn't know where to start
yeah
unless
time from somewhere and just had i mean five or six goes an the same sort of question until you get to the stage where you just go oh yeah okay
bang
mm
and then you've got to the stage where you don't need to
i mean you know with other jobs that you do when you need to practise it and when you don't
yeah
erm if you've got something complicated to wire up or something
mm
or work out what i'm doing here maybe make a little few little notes to yourself
mm
i must do that bit and that before that
and make sure this bit is UNK but that mustn't be UNK and
yeah
you do that same job half a dozen times
mm
in the end you're just UNK through it you're thinking about what you're having for your tea
and you're talking to your mate and it's all just happening by magic
mm
yeah
and you're not really concentrating very much at all
but it only comes with practice and it's
yeah
exactly the same with this
mm
it will you know you see it done once and do it once yourself
you think right i've got it
come the exam you will be kicking yourself
yeah
cos you'll think i did one of these when was it
mm
oh a couple of months ago i did one of these now er how do i get into it
where do i start
yeah
what's the trick on this one
hey
so
yeah
right
i don't i mean i know i i'm very busy i've got stuff that i should have done months and months ago that i haven't got round to doing yet cos there's been all sort of interruptions
so er but i'm the one who suffers cos i'm not getting round doing it
yeah
so i can't you know can't advise you
mm
in how to find time
and you really need do it
i've gone on a bit but
you do need
mm
to find yourself several hours a week
mhm
erm as well as just going to night school
yeah
so it's up to you
erm i'm you know i'm quite sure if you don't if you don't put a lot of work in then you will finish up not getting through
mm
and you just sort of have it all hanging over you and
yeah
do it again next year
so
mm
how long is there
a month and a bit
yeah
there's a bank holiday coming up now there's another one the end of may
mhm
there'll be all sort of interruptions and
yeah
there's no time at all
it's gonna fly by and very soon you'll be sort of UNK into that exam
yeah
thinking oh if only i spent a bit more time
yeah i'll find the time
okay
yeah
okay i mean it's not for
yeah
me
it's for you it's for you
no
yeah
yeah
erm cos if you don't it's then either be thinking of oh well
yeah it's a lot of effort going nowhere if i don't
exactly it's all wasted what you have put in has just gone then
yeah
and you start all over again
yeah
okay
anyway i'll better get off
and erm let you have a little
right
break from coming in from work starting on this
ten past ten again
next friday then
yeah i'll
right
how long have you been living in the flats for

what job did your husband have
oh he was in a big er whatsername in town

all i know is he's got a good
your husband like your husband when your husband was living
what about your husband

he was buying and selling
got his own car own van and had one or two working for him
mhm
mhm
and er you st see he had like this

mhm
and in the end it died
it was UNK they call it
yes
took UNK in his arm
god fo when he when he died i nearly dies and all
i tried to go away
so how do you know you lived in the flats for fifteen years
yeah
how has it actually erm varied i mean is the s is it the same are the flats the same as when you first moved in or have they changed
no far from it duck
what was it like when you first moved in
when i first moved in they were nice people
yeah
when i say nice people that well you know what's come from all the different countries from out there
can i can't mention names can i
i can't mention names
how's it yeah
so what was it like when you fir when you saying when you first came h here
it was you liked it didn't you liked it here when you first came
yeah they were all nice people
mhm
they never took causing UNK and all s that
so wh what was it in what way do you know i mean is it the about the flats themselves i mean are they are they the same or have they gone what about the flats are they are they any different to w when you first came here
you mean you mean about repairs and things
yeah that kind of thing i mean how was that UNK you first
yeah well they were all right when we first come in but eventually
mhm
th quite a lot wanted seeing to
and then they used to leave it and let us wait and this that and the other you know
but eventually they had them done
mhm
did you f did you feel did you feel safe living in the flats now
do you feel safe
or not i mean do you feel do you think you have to lock a door or
i don't
you don't think
no
did you when you first came in
i was alright when i first came in because i'm under the doctor under the h hospital at the moment
mhm
and you're frightened of every little thing
that happens
and they do happen and all
yeah what kinds of things happen that you know that make you feel unhappy
well by yourself to open the door
once i opened the door and i were knocked back and all me rent and
how long ago was that
er that's qui it was quite a while ago but it happened
mhm
yeah
we had that kind of thing
going into wh where there's only one person
and you know who was doing it
mhm
mention names
you can't mention names can you
so when it happens what happened when it UNK when that happened to you what did you do
reported it and they send him out the flats
did y did it happen did when it happened to you when this happened to you when you had things stolen from you
someone came to the door
so what who did you go to
did you get any help
yes i got help
yes
who
it was it still happened
to you
it still happened to other people and all
especially old people
old people
not people that could that can defend themselves that can what's the name of it if they could well they've broken old people's doors in and took their money and hit them and whatsername
mhm
do you so you see yourself the fact that you're living here on your own in the in the flats makes you feel more vulnerable
feel more vulnerable living in here on your own
you mean frightened
yeah i think yeah
yes
they take them in and that's it
mhm
got all these
do you think yeah
do you think it's do you think what do you think of the flats to live you know as a senior citizen do you think it's suitable for senior citizens to live in the flats
do you think it's a good place for senior citizens to live these flats
yes
if they didn't take the wrong people in at the end
if they didn't
take the wrong people in the whatsername
mhm
so what kind of people live here that we what's made it go you said that it's got one of the s what are the kind of things that go on now that wo didn't go on before
well tried to go across the road and get a bit of shopping
well in the evening they can't do that now
they've got to stop behind the doors
they're frightened to death
bus stops going to get off
aye they're from up town
drunk
does that happen have you had that a few times is it
aye
first i took out didn't i
even when you go out at the daytime
on they're own
mm
how many t i mean er how many times has have you have you had have you had have you had problems with people you know when you told me about w that incident when someone came to the door and took your r took your rent off you
yeah
has it has it happened other times as well or
oh two or three times
what's happened
same
what's happened on the two or three times
well they go UNK around don't they
they come in your house
they get in
where they get the keys from i don't know
yeah
oh experience duck
see there was part of it you've got er you've got to have somebody with you
they change everything over don't they don't do this and they don't do that
i had a dog
and my doctor my doctor said you can't have the dog you need because you're sick on and off all the time
and it'll make you worse
and i had a cat
that was told to go out
you see what you're what you're up against
mhm
so do you know when you do you know when you erm i mean lived in the flats in the flats for fifteen years have you managed to make many friends
well as time went on
yes
these people come in and it was alright and after a little while it was the old story
yeah
i said well UNK they do it
i've got no make people unhappy and whatsername break in and take the take your food and everything
you know what i mean
so that's happened has it
oh aye

yeah
so what is it did you used to have more f er was it okay at first i mean you used to have quite a few friends when you first move in
yeah
and yet now sort of like now
i've got no friends now
is that because those people have moved out or what was the reason
