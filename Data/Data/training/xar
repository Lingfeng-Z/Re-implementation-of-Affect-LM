that's what
is it the uncertainty i mean are you are you saying it's the uncertainty of what the UNK bring that's why you feel
yeah yes that's what i mean yeah
yeah that's it's just that i want to clarify that
yeah
oh it be ever so
do you what do you do you know if erm if you ever want to get to a phone to see a doctor or wh to get to a the doctor
yeah
or anyone else what do you do
how do you i mean do you

what
there's one out here one here but that one has gone duck
som did somebody else do that for you
yeah
was that a neighbour or
yes a neighbour
yes a neighbour
it might be the letter man that brings the letters
mhm
what do you feel you know the fact that quite a lot of erm well you were saying e you saying that quite a few quite a lot more coloured people live here
pardon
than when you when you first came here you said there were not many coloured people
yet now there are more
yeah
how do you fe there are more coloured people were there many UNK were there many coloured people when you first came here or just one or two or none
there were i couldn't see none
you couldn't see any at all
so how do you feel about that the fact that there are more coloured people
duck they were coming in there was some nice ones and some decent ones
yeah
you know what i mean
oh my god almighty
they used to pay the people to whatsername
mhm
when they come
they come kicking all UNK up and down
mhm
mhm
oh the messing up and the bins
yeah
mhm
but do you think that the yeah so and do you f i mean d have you managed to make any friends with coloured people on the flats at all
i that's what i've just said
they wasn't all like it
yes you've some you found some
yeah
yes
there is nice ones
mhm
but there're some UNK as well
mhm
they wouldn't stop and think
mhm
during the period you've lived in the flats have you found noise a problem or not
has it been noisy or not
noisy
noisy
it has
yes as time went along
what kind of well what kind of noise do you mean
er singing falling out breaking windows fighting
with their wives and things
mhm
yes
you know the fact that what do you feel about you know the fact that s there some girls you know that work as UNK locally

out there the cars comes and street walking on there
they haven't stopped it yet have they
i mean what do you feel about
the police the police
does a bit to the best of my ability but er they're there just the same
one lot get kicked er out then another lot comes
i think they should make a place for them
like they have been
you know
yeah
let them a decent place
and get them off of the streets
so you s you s you're saying so you're saying some kind of actual
yeah
so you not it it's do you say you're not actually against you don't mind er you wouldn't mind them doing what they're doing if they did it away from here
yeah
that's what you're saying somewhere actually
yes
yes a proper place
mhm
why do why do think yeah
eh
why do you think it is that you get erm that you have got quite a few girls that become UNK what do you think the reasons are for it
you see i'm not he goes either
mhm
and they go they go like that
they go like that
that's the only way i can see it
they go out
and it's oh i think it's terrible
i think it's terrible
you go h what do you feel towards the girls
that get
some of the girls UNK kicked them out and
see what i mean it's all mixed up
yeah
one or two killed on here wasn't there
do you kn erm on the subject of i know last time i came when i spoke to you that you were saying about you were saying about religion and it was and the fact that you erm go to church
about going to church

erm what do you think of the police
what kind of job do you think the do in the flats
well they're doing the best they've got them with the
walking around all night
i erm they start at six o'clock and finish at six i think
no finish about nine o'clock
yeah
that's the security

they come on y on your door and UNK you and one thing and another so there's nowt you could do
you couldn't stop them
do you think the police i mean do you think they should be
what do you think are they ke what do you think are the major problems they should be concentrating on
what are the bi what are the crimes that the police should be UNK
well you need when they do harm they
yeah what kind of things should the police what are the most i what do you think are the major problems the major crimes in the flats
that the police should be concentrating on
what are the major problems for you as a tenant
you mean now
what are the kind of things i mean is it what are the kind of things d that you think the police should be putting their efforts into stopping
stop it well they did stop it didn't they
stop what
they stopped it in the end didn't they
stopped what are you t
stopped them from what in our flats
they stopped them
did they
they went ar they went around all the houses

the UNK and the UNK they've all gone together
oh dear
you didn't know whether you didn't know whether you got day or night
frightened to go out and do a bit of shopping
was that was that during the riot
what you said that what you said about the UNK was that is that what you're talking about the UNK the worry
is that what you're talking about now when you're saying about the about erm you didn't know what to about being frightened you've said a few times
yeah
was it during the UNK that you
yeah
yeah
yeah
i were coming home one day with the with the with me shopping
and took the bag out of me hands
and me other bag with me money in
course i'd never carry that bag again
how long ago was that
oh it's not all that long ago duck
that woman at the corner was she has her bag pinched often
mhm
so do you think you do you think the police do a lot er do enough to help you with those type of problems
oh yeah
they do
they do their best
do their best
they go through hell and fire with you
yeah they do
what do you think about th yeah
pardon
what do you think about the government
do you think the what do you think of the government
no i tell you what i think about the UNK government
yeah
it's no good since margaret thatcher go in
mhm
what has it what has it what ways are you critical
what do you think
well for a start they're all
for a start
they got no putting a bit of best clothes on and having a good time breaking in people's houses and one thing and another
they've got no money
they've got no jobs
they they'll wa going around hungry
well that's my UNK
mhm
do you v well do you vote at elections
yeah
i do vote
so how do you think yo how do you think you'll do you think you
i don't i don't whatsername for all
you mean
i get i get out of it
mhm
i don't she'd be brought in any more
so who would
she's all for the p she's all for the UNK
er money people
people who've got money she's all she'll look after them but she's not looking after them blokes
now
mhm
so how do you think you'll vote when it comes to the election
i'll vote for the right person won't i
mhm
so you so you wouldn't UNK so what you're saying is UNK
mhm
erm
so erm when did you live in the flats
erm i lived in the flats from christmas eighty three till september eighty five
mhm
and erm in addition you've you're a social worker
i am a social worker
and you and you've erm through your work as a social worker you've had some contact with people in the flats
that's right
i've erm contacted them through living there and working with them as well
mhm
and in addition to that am i right in saying for thirty years you've been a UNK
i've been a UNK for thirty years
mhm
yes
erm whereabouts erm were you born
i was born in scotland
in scotland what part
in the west of scotland just between edinburgh and glasgow
yes and erm i came down here erm just at the time i was becoming a UNK thirty odd years ago
so have you got have you got any brothers and sisters
i have one erm a sister and one brother both married with families in scotland still
so i still go back
to visit them
what about erm the occupation of you parents
er well my mother is a cook and
mhm
my father is a mi sorry he wasn't a miner
he was a miner for a very short time
erm but then he couldn't take and he moved into the steel works
so he he's worked in steel work for a long time
till he retired
what kind of education had when did you when did you leave sc
erm yeah i attended the grammar school
yeah
in scotland and erm it was called the senior secondary then
and erm i er did my scottish higher leaving certificate
and erm then after erm i had done my training as UNK i did teacher training and i taught for twenty years before becoming a social worker
how what kind of a prior to living on the flats erm what kind of accommodation have you lived in
erm well i i've lived always in sort of traditional UNK which are generally
mhm
erm sort of detached houses or er rather big properties somewhere or other
erm but prior to coming to er live in the flats i lived on road in erm next door to a mother and baby home
and i worked in the mother and baby home
so that was just like an ordinary
mhm
detached house on the main road in
so how does the accommodation erm you've been in prior to flats contrast with erm living on the flats
erm it was a complete contrast
erm it couldn't be more different actually
er you know living er so close to neighbours and people you know in so it tended to be in other places where i've lived that you didn't see people very often at least you didn't speak to your close neighbours very often and erm in the flats you know i found that they were right in the midst of it
okay
what was your motivation behind living in the flats
the i know you
erm well it really UNK out of my work in the mother and baby
yes
home
er several of the girls who had been in the mother and baby home were housed in the flats
and we had to help them to move and you know help them to move their things and really i saw the kind of difficulties the girls would be living under
and i felt that they did need some kind of ongoing support
and also i used to notice that there were quite a lot of em empty window you know in the flats and erm you know i just got a feeling that this was really where i found that i would be able to work or that i wanted to work
so from there i mentioned it to our UNK who's the i the one who's in charge of us all in this er area
and erm that i would like to live in the flats and she just said why don't you
and erm i asked around to see if anyone else was interested in doing the same kind of thing
and another sister said she would be happy to join me in that
and so i approached erm mr at street
but i wrote in and i was asked to see mr
and erm you know and i had a letter then from mr saying that they would consider us for a place in the flats
and erm after about six or eight months we were given a place off walk
having lived there f for a few years erm how did it contrast with what you actually expected
how did it with your original expectations
well i think having erm had some contact
yes
in the flats
mhm
and also when girls moved in i would visit them in the flats
yes
and erm they came back and visited the mother and baby home too
so i knew the kind of complaints they had about the flats
and erm and so i was familiar with the kind of things erm that we expected
and well you know things like the noise of the blues parties and things like that were a great UNK
i came in knowing that was going to happen so erm yo i think also i had the freedom that i had chosen to live there and i think that made erm the difference
i put up with it then knowing that i had chosen it
and erm also but i was glad to experience the kind of things that people who were living in the flats without choice had to experience
mhm
am i right in saying that one of one of your UNK behind living in the flats was the fact that erm the contact with people on the flats and you felt erm that it would help you erm
that's right
if you actually went through the experience that they themselves were
that's right
it would help me and er it would give me a greater understanding
mhm
erm having actually experience that way of you know having to live
and that was and that was something that was achieved ha having lived there a few years you think
well i don't think it was achieved because i mean it's there's always
yeah
something i mean we moved out of the flats partly because the flats were coming down
yeah
and partly because i had to have an operation which meant that it wouldn't be easy for me to live in the flats any longer
and it just seemed that was the time to give up the UNK
but i would hope i mean it has given me the wish to go on living in a similar kind of situation
so a actually living on the flats erm did that ha did that have any impact for your actual life itself compared to other places you've lived
yes it erm it certainly did
erm i because the people that w we were we near to the people and more accessible to them
yeah
i think they felt happier in coming to visit us
and i certainly think that they felt more comfortable coming to our flat than they would have felt coming to a big private house somewhere
mhm
or other
and in that way i felt that i was closer to people
mhm
so i'm right in saying you had an open house in which people could
that's right
tenants in the flats could come in and
yes er we just
talk
yeah er you know we had an understanding that if erm because there were times when we wanted to just have some time together or to pray together and erm you know people who did come in and out to the flats we erm told them that if th we were in and we didn't answer the door it was actually because we were either doing something that we couldn't come
and er the people just accepted that and they didn't keep them from coming because at most of the time er the
mhm
house would be open even late at night or erm you know early in the morning if necessary people could come
mhm
how many people did you in your er in your time on the flats how many people do you think have visited at some time
oh
aye
yeah aye
er we never kept account of anything but
i mean some evenings it would be quite quiet and maybe just the next door neighbour
yeah
would be in or erm you know maybe in the course of the evening or just the afternoon we'd have had two or three people called
i remember one evening we went up to bed and my head was just spinning because we'd had about ten people had come in some of them UNK and some had you know but i'd say at one stage we had about seven people in the flat together
erm and although it was erm you know it was good and the people themselves enjoyed talking to each other as well it was a bit UNK at the end of the day
but er y you know that kind of thing erm we always hoped and felt was good
mhm
what happened say on sundays and erm and during religious holidays did you get
well on sundays i mean we went to church in the
church yeah
the local church
and erm it was just the same as any other day
mhm
occasionally we had to go away to one of our other UNK for meetings
but if we were there it was just the same
erm but the door would be open for anybody who
mhm
wanted to come
and what k what kind of response did you have erm from erm tenants of the flats i mean how did you were people generally friendly
they w oh yes
erm you know any anyone we met and spoke to i think some people held us in some kind of suspicion but a lot of people were glad er to have the er you know have the company and erm that were available to them
i thi i mean there were quite a number of people i would say on the flats that we didn't make contact with at all
mhm
i don't th i think when we spoke last week erm referred to the fact that er ethnic UNK erm
that's right
especially erm among the er the young UNK
now with the older west indian people we would have you know a passing sort of conversations and i know a couple of them came to help to get me to help them to fill in d h s forms and things like that
erm or i mean you know for advice about what they could do about d h s
they came to the house to do that
but with the younger erm west indians i didn't feel that we just didn't seem to be able to find an approach
and er part of it i think was because during the daytime you didn't see them very much and at nighttime y you know they would be obviously around erm going to blues parties and things like that
but it just didn't seem to be a time when you could er get an entry
you know so it was something that erm i didn't really feel that we did
mhm
what do f er moving on to look at the image that the flats have erm bad publicity the flats
mm
have had in the media
erm how fair do you think it is the actual th the actual coverage of the flats
well i certainly didn't find it any more dangerous living in the flats than i would have found living in
and i didn't feel any more afraid walking into the flats than i would have felt walking on the road at night you know in where i'd been before
erm also do you know like people would say things like oh you must be very brave living in the flats
we didn't feel brave at all it was just we lived there and we didn't feel under any kind of threat
and in fact one night we'd gone to bed and left the key in the door and the door UNK the key on the outside
and we came down in the morning as safe as we would have been anywhere
erm i know there had been occasion when we had people sleeping on the UNK and you know i think occasionally and but i think sometimes that was maybe somebody got home from a blues party and had too much to drink or something and they came into the warm the heat w from the downstairs flat er k comes up on the UNK and i know there was someone sleeping there
erm but i certainly never felt under any threat or any danger from people in the flats
mhm
so you so really erm you'd say that the actual image of the flats in the press and the media in general somewhat unfair
yes
yes erm well certainly from my own experience er i don't really think that erm there was as much crime or break ins or danger as there seemed to be portrayed in the
mhm
the media
mhm
what having lived on the flats erm what would you put forward as being some the good points of living there
what were the yeah the good the good points for you personally yeah
do you mean the good points for me personally
yeah
well
what did you find best about living there
er well i think the experience that i gained of the kind of erm living situation erm because i you know we UNK the same kind of difficulties
erm e even like things like UNK the bins
er i know there were complaints that people used to throw rubbish out of the windows
well it did take a bit of organization to get yourself to the end of the walk erm with your weekly rubbish or your daily rubbish to get that put away
er and you know to really see what kind of erm design what design can do to the actual living situation
erm i think too the UNK to erm our neighbours and to the people was a very good experience
and also just the whole erm general feeling of being with the people in the flats
and i think i had great UNK for the er in particular for the woman who was the erm president of the tenants association
i think she did a marvellous job in really getting public attention to the situation and to the difficulties of the flats
mhm
and er to the community worker who fight them
well i really you know felt that was a good experience to see people who were normally classed as UNK having erm that kind of strength within themselves and the power to push on and to face lots of difficulties
and er you know to face being knocked back
er very often when they were trying to do things
and to do it without a lot without a lot of support from the a from the people who actually lived in the flats although they organized things and got it going and the people living there didn't seem to be motivated to give them the kind of encouragement erm
mhm
why d why do you think why do you think it is that there wasn't that motivation
erm a lot of it was that people just accepted their situation and didn't think there was any way they were going to get anything different
i think erm maybe some of them felt it would be a waste of time fighting for it
er but obviously you know the courage and the strength of the people who did keep it going erm really has achieved a lot
they they've achieved all these people being moved out of the flats
mhm
which was only which was the key
that's right
that was what they said how to do
yeah
because they er well the flats just i weren't good enough to be erm you know UNK erm UNK or whatever
why do you think it is that erm that the reputation of the flats has been er i suppose gone off and i mean early on back in the early seventies erm the flats were quite an attractive place to come to it wasn't even that easy to get on the flats
mm
and yet gradually the reputation has gone down it's become an area in which erm basically people who haven't been able to get housing
that's right
been desperate
how is tha how is that's come about
erm well you know from my experience in the mother and baby home it seemed that even when girls didn't want to live in flats
mhm
if they didn't take the offer of the flat there was very little else they were going to get
it was either this flat or nothing
and they would take it
and i think that was the situation for a lot of people that erm if they didn't take the flat that was offered to them then they would be virtually erm either still on a long waiting list or homeless
and er so i think the kind of people who were being housed
they weren't the kind of people who could get themselves together and organized it was a more and more the bottom end of the scale and people who were actually erm you know really UNK in many ways
mhm
and so e with that the decline of the flats really erm seemed to go that way
yes
what do you think the impact is on erm you know a community such as flats when erm you know when a majority of the people in the flats are living on the poverty line or below it
how does that e affect the community
you know
it seems there's a sort of general air of UNK
mhm
erm and you know and i the thing that erm used to worry me maybe sometimes was the acceptance of this as what they should be having
and that this was the only way of life they could have
erm that probably because they'd been at the bottom so long er it didn't appear that there was
mm
gonna be much way up
mhm
so say if i said to you well if and i said to you well what could i do
what can i do
this is my situation
so how would you respond to that
i said w you know what can i do to change the situation
erm well i think erm the first thing i would probably do would be try and explain what your what the rights your rights were and what sort of benefits you were entitled to
because a lot of people didn't even know what they were entitled to
or if they were told that they couldn't get so and so that was it
so on occasions we could erm help people with that kind of thing
and i know it's difficult to get people motivated when they've been hit down and hit down so often er but and i don't think that you could do er any great erm as we said when we went into the flats we didn't go in with any big world UNK ideas of causing a revolution or you know of doing er putting on a big project or anything it was actually to be with the people in their situation and gradually to help improve somehow if we could
and you know i think that's all we could do tackle i UNK er with individuals as they came along
and i know a lot of things too with the girls who came to us we tried to erm give them er a sense of their worth as a women and not to constantly be UNK and to accept erm what their UNK did or said and so on
you know like erm maybe one of UNK say well you know i'd say well why don't you leave her with erm your boyfriend for the day and you have a day off and have a break
oh well it's my place to look after you know the child
and i'd say well if there are two parents there whether it's whether they're married or whether they're not the parents are there together it was shared equally
we would try to erm put those kind of things forward
and where ag erm either erm a young mother or even older women who didn't have a husband to support them then we would try and we had one woman coming in and saying she had six children and er her husband had gone off and her UNK hadn't been sorted out
she wanted to get the children to school and er UNK she'd no money for things for their breakfast
well they did provide her with food but also i took her up to the phone and showed her how to get in touch with d h s and explain the situation
so those kind of things we tried to do
with your with regard to erm the tenants and the contact you had with them erm would you say that you found that people tended to be supportive of each other
on in your opinion or not
do people UNK obviously there are virtually everyone at the flats was in a is in a poor situation
mm
financially
erm
erm
i would say that erm
i mean how much of a community is there in the flats
oh there isn't i wouldn't say there was a big community spirit
yeah
i would say that there are small groups of people who help each
yeah
and erm you know i i've had on occasion when there have been a couple of people in our flat we hadn't either done or said anything
i you know one woman came in distress again her husband had left her and gone off leaving rent arrears
at that time and erm she hadn't known anything about it because he had looked after the benefit and she thought he'd been paying the rent
and she came in with and it was bad enough him going off and leaving her erm without her finding this as well
and she came in and she was telling us all about it and another woman who was there she was the one who she went over and sat beside here and said oh never mind and you know we we'll get it sorted out and you're better off without him
er you know sh there were she was saying things and we were just sitting er by her watching her providing the cups of tea
erm but you know there but on occasions when people really needed help there was usually somebody erm that they could turn to
but as for er a sort of lively erm community spirit throughout the flats it wasn't very much in evidence
mm
just basically small groups that would help each other
that's right
did you have any contact with erm UNK who worked from the f from the flats or not
erm yeah we had a UNK with quite a few of them and i think they were aware of who we were
now whether they were suspicious of us because we were UNK i don't know
mhm
erm but er w we didn't have erm sort of close contacts
mhm
er with them
i know one or two of them erm now as well
yes
erm but you know we didn't actually erm we didn't have them coming
mhm
to visit us
not fr you kn from our we would door but it was open
mhm
to them as to anybody else
mhm
you're in your opinion what do you what were what were generally the motivation behind the girls becoming UNK i mean was it
i would say a lot of it is money
mhm
erm and i know one that i do know now said it's certainly she said it's only for the money i do it nothing else
mm
so it's a case of the poverty that exists within the flats
yes
erm
i think so
forcing them onto the onto the
onto the onto the street
yeah
and it was very easy for young erm young women erm who were either just on supplementary benefit or on unemployment erm to get UNK into that way of living because i mean obviously they wanted nice clothes and things like that
it was a way of getting money
mhm
look at the actual erm UNK of the flats say for bringing up children
erm how suitable would you say the flats are for bringing up children
well there's certainly not there's not much in the way of er play area for the children
there was the big UNK but that was the general er UNK for everyone
and i know like er there were lots of things kids there on roller UNK going along UNK people were shouting at them or you know trying to clear them off
erm and there was just and there was very little by the way of grass even and er you know it was towards the end of the life of the flats really that the play scheme got going
erm for the children there
but and you know like for mothers er trying to get UNK and shopping and everything up they'd either to go up stairs or down stairs
to get into their flats
and i think it caused quite a lot of hassle and difficulty for people with young children
and then the er the older ones when they were if they were sitting on the walls outside the erm deck level flats again they were either disturbing the people there or the people were out shouting at them to get away and sit on their own walls and things like that
but there was just very little erm convenience and accommodation
for either young children or teenagers
mhm
what about for the elderly the
erm well
how do you e
again probably i had kind of personal experience of that erm when i had the difficulty in walking myself
yes
erm
you know the difficulty of getting up to the flats i you know i suffered from arthritis and er you know i it was quite a UNK business to get from the ground up to our own flat
mhm
it was very UNK and actually the UNK just used to be dropping off me by the time i got into the flat
so you know i think for er people who are elderly or disabled in any way that was a difficulty too
mhm
and i think perhaps elderly people were quite afraid erm on the you know living on the on the deck level
i know we had one lady erm lived underneath us and she was really very nervous and you know erm hardly came out of her flat at all
she used to get someone else to go and do her shopping for her
because she was afraid
mhm
so did you go and to see her at erm often
yes we used to go to see her and she came up a couple of times
but even to come out of her flat and come up to us if we went down and brought her up she would come
was that due to personal experience or was it
no i think she was probably a nervous kind of person
erm as well
but you know when if a UNK of erm young people were together standing outside she would get very frightened about it
wh you know erm to look at the actual facilities that erm is in the flats erm tenants' action group
you thought they di did a pretty good job
they did they did an excellent job and it was only a small group of people erm
yeah
together
and they got the survey going and they got enough people to volunteer to go round and interviewing people living in the flats to get all the information that was required
erm they got the media to come in on it
and they really erm took on a UNK task really
and er i think they did a marvellous job
mhm
did you have any contact where a lot of times in the flats with the housing office
erm very little
only erm on occasions when we needed repairs done
mhm
when you had to keep UNK them to do it
and erm you know i know that was one difficulty that people had a long time to wait for repairs
erm as well
and er i know the housing office always had excuses that they had put the report in and we were just waiting for someone to do it
but that could be you kn quite difficult on occasions
but we didn't have erm very close contacts
how did you find the local shops erm
oh well i found was a very cheap place to live
you found it yeah
yeah
and erm we did all our shopping in the local area and at the market
here i mean
so you found the market good
mhm
yes
we found it we lived you know very cheaply
if you what say if you say erm wanted to erm buy clothes would you go
yeah we bought clothes in the
local shops as well
whatever we could get
erm a lot of the stuff you know a lot of my clothes i always make myself anyway but i you know what on the market then
what about for things i mean did you have a telephone yourself
y i think you said
we did have a telephone in the house
yeah
erm what happened you know most people in the flats hadn't got a telephone say there was an emergency
yeah
erm how much of a problem was that for tenants living on the flats
well we often had people coming and asking to use our telephone because either the telephones were erm all out of order or you could only dial for UNK
erm when we moved into the flat at first there was actually a telephone box on the deck
and just outside our place but it was often erm out of order
and i think it w was quite difficult for people because they'd either have to walk a long way to try and make a telephone call
if their UNK didn't come erm the only way of contacting d h s was either to go down or to walk all round until they could find a telephone to do it
cos er we quite often had people in erm asking to use the telephone to ring d h s which you know we let them do
right having lived on the er flats what did you feel about the actual setup you know the rooms the actual flats themselves
er well the a the flat that we lived in
mhm
erm i found it that it was a very pleasant layout
the living room was erm quite big
er the kitchen wasn't very big but it was good enough and then the bedrooms upstairs i certainly wouldn't have liked to live in a downstairs flat
er because i think you know the erm the bedrooms on er the bottom floor er certainly i wouldn't have liked to sleep erm in a downstairs bedroom like that
erm the t er you know i think the whole erm the layout inside was quite good
erm but things like er you could see how people would lose heart with decorating er because fairly soon after you'd UNK the ceiling and the wall erm just below the UNK and above the heater cos it was almost well it was almost completely black
and y erm you know you would get pieces of UNK and black heavy dirt dust coming out onto the furniture
erm from the heating the heating system
and so that you know could be erm very UNK when you were trying to keep things erm good
and then oh at the end when we knew we were coming out
we just didn't even bother to whitewash or to paint the ceiling again
erm but the flats themselves could be nice
i mean we didn't have any damp or anything in erm our flat but i've been in some of the downstairs ones where they were very damp
the erm you know sort of the facilities like disposal of rubbish erm and UNK were a bit difficult i found
erm and the UNK for getting rid of rubbish were just well they were just erm not practical in any way
they didn't fit the kind of er bags you put in your d your bin for a start
erm you couldn't put erm anything that was you know more than a small UNK bin size
bag in and most people had a lot more than that to put down so consequently they just dumped it if it didn't fit
so you know there were erm lots of little things like that erm in the layout of the flats which i thought weren't er well they just weren't practical
mhm
erm in your opinion er how suitable do you think the flats are for actually bringing up s a family
well they're not at all suitable really
mhm
erm because to get in to the flat they'd either to go up stairs from the deck or downstairs from the deck and to try and manage that with small children probably a UNK and shopping as well
erm and people wouldn't know what to do whether to leave the child at the bottom of the stairs and take the shopping in or to leave the shopping and have er you know er think it might go missing or something by the time they take the child and the UNK
up or down
and also there was just no proper play area for children
mhm
they played on the UNK and er were always being shouted at by residents who didn't want them er playing just in front of their places
er if they wanted to be on their roller UNK or even on their UNK then they were sort of going around the UNK
again they were disturbing people living on the either the deck level or the ground floor flats because of the noise that made
and there was no soft play area at all for children
until the play centre was actually opened and that was towards the end of the life of the flats really
mhm
erm you know
yeah why was it that it was towards the end when things were that there was finally a play centre set up ra rather than actually erm in the earlier days
have you any idea or not
well i think it was just because of the people who put the pressure on at that time perhaps people who'd been in the tenants association before didn't see that as a priority
mhm
but the er last group of tenants found that was a big priority and really pushed and worked till they you know to get it
you mean this is the present group you're talking of
yes
yes
yeah
but er i think it er may have been started with and earlier group i don't know but i know you know the certainly the final stages of the UNK were with
mhm
this presents tenants' action group
mhm
having lived on the flats how do you feel about the fact that they're going to be coming down
well i'm happy that the flats are coming down because i don't think that they're really fit places for people to live
mhm
i think there are much more pleasant ways of people living than this erm set up that they have
and erm so i'm glad that the flats are coming down
mhm
in that way
mhm
what was it about the setup that you'd be most critical of
if you had to the real
i
key reasons for the flats
i think the density
yeah
of people living in a very small area
mhm
er the w the way erm people are put in to live like that
and you know the like erm a garden or a small area in front of their own door where they can put their children to play safely
having lived on the flats erm what are you views on the actual policing of them or not
erm
oh well to be quite UNK we didn't see the police around very often
you didn't see them round
er you'd occasionally see two of them walking erm around but unless there was specific for the from for them coming erm i did see them er going into a flat
now i don't know whether they actually broke the door down in the end but they did gain entrance to a flat very near us erm and they had dogs with them that night
and that was there was quite a group of police together well with that
and there was quite a UNK at that time
erm but they seemed to be there for a specific purpose but the normal day to day
mhm
er policing of the flats i mean they weren't erm strongly in evidence
mhm
i would say
what kind of policing policy would you actually say would have been would be suited to the flats anyway
and the fact that they were they were not seen too much i mean how do y do you se do you view that erm as being a good thing or not
erm well i mean i think it depends on your own perspective
mhm
on that one
erm for me i would feel that the police having a r a low profile erm is more beneficial er and i think perhaps maybe erm the community policemen type of thing could have been helpful
erm but i you know i don't know that was a got off the ground very well
mhm
er but i think you know you've got sort of police walking around all the time erm it can UNK things rather than calm them
having lived in the flats but also erm from your experience erm both as a UNK and a social worker erm looking at flats complex
er it obviously has a lot in common with other inner city areas
erm what kind of response do you think is required to help areas such as flats
er well i think for anything erm really profitable to be h to happen a great deal of money needs to be put into it
mhm
and i think central government needs to look at the way in which inner cities are being constantly run down and erm problems highlighted and UNK because of the circumstances
and i think lots of need to be put in but i think what needs to be done is to hear that the people who are actually living in the inner city feel it is what they need
mhm
it's not just what somebody else thinks they need
UNK
so erm carrying on from where we left off erm am i right in saying that you feel that with areas such as this it's very important more money's pumped in
mhm
mhm
yeah
what areas when i say what areas i mean what mean c what erm would you like the money actually to be used on
er well i think more could be done with erm helping people who are unemployed
mhm
erm probably UNK setting up some kind of small industry erm or co UNK
i think that's needs to be looked at
and erm and i think something that er holding a community together
some ways of providing money to get resources which will erm have the kind of facilities that people want to use and where they will come together and be together
erm you know not just er something that is er created and left there it's with that erm the thing in mind that if people want to have some place where they can get together in the kind of atmosphere that they want
with something there erm of interest to them
mhm
i think that needs to be done
but certainly i think erm with young and with the unemployed that really is quite a high priority to be looked at
what are the consequences of erm present policy continues and erm areas such as this simply don't get simply don't get extra money for reductions continue to be made
mm
well what's gonna happen
is that the area will c continue to UNK
mhm
the problems will just increase and the poor and are just going to get poorer
so what are the consequences for the for areas such as this
i mean what does it mean for the actual people living here
it means that they are just going to be even poorer than they are now
erm any bit of hope that they've got erm i is going to be gradually eroded as far as i can see
and erm i think we'll be going back to the kind of erm conditions that there were in the victorian age and in UNK age
and in fact some of the erm the that you look at now could have walked out of a UNK novel
and i you know it just looks as though erm they're trying to force more and more onto the voluntary erm centres and the voluntary organizations to provide resources and to provide help
mhm
but it's not going to be the answer to the problem
how does it make you feel the fact that er the way that areas such as complex have gone downhill
how does it make you feel as a person human consequence
it makes me sad it makes me angry and erm i don't know erm what other feelings it causes in me
erm t th certainly it makes me really angry that people have to struggle for the basics and i you know i just don't see how people who are on long term benefits erm state benefits can survive without getting into serious debt
without getting into serious debt or going without erm things which are really necessary
am i right in saying that you see erm the problems of areas such as this as being extremely urgent something done now
yes
yeah
i would say that if er if the inner cities are going to be saved in anyway it's time it's past time now for things to happen
and people are either just going to be in despair or else they're going to revolt
gonna be on thing or the other
i see
how what way do you think it would
having lived on the erm complex what
erm
to the situation that people are in
well i can i can see lots of people just giving up hope and thinking there's no way that we're going to get any better
erm i think there might be a small group who would be prepared to fight
mhm
do you f you feel that erm present government erm do you feel that erm the other political parties what they're erm suggesting with their policies for the inner UNK do you think they're any better
well when it goes up to election everything is good
mhm
but afterwards er it's difficult to say
erm where whether they're any different from the ones that have gone before
erm b i mean certainly i would think that this government erm has less care for er the poor than other governments would have
mhm
because they just don't seem to be aware of the difficulties people have of living on the UNK and under the UNK
what are the things that erm in addition to extra money one of the things that you've UNK pretty strongly is involving the people themselves
yes
erm
yeah because i don't think anything will work unless it's what the people who are living in the circumstances and living in the situation erm if it's not going to relevant to their lives then you're wasting the money
mhm
you might as well hand it to them as a gift
mhm
as give them something that's not gonna be erm of use or something that they don't see
mhm
as what their needs are
mhm
how difficult do you think it wo it would be in actually involving e people in that kind of decision making
i think it's difficult
mhm
because it takes time
yeah
it takes a lot of erm energy and a lot of support
erm and er but i think it's better to take the time and provide something that is erm what is needed rather than to just go ahead and erm do something without referring to the people it concerns
mhm
and i think our own erm tenants' group here is a good example of that
that although you know erm interviewing eve if not everybody on the flats as many people as possible as to what their feelings were about the flats and so on to actually ca done all that and involved them erm in the erm what has resulted is the flats being UNK
erm that took a lot of time a lot of thought and planning
but in the end it has erm it's really paying off
and i think that's the kind of thing that needs to be done
mhm
erm i think we covered it briefly but erm covered it perhaps in slightly greater detail when we had the preliminary interview a few weeks ago
mhm
erm you spoke a erm a bit about erm other people outside p outside people and their response to the actual flats the fact that erm they saw the problems of the flats as being erm linked to the people themselves
that's right
erm it was basically their responsibility the decline rather than anything else
mhm
erm what do you feel about that
erm
have that feeling
well the feeling is a erm a great lack of understanding of what it is to actually live erm in poverty
mhm
and er you know i feel that people are only too ready to believe erm others you know er to believe er others you know er to believe the people living in the flats
and don't want to see that it's any of their responsibility at all
that people are forced to live in the flats and are forced to live in on the minimum
mhm
amount of money that is that they could get
as social work you've had quite a contact erm with people on the flats erm living in the situation they actually most people in the flats
how does what impact does that have on the actual problems that they actually
to what ex what i'm saying is to what extent has been living in the flats has contributed the life on the flats that they're in
yeah
erm well it certainly hasn't helped the problems any
yeah
erm the people who have problems erm i would think because of feeling probably the way they feel about living in the flats or about having to live in that way doesn't make them feel any UNK about erm you know any other particular difficulties that they're having
and erm i think too the sort of when you've got all people UNK together all people with problems there are very few who can help themselves and help each other
and therefore it just becomes a heavier and heavier burden
mhm
whereas if erm you know the housing policy was such that er people aren't UNK together in that way erm then people can help each other
mhm
areas can help each other
mhm
so what you're saying is that erm as most people are s such a high percentage of people in the flats have pr have erm serious problems it means it's basically th basically that all their energy goes into actually trying to
trying to survive
get by themselves survive themselves rather than being able to help others
yes i think that UNK having said the word survive there erm makes me think of if er they are actually surviving but not living
and you actually having lived in the flats you saw that erm first hand
yes
yeah
you've worked am i right in saying have you worked on the flats you'd had contact had you with people in the flats erm prior to
yes i'd had contact
erm
with people in flats since about ooh nineteen
mhm
seventy eight or so
mhm
and er
so actually seeing though first time how much of a shock did it come to you or was it just or was it expected
erm well i think you know having a th my i think my first visit to the UNK to the flat complex was a big shock
mhm
erm because i'd never actually been in the flats before
and erm come here a young girl and a baby and helping to install her in on one of the flats and just sort of e th there was something erm happened to be wrong with one of the rubbish UNK at that time and we were actually kicking our way through rubbish on the stairs erm near the UNK to get erm to come up
and i think that really erm horrified me
that this was the way people had to live
and er but erm i think my erm sort of brief contacts with coming and visiting when i actually came to live on the flats erm i knew what to expect and er and erm i wasn't i wasn't surprised at erm you know how what the living conditions were like
mhm
how did as mo as we've erm said most people in the flats actually flats actually live on erm benefits erm how di how did people get by
i mean was it e day to day living
yes
erm
i think it was it was day to day living and er which in some ways could be more expensive than if
mhm
they were able to do a bit of erm say shopping for erm a longer period
i know sometimes erm people when they got their benefit would try and do shopping for two weeks but even that was unrealistic of how long they were what they were buying was going to last for two weeks
erm and so it was sort of going to the corner shop and buying what they could er when they had the money and sometimes they would borrow money from somebody whose benefit came on a different day
and er to try and tide them over
but then again when their own benefit came that was a chunk out of it
to start with you know
and er so it really was a hand to mouth existence and going without
mhm
living on very little
and yet how successful were people in getting
some people i
yeah
think were erm well to be quite UNK i don't know how they managed to exist on it and have a little bit for the occasional treat erm or to have a packet of cigarettes or whatever
erm how they managed to survive on it erm you know you just you wonder how they can
mhm
and yet some people managed to do i yeah
because it's so little
some people managed to do that
yeah
but i think at
greater expense because they ad to go without quite a lot and especially people with children
they very seldom bought things for themselves it was spent on the children
and i know i mean er people who just went round jumble sales erm to try and get clothing for themselves
mhm
and for the children
mhm
and i'm quite sure that many of the people erm living in the flats never had anything new
they didn't have the experience of buying something nice and new for themselves
mm
i know you mentioned something erm earlier on
erm perhaps when we today about erm clothing that you managed to get together
yeah well i had erm access to quite a lot of you know quite good clothing er both children's and UNK and erm while i didn't feel that it was that people should have to depend on someone else to give them clothing erm in some ways it went against the grain to do it
but rather than see people going without erm if i had access to good clothing i didn't see why i shouldn't give it to them
erm because after all it wasn't their fault but they
mhm
they couldn't afford erm clothing
so i would erm you know quite often get bags of clothes and s we sorted them out and give them to people with erm quite large families and erm we used to also get some for the tenants' association for the jumble sales
mhm
i'd get bags of clothing and stuff for them
as well
and what was the response of people when they actually got this
well anybody that we gave it to they would be highly delighted to get it
and i mean that made you feel bad as well
er
erm you said when we left er where we left off last time about erm about people and how delighted the they were to get second hand clothing
but that's you know basically related to the situation that people were in
yeah
erm i know it's a fairly difficult question a wide question to ask for that matter but erm how do you feel with the society should erm should respond you know to in order to actually help areas such as flats
it is a very wide question alright
yes it is yeah
what are the kind of things
yes
er but certainly i mean like i mentioned before what a what areas like need is erm certainly more money being put in to actually providing the facilities
whether it's living facilities or erm for facilities for people to use er that certainly needs to be done
and i think erm as for you know what we as a sho society should be doing erm you know that's the whole economic policy erm would really have to be looked at
and erm i think too some ways of allowing people to have more power over their own lives and not just being at the mercy of agencies such as social services and erm
mhm
you know because they don't know what their right are with and you know i think places like the law centre which fight for the rights of people in you know to develop that kind of service for people
whereby erm we don't end up actually doing the things for them but we show them the way that they can do them for themselves
mhm
so how do you see the role of UNK social services erm
at the moment
yes how do you see at the moment how do you and how
well
how should it be or how is it
well
h how it is erm i think maybe first er
mhm
a lot of our erm work is i sort of the statutory things that comes to us either through care orders or through the court or through supervision of children in particular
erm so a lot of our time is done in that rather then in UNK or UNK erm work
and i know that you know that was our hope in moving into the area that we'd be able to engage local people as volunteers and you know really develop services erm in the area
but so far because of the other pressures that are on us that just hasn't been able to be followed
mhm
through
erm and i think again like what should erm we should be doing is more of the UNK type of work
mhm
so what would that actually involve
you say you're saying preventative
erm
well
what would that
erm being able to help families that erm have problems in coping with their children and so on
rather than having to remove the children from them to have more resources at our disposal to either help erm parents to develop better UNK skills or erm i mean because a lot of the problems again are from poverty a lot of the pressures are from poverty
and you know i if a UNK a child is UNK very often erm you know if it especially with you know maybe a mother who has a few children to look after and she's on her own twenty four hours a day with them
erm it is no wonder that she would UNK out at a child
you know with the and when she doesn't know where she's going to get enough money to feed UNK them and especially at a time like now when all these adverts are on television for you know the toys that children want and they just haven't the ability to provide those things for the children much as they would want to do it
mhm
how much pressure do you feel people are under in flats under to a family
i think they're under a great pressure and you know th i think it's erm you know quite amazing really that people survive as well as they do given the pressures they're that they are under
and you know sort of given the given the lack of sort of environmental helps
erm because i mean even living in can be a depressing experience in itself
sort of looking out of your window and seeing just a blank concrete wall in front of you day after day after day
erm doesn't do much to lift your spirits if you're getting up feeling a bit down in the morning
mhm
so that kind of pressure
mhm
er the pressure of erm coping with children in that kind of environment without enough money really and also erm you know things like having UNK nights because of noise and things like that and having to get up and cope
erm just the same as if you had a good nights sleep
mhm
how much of a problem had the noise been
well at times s erm you know the noise from blues parties could be really UNK
mhm
and i mean whenever there was one in the flats you could hear it probably throughout the whole complex
erm but you know when it was in a block that was fairly near you erm er i think probably children were the least affected by it because er i think they adapt to things like that more quickly
but i mean a mother that couldn't sleep all night and get up the next day having to cope with the family erm you know thing things like that they're very difficult
mhm
with regard to blues parties
mm
erm what is your attitude towards them i mean obviously something i suppose that people who actually take p who actually go see it as being a form of en enjoyment for them
yeah
erm yet at the same time UNK at the same time it's affecting other people in the actual flats so what is the solution
erm
to that
i mean do you actually stop blues parties full stop
i don't think
or do you lose them s somewhere else
yeah i think moving them somewhere else erm which would be a maybe a bit further away
mhm
erm from where people are actually living and trying to get a nights sleep
erm i know i remember i spoke to erm i said in an earl the earlier part of the
mm mhm
interview that we didn't have erm much sort of UNK with the young UNK community or the UNK community but erm you know i have spoken to one or two and i remember speaking to one who said that they had gone after a warehouse somewhere
erm i think it's somewhere down near where the road police station is now and erm you know they had been hoping to get premises down there
and something like that i thought would have been a very good solution
mhm
because they would be still free to go to their parties and they wouldn't be affecting neighbours in that way
mhm
earlier we mentioned about erm particularly about the actual stress that can people can g in erm living in the flats and also the financial difficulties
erm what social services erm policy say with regard to there's a certain amount of money available t say for if people came to family
and they happen to have a bill they can't pay
in that situation social services do have certain
we do have erm it's rather you know it's quite a small amount
mhm
really when you think of the extent of the problems in the area
so erm and how we use that money is at our discretion
mhm
there is a certain amount of money for f families
and i mean i'm talking in matter of a few thousand pounds to do for a whole year
and erm so we the way we work it out ourselves is that we don't actually pay people's fuel bills
mhm
what we have done when they've been cut off with erm electricity in particular erm we liaise with d h s for them to help their erm to get their UNK made a at a level which doesn't leave them erm you know too short of money
and we also have paid for the UNK fee
cos usually if it's been cut off there's a about twelve fifty or something to be UNK
mhm
we pay the UNK fee but not the electricity bill
mhm
and we also have given out food erm and money for food
if someone comes and they've actually run out of food and they've you know for some reason or other their UNK is either held up or you know they've had a big expense er which they've had to pay then we would provide them with something
erm to keep them to tide them over
mhm
but at the same time we are not er doing that and letting d h s out of s the kind of provision they ought
mhm
to be making
i think if we just hand out money for those kind of things then the pressure is taken off d h s
mhm
and that's not right either
mhm
so do you as a social worker have much erm do much work with d h s
yes we have erm a lot of connection with d h s
mhm
erm you know we know the special case officers in each of the areas and we also liaise erm on behalf of people who come in with problems to them
we also provide the facility of the telephone here
for people to make their own connections to the
mhm
d h s because very often they either can't get telephone boxes working or they're hanging on so long that they don't have enough money
mhm
to put in to the box
mhm
so you know we provide that kind of service
mhm
we also you know do our best to get them to er pay up when er when they can but i mean we're not always successful in that
especially now with the single payments being cut back so UNK
mhm
and what kind of impact is that likely to have the UNK on single payments
well it i mean already it is having quite an im impact erm especially for items like furniture and UNK and i mean UNK doesn't last for ever especially with a family and i know erm they're allowed every so often but erm i mean i think erm the UNK are becoming more and more and more and people seem to be which means that we have to look around for voluntary erm agencies that ca such as who can provide us with furniture or beds and UNK
so that's erm in areas such as flats and the effects are pretty serious
yes
the ch the change in policy
yes
yeah
mhm
how does it make you feel you know as a social worker erm when whatever you in whatever you do every you do no matter how effective you are that you're that when you leave those people they're in they're basically in that same situation and equally v and still vulnerable
yeah
erm
erm well it doesn't make you feel very good
er i mean i would say that the majority of people in this office carry a lot of erm anxiety and pressure home with them
mhm
er just because of this you know precise thing
that erm you know whatever you do is very little and we're not really taking the pressure off very much
mhm
i know that erm that we haven't real haven't covered in great UNK detail is erm how you yourself became a social worker and career background
erm so erm you've been a social worker for how many years
i've been a social worker since nineteen seventy so ten years this year
ten years
yeah
erm i went into residential social work first erm but that was after twenty years of teaching erm in various parts of the country i was in bradford and then i spent seven years in africa where i also erm was a teacher and when i came back from africa i was asked if i would just replace someone that was going on a course in a residential er the mother and baby home it was actually
and so i said yes i would do that for the year and then i'd get back into teaching
but when i actually erm got into the social work side of it and i saw what the needs there were erm and it was at the particular time too when you know lots of teachers were sort of being made redundant or at least the er the numbers in schools weren't so high
and i felt that there was more pressure in social work than there was in teaching
there was a greater need for social workers
so i spent two years in the mother and baby home then and decided that if i was going to stay in social work then i would erm be better a able to help people if i could do it from the theoretical background as well as the feeling erm background er of my own my own personal feelings
erm so i did the two year c q s w course
i went back to the mother and baby home for another almost two years and from there that was i think i said at the beginning how i actually was introduced to flats and it was actually living at the mother and baby home doing far more work with girls
mhm
who moved out that led me to want to live in the flats
mhm
do you the fact that you actually lived in the flats few years er at the same with you working on the flats as well
how much of a benefit has that been the fact that people are seeing you i as a as a professional who you know who works for social services
mhm
living amongst that i mean
erm but the first year that i was in the
yeah
flats i was i was working erm in with a voluntary agency
yes
i wasn't actually with social services
mhm
although i was doing the same kind of erm work
and then as the job came up with social services and i joined it i did have some reservations because i felt that maybe people would see me as sort of having UNK them and joined them you know er brilliant movie
thank you
mhm
but for what i am
mhm
and er that they still even when i have to do things which are not very erm happy either for me or for them erm i'll just give the example of removing a child from
mhm
the parents erm well that is very difficult on both sides
erm i still feel that there is an element of trust that people have in me erm because of having lived with them
mm
mhm
but i mean how often does that happen anyway is that i presume that's very much a last resort
it's ve yeah very much a last resort and it's usually erm as a result of ill treatment
you know that
mhm
that we would have to do that
and not always you know it's not always the parents who have who have erm either UNK the child or something but
mhm
perhaps they've left them with someone who has done that
mhm
you know the kind of erm the kind of accident that can happen
mhm
erm and you know there's er you know really er it's something that we're not the only ones who make the decision
while we actually do the a the removal we usually have other agencies with us such as the n s p c the police who have to carry out the investigation into what has actually happened and erm in the end the court
because if the court doesn't say that yeah this child must remain in care erm you know
but we actually do the removal
mm
and er you know that's quite traumatic
mhm
have there been many cases on the flats or has this been a
well er erm dunno that
i mean there have been some in the area which haven't been that flats as well
mhm
you know
erm in my own particular case i have done it twice
mhm
mhm
is there any danger that erm that it could happen more er that you could have the same happening say in flats as a similar thing happening say in erm more middle class areas such as yet erm there being more risk of it of it of erm parents losing the child say in some areas such as flats and yet in
erm
somehow that
well i would say that if it comes to the attention of social services that we would treat it the same
mhm
in that we would go through the same procedure whether they lived in
mhm
or in
mhm
erm you know we're not out to get to get them
and i think that's the you know a general feeling that's not just me
you know from knowing how it affects other
mhm
workers as well
mhm
yeah would you would you say that it's erm it's a more of a problem in places such as flats anyway than say
is it is it any more problem there
well i would say that the people in flats are under greater pressure
mhm
and you know i would say that erm because of the pressures it is likely that people
yeah
erm might UNK out more
it's not surprising considering
mhm
the pressures
mhm
but that's but that's erm not UNK not because of the people it's actually
no
because of the environment those people are isn't it
yeah
i would think that
mhm
erm do you know you you've you spoke erm earlier erm about the church erm how do you see how so you se do you see the role of the church erm in ar in er inner cities
what do you think they could do
erm well i think what they have to do first is
mhm
is to UNK themselves with the people
mhm
erm and i think actually being part of them and you know like inner city churches living right the you know the UNK and the UNK not just coming from say to but actually living in the area
and er just sort of by their lives becoming relevant as well
mhm
and i think i must say that i it's well certainly in nottingham my experience is that the church of england is and perhaps other churches are more aware of this than the catholic church is
even though i belong to the catholic church that's my feeling erm and my experience i would say since living in
mhm
so is that i mean to what extent do you feel erm the ch the church generally has moved along the road that you'd like to see it
move
erm it's moving i think slowly
mhm
first of all it's becoming aware
mhm
it's becoming aware that people who live in the inner cities are not bad
mhm
that a lot of it is due to the living conditions and the unemployment and all the rest of it
i think and once the awareness is there then the movement can begin
and i think that's what is happening
mhm
and what happened to him after that
er well he was unemployed for a quite some time er and he got odd casual jobs er and then finally doing er as late as the second world war he got er he got employment on the railway
now did he have any er political or trade union UNK
he had er some er trades union er some trades union experience
er he did attend his er the union branches q er quite regularly
but he didn't have er he didn't have any official er position within the union branch
and was he politically active or anything
er not really no not really that er political activity was left er to my mother
yeah
she was er she was politically UNK active er for the labour party
could you tell me a bit about that
yeah
yeah
and erm what kind of things was she involved in then
well she was er very prominent in the er labour party war organization
mm
that old day they had a fairly er strong er war organizations locally and she was er she was fairly active in there
and do you remember any experiences of your mother at election time or anything like that
er well yes
er the main means of propaganda of course in those days was er leaflet and er street meetings
er and i well remember er even as early as nineteen the election which took place immediately after world war one i remember being er sort of dragged round the streets you know er i think it was enjoyable i don't know er by my mother er attending these street meetings er i very well remember it because i had a new coat a new coat for er for this particular venture and er the two things you know are fairly deep in my memory
now how did your family cope with your mother being sort of politically active what did you how did you manage
well fairly well fairly well
er erm my older brothers er they took an active part immediately i in the early twenties
so it didn't seem to be of any hardship to anybody for the mother to be involved in er political activity
mm
did your father play er a role in
er no he er he did er become an individual member of the labour party at that stage but he er he didn't he didn't take er an active er or organized part in it
now could you tell us a little bit about your brothers and sisters
how many did you have
well i had my older brother er he won some sort of a scholarship i remember he became er part time attendant at the er part time attendant at the er university
er
it didn't do him a lot of good in the early er in the early days but er it did stand him in good UNK later of course because he became er a full time official o of the er notts area n u m
this was wasn't it
he was indeed
he was one them but who was er UNK in UNK after nineteen twenty six
he spent all his working life up until nineteen twenty six er at the local hucknall colliery but after twe er twenty six er he was UNK he was dismissed and was unable to get employment in the er in the industry until er the latter thirties middle thirties
after which he became a branch official and er and er subsequently became a er a full time area official
er another brother in the in twenty six he took another course of action he cleared off and er he went to he went to live in australia
er another brother he er subsequently became a er a labour county councillor but that er that was after the second world war er after he had er after he had er done war service
but i'm quite sure his earlier associations within the family er you know helped him in er in his endeavour to become a county councillor after the er after the second world war
er well that leaves me
i also er i did have a sister
yes
and subsequently she was much younger
she went to australia
and your elder brother you talked about at some length was les was it
that's right yeah
er and what about erm political UNK
they're all you mentioned one was a county councillor what about les what w he was involved with
ah l leslie yes he did a tremendous amount of work for the er for the l labour party
er he was indeed for some time the er secretary of the er divisional labour party
er among other things
but er he did a fair amount of educational work organizing er educational classes and so on
er so much so he was er able to er organize local weekend schools to which er people like hugh UNK er would come and er give a couple of lectures er sunday morning sunday afternoon
er john another one
er he was also closely associated with the national council of labour colleges who did indeed
mm
help in the organization of er of these weekend schools
but er immediately prior to the second world war he did er he did er join the communist party
now so he was a p a n a political influence on you was he er at some time
er well it was all mixed up it was all mixed up the funny thing is er whilst he was many years my senior er i joined the communist party before he did
so er th there were some er quite substantial er discussions and debates which er which er which went on in the family over the years of course
now erm tt could you just talk a little bit just about your you know y your background as a child
what school did you go to
i went to a local er council school
what was that called
that was er boys' school
and do you remember much about that
pardon
do you remember much about that school
er well not a lot
i remember there was er about forty eight of us in the classes that er that went on
there was a very strict er a very strict discipline
er looking at it from today's standards there was little er little recreation
you know er little physical recreation
and what do y what sort of examples can you give about discipline then harsh discipline
what sort of things went on
er well er i d i remember the er in the infants er in the infants section it was necessary for to er for to touch y touch your hat touch your little cap er when the er when the UNK when the UNK er went by
er and i think that somewhat sums it up
you more or less stood to attention
now erm did you stay in the same school or
more or less yes
yeah
er the school had its infants department and er intermediate and so on you see
and you went on and left school at what age
fourteen
and what did you come to do then when you erm
er well
left school
of course jobs were at a premium then
er i got a job er in the UNK trade
er which er i suppose i was there for six years
but many of these er many of these jobs of course as far as the young people were concerned were dead end jobs
you got nineteen twenty one and that was it they didn't want er they didn't want adults
er you know they only wanted er re really junior people
now before we talk a little bit about that i'll j can i just take you back erm a couple of years and ask you er what your memories are of the general strike
what do you remember about that
about the general strike
yeah
er one was er one was food
er at midday at midday w we er we reported to one of the local UNK
er the majority of the local UNK were w were responsible for er organizing soup kitchens for the kids er s it didn't apply sundays it didn't apply sundays
we got er a meal mostly soup and a piece of bread er at midday
er the chapel i attended was er the UNK chapel on er on road
er as i say it the majority of it was soup but on one occasion during the week we always had er some sort of UNK er UNK meat sandwiches and tea
and er i can taste the tea now
er it had a peculiar taste with it
i don't know exactly what it was but er it was UNK meat sandwiches er and tea
now the other one the other
were you at school normally
during the strike
oh yes we were at school
yeah
yeah
er the other one was towards the latter end of the strike and er this particular area the notts area er had what was called broken away from the er from the main body er of the strike
there were some er some er miners in notts who were persuaded er to go back to work
er as against the decision of the er of the union
and of course this created this created a tr a tremendous problem because er these few people that went to the er odd pits were in need of er a very strong police UNK
and there were hundreds of police who were drafted into the into the town er UNK on the er local pubs er and so on
and d it was the duty of these police to protect these er these people these scabs as they were called er and UNK them from their homes to the pit and see them back
see them back home
er and i remember er a very vivid occasion of being on road which is close by the er hucknall colliery about three o'clock time when er a couple of these er people were being UNK back towards the centre of the town after they'd done er a day's work and there were lots and lots of er people about men and women who were shouting and UNK at er at er at these at these people who had been er who had er UNK the union decision and gone to work
and there were quite a large collection of police who stood in reserve up one of the side streets
and er anyway the situation was getting out of hand and er the man in charge the superintendent whoever he was he gave the signal that these that these reserves should er should clear the street to make way for the to make way for the scabs
and er they drew their UNK that i'd never seen before policemen with UNK er and they started to run and everybody else started to run and i forgot there was a puppy dog this puppy dog it chased it chased towards the er p policemen and started er UNK and d and carrying on and one of the policemen did no more than UNK it straight across the top of the head with a with a UNK and er and that was the end of the puppy
well everybody really er began to UNK
er people would try front doors to see if they could get in front doors but no and they UNK down er UNK between the between the houses and so on
er and all in all it was quite er it's quite it was quite an experience er to have seen er this er this police er UNK charge er and er we were fortunate enough in being able to get out of the way
those are the two e are the two experiences the question of food and the f er the s the soup kitchens and the er police protection for those who er went to UNK the decisions er of the union
now about these people these UNK what were they were they local people or were
oh yeah
they people drafted in
they were local people then
they were local people yes
and what was the attitude over and above other than obviously coming in and out of work what was the attitude of the local neighbours and whatnot towards them
well er th er this is one of the UNK er is it not you see this bad feeling
this bad feeling er lived on into old age
lived on into old age
er
what were the kind of conditions of the people who w who went back in did they go in UNK because of they had erm say large families or something like that and they had difficulty trying to make ends meet
er i don't know whether that i don't know whether that was a factor er looking back er i wouldn't know
but there was a i know there was a system in notts you see whereby er the coal was dug on the basis of contracts between the management and er a man or two men
mm
and these two men would employ half a dozen other men you see and whether w whether it was for to get a UNK in the future for to be one of these contractors or not i j i just don't know
you see
now what about your own family how did you manage how did you make ends meet with the er four children
well we were fortunate we were fortunate
er in so far that my father had been dismissed from the er from the coal mining industry er before just before nineteen twenty six and he was officially unemployed
so the family we as a family were better off than the majority of er of families er in so far that er whilst we were a fair sized family we did have at least some income in the form of unemployment pay er that my father received
mm
er my brothers er older than me who were indeed er boys working in the pit they didn't get they didn't get any relief or er any income
did they did
except
they or you have to get any c casual work i mean y sort of part time little jobs
er
yeah well er they did a little bit of er UNK picking
they went to UNK area UNK picking
and one or two er little odd jobs like this er for er for the summer period but er obviously these harvest jobs er didn't last very long
but there was a movement there was a movement because these single men had no income whatever and there was a demonstration of er of these er single men they marched to the UNK er in UNK
er the city not the city the UNK hospital
er they marched you see they'd no income they'd nothing
they marched to the er to the UNK demanding that they should be taken in you see
er on the basis that er that er that er they were UNK
but they were not allowed in because
a they couldn't er they couldn't get er th they couldn't provide accommodation for all the hundreds that they were you see
and b of course er the political set up was such that they were not interested er in helping er the miners over this er over this UNK particularly difficult er period
and why do you think was that
they di they didn't want to feed those on strike they wanted to try and get them back to work did they
er yeah well one can appreciate in er in circumstances of real hard struggle
yeah
the likes of which the twenty six strike was you see there was no er there was no holds UNK
y your political affiliation was either one way or the other and er you didn't er you didn't m UNK words about it did you not i mean you
you didn't show you didn't show any er either any enthusiasm or sympathy for the other side
now what about other members of the of your family
were they active in organizing in participating in the UNK and this kind of thing
yes oh yes they were er they were involved
so much so of course that er that er the elder brother he was er he was er a branch official by this time twenty six at the er hucknall colliery the local colliery and of course when the strike er was over er that was the end of he as far as working in the in the coal mining industry in this particular area that was the end of it
they er they just had their UNK and er and er that was it you were out and you weren't going do er you know you were not allowed to have another job
now i don't know if you remember anything about the nine days of the general strike as opposed to the s sort of the whole miners' strike in that year
yeah
do you remember anything special about
yeah
those nine days
yeah
in comparison to
yeah well er yeah there was there was er one er course er we kids w looked upon er these activities w with some with some interest you know
er for example it was better than going to school
and th the local there was a local brewery now i can't quite remember which brewery it was during the er during the general strike they er they decided to er to send out barrels of beer
er
obviously to the to one of their pubs
and the vehicle got as far as hucknall marketplace er and that was it
the it was UNK there and er all the barrels of ale were rolled off we were rolled off the vehicle
and er they were just they were just in the in the act of UNK of UNK a couple of these barrels and er i it was unfortunate that the that the police showed up
so consequently th there was no er the there was no free beer
but i ve i ve i very well remember that one
er i remember too er there was some attempt made to stop a train which er which was run er on what was then known as the great central line that runs through that runs through hucknall
er i know that there was quite a business about this but er i wasn't an UNK er and i didn't er i'm never so sure that er i didn't get the i didn't get the details right
er it seems it seems that there were a lot of students from one of the bigger un er top class universities which were handling this train er but er there were quite a few er things done some of them i would think dangerous
but er apparently er this train whilst it was UNK it was UNK locally but after a while it er it er it did get away and it proceeded towards er towards er sheffield
what happened above er above hucknall er i just don't know
now if we er if we can just move on move on back to your tt starting your working life
yeah
erm and y you er said that you that you started work in a butcher 's
w did you have a proper apprenticeship
not re no
no
no proper training
oh no
and what were y what were the kind of jobs that you were expected to do then
well er there was er keeping the place cleaned er there was er doing deliveries work there was er the making up of er certain items sausage er etcetera er and you were also ex expected to help in the er in the slaughterhouse
er and you sort of er a general UNK actually but you picked up some knowledge some knowledge of the of the er business
what er what sort of wages were you getting for that
well the wages then was er w started at er ten shillings ten shillings a week that's fifty p a week you see
and wh how did that compare with other lads of your age
was that good or bad
oh er now th that was that was that was pretty poor er probably employed in the co op in those days would have attracted er a fourteen shillings er nearly half as much again
er perhaps in the mining industry you would have got er thirteen shillings something like this
and what sort of hours did you have to work then
shop work is that a long how long a day would you have
oh hours it was er it was er six er six full days a week seven in the morning to six at night that is
er
now er if we could come on a little bit erm tt when was it that you became sort of officially politically active when you actually joined er joined the party
oh well that would be the er i was a member of the er i was a member of the trades union whilst i was in this private distribution
there weren't many others er perhaps only four more er in the in the town but we were associated with the with the er branch which looked after the interests of the co op employees
er but er political UNK er serious political affiliation that would start about nineteen thirty one or perhaps nineteen thirty two
and what did you join
well i joined the i joined the young communist league at that stage
and er if we could just go into a little bit about this was in hucknall
this was in hucknall yeah
what erm what sort of activities did you organize then what sort of thi events did you
well we did er we did a fair amount of er leaflet er distribution
er there were one or two of us not many we helped the er communist party branch proper in their campaigns for er council elections er sales of the er of the daily worker as it was known er in those days
er we had a fair amount of activity supporting the s UNK of the er unemployed
er i would think we made ourselves generally useful
probably too much so on the political side in so far that er looking back it seems that w we were isolated from other young people in so far that we were associated with straight political er activity and er straight political movement
mm
well why w would why would you say that what s what s was your sort of membership where from what groups of people did you draw your members from
well they were much the same local workers
er a couple of lads who were who were unemployed er we were never able to break in the mining industry at this particular stage
we were never able to er we were never able to get young miners er in these in the very early days immediately after nineteen twenty six onwards to er to er to be associated with the er young communist league
and why do you think that was
was it was it or would you say it was
well er this wa this was this was this was very clear this was very clear you see
when you look back when you look back you see erm understand that after nineteen twenty six at the local pits if you if you took a watch if you took a watch to work with you so that you're in a position to know the time and tell the other people what the time was you see you were running the serious risk of losing your job
now this may this may appear this may this may be a this may appear to be a something UNK might this
this is exactly what the situation was
because they developed a system of mining whereby once it was the task had begun to clear the coal face of a certain er a certain area of coal it didn't matter what happened during that particular period of time whether all the machinery broke down etcetera you had to stop u until that amount of coal had been cleared off you see
and they were not having anybody in the mine with a watch who could let people know exactly what the time was and in other words create a situation where the men might go home before they'd completed this particular task
but that indeed er was the situation
er so much so you see that er people who did have employment in the industry would not would not be seen talking to left wing labour party people or members of the communist party because they readily understood you know that here was a risk that they were running whereby they may indeed lo er lose their employment
er and so the therefore you see these are some of the reasons why w we were unable to get close to the er younger members who were or the younger people who were employed in the coal industry
now
however the situation was changed later on
er what was your relationship with people as you say on the left in the la in the labour party
with the labour party generally
or w or and with the youth in the i l p and the labour
party with their youth sections what was your relationship with them
well the funny thing was that er the local labour party n didn't have didn't have a youth er a youth section
it were shame it were shame that those who would er have been the youth section in the labour party locally were we people who were who were in the youth communist league you see
er but the relationship with the er with the labour party and particularly the left in the labour party was not er was not too bad at all
was not too bad at all because er d everybody was UNK involved in some sort of endeavour either er through the unions or through the er demonstrations against unemployment you see so there was indeed er a certain coming together
er when the election local elections were on of course er i we were n not quite so friendly to each other because er each had got candidates er UNK for the er for the same er for the one er particular seat
how wh what sort of how did that feel then er one minute you were fighting together on er an unemployed
mm
demonstration and the next minute you were fighting against
mm
one another what er wh did that cause any personal UNK
er only in very odd cases
only in very odd cases
er i don't think er the l on the left it didn't much matter on the left it didn't much matter er the right wing types were probably not so er not so very happy about the situation
now you've talked about these activities erm
and wi and parliamentary wise you see
yes
there was a er a fairly good er fairly good er m p a fellow named UNK
er he was not a brilliant UNK er but er by and large he was er he was er he was he was a pretty good and well respected er member of parliament
erm if we can just talk a bit about the activities the question of the demonstrations against unemployment what did you actually do to aid those demonstrations
were these the national UNK as well as local ones
oh yes
the national UNK er the er the yorkshire the yorkshire UNK er would come through here
er and when the yorkshire UNK didn't come through here you'd get the er notts er UNK which er would join up with the derbyshire UNK er a wee bit a wee bit lower down wee bit lower down the er down the country so er in every er in every er activity against er unemployment they'd the locals who were who were obviously involved
and what sort of things did you actually do to help the national UNK then
what practical support did you give them
er well we'd er distribute the leaflets we'd er do what was known as the UNK in other words er whitewash UNK whitewash times of meetings whitewash the announcement of er times of arrival er and things of this character
and what about their accommodation and things like that did you or the food did you do anything like that
er invariably the co accommodation was er was provided in the in the local halls there were two local halls in those days but er primarily the public hall wi that was the local council hall
er this er provided the er this provided the accommodation
they all slept there you know they s th they slept rough
but it was warm er and er meals were provided for them
and do you have any specific memories of er the UNK
because it must be thirty two and thirty six mainly you'd be talking about wouldn't it
yeah
early thirties yes
the two main ones
and what do you have any sort of memories that you can describe of the UNK in coming to
er i remember one i remember one demonstration we were able to er we were e employed you see er we didn't we didn't participate in the er in a national march but what we were able to do on one occasion was er to raise enough money for one or two of us for to er go to london by the train and er be in UNK park when er the er the various UNK from e er from various areas er of london marched er marched into er marched into UNK park
and er it was quite er it was quite something you see to see these er thousands of er of er and they were well UNK er in demonstration with UNK with their elected leaders at the front march into er march into er UNK park er they had bands playing they had er perhaps er fifteen or sixteen platforms you know from which the er various working class leaders er spoke to i don't know how many people wh who er who would be in h UNK park on er on this particular day
but er as much as anything that in itself was er one of the UNK you know one of the er high points that the er i remember of this particular period
UNK park erm was it to see the arrival of the UNK can you remember what year that was
i can't no i can't
and er
er it could have been thirty two er
now can you remember any of the local initiatives or any of the local activities that took place against unemployment
what sort of things that went on
erm well there was er there was the local organization for the unemployed the national union the er national unemployed workers' movement
they had a very strong well organized er well organized branch locally
er and these people er understood what could be got f er what little bits could be got out of the er various unemployment er acts and er this knowledge er plus the pressures and feelings that were able to be brought to bear i'm quite sure did er did benefit many er many people who were unemployed
er for example er whilst people w were getting what er the unemployment act said they should have er this pressure was er i'm quite sure able to get some additional er benefits even if it was er only in kind er from the from the local authorities
now wh erm can you remember any of the sort of i initiatives i mean did anything take place in hucknall
er not beyond not beyond the er the marketplace the er marketplace meetings
er summertime good weather the these meetings were a feature of er the you know the political lie er in the wintertime similar meetings and activities were undertaken er in the public hall er in the local hall
but er exact er UNK if you in that respect it's hard to it's hard to say whether they were any
and er how many people did you get at these street meetings in the marketplace
in the public i in the marketplace
yeah
ooh round about er three hundred
yeah
oh yes it was you could get a meeting there you could get a meeting there
and there was interest there was UNK there was er etcetera you see
and it had been known that er the tories that the tories through the medium of er the economic league you know their propaganda organization the economic league which was er which was substantially supported by the by the coal owners
yeah
obviously er they th they'd been known they'd been known to come er and try and have a meeting
they usually didn't finish it but er they started so er there was a fair amount of er of er of er interest in the marketplace
now you told me er before about this er the unemployed used to gather weekly in the in the public hall what
yeah
was this
what took place at these meetings
well they would have a er they would have a UNK they would have er their own er local artists you know er
what would that be not just sort of play school songs it would be anything would it
anything
oh yes
anything
er UNK local UNK but er overall of course it er i it was the er unemployed workers' organization
and was there any sort of political activities organized then
erm meetings or classes or anything like that
yes there was er a fair amount of er straight political er education
er for example classes were my mother organized some classes other people organized classes
er for example i remember in a couple of miles down the road in the er hall there was er there was weekly classes on er among other things on UNK economics you see
we had no money in our pockets but er we're talking about er economics and UNK economics at that er and funnily enough the chap the chap who did that er bert he was unemployed he was he was one of the fellows from derbyshire who was UNK in derbyshire
er he was a lecturer and er a couple of UNK and he was a couple of cigarettes and he was he wa he wa he was er quite well quite well er r UNK
but he became he became the area secretary of the derbyshire miners er derbyshire miners organization
er and you've got er you've got er political er educational classes similar to this both in hucknall er and in the and in the surrounding area
and did you even though you were employed did you actually participate
oh yes
er of a friday evening of a friday evening er i would attend er a national council of labour colleges lecture a fellow named u us used to run this one
er and then er i also attended er political discussions and lectures which were laid on er by the communist party as well
and this went on for years this
oh yes over a long period
over a long period
now what about your life outside of work and outside of political activity did you have much leisure activities
er not really
i er i was a keen UNK
er mind many people many people relied on the cycle er for to get about you see
er if we attended if we were due to attend a meeting for example in derby er twenty mile away
er well you went on a bike you see
er if you er if you attended were to attend er a meeting in nottingham you went on your bike or mansfield you see
er and apart from them i was er i was er i was a fairly er keen er UNK and did er did a little bit of camping too
but er
right
where did you used to go
why what did you used to do
er well we had a camp the youth communist league had a camp down at er a place called UNK that was er that was not far er not far from colliery
er quite a successful camp that quite a successful camp
er what sort
fifty or sixty er of a weekend you know who would attend who would attend that
and what sort of things did you get up to
er well we had er a very fine er wind up gramophone and we had some marvellous records
some er some very good erm records i should say decent music
er
what do you mean by that decent music
pardon
what do you mean by decent music
well er you'd get er light opera and er and er you know UNK and UNK and
yeah
and this sort of thing
er which was er which was always er which was always enjoyable
mm
er apart from you'd get a UNK you know y you'd go along for a UNK er my most of the time was er made up er by er cooking your grub you know
mm
messing about with the wi with the er food
now what about other things
i mean did you ever have time for dances and going to the pictures and that kind of thing i mean you must have found some time
er well that kind of thing that
as a young man
that was always a question of money
yeah
you know and er you just didn't er you just didn't have er y you may get a cinema once a week or perhaps a dance once a week but that er that wa that was the limit you know
but you ma you managed to fit in some other sort of
oh yes
social life over and above it as a sort of relax you know
yeah
yeah
that was what i was trying to get at
and then you know so l try and bring that on y you erm you got married in the thirties
that's right
and how did you get round to meet your wife then
well she was er she was involved with er the cooperative youth organization known as the er co op comrades circle
er and all of these organizations you see one way or another their UNK crossed and er erm people met people this way
and can you remember how exactly you met your wife
er i don't know er i don't know i'm not er i do er i had this brother i had this brother and he was er he was a lecturer you see and he was supposed to g go to west UNK to talk to this co op comrades circle on the problems of the UNK
er i don't know whether you know about the UNK
that the area in germany you mean
that's right
yeah
between france and germany you see
and he sent me to tell them he couldn't come you see
er and i something like this
and so you met your wife there
aye
erm and how long was it before you got married
i don't know really i married in er early thirty six er
now your wife wasn't a member of the communist party
she was by this time
yeah
er
wha what did she think by er she was a member before she got before she married then
yeah
yeah
er so she was she wasn't bothered at all about your er
oh no
your activities when you first started
so how did you er manage when you first got married then
did your wife work at all
yes well she er she did a bit of work and er we lived
what job did she do
in a comparatively cheap er cheap little flat with er some other party members you see
so we were
whereabouts hucknall
this was in ba the exact centre of hucknall
er near the marketplace UNK the marketplace
but of course er that's gone now that that's all gone now and by one means or another we were able to er to er live UNK anyway
and your wife was from west UNK originally was she
yeah
yeah
well she lived down there but she UNK from derbyshire
and w er did sh you said she got some work what job did she do then to help
erm mostly of a domestic nature
and you were still working in the UNK at this time
that's right
that's right
now er if we could come on now it was in nineteen thirty six that you went to spain
well it was thirty seven
thirty seven was it
yeah
erm now can you tell me about how you how you decided to actually you know why you decided to actually go to spain in the first place
well er you see the b the political background er played a very important part er and the fa and the struggle against UNK in this er early thirty period was er was really something
er it's difficult for people to appreciate today er the amount of political activity that took place during this early thirty period and it's pe difficult for people to appreciate the political understanding that did exist over this period
and not only political understanding but political determination to do something about it
and the er the er struggle of the spanish people r really captured the imagination of er huge sections of the er of the majority of the people er in britain
and you'd got you'd got a tremendous UNK you know of er of enthusiasm of determination you see er and obviously er people wanted to give er expression to their support to the maximum
er people quite a f few people went to er went to spain
bef before i went er i er quite a few of my friends went
you see and it's er it er it's this j this background you see which er convinced people that er they ought to you know help the spanish people in a real serious and er and personal capacity
because they'd got a tremendous struggle on they'd got a tremendous struggle on they were struggling against tremendous odds they were struggling against er all sorts of er of er of UNK that er was being conducted by quite a quite a few of the er quite a few of the major powers
and it was this background you see that er that er th that gave me at least the need for to play some part in
mm
helping along the struggle against er against UNK
now did you go with friends
did you go with you know your friends and comrades at the time
well i er i picked up i picked up er i picked up people in london but locally er i went er individually
i went on my own
how did you know people had gone before you though
well we got letters back we
yeah
your
your friends had gone though you had gone
oh yes
er in fact in fact a c a couple of them are o er b were killed there
er one from mansfield er one from nottingham
now can you tell me a bit about you your journey down there
er we were well it was fairly well organized it was fairly well organized it was er
well how you got to london did you
and then
yeah you're in need of er you're in need of er getting to london
er and to get to london probably the local people would help raise the er would help raise the fare but having er having got to london er you contacted the organization er you would then took a er weekend ticket took a weekend ticket to er to paris
this was a you know a return er a return ticket
cost about one pounds twenty five or the equivalent of one pounds twenty five p
but er you got to paris you got an address in paris they gave you a bed couple of meals
now who ga who supplied the money
were you given the money or did you have to pay for that yourself
oh no you er they er provided the ticket you see they provided the ticket
mm
oh there was no such thing if they gave you the money you might nip off
no they UNK they gave you the tickets you see
mm
how we got there er you got er you got some food ad you got a bed for er for a couple of days
er you then had got another ticket and er train ticket and you went to the south of france by train and er you got a bed and a couple of meals there er then you had a bus ride
they provided a bus you had a bus ride and you picked up a couple of guides er who during the night would take you over the er take you over the er UNK er over the mountains er the UNK you see UNK er you're in need of a guide because the er the UNK posts etcetera were shut were closed
er and they were also UNK
and er you were in need of er finding a way over the UNK which er gave you a chance of er getting to the other side so hence er you needed er you needed french er french guides
and they were UNK by UNK troops
pardon
they were guard UNK by UNK troops
ah well you didn't go over you didn't go over er where UNK troops were but
mm
they were UNK by french troops you see
i see
yeah
er there was not a lot of enthusiasm for this er th this guarding which went on you see because everybody was in sympathy er with the cause of the republican government the s the spanish republican government
now
so it was er only half UNK as far as er as far as the er the er activities of the guards on the UNK from the french side were concerned
now where did you go to once you were in spain
well we went to a place called UNK
that's just inside er that's just inside er just inside spain what
they have it's a it's an old an old UNK from the UNK days of the er history of spain yeah
and er from there from there we er we were er we were obviously then UNK there and we then went to er a training base of UNK
now how
more or less in the er almost in the middle of spain
tt how long had the erm journey took you then from nottingham down to UNK
from here to er republican territory
yeah
perhaps six days
and it was quite short then
the er
oh yeah it was quite short yeah
yeah
now what happened when you got to er UNK the me
this was what was there it was the international brigade
well that was the that was the er base headquarters of the international brigade UNK and then from there w you were UNK out to the village which was er sort of the base who are responsible for your er particular national UNK you see er the french people they er w they would be in one village the english and the UNK er americans would be er in this place that we were at called UNK er and the germans w the german anti UNK would be er in another
er like wh when i was with the it er the italian anti UNK you see
and what er how many different UNK were there then
well you name the UNK and they were there you see
they were a everybody was there
and not just europeans
oh no
who from outside of europe
no there were there were UNK there were there we the there were chinese there was er the there were UNK there were er ce people from er central america south america from everywhere
now given the different UNK wa wasn't there a communication problem
language problem
well er there al there always is isn't there
there is a there is but er but er the medium er as best it could be used was spanish you see
see
and it's surprising the number of people er who do speak spanish
you see because everybody from UNK right down to the er to the tip of south america for example er speak one dialect or another of er of er of spain of the spanish language and large areas of er of er the UNK you see er and italian is not a long way from it you see so er it on the surface it may seem to have been difficult but the er you know there we did get by
did you manage by pick did you pick up a few words yourself
ah yes just a few
everybody managed by
yeah
doing that did they
yeah
and er what was the point it was like a training camp as well was it
that's right yeah
now what kind of er training did you get
well er we got we got the use of er of rifles you know there weren't many because they were wanted er they were wanted at the er front
there were one or two rifles they were er you know
so we did indeed get some basic er basic military training
we fired rifles and this and this sort of thing
er we did er you know practise military UNK as they were as they were UNK in er in those days and so on
so we did er we did indeed get some er basic military training
erm what about your standard of living
what kind of food did you get and where were you living at the time
er well there was always a problem er food wise because there was a UNK there was a sc an overall UNK er of food
er and the spanish coast you see was UNK
you see it was er whilst it was er a UNK legally elected government you see there were such people as er as UNK from italy fascist italy and er UNK germany you see who had got units naval units air units etcetera UNK
UNK the er the ports of er of republican spain
and consequently er the UNK did have er did have serious er serious consequences for the UNK in relation to food etcetera that er that were required by the er by the republican government
so what sort of
i remember there was one fellow er an UNK he was known as potato jones
he used to he used to run his own ship er a little coastal a little coastal er UNK
er and he used to run he used to run food to er the in er in this in this boat a fellow named potato jones i don't know why he was known as potato jones
er was he politically inclined was he
er this i don't know this i don't know but er
or was it a bit of UNK
yeah
he was an he was an he was a hero you see er
you don't know whether he did it from an UNK point of view or from er
no
exactly why he must have had some sympathy mustn't he
er now
and the food on
yeah
the question of food
yeah
you see it was er it could have been er it could have been er better done but er we got by we got by
what exactly kind of meals did you have
what were they
most of it most of it is most
UNK is it
of it was soup
most of it
was it
most of it was soup
i was ever so sure that er that there was a UNK number of er well there was a qu quite a substantial fall in the in the in the donkey population er
er in spain because we UNK it was only donkey that went in that went into the er UNK as they call it went into the went into the soup you know with the beans and er various types of UNK and so on
and er the bread
the bread wasn't bad the bread wasn't bad
did you ever get any let up from that though
did you ever have a decent meal
er n not really you may talk your way into some UNK house and er he'd give you a UNK egg or something like this and er that was something if you got a UNK egg
and what about oth other supplies i mean clothing and cigarettes and that kind of thing was that
well you had what you went in you see er you may get a you may have got a UNK coat or a UNK you know er sort of a big UNK er but er uniform in the in the accepted military sense er no
mm
and what about cigarettes
pardon
how about did you manage for them
cigarettes
well er a similar er when you got a letter when you got a letter so you you'd probably get you'd probably get four or five UNK you see er things like this and there was an issue from time to time and they were UNK american cigarettes UNK american cigarettes
now
perhaps once a week you'd get twenty of those but er there was a local tobacco you know
but er you'd got to be a man and a half to be able just to smoke to smoke the local stuff
now how long were you were you at this er camp before you
oh er perhaps a couple of months
no longer
now how was the army itself organized did you was it in the in the normal sense of the army
oh yes
or was it
yes it was organized and it and er yes
there were companies er and there'd be probably three companies to a UNK something like this depends on the arms er and then er you'd get three or four UNK to er to a brigade you see
but you had political UNK
and we had political UNK oh yes
and what sort of a role did they play then
what did they do
er well they had a difficult job they had a difficult job you see because they'd got to keep explaining to you why you hadn't got a rifle
and er and when you're fighting a war you see and er and er and you haven't got a rifle i mean it's a serious problem
so the political UNK has got to convince you see as to who was responsible for you not having a rifle
er in other words in other words their task was one of er of holding maintaining you know er a political enthusiasm you know and er and er a political discipline see
so when things aren't going very well you see the f these are the chaps that's got to do they've got to do the explaining
but er did they have er any other sort of job to do though
i mean did they you know deliver political speeches to try and
oh yes
this was their role this was their role you see
erm and how did that go down well did it er did it work in practice
well it more or less it more or less it was accepted
because he's talking he's talking to er a fairly high er political level of understanding
mm
you see
mm
and wh what happened then
wh where did you go to anyway when you when you were sent to the front
oh well er i joined the er i joined the er british UNK er up the front not far from a place called er
interesting you said the british UNK th y in your own UNK you kept your own UNK
oh yes aha
so that language
yeah
although for a time for a time i was er i was with er an UNK mixed up outfit wh which included er americans UNK er and british
but mainly but english speaking
oh aye yes they were all english speaking
oh yes yeah
but anyway when y you were first sent with the british UNK to was that
well then i went to the british UNK
mm
not far
erm did you have all your equipment by this time then you did get a rifle
more or less more or less
er you'd never got er you'd never got enough er if you'd got a rifle er you didn't have many rounds of UNK and things like this you see
so there was never er there was never an UNK of anything as far as that went
now were you involved in many battles
not many
no
er i was involved in the in the this battle that resulted in the UNK by the er by the er by UNK at er
what sort of things went on erm was it close fighting or did you never see
yeah it
it got fairly close
er it ought not to have done in so far that er we were we were we were we were moving we were going forward to take up positions on er on the river er and this was being done on the understanding that er a certain bridge had been destroyed er and it hadn't been destroyed er and they were and they were they were already across you see
they were already our side
this is the nationalist army yeah
and er they did indeed even have tanks across this side
er and when you ain't got any tanks and he's got some tanks your situation isn't it's not very it's not very healthy
they not only had tanks they had er they had aircraft
in fact in fact tt it was a regular army division er from italy that was doing this job
and so you as a sort of er volunteer army didn't have a lot of
well we you didn't have a lot of chance in these circumstances in these circumstances when they when they UNK every piece of modern equipment or equipment that w was modern in those er in th in those er in those days and you're not er
was there much
you're not er more heavily armed than er than rifle and the odd light machine gun
and er he's already he's already got you at a disadvantage by er you're on the move and he's waiting for you
now d was there much of a battle or did you realize
yes this went on it went on for about er three days it went on for three days
er but er in the end er in the end they won
obviously
they
mm
er the air force the german air force aye they had a go as well they were providing all sorts of er UNK and bombing er comma
and it's my contention it's my contention that them people that were er UNK and bombing me er outside er in republican spain was the same was the same crowd was the same crowd that were bombing and UNK several years later in the in the second world war in france er and holland
now what happened to you then
well i was captured
and if we can just er just go back just for one minute just to draw a bit of before you were captured er and whatnot could you tell us just a little bit about the living conditions that you had when you were actually at the front
well er aye
well you j you just live rough you li you live rough
er and this particular time of the year it was summer of course you we you weren't UNK worried about not having a shelter you see
you had reached the stage where you could er you could sleep out er and you didn't er you didn't have a soft bed if er you were you were living rough
and of course er i think it says something it says some thing for the morale you see that er and political understanding you see that you can accept all these things see er and still er and still carry on determined
now what about your supplies how did you manage with them
er most of the supplies food was picked up er was picked up locally
er it seems we had a very good er UNK he seemed to always turn up er he seemed to always turn up with something
er it seems it seems that the english are p pretty good at this sort of thing
and did you ever meet up with your friends from nottingham at that time
er yes
er UNK yes i saw him
but UNK he came down to the er to the base and then i went out you see and er he was back at the base UNK whilst this was going on
although i would think that er UNK has got the longest er time served in active service than probably er any other individual that went to spain
he was in at the beginning and he was er he was there at the end sort of thing
mm
er he suffered a couple of UNK as a ma as a matter of fact
now er what happened once you'd been captured then
where were you taken
tt er well we had like i say we w we were i we were in the hands we were in the hands of the er italian army the er regular army from italy we were in their hands er for quite some time
er there was some relief i should think about this er a bit of relief
but after a while after a while we were handed over to the er spanish fascist authorities proper
er there was just the one meal a day and a piece of bread and that was your lot
but er after a while
erm er th they so they treated you quite badly then
pardon
they didn't treat you very well
not r no not really
no
and di did they
they weren't against laying about you with sticks and stones and rifle UNK for no reason at all
and did they pick on any individuals
er oh yeah they would
pick on individuals
there was a bloke named er he w he was er an UNK who had er a fairly high standing in the irish er republican movement
er they were they picked they picked er they picked on him
and as a matter of fact as a matter of fact the germans th had thought that he would be of value to them at a later stage because he was er he was shipped to germany and er i understand that he died in germany er at the latter end of er of er of the of the war the second world war
y er th they kept him there they i think they were hopeful they were hopeful that he being a republican from ireland that er he c he c he could have been used you know by the UNK in er in their general propaganda directed to britain er with a irish er UNK on the situation but er it's quite clear that er that they were never able to use
er wouldn't be used because er he was never heard he was never he was heard he was never heard erm similar to this lord UNK you know that used to do the broadcasting er from UNK germany to er to britain particularly to england
but anyway he died almost as a prisoner at er at towards the end of er o er of the second world war
er and they did indeed they picked er they picked on him
er but this er that was a that was a er decision of the er of the german command of the german army that was in spain
but after the war w we went back er under the er under the control of the italian army
right
okay mrs erm can you tell me how old you were when you started your first job
er fourteen
and what was that doing
er UNK at a UNK shop in UNK
in UNK
yes
and what was that like
well i it wasn't too bad at all they the UNK shop actually it was er a UNK and his wife who had built up a business over the years in UNK and it was very well UNK by UNK people
but at fourteen my job was to er i had to fetch the coal and the sticks to light the er stove that held the UNK and er they were er d i like i had to go to the UNK which was down fourteen steps the steps were wooden ones outside the upper floor where we worked
and so i had to drag the coal UNK up there i was faced with that and chop the sticks which i'd never done before
and so that it made me a UNK than i should have been
and also the UNK were twenty two pound they were long flat arrangements called UNK
and er the all day that stove had to be kept in summer and winter because there was no other means of heating the UNK
and a bath was kept a zinc bath at the side of the stove and the UNK there were two UNK and four other pe UNK girls an and women like
and erm the UNK would come when they wanted to do any pressing of UNK or anything and they would take the UNK iron and put it in on of the what we call press UNK that we pressed the and then they would UNK it in the bucket of water to get it the right heat to start so a cloud of steam went up
the UNK sat cross UNK on benches and er the UNK there were four machines on one big bench th they went from one belt
and in the other room there were two rooms and the other room had a UNK machine which was quite modern in those days not many firms had a UNK machine
and i was there until i was about eighteen
i wasn't a bound apprentice as such i didn't have to er it meant that i didn't have to stay with them
er they wouldn't have you as a bound apprentice because unfortunately although the wages were so low when you was being an apprentice three and six a year then six and six year and then er i think thirteen shilling the third year
now that was a year but er because you wasn't a bound apprentice when trade fell off in the winter and it fell off UNK in the winter and then built up for easter when everyone in those days bought new clothes
er it erm er the result was that you was really working flat out all the summer and then as the winter advanced you got very short of work and they put us on the dole for half a week
we worked a wee half a week and were on the dole monday tuesday and wednesday we'd be on the dole then work thursday friday and saturday morning
well we should have knocked off work at about twelve on the saturday and instead of that being a shop they were taking orders and we had to do all the alterations as they came in and bought the clothes
and the result was we were often working till half past three without any lunch at all
and we used to get very worked up about it and then we went down to fetch our wages and the older ones were always going to complain but this erm tt er son of the people he used to look at the factory clock opposite and it would be half past three and he'd said right i'll pay you till three o'clock and we'll make it right next week
next week came and we never got that half hour so it must have added up a lot all throughout the year
and er we bore great UNK about this that was the only thing that i can honestly say we bore any UNK about
mm i can imagine
otherwise it was er they were nice people and it was quite nice
and where did you work after that
well at about er when i was about eighteen i erm i decided i'd had enough of this er this business of three days on the three days on and three off in the winter and it was about october time and i could see another winter of it
and er also down at long UNK labour exchange which we walked to or went on the train for tuppence we had to er fetch our money on friday night
a very nice er was with the UNK as t we were called but a very terrible she really was a terrible civil servant
that was for the older girls and they frightened us to death with UNK of what this UNK annie as they said called her had er had said to them and how rude she was terrible
she really was and i sort of thought oh i can't go i can't face up to going there
so er there was a job advertised in the erm well it was the journal in those days and er i went after it in nottingham
it was er by the park that's near UNK market it has UNK grave in it i don't quite victoria park i think it is
and i ha i wasn't very familiar with nottingham then but i went and erm we crossed this park and it was at a big house there UNK were always in rather out of the way places and er he'd just got fixed up
so i was very disappointed and on the way back to catch the bus on parliament street i passed erm a shop called UNK which was next to the corner pin and er although i was very nervous i went in and ask if they wanted a UNK
they were very surprised because usually they advertised for them but they went up and asked the UNK if they wanted anyone and then a dear old man a er named mr said he like a UNK
and he worked on his own on these trousers you see
each man then there was about there'd be about four or five men there all had a number of girls working for them and er they had to pay the wages out of what they earned
you see
they it was all piece work there
unlike UNK a fixed rate for the week it was then piece work
but our rate was fixed the UNK rate we worked for a fixed rate
but the men had to balance it up by what they called UNK tha that came on every garment and how much er money they were getting for it
and then of course had to take their own wages out as well
well conditions were about the same the UNK and the floors that got cotton and all erm bits of material on and everything
the conditions were about the same the wor people were very nice
and er this erm tt as i say this old man he he'd didn't like coming in too soon in the morning and er a i could see he was finding it a bit difficult to find both our wages out of his money although i got there to time and worked
and er when the winter came it was the same old story everyone was short of work again
but erm they didn't seem to go on the dole they just seemed short of work and short of money you see
and he told me that if i he came from out UNK way and he said if you can better yourself dorothy do so
so he said i don't want to keep you and i could see what struggle it was for him to come a er so often in the bad weather that er i started the same idea
i didn't want to come back to UNK so i st because they were very offended because i left
no one had ever left UNK before and they were very upset about it
and then i erm i went to er i went to r i shall i start on the scheme going around to the shops and i got a job on long row
and there the UNK he'd been trained in the war and he only had one la leg and he seemed very nice but er he told me to start on the monday and then i got a letter
you see that was the same system the piece work to say there was no trade at all
there'd been some snow and erm er he wasn't well and could i if i cared i could look for a work elsewhere as i it was just impossible for him to pay wages you see
so as the shop you see didn't pay the wages they had to just pay it on the things that were done
and so then i so i was very disappointed and i went to a shop then called UNK which was a bigger shop and er a very well known shop
and i went in there and asked for their UNK department and er i found out after that i was just dead lucky one of their UNK was going to er leave she was getting married and she was leaving and erm although you didn't have to leave then she sort of had got to leave so er i just fell lucky there
and this mr was so taken UNK by me going in and asking for a job and they'd always advertised in the paper before that he said well she must want work if she's gone after it
and er if i could do the job i could have it
so i started there and they put me on a month's trial and i UNK about this month whether i was good enough and they'd forgotten all about it by the end of month trial
and er that too was at the top of the building and that was in oh a series of little rooms although the shop was big and beautiful down below
the higher you went the less beautiful it got
and conditions were still at just about the same but it had been an old hotel so all the rooms at the top were left just as the bedrooms would have been so you went up and down steps and along corridors
you could easily get lost at first until you got used to it
or you went up the fire escape which had fifty two steps to go up
and you was in these top rooms with the UNK but erm they had gas UNK under the UNK
and er of course th the trouble was that i the UNK was erm you threw all your UNK on the floor you threw all your bits of cloth on the floor and er you had your youngest girl sweeping it up
but nobody ever UNK the floors and they were bare boards so they got you know in a pretty er far worse condition than factories
but erm
did they have any form of inspection like they did in factories
erm they do have they did have factory inspectors but they always informed them when they came and always bought a suit or a costume if they were women
there were the odd women inspectors
and so they were far too f they got far things far too reduced in price to have said much about it was the accepted world then
i
so conditions were quite bad in fact
conditions were poor really in that respect
but er it was just the thing they thought inevitable in a UNK
whereas er in erm a factory i believe they would have had to have er the rooms UNK or UNK at certain times we weren't bound up with any regulations then
you see
there was no regulations as far a i know we never had a thing painted or done at all in any of the places i worked at
they were just really UNK rooms that we used
mm
how long did you work at that place for then
ah well they put me on the top rate of pay which was quite good thirty five shilling a week
what year would this be
ah oh about thirty one
tt and er it was very good the money was we were very busy in the summer and we could earn overtime
the same thing applied to winter we were very short of work but instead of you ever being on the dole again er you went in at ten o'clock in the morning
so er before and you had two half days a week you'd have thursday and saturday you see
t er but you wasn't putting the hours in so you didn't get the money
and then you see then the erm er the bus fare you got as reduced rate to go in early so i used to go in at the UNK about from the last bus i could go in cheap and then walk to trent bridge and back it was very nice
but the people were grand the people i worked with and you could talk all the while
yeah
while you worked er conversation was good and the people were grand people
so it made up for any other er you know
the only thing is i didn't really want to be a UNK i wanted to be a nurse but hadn't much choice then
and having l your mother and father left er your parents had left you with such low money in the early stages you couldn't in any case you couldn't my friend was a nurse but you'd got to have a special background
you'd got to be someone to be a nurse in those days
and they had some terrible times i can tell you
but she'd got to have her family backing i mean er in fact she'd got to really be middle class at least to
mm
be a nurse then
so er i stayed on in UNK and probably got on better because they were lovely people
er when you left that UNK job why did you leave in the end
er because i was ill er well ill
i'd got a UNK cough developed and now looking back through the years er it would have been a sort of hay UNK condition that i have been a bit bothered with
i it's er never held me up that much but er it obviously it affected er me throat the erm it's the bits off the new cloth you see
you've always got the new cloth and er and i think the heat in the summer with the UNK going and everything contributed to it
and er i got a UNK spot on the lung and had to go to the UNK
er or i wouldn't have left i would have stayed on i liked the people
they were marvellous to me when i did go there
and erm tt and then i was there twenty two weeks as a patient and er the then the only cure was rest and good food and fresh air
and fresh air we got it was all open to the weather i once remember putting an umbrella up because it UNK on the bed
and we every morning when we had to strip wash in the bath er in the bowl room the frost was on the ground
it was at UNK it was beautiful round there but very isolated
and once you'd recovered you left there did you
well i stayed on as an UNK because they said that i could erm i could marry because er i wasn't erm classed as erm tt er i wouldn't pass it on to me husband so i could marry provided i prevented having children for er five years that you had to see the doctor until the medical doctor at nottingham until he pronounced you clear you see
and er so that's er i stopped on six months being an UNK because i couldn't go back into UNK obviously because er it might have UNK it all again
but you were working as an UNK
that was before you got married was it
yes
six months before i got married
i stayed on as an UNK up there
i never worked harder in me life
oh the little tt oh the little UNK however they stuck it i shall never know
they worked from eight in the morning till nearly eight at night with just an hour's dinner and half an hour's tea
and an hour off a day
and if they didn't get up when the night sister switched the lights on they were on the UNK and they lost that hour
the conditions er y you know i it's like a another world
and yet they were UNK and good and stuck it didn't they jack
mhm
mm
yes
rea really marvellous and the nurses too
it was th it was erm a lot of the nurses were there for two years before they went to get th into the general hospital training
they could do two years between sixteen and eighteen you see
a in that at that sort of a place they could do it and they er came over from ireland a lot of them and er did the two years
but it was so cold for them but they did it
and so isolated some of them ran away and you know i it really was
but the sisters were very devoted to it and the doctor and the UNK
it's amazing really
mm
the conditions today to then
yeah
yet people were happy and UNK and just as dedicated
they g seven shilling a week we g
i'm going to try and keep a record a log of those who speak and at the end of the meeting there's some information i need about you like it's not it's not required information
if you wish to give it age sex occupation that sort of thing
er so th i will also then have a list of the people who need to sign the form
okay
if you don't speak you don't need to sign the form
right
forget all that
we begin our meeting
and for our UNK i want to turn to UNK number one hundred
yesterday er i t took part in a songs of praise service at north
and what the folks had done with their quarterly newsletter that they send to both villages north and south on the back they'd put a form requesting that every household submitted their five favourite UNK
and these UNK were then compiled together the top ten
and last night we sang the top ten in the songs of praise service and it was a surprising how many extra people came to the church as a result of that
tt and er one of the UNK that i read during the service is this one UNK a hundred
make a UNK noise to the lord all the lands
serve the lord with UNK
come into his presence with singing
know that the lord is god it is he that made us and we are his
we are his people and the sheep of his UNK
enter his gates with UNK and his courts with praise
give thanks to him bless his name
for the lord is good
his UNK love UNK forever and his UNK to all generation
amen
the er hopeful line i think in that UNK is the first one make a UNK noise to the lord all the lands
so it means that you don't have to be a brilliant singer
it says UNK not UNK
and as long as it's done with joy then it is acceptable worship
let us pray together
father we thank you for the worship life of our church
we thank you for the times when it moves us to be in your presence together
we recognize too that there are times when we are frustrated
or anxious about things that are happening
the whole variety of experience that makes up our worship life
for we our changing and growing in you and together
and father as we think together further about our worship about the life of our church family we pray that you would be with us n this meeting
guide and direct all our conversation
and lead us that we might know your will mor clearly and desire to follow it more fully
we pray in the name of christ our lord
amen
amen
my first task tonight having finished the UNK is to welcome stella as our minutes secretary

yeah

thank you
then with your agreement i shall sign these as a correct record
terribly sorry couldn't find a way in
have you not been up the UNK before
well i was expecting th well i was expecting it to be the church hall you see
right
these UNK blowing
right
jenny i should tell you that the meeting's being recorded for this er for the dictionary people
and er we've a we've all given our permission
however of course you may not give your permission for your words of you know i couldn't find the doors
and i need you to sign a consent form before you go as you have spoken at the meeting okay
and er you know your words could find their way into one of UNK
or er all those other things
okay
matters arising from the minutes please
the question of wider publicity
i reported last time that i'd made an approach to chris
i've heard nothing more from him neither have i asked him yet if he's come up with anything
er that's neglect on my part erm but unless anybody's spoken to chris and UNK not here
erm we'll leave it at that for the time being
the whole issue of the preparation of worship that's under b e on page two last time
er the stewards have started to discuss the ideas and have yet to come forward some suggestions
that still stands
but we have got a meeting on thursday so perhaps we could make a point of er coming forward with some possible suggestions
er c theme services that's er g on the erm minutes
erm we have arranged two sets of theme services
the september ones are in hand
and we're doing something on the character of the christian er i can't UNK righteousness is one and i can't remember what the other is
pardon
no i don't th ah
i can't remember
UNK
UNK righteousness and UNK
UNK right
okay
just wait while i write your names down
okay
so that's all in hand erm the UNK we wanted didn't quite work out as we'd suggested
er but er i've managed to fiddle it with the suggested UNK for the november series which i have come a little bit UNK about
and i'll report that to the stewards at the meeting on er on thursday as the initiative came from them
mainly because erm wires got crossed and er the 's hall folks want us to go again to do exchange at the end of november and well we'll discuss it a little bit further
i don't think it's impossible but we just need to make sure that we've got it right
the church anniversary nineteen ninety four er that's number three on the er minutes
er miles is now definitely coming to england
we didn't definitely know that when we had the meeting but he is coming and i will write to him when he arrives in the country
and see if he'll be willing to come
er point four the use of silence
simply to report that there are no further UNK developments on the use of silence in worship since our last meeting
but i give you my undertaking that the ideas will be pursued er at a later date
er i mean that very helpful discussion er though aspects of it have already been included
but the particular thrust of the theme er will come in later on
er item five on the minutes was can we combat the competition posed by other children's activities
and erm one of the things we agreed to do was to compile a list
erm pat cath and andrew did we get anywhere
you have some names
so erm that's still to be sorted out er in the future
we'll get together over that and sort it out but we are seriously er getting about doing what we were asked to do
erm there's also mention there about er family services and i've put those on our agenda later on
and er and an item particularly that comes from the church council
are there any other matters arising that anyone want to pick up on at this point
can i just say about the erm sport side
i found that it is the planning of this that it's also choir UNK and certain school activities that do clash
right
with junior church
so it isn't just
sport
sport
right
okay this covered the matters arising happily for now
okay the rest of the agenda looks like this
the time of the morning service language quite appropriate considering church family services and all age worship children and communion if we have time any other business date of the next meeting go home
okay
time of the morning service
this whole issue about er children junior church other activities children being UNK adults finding it difficult to insist or persuade their children that they should be in junior church when other folks are trying to UNK them in other directions
erm was raised er quite UNK i thought at the church council when it met erm at the end of last month
now er one of the very or the very serious suggestion that came out of that meeting and it i think it met unanimous support that night was consideration of altering the time of the morning service
and the suggestion was that it should be at nine thirty and not ten thirty
so that's quite a radical shift bringing it forward a whole hour
and er we did say that we would consult further about it and erm you are one constituency er which certainly you know er as is your responsibility to think about the worship line of the church
where it we ought to consider it
so it's a suggestion at the moment it's not a firm proposal it's not fixed in concrete and i would hate anyone to think that was the case
but does anyone have any strong feelings either for or against changing the time and for or against nine thirty
in taking the time on it's own erm that that's not a problem i would have thought for most people cos if they're making sunday UNK anyway then i it's in the middle of the morning one way or the other
but in terms of competition does it actually address the competition
erm we can't really answer that as a body until we've looked at some of the er preparation for that
that UNK doing with cath and andrew
so i mean i we'd answer that in isolation
right
yeah we do need more information certainly
mm
erm but i mean i you know the reason i asked this question is that if this group said now absolutely no way
then we would probably wouldn't go any further with it
you know
but if you are saying you know we need more evidence and we will and we you know certainly don't rule it out of court
well you could make a UNK
yes yeah
john
would for instance sort of ten o'clock er instead of the hour half an hour difference be a possibility
erm
yeah
i mean that's that you know i mean
yeah
it's all up for UNK i would suggest
yeah
it was also discussed that nine thirty wasn't early enough
yes it wa
were thinking of morning sports it wasn't early enough
yeah
you would need it to be nine o'clock
yeah
what do the other churches think then in town catholic and the
well i know the minster have a nine thirty and eleven o'clock
the catholic meet in the middle of the night i think don't they
yeah the catholic are coming out at half past nine aren't they
yes i think i don't know whether it's half past eight or nine o'clock but it's certainly it's in the dark in the winter
half past eight
is it half past eight
right
UNK i think have one
half past ten
half past ten right
i don't mind the half past nine half past but i do feel concerned about those older people who've already said they couldn't possibly get for half past nine
mm
and it seems such a shame after all yes
to UNK them of the
right
some folks have actually said that have they
yes
i mean i don't yes
cos
i don't mind it myself but erm
right
i do feel concern for the older people
mhm
cos very often the older people
yeah
right
is nine thirty er that time ever been used in UNK
well yes there there's plenty of erm there's UNK for it
right
i mean perhaps colin you'd talk about for a moment
two services they have a think it's nine fifteen and ten forty five i'm not sure
er we've UNK on holiday at nine thirty
in methodist churches
UNK
yeah
we don't have to have a precedent even do we if it if it
no
meets our situation
i think you need to collect the names of the n the people who won't be able to come before nine or nine thirty and weigh it against those people who will
mm
again it's children percent
yes oh yes parents have to be asked as well
yeah
mm
and if there was er an a distinct advantage in that would be obviously beneficial wouldn't it
but if it didn't and they weren't forthcoming then erm
yeah
i know some of the sport starts about ten o'clock on sundays
right
sunday mornings
yeah
football time
well we might have er be able to speak with the people who are doing the UNK and work out the times
yes
with those
i mean if we are positively going to have junior church we could say well couldn't as we are the earlier why can't they
start later
yeah
start later
yeah
yeah
and i mean if we're going to compromise
right
bill
i was just gonna say exactly that
i it comes down to if we're gonna move it earlier why are we gonna move it earlier
and are we moving it earlier because of the er competition with sport and so on
and if so erm are we then gonna go early enough to prevent this clash
right
and erm er from what i've seen i mean people are often at football games for ten o'clock kick off and so on which means er that's just one example which means they could be away half past eight in the morning
right
yeah
so and so then
yeah
you've gotta decide if you're actually gonna avoid UNK with
mm
the sport and so on and er and then what time you're gonna go for
and alternatively we do a bit of research and find out if some compromise can be arranged
well i think the consideration and the research has got to go on for some time
mm
yeah absolutely
erm
i think just moving it earlier i s completely support what bill just said doesn't actually solve the problem
i think as well the young people have got to be motivated to come to what they find here
and i think er well pat and i have discussed that a little bit as well cos i've been under some pressure in this direction with alice
erm
yeah
mm
she's very happy to attend another worship in the day
and has come with me and bored out of her mind and not understood it
mm
and she UNK offered to come
and i think we've got to face that end of problem as well
yeah
mm
just shifting time UNK doesn't actually solve the problem
right
and we may UNK a lot of people in doing so
right
do i detect then that the general feeling is that we shouldn't even UNK with this
until you've done a bit more research
no i m no i mean full stop
no i wasn't i wasn't implying that
no but i was just sort of testing you out to see you know how you UNK
coming to junior church and worship is not a sufficient attractive proposition for our young people with regard to the competition
right
if it was a er you know if it was really attractive to them something they wanted to do they would bring about those UNK themselves
cos they would be going to their coach or team or what have you and saying look we want to
and then
so it's actually the quality of our worship that we need to improve rather than changing the time
well i think changing the time might bring about
so we will we will consider further
but you would want to put some pretty strong UNK on the whole thing
mm
mm
agreed
mm
right
thank you
that's very helpful erm i mean obviously we've yet to decide who's going to do the research and who's going to do all the considering
erm obviously i can have ad hoc conversations with different groups and i'll i'm very happy to do that
but the danger is of course that we don't cover everybody
and everyone needs to be consulted
yeah
yes
er it did occur to me i mean i was in my last church the for completely different reasons the question of the timing of the church services was brought up
and the worship consultation did institute a questionnaire that every household was asked to fill in
to talk about when th when worship would be most helpful for them to be UNK to be held
yeah
you know and to talk about many other while they were at it with this questionnaire they tackled many other subjects as well you know
what do people find UNK in worship
what would they like to see included
and er a whole host of things came up and a number of things were repeated that we were able to follow up
but interestingly a huge proportion of the people said don't change the time of the services
nothing it wasn't changed
but of course most of the people that you're asking are those who it suits
you know those who it doesn't suit don't belong to our church
so you could almost predict the answer when you think about it erm before you start to ask the questions
okay
but that's you know another suggestion
okay o a do you think we've done that to death
yes
right
i'd like to introduce a conversation about language now
see how we get on with this
the importance of language is something that we have come to appreciate more and more in recent time
we refer to the language of power for instance
that's the language that politicians and others who have powerful position use in order to make the most of their authority
we also refer to the language of love
the special language that is shared by two people who love one another
sometimes the word that they use no only terms of UNK er but other words er special words to them you know are part of their own language of love
but there's also the language that UNK
language that UNK that if you like pushes down other people
and with our growing appreciation of the importance of language there's been an UNK in language that is UNK the belief that both male and female are equal
we're also trying to speak language which is not racist
or UNK or UNK
having been at the methodist conference last week or UNK
we have a very large UNK er brother in the methodist ministry and er when the mayor of derby addressed the methodist conference he said you know he like to come to these kind of events and he'd talk about the specific sort of things
and he says he always looks out to see who is the f the local UNK tuck
and er this particular minister was all everyone was sort of looking in his direction and pointing
and er when you get up to speak at the conference you have to give your name and the reason why you're there
and er when this chap got up to speak he said tuck conference elected
l
and brought the house down
and er someone else who was on the large side also stood up and they all UNK at him and he said he'd had enough of this UNK language
but he took it all in good part
but jesus knew all about the power of language
just as jesus seemed to know about everything that there is in our life
and the way in which he used words was incredibly powerful
for he had the bi the ability to take the ordinary things of life and interpret them in an effective way
he spoke of a shepherd with his sheep
he spoke of a woman sweeping her home
and of a father's arguments with his two sons
that rings bells already
and he spoke of problems between landlords and tenants
and he used these things to illustrate his message about the kingdom of god
and of course if we can't interpret god's kingdom the christian faith in everyday language how can we interpret it
if we can't make the gospel of jesus relevant to today how can we lead other people to faith
so what do we do
what is our experience of language in this church
do we find that when we sit in worship often the language that UNK use especially when they use some of the so called theological language
they talk about salvation redemption UNK come on jack some nice long words
yeah and all you know things that it's almost expected that you will understand what they mean
which to be honest a lot of people do not understand
and as someone once said it's not the long words that we should worry about it's the short ones
yes
sin
faith
god
so you know what's your experience of the language that you hear
anyone want to say anything
i'm a great i'm a great believer in the fact that everybody should hear the gospel in their own tongue
right
therefore
well er the language they use
these words are i love them i love them redemption and UNK and so on i love them but er we've gotta put it in a different way
we've gotta put it in a modern UNK way or more UNK
right
jesus did didn't he
UNK way
yeah
it's the UNK that are making it complicated
well i think for most people who are coming into a church seeking something the inclusion of words such as you outlined puts up an enormous barrier
mm
and they would go away full of UNK of self doubt
i mean there are a couple of those words i don't know what you're talking about quite honestly
erm i don't expect that my life will change immediately if i found out about them
but if UNK if somebody put them in plain language to me
yes
that i went home with erm we had very good relevant local dialogue with the minister yesterday morning simple things within twenty five miles of our experience that made us all think very hard
i for one think that sort of thing to people searching for something makes a lot of impact
would you say though that on the whole the language that you hear UNK in worship here is relevant helpful and u easily understood
by all
are you talking about the words or the message
yeah two different things aren't they
i'm i think i'm talking about the words first of all
i think we can all get the flavour of what the message is about even if we don't understand all the language
i mean it's a bit like watching the television while you're doing the ironing
you can't be actually following the whole of the action all the time cos you have to make sure you're not burning a hole in the shirt
but you get a general flavour of what the action is about and you follow most of it
and i think that often you know listening to UNK is a bit like that especially as you don't concentrate all the time
so i think i've i mean you put me right but i think i'm talking about the words rather than the essential message
a problem with the words
right
message
it's very subjective isn't it
it depends on the skill of the UNK
right
and how well they communicate
and i mean some of the people who lead our worship are very UNK in their language
and then you know they use the same phrases and they don't communicate really
they stay where they are
er they don't move us on or they don't move me on in my thinking and they don't lay down the charge cos they're UNK and they're using
i think there's one thing though that we've got to avoid if we're going to pass any of our information across and that's the element of fashion
that you know in many of the words you came up with to start with there's an element of fashion in avoid UNK avoiding UNK and things like that
and we don't want to make that the end in itself
we had a good guide i think when it was at one of the er welcoming services to the new ministers i don't think it was yours before yours
geoffrey made a comment about select preacher because you don't particularly like the way he puts the message over
pray for him there will be a message somewhere
you know i think this is the distinction that bob was making about the words and the meaning
if we look for the fashion that's the UNK it's the meaning that's the more important
i don't think i mean to me it's a bit like dare i say it UNK to other outside forces
as regards anything else
the issue is that you know we build ourselves round the church
and we mustn't let words and other fashionable elements become too dominant
but is not the point that erm we want those who are concerned about fashionable elements to be attracted by our worship cos we want everyone to be attracted
and that we don't want to put up anything that'll be a UNK block to people coming
which i think got some business circles
right
mm
and nothing to do with the running of
my experience just to take one example of non sexist language and when i was in college in the mid eighties it was the thing you know
it all had to be his and hers or ours or whatever
is that when you actually sit down and you know we if we were to actually cross out the words that were sexist in the service book you know er and put the non sexist alternatives in
like er we have UNK against our fellow men you know that one we say in the prayer of confession
now it's actually much more UNK to say we have UNK against our neighbours
cos we're supposed to love our neighbours not our fellow men
and that is the non sexist alternative
to fellow men
we have UNK against our neighbours
now if we were actually to do that in our service books which is what one of the things that the methodist conference suggests we consider just crossing out and putting in the correct non UNK language i bet you that eighty percent of our church would be up in arms
but my experience is also if we'd bought the books that had been printed neighbours in the first place no one would have noticed the difference
when you pray in non sexist way
when you pray in a sexist way those who are concerned about it notice
and therefore i believe it's worth making the effort to use non sexist language because no one notices and using sexist language may just UNK and put off one or two
and that's not what i'm in the business of doing
now you can use that then about all these other examples of you know UNK and er and er racism and that sort of thing
it's interesting how when you know we meet the standard nobody can take it i notice it really
do you want to say something colin
well i think that's illustrated by printing off the words i am your son i am adopted in your family i am your child i am adopted in your family
yeah
if you print the words UNK child adopted in your family
if the word son there you the decide sing child if you feel more comfortable with that you're up in arms
yes
you might as well go and sing something else
yeah that's right
i'm actually more concerned about sort of this sort of UNK prayer language
yeah
that we get
right
and er i don't think i'm being too sort of general here if i sort of quote the place of the local preacher or the person who's leading our worship
sort of thinking ah this prayer is for the children i'll pray for the wonderful world that god's created
right
and that really does UNK me
and if kids have haven't shut off before then they always get that prayer if the preacher is being particularly sensitive or UNK to you know you talk about a god of nature
in actual fact our children have feelings of joy and happiness and sadness just as we do and they have they have the same emotions as we do
and i really do think that is poor
do you believe that the language then is not a big issue in our fellowship
can anyone tell me why we put it on the list of things we wanted to discuss then
i think you just i think you've hit it there
right
the language is not an issue in our fellowship
right
i think the holy spirit
if we're to go outside the windows
right
the holy spirit is a bigger issue
the holy spirit is a bigger issue
a man can say a most extraordinary thing there holy spirit it'll come across
right
it does in itself
i think er on the er the walls bringing the people in is if they understand that they do not believe er or that within their heart then that's the difficulty that's the sort of bridge we've got to get over
it's hopefully through the understanding that they will believe but
yes the words are important to people's understanding aren't they
yeah
they're not actually that im they're not important about bringing them to faith
though understanding is perhaps the first step
yeah
mm
and er of course the point that jack makes is the point that brings them to faith is the work of the holy spirit and not the work of anybody else
is there anything i mean i think i know the answer to the question but is there anything we can do to improve the language that's UNK in our church
to help it to be more acceptable or is it already acceptable to those who do not yet attend
he says in confidence and faith
i think we could be more sensitive to those people who worship for one reason or another worship on their own
right
was picked up in the church family service church
yeah
yeah we discussed last week
yeah
yeah
last time we met sorry
okay
i would think it could be helpful now and then to have simple explanations of some of the words used say erm where we're building to a communion service
yeah
for instance
and whilst in the membership classes we go through an explanation and a discussion after that we tend to just repeat them
mm
and erm maybe the text for the day could be some of the language we used in services like that
well actually it is yes it is
yes
yes i mean that's very important
i mean one of the things i was taught when i my training for work with children was that erm it's alright to use big l long words for children as long as you explain to them what the words mean
er it doesn't mean that you always got to use simple language
because i mean children need to grow and understand what longer words mean as well
and you can talk about erm er UNK shall we say as long as you explain to them what UNK means
erm and i think it's exactly the same with some of the words that you know that i quoted earlier
that we can use them but we must not always assume that everybody understand what they mean
and i think it's that hidden assumption that a lot of people find offensive
so you've got to be in the know you've got to be in the club to understand the jargon
mm
i think it's just into my mind i was assuming you meant the free speech within the church the open prayer and the and the UNK
which i don't have a problem with
but the thing i've noticed coming in for the first time a and two prayers spring to mind one's
right
and one is the UNK
er i just can't think of the words i mean but if you if you run through those it's quite off putting
and i remember being eight nine ten eleven years old and knowing them all off by heart
yes
and not knowing what they meant
mm
hadn't got a clue
we UNK thy holy name
and er
we are not worthy even to gather up the UNK under your table oh gracious lord
yeah
it is thy nature always to have mercy
yes
it's er it isn't it isn't everyday language and i'm not sure that it helps us express what we really want to say
you could take it a step further and with seeing that on the paper yesterday morning in service we read the twenty third UNK
try reading that and explaining the words of that to somebody who has no knowledge of the christian faith i thought was quite a challenge
but some of the UNK we sing as well
right
right
well perhaps we ought to give people a s a list a piece of paper and a pencil when they come into church one day and say write down all the words that you hear today or sing today that you do not understand
and make it completely anonymous
it'd be an interesting exercise wouldn't it
mm
well we could er make a dictionary
so somebody came i don't know who it was recently and observed communion
different type of communion
nigel brought an alternative UNK
didn't he
was the language in that simpler
it wasn't that much simpler
no
it was different
different
i mean the methodist church has launched six new UNK for communion as experiments to see how people react to them
can you remember we used on at lent
on for lent and UNK
erm and i thought on the whole the language was UNK
i mean it was just lifted from the scripture and put into a prayer or whatever
i mean i found it you know i mean very strong from that point of view
er but it wasn't particularly everyday language
and why can't we have a communion service in everyday language
that surely could be UNK the prayers on the UNK
and come out with a more meaningful prayer
that we could introduce to our neighbours first they came through the door
i think you've got to be careful though
if you go too far down that road you lose your sense of UNK and wonder which i think is important personally
that i agree
okay
bill you don't need to keep putting your hand up it's okay
we're very informal really
you started off by erm talking about how er jesus tackled the problem and er it seems to me that erm is what is a very great example really
i mean he'd use so often the experience of the people who were listening so when a went down to they all knew what he was talking about
right
and then he would say the kingdom of heaven you may or may not know what that is depending
mm
on whether you're in the club or not but he said
yeah
the kingdom of heaven is like this
yes
and he and erm i think if we kept if we kept that at the front of our minds
mm
when we used it
yeah
erm er or tackling issues like you know UNK or
yes
and then i think that help
absolutely i mean i the trouble i'd find it is the right way round to tackle it
i mean you could think of a brilliant illustration and then you work the message out from it which is the wrong way round
cos you're actually supposed to think of what the message the essential message you want to get across and then work your illustration out accordingly
now that's the hard thing
now i'm i mean i give you an example
tomorrow i go into radio nottingham to record three more thought for the days
three ninety second slots
i'm talking about cold sausages UNK up after the kids and a school activity day
and you start with i started with those three things and worked out three essential messages
not at all linked okay
if you want to know what the messages are you have to listen on tuesday wednesday and thursday next week by the way
but you know if you wanted to talk about UNK as a for instance that's growing in grace and UNK becoming more the person that god wants us to be
as we grow in faith
more UNK more holy
erm and i a work of god's grace a in us to make us like that
now how do you then starting from that UNK bring that you know into everyday language
you have to do either your own or somebody else's er bit of the story
yeah
and we're not very good at that
no
we don't practise it er we rely on er the sort of language form of the sermon which er is UNK largely after the fifth
okay
because of our tradition of relying so much on the sermon
mm
we do yes
and i don't resent that at all
but i can see you know i mean that in itself is a UNK to many people isn't it
now i wonder how many people came to north last night because they knew there wasn't gonna be a sermon
they got a five minute UNK talk but they didn't get a sermon
interesting
okay
have we finished
i mean it's been a helpful conversation erm you know i'm not s i you know you persuaded me rightly or wrongly that it's not that much of an issue in our fellowship but it's something that we do always need to be aware of
mhm
the words that we use
i mean anyone who comes into contact with UNK and them trying to grasp our language knows you know has an insight into how difficult into how difficult it can be for some people
that's just a little aside on that
the most common thing i've come across
going round is it still plugged in
it i think
no it's not he explained to me exactly what i had to do before he went
turn the tape over
that's right
yeah
okay let's move on from language then
let's er just give a little bit more consideration to church family services
and er all age worship
now i mean i bring it back to you on the agenda for two reasons
first of all because we said in the minutes last night er last week last time whenever it was
further consideration is to be given to this topic but it was agreed that it would be generally more helpful if we understand that family services were not necessarily for those with families but a celebration of the whole church
therefore they should be UNK church family services
so i bring it back because we said we would consider it further
and also because the whole issue of all age worship was one of the things that we put on the list of what we want to discuss
and i bring it to you in the context of our conversation about junior church
cos bill's mother wrote a very interesting letter to the methodist recorder last week
which you've probably not read
which basically says if friday sunday school works then let's have it
you know it hasn't all got to happen on a sunday
no
and one of the prime moves for all age worship when it first started was to say you know if christian education is going to take place at other times than on a sunday then what do we do together for all ages in worship
you know if the children are not going to go out and the adults are not going to have their own education classes which let's be honest most of us don't attend or have anything to do with
then worship has got to UNK all age groups
and so those who devised all age worship in the in the sort of early eighties or late seventies when it was the thing devised it either to be just worship or to be both education and worship
whereby the whole church family broke up into groups for a period of education and then came together for a time of celebration and worship
which drew all the UNK of all that they'd learnt together
now this may be another way of solving problem
of saying let's have christian education on another day of the week let's have all age worship in whatever form on a sunday morning
and let's have our traditional methodist preaching service on a sunday night
now i'll throw all that into the UNK pot and we'll see what we come out with
excellent idea
now that is i mean all age worship every sunday
yes why not
be a radical UNK we'd have to learn an awful lot about what it really meant
none of this playing around with it like we do with our family services at the moment
where you think of what this week's UNK going to be
if we're honest
it's always got some good theological or religious or christian point about it so
i don't see that any barrier really exists to including any age group other night of the week
but i do see that would perhaps to UNK for young people again
as another draw on their time homework etcetera
yeah
erm the little bit we do of boy's brigade
yeah
seems to be quite useful nowadays
it's quite interesting sometimes how you get a question back or you get closer to the young people as a result
maybe we should encourage that sort of leap more erm even perhaps other people in our church family being involved in that
mhm
i mean people who would not normally be involved with young boys or young girls into a quarter of an hour of contact
that could provide a stronger link to sides
does anybody want to say any more about our present church family services
bearing in mind that i'm taking one in a UNK time
and we're having a baptism
okay let's move on
i'm sorry i've lost me UNK now
what we gonna do now stella
you've taken my agenda
i've taken your agenda have i
yeah
well i've taken me own as well
is it under there is that it
oh there's yours there's mine
thank you
should children be allowed to receive holy communion discuss
what's a UNK point
what's the UNK
are you asking me
if there if there is a point scripture
i don't know whether there is or there isn't
can i just say something
yes
let me write your name down
about necessarily taking it but i think they certainly ought to be made aware of sort of what it involves and what it really means
cos i remember as a little one i hadn't got a clue and the whole meaning of it was lost completely
right
and i think when you're little you don't really understand and unless your parents tell you then
er the main UNK block that people point to for this is the i think it's in paul's writings when he says that the communion must not be taken UNK or without you know due thought and UNK
UNK
you know i can't exactly sort of quote you word for word
but you know there is an instruction there that we must we must be careful and prepared to examine ourselves in all UNK and truth before we come to communion
now traditionally the argument has run has said
well you know if we take that scripture seriously
mm
then certainly children should not be receiving communion
how do other UNK tackle that reading
that's not catholic view
i mean they encourage fairly early er
yes they do
confirmation
their conception of salvation is a bit different isn't it
well i'm not sure i know
i'm not saying we should
no i don't really know the answer to the question
i don't know the answer myself
but it but it's often UNK as being of the right mind and having the right attitude about understanding
yes
what they're doing
now i mean many of the erm practices of religion i'm not sure i understand them all but i still take part in them
you know
yeah
i don't understand how a car works but i still drive it
mm
what age are you talking about
of a child
well any you know what does it UNK
you know how any age
er you know i think i er it's all up for UNK really
i mean once you can eat and drink
yes
you know
why not
imagine if the family is meeting round a table and the dish is passed round and the children are not allowed to take any
i know a UNK that was taking communion
right
what age are we talking about
what
this UNK she was a w a woman
she was
oh right yes
she was born again
you'd certainly have to rewrite the communion service for young people to understand it
mm
they are smashing
yeah
yes
i think it's a case of as karen says explaining things
yes
bringing the younger children into church just these last few weeks
yeah
has created a lot of questions
i mean one little boy came in and he said what's that UNK doing on the table
aye
so i
and this time he did say you know the cross
and he wanted to know why the books were there and
you know there's so many questions that need answering
yes
erm because these are the sort of things that don't come over at school
they might tell them the stories the bible stories at school but i mean the general church
yeah
worship
they don't understand do they
no
but i should think it'd be quite simple to put across
the body the represents the body the blood the wine represents the blood
that'd be sufficient would it matt
well it doesn't require a great deal does it
i mean if we're gonna do justice to communion it's about UNK it's about UNK it's about celebration it's about and there's the corporate nature of it too
coming together
yeah
and receiving together and eating together
which takes us right back to you know to the temple in jerusalem and UNK and all sorts
i'm not suggesting we should drag all these things up but they're all important UNK of what communion is about
UNK isn't it
yes that was one of the bases on which communion is
and the blood UNK you see comes into it as well doesn't it
yeah
once you start
going back to your earlier words about the illustrations and the message what are we trying to achieve
are we trying to achieve erm unity or bringing children in to do something in a corporate way
or do we want them really to understand what they're doing first presumably
so our long term goal surely is to allow children to have communion
so long as they understand or we have UNK to them why we want them to do that
what it means
and at the moment i don't think we do communicate that
now do you know i if the UNK of the UNK did the children join in there
cos christ was
yes
just re UNK that
the whole family would come together it would be yes a total family celebration
absolutely
i mean people travel from all over the world to be with their family for UNK didn't they
i don't see what difference it makes a child not understanding there's plenty i don't understand
cos the UNK one at the UNK was the one who answered the questions wasn't it
cos they asked these questions about why it was being held and everything
and the child the smallest child is trained to give the answers
child
me my view is this for what it's worth er we have two UNK in the methodist church baptism and holy communion
sacrament is to do with god's free grace being available to all
if we say that children cannot receive communion we'll UNK ought also to s ask question about whether infants should be UNK
it's the same grace that we're talking about
and if infants are UNK as they are in our church then i would find it very difficult to deny a child to come to communion
and i believe that we should have a policy whereby children would normally receive communion when they are in a communion service
and that includes older people who are not yet confirmed or made members of the church
that's the first point
the second point is to echo the er the words that matt just said about that lady who was converted
john wesley was very firm that communion was a means of grace
and when he talks about a means of grace he means something that happens to you that can bring you to faith
and he used to UNK several different means of grace
and he believed as matt you know gave testimony to the fact that when you come to communion you can actually be converted
and therefore to only say those who love the lord can receive is actually a UNK that it's a means of grace
so that's why i always say those who seek to love the lord
right
so that's the second thing
er the third thing is that if we do accept that it should be a general practice in our church the parents of the children who are within our church family need to be told
and it shouldn't just something that's forced
and if they choose to withdraw their children from communion then that's their decision not ours
erm and that a you know and i would go along with everything we've said about UNK children and UNK the whole congregation let's be honest
and i have got a number of family services that just do communion
and finish up with communion
i mean we did have one at easter time didn't we
yeah
but in just the little few words you used then i would have thought that many parents in this church would react positively
the difference between seeking the love and loving that expression that you used
i would have thought you'd get a very good response
and i think the illustration about baptism hadn't really struck me before tonight
and i think it's very significant
perhaps i'll write an article for contact erm along those lines and see what sort of response we get
but would there be anyone against
erm this is this is a pet shop in
and erm how long has this shop been going for
be sixty one years
sixty one years
since nineteen twenty six
and it's always been actually situated at this very shop here on
exactly in the same place
mhm
that's right
you must have quite a lot of memories
yeah well
a lot has happened
has
er in the years i can assure you
right so at the point we broke off you were saying about things that things have changed quite a lot
what was it like i mean you know you er when you first moved here that was it nineteen twenty six
er yeah
as a child
i was a child
at school
yes
so that was obviously that was well before the flats were built
so what was it actually like
what kind of housing was it across where the flats are now
i believe they're coming down very shortly
er yeah they were UNK
all semi that's right UNK
two houses an entry
mhm
that's right
all the way up road right to street
and er they were good houses
er definitely good houses
so what actually happened that were they were brought down
well this is the powers that be isn't it
er i suppose really the fact that all the streets down road were er very narrow
and er i think some people might have called it a UNK i suppose they were in a way
but there were some very good people lived down those streets
and they cleared the entire area
mhm
the area that you can see
yeah
right to the UNK
and erm er built the flats in place
they pulled the houses down all the shops down
because there were shops all the way down UNK
from here
and er put up the flats
er it's different
it definitely is different to what it
mhm
used to be
was it i mean when the actual decision was made to ge to get rid of that property that was there prior to the flats was that a controversial decision or was it welcomed by local people who
er be difficult to say because er looking at it purely from the UNK side of the business
yeah
if memory serves me correct there were about say four hundred dwellings
yeah
and they put up the flats and i think i'm right there is about seven hundred dwellings
that's right
yeah
so there's more people into the area for the shops
and er looking at it from that light it was er obviously a better proposition
but somehow well i don't know things didn't seem to work out
er it was ne it's never been the road that it was prior to that
mhm
yeah what was
never
even er well with the er extra houses that you might say the flats the extra dwellings
and it's never been the road it was
up unto er i think the flats came about nineteen sixty seven i think
something like that nineteen sixty seven or nineteen sixty eight some where around there
but er it's not the road that it used to be
not business wise
mhm
so w did you used to have quite a lot of customers who came up from th from there
little streets you mean
yes
oh yes
oh yes
mhm
very many
mhm
i mean this is personally for our place and i'm sure all the shops did the same
they all er traded on the
and er well it was rather good
and what kind of community was it
community
i mean did people tend to know everyone know each other 's name
stay together er families stay together er i thi mind you i think this is pretty general anywhere but from what i understand but er when er sons and daughters marry they invariably got a house just down the street near to mum
they didn't move out of the area necessarily
mhm
i won't say none of them did but the majority stayed together so you might say this gave this close knit of people all UNK relative wise
which as i say er it was alright
it maybe not the modern way but it was
mhm
er certainly the area is better from the point of these little streets going
it's just a bit unfortunate in my opinion what they put up in the place
if they put houses up it'd be a different situation
mhm
but they didn't
they really out
mhm
what do you think went wrong
don't know
i wouldn't like to say
was it
i don't really know
mhm
was it i mean was there w i mean wit with regard to custom did you get much custom have you had much custom from people in the flats
oh yes
oh yes
i mean again you know this is speaking personally of the trade
yeah
you see when this thing first happened er all those old houses they all had some sort of garden
it was the order of the day
you didn't build a house without a garden
even if it was UNK it was they still got a little bit of land
and er of course people er pursue their own hobbies of pets
or whatever it may be
and this is er obviously ideal for us
well when they put the flats up i mean they couldn't keep pets and they hadn't got a garden and there was a period of time when er we were rather concerned
from fr the only from the trade angle the business angle
but like so many other things er they say when one door closes another one opens so the people in the flats they hadn't got a garden then they er went to town on er pot plants indoor plants
in place of a garden
and to offset the er not being able to have pets as such pigeons and UNK of birds and things like that
erm they went into fish
they could have as many fish tanks as they wanted so things came right again
and er well as i say they took the place of gardens and er birds really
mhm
birds i'm talking now not the one in the cage er the UNK and the pigeons and the chickens and all that sort of thing
which they used to have down those streets
so really it's not worked out too badly
i mean er now we're in the second flow of them being UNK again so i don't know what's gonna happen for the future
mhm
i'll have to wait and see
mm
do you welcome the flats that are c the fact the flats are coming down or are you sorry about it do you feel
well i'm er i'm actually sorry about it in and that
but i think it will be better for the area
the flats coming down
if they put up dwellings
mhm
houses as opposed to flats
er i personally think that would be better for the area yes
mhm
they whether they're going to do that i don't really know yet not really certain
i can't seem to have yet heard definitely that this is going to be
i hope it is
mhm
how has the actual erm shopping complex when i th the area in general how has that changed erm over the erm
over the years
over the years
i mean obviously for thirty
well it was always said that and street were the two best shopping roads in nottingham
and er i quite believe it
i don't know much about street but er i can say this that on if you started at the top at road and walked down to er well just past where we are you could buy anything
and not only just er the cheaper things quality
you could buy both
it doesn't matter what you wanted you could buy anything whether it be as i say er the cheaper line of goods in whatever category they might fall or the better class
mhm
and er well now i think there's a lot of things that you can't purchase on this road
from what i understand you have got to go out of the road to get to get er well this er well whatever it is this
yeah
type of thing
i know there's an awful lot you can get on the road but not like it used to be
mhm
so to me it is not as good as it was as a shopping area
mhm
what about for traders i mean erm obviously you can't really c er why you can't comment on the fact that er how your father o can you comment on how your father actually moved here in the first place
i mean what attracted him to
ooh that no i couldn't answer that er only the fact that er he'd been in the pet business all his life
mhm
but not in nottingham down in london
mhm
and he moved up here after the war world war one
and i don't know what he did in between then and er oh he had a we had a sweet shop on road
that's right
but he obviously wanted to get in his own trade and i assume place came up
for sale i would imagine
anyway he moved into here er like i say nineteen twenty six
and er been here ever since
mhm
er well that's really it in that sense
mm
erm i mean my father died eventually and er the business passed on to meself
and now my son's in it with me so hopefully he will carry it on when the time comes
mhm
so there's the
i don't know
this business has been in erm family hands since nineteen twenty six
yes
that's sixty that's for sixty odd years
that's sixty one years
that's right
yeah
yeah
there must be a lot of pride actually in it then erm
it is rather nice i must admit
er it is rather nice
mhm
yes
i must i think it is anyway
but it's now in its you might say third generation mightn't you
basically
and has it cha you know the actual erm things that you sell the actual
the trade itself how's that changed
oh yes it's changed yes
well i mean you've used the word the pet shop
yeah
or the pet trade
yeah
er which it is
mhm
but way back er there wasn't such a thing as a pet shop
not as you know it
they were corn shops which is what this was
er that's like i say chickens pigeons and various other animals obviously rabbits and dogs and cats
and it was the corn shop that started selling the dog and cat biscuits
of which there weren't too many
i think there were sufficient but there weren't too many
er well through progression through whatever people giving up chickens and pigeons and all that sort of thing
oh and in case of this particular area not being allowed to keep them
so you're not a corn shop any more
but of course this is where you came into the pet shop
you UNK for pets
as opposed to well chickens and pigeons
er and that's how it is today
dogs and cats of course birds and er since the war erm second war erm in the fifties er the UNK side started to take over and er people kept fish
cold water fish and then er what are generally known as tropical fish which are basically fresh water tropical fish and maybe this last fifteen years or so er a step up from that they've gone onto tropical marine fish
which is how the business is today
and we also did in those old days pre war a big garden trade
seeds which were sold loose and all the UNK and er erm UNK that go with it
plant pot etcetera
well again since the war and er probably since about the sixties the garden centres have taken over a lot on that
but we still sell the seeds and we still sell the UNK but we don't sell them loose any more they're in fancy packets
which people seem to prefer
and er again they're some of the side of the trade that has altered but the basics are still there
it's still er a garden shop in that sense
but not s not so no the stuff is not sold in the same way
we just have UNK seeds like nearly everyone else
and er UNK we s tell lo still sell loose and packet them ourselves but it has altered
but the garden UNK still there anyway
mhm
what about erm how was it that you became involved in erm was it having looked round the shop erm is it you UNK in is erm fish
ah i see what you mean yes
yes
ah well that was when my son came in the business
yes
because prior to that we hadn't sold fish as such
UNK yes and that s a few cold water fish but nothing much
and it was he that er started the er the UNK side
and er eventually when we got the ne purchased the next door premises we decided to turn that entirely into UNK
mhm
and er what we term the front shop the main shop if you like that's still the pet shop
and er the next door shop is the UNK where all the UNK are
mhm
but it was he that started the UNK trade
er it would be about nineteen seventy perhaps
mhm
one thing that interests me erm is you know a lot of the shops haven't survived
you know a lot of the erm shops that have been here for many years
mhm
eventually disappeared from for various reasons
mm
what do you think it is about that's sort of helped this shop survive for so many years
to keep this one going
yeah i mean thi is now sixty one years which
well i don't really know
UNK that er it might be the fact that always have we had what i would term an outside trade
by that i mean partially out of this area
mhm
and er i mean that was pre war i'm talking of even there
we had customers that came or we delivered to out of the area
and we've still got them
so maybe that's kept us going when the times weren't so good as they might be
when the local UNK er declined
as i say which came about when they built the flats and filled those
but we've still got those outside er customers
by outside i'm talking obviously of er
mhm
places like that
mhm
and we have got one or two families that still trade with us their parents traded with us
and their sons or daughters or whatever still trade with us
and that maybe that's the reason
mhm
am i right in saying that you've also been very you've also changed with the times as well and adjusted
well we sort of had to obviously
yeah
we've had to
erm we could the needs of the customers are different
er through the er local scene i suppose
mhm
cos you were saying for example with the fact that the flats they erm people what they actually wanted to buy from here erm UNK from what yeah
that fr the people in the houses had
that's right
it was still basically pets but a different type of pets
mhm
or a different type of UNK maybe better word cos i don't know you can't really count chickens and pigeons as in the way of pets
although they are they must be to the people concerned but i mean a UNK usually a dog cat or bird isn't it
when you say i've got a pet whatever
yeah
mhm
moving on to look at the fact i mean you had erm and it isn't the fact that you're still working in the shop you're still helping the shop you've had forty years in which you actually lived here didn't you about forty years
yes forty years
were they were they happy years
ooh they were
yeah
definitely
mhm
oh yes
and did you get to know a lot of people in the obvious well do you still know a lot of people in the area
yes er
the older people er erm and some of their erm children
which are now sort of grown up but er known them all my life
and the older people er i've obviously known those mor nearly all my life as well
oh yes
happy days here
i've no UNK
mm
i mean we were brought up here
didn't do me any harm
what kind of community has it been having lived here having had so many years in which you've actually had i mean ei either lived here for forty years plus erm from many other years you've actually been working here in UNK in addition
yes
