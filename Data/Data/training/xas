erm what kind of community had there been here i mean erm is there mu er is there much community spirit in would you say or not
i think there is
mhm
you're talking of today
yeah today
yes
i think there is UNK
compared with previously
yeah probably are
compared with pre
probably not so much as previously
mhm
but i think there is a community spirit here yes
mhm
but i think no i wouldn't have thought that it er was as much as er as it was previously
mhm
no
i wouldn't have thought so
mhm
but certainly there is a there is the s the spirit here
and without a doubt
mhm
but then see people live different lives today
er and again i don't know er it's only my thoughts that everybody's in such a hurry today through pressure of this and pressure of that
perhaps they don't have time to stand and talk like we used to
erm and that may be the reason
mhm
that you've got to get on with your thing and get your shopping or whatever it is done quick to get home to do whatever they do at home
whereby you know going back a bit it was quite the accepted thing to stand and have a chat for ten twenty minutes and er life was at a slower pace
which it is i would assume anywhere
i don't think it's er anything to do with area or a this town this city or this
mhm
i mean people move faster now they don't have time
i don't know why they don't have time but er they don't
mhm
the actual flats gonna be coming down
do you think that they erm were an asset or not to the actual community when they ac i mean erm looking at how things were in prior to the flats being built and
mm
erm the couple of years since i mean have they what impact have they had on the area in general if any
the flats
yeah
well i don't know er
well you j you're sitting
in all in all fairness they're not in my opinion not exactly the greatest thing to look at in the country are they
they don't sort of UNK you one with oh dear look at that isn't that nice
i mean it's a dwelling i think it's fine they're very nice so i understand
but looking purely at the outside bit if they'd have had some whitewash on i think they'd have looked better
quite honestly
but er i think that has not improved it
i think perhaps as i say i'd have had some colour
it might had er i it could well have er given a different appearance to people coming through
the UNK by not the people that live here
er but that's just i say that is my opinion
mhm
erm they really do look a little bit UNK a little bit grey
well they are grey looking cos that's the colour of them
mhm
but er i would have thought they would have presented themselves better had they have been er well a little bit more colour about it
mhm
i mean you get normal houses i know they're only red bricks but they've got different coloured doors and different coloured window frames and things like that
which er well to me it looks nice
but they are all the same
the grey had taken the place of the red bricks and as you can look out now you can see them
all the windows are the same colour
and UNK all the doors are the same colour
UNK er nothing to show out or stand out or look rather pleasant
mhm
i mean as i say very good
mhm
have you had much contact with anyone in people in the flats
in what way
as a trader a
customers
yeah
quite a lot
mhm
and although it's quite easy to it's quite difficult to sorry it's quite difficult to erm to UNK i mean how have you found the people compared erm people ever discuss the flats or
not really no
no not really
i mean do you find most people happy UNK living there or
yes they seem just ordinary people
mhm
to me
yeah
mhm
they're quite appear quite well i don't know whether they're happy living in the flats or not but they seem quite normal people they talk about the normal thing that people always talked about
mhm
and er
no they i think they're the same type of people by and large as we had here before
really
do
er they seem just ordinary people
UNK i mean certainly in recent years anyway 's had a lot of erm bad publicity in the press and certainly in the press and
oh yes
t v
i mean how far do you think the publicity that the area's had has been from your considerable experience would be
i yes
i think er it did get a very bad name
but it is i think it is far different now to what it was five or six seven years ago
yeah
that er when you get these er UNK or whatever it is it takes an awful lot of living down
and i think a lot of people outside the area perhaps do not accept it
you know it's er it's got the bad publicity that it had and it's still got it well i don't think it has to be
it's far different i think to what it was as i say er well five ten years ago
what are the difference that the last five ten years
what kind of difference have round in ten years
oh i think the people are different somehow or other
i know they're probably the same people that lived here then but er there's all this talk about problems and troubles er we we've never noticed it
on the other hand at six o'clock at night i've gone home
mhm
so i can't speak for that obviously
mhm
but er they seem quite ordinary people to me
mhm
people i know and the only ones i really know are those that come in the shop
and they're just people
mhm
and they've got the usual UNK and UNK like everybody else including myself
i've got my UNK and UNK but haven't we all
mhm
but er you know the ordinary people
mm
so how are things you know said that in the last few say in five years that things have changed
what k what kind what's changed in the short time are the things wh when i've been talking to them about the publicity you said that the last few years there's there has been
it's
very recent there has been changes
it there is a difference
mhm
there is a difference now
and to the better
so the thing you're saying you're saying that people
ooh yes
yes to what they were
mhm
yes
mhm
so you've er you're pretty hopeful about the future
i am if they put houses up there yes
mhm
that's purely a UNK business thing obviously
what about for the overall area i mean do you s do you think that what kind of future do you think has
cos i mean
well er i would think erm
both for the i'm talking about both for the from the UNK point of view and also for the also
yes
er i would think it should have a decent future myself
if you know providing things keep going along the lines
mm
that er i understand they are going to go along
mhm
oh yes i think so
what where are you i've missed that actually the quite interesting just to briefly ask you about th erm when we s when i saw you last time you were telling me something about actually erm a bit about yourself how what kind of person actually saying you know personality what kind of things wh how would you actually describe yourself say if i said to you erm what kind of person are you
me
what kind of q yeah what are the UNK what are the kind of qualities that have helped you get by over the years
just an ordinary person
i don't think i've got any special qualities at all
i'm sure i haven't
no er take life as it comes you know
times we've all had bad times
mhm
and UNK we'll have some more bad times but er no
i think that i'm just an ordinary i hope i am anyway
i would like to think i am just an ordinary person
er i don't really know anything special about me
had a normal UNK normal schooling
normal early work life
mhm
i mean
what did you do in your
you was that
when i first started work
yeah
yeah
well like any other shop lad and although worked with me father i was still a shop lad
er out on the shop bike and cleaning the windows and all that sort of thing
with everybody else who worked in shops did the same thing
all the UNK
we didn't start at the top in those days
and work your way in
up or down
you started at the bottom
mhm
i didn't regret it
they were happy days
and wh when you when you look at your actual erm UNK etcetera UNK
oh yes round here
oh they were good
what school is it you went to
i went to
which is not called that now i went to road
and then after that i went to a public school but er to those years er i just followed the pattern
after that was that and then on to road
er that was just normal UNK
mhm
i don't regret them
not one little bit
is this erm looking at the a moving on to look at the erm this area for actual for traders and so on is it as attractive erm for traders to actually move into the area as it was previously or not
erm
well
that's a bit difficult er i would probably think not
yeah
i would probably think not
er quite so today as it used to be
er i'm only UNK on that there are one or two empty shops
mhm
around
fortunately not too many on this little patch we're on
i understand further up the road there are
mhm
well that must mean something
must do
mhm
well do you think actually so to make it more what could be done to actually make it more attractive to traders
to traders
yeah
cos obviously
ah
you can cos you can contrast it with when it was a very successful area
mm
well
you could get virtually anything at one stage
you could
so what could you do to kind of
er
i don't really know
it would be asking too much to bring all the shops back on
yeah
patch obviously
mhm
and make it one long road of shops
that may have been the reason
that may have been the decline that they chopped all these shops out and so er well as far as this side of the road right hand side coming from the city end
er all of sudden you get the UNK and the shops stop
whether that is it i don't know but it could well be
you stop there
you don't go any further
and i know i don't really know
not to be able to answer that one
to make it more attractive
perhaps if we get dwellings as i say up here
mhm
these small houses again yes that could that could have er an impact i think
mhm
it could well do
it might bring more people into the area
mhm
other
who do the shopping like
mhm
so actually quite a few factors what actually goes there the flats could be quite an important factor for the area
i think so
i really do
yes
mhm
i really do think that
mhm
is th another area that i didn't cover actually when we were looking at the flats was erm some people have s have around said that erm flats when they were first up in the first few years erm were a contrast with the later years in that erm they didn't have many of the problems many of the problems associated with the flats now UNK we were not in existence in the early days of the flats
do you would you say
no i don't think they were
if they were they didn't manifest UNK
mhm
so
i would think er very little er problems er if that's the word
er as you say about the first eight years
mhm
er it's something like that
ten years perhaps
no there were just erm a load of flats across there instead of houses
no
mhm
so is it have you idea what's actually changed why
why
things were okay early on and
i don't know
was it a fairly sudden thing or a rapid change
it probably
was it sudden or fairly slow change
UNK itself perhaps over a period of three four years
mhm
or five six years perhaps
something like that
mhm
the reasons why are i d i don't know
mhm
as i say the majority of the people whom i come in contact with they're just people
just ordinary people
mhm
so you felt that
the could be anywhere
mhm
so am i right in saying you find the people in the flats fine
yeah
no problem at all
the people i've come in contact with definitely
no trouble at all
straight into finish now most of the areas
erm that started and let's look at the actual future
erm
mm
so UNK looking ahead erm how do you see the future for this business
do you i mean do you think you can
oh dear
yeah
well
i mean you start started going sixty one years
erm so
i er
what about it's chances to of century
going the next
of ge of getting to a hundred years old
i would think that's rather unlikely
er
you think that's rather unlikely
well i do because er as i say my son more or less runs it now
and he hasn't any children
so there you go from there
and er
yeah
it'd be nice er but i shouldn't think he will be having a family now
so after he there isn't anyone
mhm
to carry it on
mhm
i'm right in saying that he's he you know he's had er many
he's got h he he's likely to have many years yet isn't he working for
oh he's got er yeah he's got quite a few
er he could well i'll be eighty six
oh he could take us into the two thousand
yes
that'd be quite an achievement really
and you could take into account the fact that
that's right
you started in the year of the general strike in nineteen twenty six
now that's a thought yeah
no i've not looked at it that way
mm
you mean you've never thought
yes
occurred to me that
yes we did didn't we
yes
i mean
aye
do you do you think erm your father when he started the shop in twenty six would ever imagined that it could possibly go on to the end of the century
ah well i don't know
he might he probably had his thoughts
can't remember him ever talking to me about this
but he probably did have his thoughts
bearing in mind that although not here as i said but he worked for his father
and his father worked for his father
so the yes it's been going back a the name the firm in that sense i think goes back a lot of years
but i say as far as nottingham's concerned er only since er like i say nineteen twenty six
but er yes he probably did have thoughts on that
i think we'll end on that one
thank you thanks very much for your help
that's quite alright
thank you
you're welcome
er okay
firstly er what is the area covered by the police district
well geographically it starts from the roundabout at the bottom of road where road meets UNK
and then along road turn left onto road and go right past the city hospital turn left onto road through to lane road to the junction with the
turn right to the roundabout
then it covers the whole of estate
if you go left along road to the crossroads near wh where the flats
er turn left onto road to the railway line and it cuts back along the railway line er which eventually comes out on the ring road
and again continue along the ring road to the lane roundabout
turn right onto lane to the bottom near the pub turn right again on road onto er road
then onto road and then turn left onto road
along there to the recreation ground turn left onto street down to UNK turn right along UNK back to road
and that is the geographical boundary
yeah
are these split into UNK
yeah that is the or the road police UNK
that is further UNK into beats what they call beats
which is eight separate areas
which UNK in name and
mhm
er do you feel that the area that is covered there is enough er staff to cover that area
yeah erm the amount of police necessary for each area is based on all sorts of statistics and for the UNK statistics that we have for this area we have or the chief UNK decided that he'll allocate a hundred and two police officers to police this area which we find adequate
there are times of course when we get very busy there are times when we get UNK
but overall the allocation is about correct
er how did the national policing policy affect
after nineteen eighty one to the present day
well as you know in nineteen eighty one there were there were troubles all over the country which seemed to start from problems in UNK
and that er went across to sort of UNK side in manchester UNK and eventually to
er as a result of that lord UNK was appointed by the government to look into the problems
and to report on it
er and one of his findings was that there was not really enough liaison between erm groups of people in the community
er he found that there was a big a big UNK between the police and certain groups
so he said
look get into the community and find out what the problems are
so consequently after eighty one or after the troubles in eighty one erm there was an extra allocation of police officers in and they were told to police mainly the area of the flats complex which was perhaps where the troubles where in
mm
er what er what special problems did the flats complex UNK present to
geographically speaking again if you put a lot of people in a small area er you'll get problems because square yard for square yard you've go more people
the design of the flats was UNK made for crime if you look at it now
i'm sure that's wa wasn't in the planners minds of course
but if you look at the flats now erm it was UNK made for crime
erm and with the housing people putting the type of people they put in there it did lead to a lot of problems
erm a lot of blues parties were held
er these are sort of parties that start at UNK and go on through the night
erm attended predominantly by west indian people
erm and that caused a lot of noise
and that was probably the main complaint overall was the noise in the small hours
so people would phone up and complain that noise throughout the night was mainly UNK er mainly down to the blues parties
we did get a lot of phone calls complaining about erm loud UNK type music from that area
er a lot of calls
mm
well th
yeah part of the problems was say going back to what sergeant said about er the people in the from the housing being mixed
er the impression i got when i talked to the locals who lived here was that it wasn't gonna be that mixed
there wasn't gonna be single parent families with three children er living above an old age pensioner who'd been in there from the word go
er that problem always raised and of course visitors and things like that car parking it all came to a head
you kn about that time
the er the special problems the complex presents at the moment are very minimal compared to what er other police officers i've spoke to who've worked the flats in the past have told me about
er there was problems with dogs
dog mess dogs running wild
er they weren't built for dogs yet people brought dogs with them or adopted let's say dogs what came there
so they started running round
er lads who were interested in UNK
you get a sixteen seventeen year old who'd interested in motorbike he wants to take his motorbike to th where he lives
so therefore you got UNK going up the UNK which weren't designed for that
lot of complaints like that
er litter was one that raised its head very much
not just chip papers and er newspaper type litter what we normally see it's if you're living on the top flat and you have a new UNK how what do you do with that UNK
and unfortunately UNK appeared at the bottom of the you know just been pushed over the sides and appeared and then they were left
er
and what sort of powers do they people have er when problems like that arise
well the powers i mean we've got the powers of there is an offence of UNK litter
but does that stop the problem if we report someone for UNK litter i e a UNK i mean they don't want to really deposit it there is it quality of life that's forced them to do it
what we did do is we contacted the d t s
or the officers at the time did
and there was a project done with those to get the rubbish moved and any rubbish that was seen was contacted
i mean er i've been told circumstances where there's been a pensioners who can't move very well
and they've got to get to the UNK to UNK the rubbish
well will they do it
or does it get left outside and then somebody comes along and kicks it and then it's open and therefore the rubbish is all over
it were just that quality of life
and policemen don't like to see it
but what do they do
so they had to start contacting the er what's the terminology we use at the moment
the inter agency
inter agency liaison is it
inter UNK liaison
the police instead of ignoring it decided to try and amongst with other agencies you know the cleaning service and that to try and er do a project
and it worked
i think people
yeah
erm
in the future i can't see e the only one i can see is what do they do with the flats when they empty
i cannot see the flats becoming empty on a friday and the UNK moving in on the sunday or the monday
i can see a period where the flats will just stand
and whether that will then attract children and damage
or whether they'll be UNK off i just don't know
yeah
so you can the there might be a problem with say the flats being left empty that trouble may occur
erm so people getting over the UNK in the flats while
mm
they're UNK off
they're being UNK up very UNK
i've yet to hear of a report where somebody's UNK is that have you heard of anywhere
they've UNK the flats
they are s very UNK
the problem is i think it's the i mean there is a private security firm in there at the moment perhaps they'll remain till eventually it's all done
but children are children aren't they
and er they are attracted to them type of building
unfortunately it's right in the centre and it er does attract them
yeah
erm do you have liaison with local community groups at all
er
yes
in our role as principal beat officers er we do
more than the fully operational constables and sergeants do yeah
w er i first li worked
visit the neighbourhood centre at and there i'm in contact with residents associations asian groups er all types of groups and if i'm invited to them i go
er to sit at the meeting
if it's full attend them anyway
er we also got the asian community centre on street and we go there and there's a cross exchange of er ideas
there's a community centre on near the centre
it is a lot
could you explain what a principal beat officer is
i'm sure sergeant will be able to
again going back to the UNK report in eighty one the area is divided up into eight beats
and rather than have police officers coming on duty and saying okay you take this beat you take that
they decided to appoint eight constables and give each area one constable or UNK one constable to each area
and he would only ever work that area
and he generally worked it during the hours of daylight when he could be seen and people could liaise with him
er i mean UNK successful has it been
well without sort of saying because i work in that department it's good erm i sincerely believe that it is very good
i mean twenty years ago when the volume of work wasn't so high as it now then erm every police officer was doing that but because time has marched on and problems have become more an more erm we tend to have left the traditional way of policing behind
and i'm sure you've seen where the chief constable says he wants more UNK on the beat well perhaps this is a way to a to achieving that
mm
erm
the community does relate to one police officer
they know he's not gonna be there for ever i e you know he'll want to move on or they perhaps will move on
but the fact that they see the same pl face see not everybody wants to talk to a policeman to report crime do they
a lot of them want to just talk to feel secure that they've seen a policeman
or just pass time of day
cos that's what they remember from their childhood
it's perhaps fair to say as well that if er a member of the public knows that p c smith or p c jones is his local policeman he would prefer to see p c smith or p c jones
and if he can't or doesn't then he will sometimes keep the problem to himself
rather than report it to anybody
and i think the local touch if you like of the principal beat officer er shows itself on occasions like that
d er do the people get to know police officers name
i mean is that sort of friendship built up or
oh yeah
relationship whatever
yeah bear i mean both of us sitting here we've been to social functions on this areas
yeah the amount of phone calls we get asking for p c for p c for p c for p c er for p c is quite incredible
people do know who their local policeman is
and they won't they won't be satisfied if the get somebody else they'll say
no
that's right
yeah
the er course we you know l like at the naval centre i'm in the handbook along with the er other services to
so they do you know relate to that er i haven't got a magic UNK
they know i haven't got a magic UNK
UNK a lot of the time they don't want to report that their child is riding without lights but they accept that if you have a quiet word he may not do it
yeah it's enjoyable work
and it's not that enjoyable to put people in prison it's not that enjoyable to put people in court
if you can see a result if i talk to john smith and tell him that i know he keeps riding on the pavement at you know with no lights it sounds minor but the old age pensioner who keeps nearly getting missed it's very you know UNK
and if he does and then i see him and that he isn't doing it any more at least i've got job satisfaction in that he hasn't
a lot of the time the fact that they know that you're doing it stops them
well the parents seem to appreciate that as well
that's how they were dealt with
erm moving on a bit now er i mean which crimes do you figure do you think figure most UNK around the UNK in and around the flats
at the present time there's very not that much crime at all
there is one perhaps two of what we call the blues parties still running
but er compared to what there was
i say you know we do talk to each other as police officers and talking to the lads who work the flats from when they were busy to you know now it's on the you know i think what there's about three hundred people is there
or three hundred if that left in the flats
it's not that many
er there was a lot of thefts from cars
because the cars are obviously parked in an area away from the er where the people lived
they were left on the car park so people knew they were parked there for the night
there's a lot of thefts from cars
theft of cars
cars being abandoned there because of the chances of them being er found
er damage UNK
then because of the reputation the area got for the blues or for the so called red light area you get people coming in from out of town which then brought it's own problems with it
there was thefts from persons you know people three o'clock in the morning making their way home from a blues were UNK
erm there was drug dealing going on
er the blues theirselves were a crime
if you think about it they're selling drink there without licences
you know that's all now going if you're just talking about the flats area
mm
well li what happens does the crime just UNK or does it move somewhere else do the problems move around
it not so much move around er some people the age group you're talking about going to the blues because don't just think that it's it is UNK west indians or UNK that go but there's white people go as well
which you know the as they get older there seems to be an age group for blues
you don't see that many forty fifty years olds at blues
and whether they tend to get older and move on or like you say i totally agree have they took off somewhere else
you know perhaps in another area of nottingham where they all tend to go now
erm
i'm just wondering th i mean how do you regard the erm the problems of prostitution and the related crimes to that in the area
i think by tradition every city had a red light district
and again looking back through history nottingham's red light district is
why i don't know whether it's because street lighting is less or geographically UNK itself
but yes if you live er in an area where UNK frequent i it is a problem to you
erm we get complaints from you know good people who get UNK by them
men who get UNK by them
erm we used to get complaints about UNK but as you know we had a new law that was allegedly UNK to nottingham which made it an offence to in certain circumstances to UNK looking for UNK
but erm generally s what we say keeping the lid on the problem
you won't stamp it out
again by tradition it's the oldest profession it's always been with us possibly always will
erm some people put forward a very strong argument for UNK it
instead of saying don't make it against the law make it UNK
and you know create special premises for it
there's an argument for that
but at the moment it's not really a great problem because the lads here go and see the UNK report them for UNK and we do well in my time here certainly i it's been reduced considerably to what it was
i'm not connected with that
but it's certainly gone down a he er quite a bit
UNK
erm i mean a are there UNK what would you say are the related crimes to prostitution
well i think you're moving on now to a sphere where perhaps c i d could you know help you on that
erm you must have heard of the phrases of UNK where somebody is operating a UNK and if they don't get a required amount of money a week or er an amount of money where they consider it sufficient they'll probably go and beat them up or something like that
then we do get odd cases of that but again the m the majority of them are never reported
and it's kept you know within that sort that sort of er area
it doesn't come to our notice much
yeah i get i mean i get the impression if you're thinking about you know the thefts from the people i mean a lot of the time is the guy who's visiting the UNK doesn't report to us if his UNK been stolen for the simple fact he was visiting a UNK
he thinks we'll look at it in a different light
er so obviously there is a lot of UNK crime that we wouldn't know about
you know the guy won't tell his wife or his girlfriend or whatever that he's lost his wallet
you know sooner than do that
i know that does happen
do you get many complaints from women who've been bothered by blokes
er who've just been walking along the road
bearing in mind like er sergeant told you before the area that we cover yeah the girls or UNK do stand street
a lot of them also stand on the part that covered by street and i know street has got a UNK action group against UNK
b because of that one complaint you know
er not so much on street because they tend to stand near the flats
UNK on the roads where the houses aren't
and the women and that who live in that area tend i've noticed to walk on the other side of the road anyway
i personally i've had yet to deal with one where the complaint
and i cover that part of er street
er it does happen
right
yeah i get you
erm do you have cases where the where the girls or same faces keep popping up or do you do you feel that once they've been pulled in they it puts them off
well we tend not to what you've just said pull them in
at one time the officers if they saw the girls UNK used to arrest them bring them to a police station they're finger print photographed and dealt with
now some of the girls and they're released you know some of the girls were arrested what two or three times a night
mm
so it was looked at tying up police time
and what was decided was we know what's known as report for UNK
we know the girls we check them out whether they're wanted or not
we know the details and the w they're told the facts when we report it and then they're given a UNK
to go to court
so there's been a difference there
we're not pulling them in
yeah i mean some very nice girls don't take that wrong i mean they n they don't hit you on the head and start fighting every time you talk to them
but how can you stop them going back
yeah
erm i think the only deterrent is increased UNK
erm and again they work quite simply UNK
if they can make a hundred pound a week and they're only getting fined twenty they ain't doing too bad
yeah
erm with wi with the big national aids campaign do you have you er with the prostitution have you had anything to do with if you ever speak to them do you say you know yo look there's aids can you do something
you know
yeah well the girls theirselves made an approach
i mean there was er on the television and etcetera only the two weeks ago we had two of the girls from here had made an approach about aids
vice squad or anti vice should i say are er involved in that
mm
erm let's go on to the next question now about erm just wondering what on what UNK under what circumstances the police get involved in domestic UNK on the flats
well every domestic i go to i look at as a potential murder
you have to
they normally come to the attention of the police by neighbours ringing up there's an argument or there's a lot of noise from next door
and we go
we obviously don't go knock on the door and say mrs brown next door is complaining about you
we knock on the door and whoever comes we say you know we've had a complaint is everything all right
if it's man and wife arguing or man female arguing and they're the only two in this place and i'm satisfied that it's gonna be quiet and there's no injuries to each other and it's not gonna UNK up then that's a domestic that you can be quite happy with
there's then the UNK where it's gonna keep going
or has been going in the past and violence obviously can result in serious injury or at least death
cos the tension runs high
so it's normally brought to us either by the neighbours ringing in or somebody passing by saying they can hear screaming
or one of the persons man or woman ringing in saying i've got trouble at me own i want me clothes back
so there's different sorts of domestic
there is the power of breach of the peace
or if they
has it been much of a problem on the flats
no they tended to s without s sounding wrong tended to sort theirselves out
th everybody yeah there was noise and that but er when we got there it had normally UNK down
perhaps going back again to the quality of life was it a release valve for the frustration of the places
i don't know
erm go on to the next one then
erm do you d do you think that drugs and alcohol are a major problem on the flats
or were a major problem
yeah
there was drugs dealing in the flats
i don't think UNK deny that
so therefore the problem was there
if that's what you're looking for yeah well that's obviously going with the flats going
there was the drugs problem where trying to put me er social hat on of people there on valium e and other drugs which were floating ground and kids were getting hold of these drugs from their parents
leaving them around s you know quite a few drugs
so that was a problem
er the alcohol
no
i don't think so except for the relation to UNK
if the if the old man had been out and spent the wages and on ale and then that resulting
i was just thinking about er when the pubs turn out and things like that
i mean d did you get problems around that time of the evening
no they tended to go home
it's very er
it was very strange
pub UNK and that never seem to appear here do they
no very strange
my old inspector who's now been and gone came from newark and he said that there was far more trouble within the public houses in newark er than ever there was here and he came here UNK the problem to be a lot worse
and i don't think he ever went to problem you know a pub fight at all
they just don't seem to happen
yeah and i say the obviously is in UNK on in the
mm
flats complex and no
you know they're very i mean the w they way how it was put to me is to d same with all your questions it was the er was it the tail UNK the dog
was ninety percent of the people there very law UNK and just got on with own lives and ten percent that caused the problems it kept re kept sh showing its head because of these
i mean there's some UNK in them flats
you've been in obviously yourself and er others are not so nice
so but as far as the drink er no
er about drugs and going back to the drugs you mentioned about valium and problems
mm
like that
erm what about other drugs erm harder drugs
i mean have they been found on the in the flats is there is dealing does de dealing go on
w majority of the dealing in there was UNK
i would wouldn't like to say about UNK and UNK because obviously the drug squads could have deals in there what i'm not aware of
but er i've had one arrest in there and that was a girl
and that was for er UNK
which er which she stated was freely available in the flats
erm well just go to the final question now i mean erm when th now the flats are UNK out and they're coming down erm and what do you see is gonna be the problem
while they're standing e problems while they're standing empty and
mm
afterwards when they're demolished what problems do you see
well i think the number the population will decrease obviously
erm there was what six hundred and eighty flats in all
so if you multiply that by two you're talking thirteen fourteen hundred perhaps even more so that amount of people are gonna go
but i don't think the method of policing will change because again going back to eighty one and UNK and he said get in among them liaise talk
er and this is exactly what we are doing so i can't see the policy er of policing of changing at all
it's just that you know i mean if you want to talk numbers there'll be less people
yeah
to police
i think a lot depends on what they build there
mm
if they build traditional what they call traditional terrace type housing i think the community in itself will er just adjust to that
if you then start talking of building supermarkets whatever then we're obviously looking at thefts from supermarkets
i mean i just know what they're gonna build there i don't think a lot anybody knows as yet
there's obviously policies being took with the community
er i think a lot will depend
i mean w like i said early on we're gonna get problems while they're empty
you're going to get people who want to sleep in there
you're gonna get kids who are missing from home who'll climb in there
that could be anywhere that could or here
that's not down to the area
er a lot depends on what they build there
if they build traditional houses we're then talking about the same amount
of people coming back families
but i don't think the problems will come to traditional housing what came to the flats i e the UNK the litter the abuse the facts of the parties
i think it'll be a fresh start for the area and a good start
about the changes that have been made to
erm do yo do you know anything about those
i know they're going on to security entrance isn't it where the er they're going to have their own key or own method of getting in on an UNK
which apparently has worked quite well at er
but UNK stay as it is
mm
so you do you think that'll be an improvement for do you think
well it's got to be for the people there theirselves hasn't it
mm
you know
as long as they don't abuse it
i mean it's no good having a your own identity number and then telling everybody what it is because that'll just never raised its head anyway that much did it
in the flats
no was the posh part of the flats if you like
right then er well thank very much anyway
i think that's
two as an apprentice to waggon repairing
now this er of course was railway UNK and er when you started work you was put with a skilled man and i er it was his job to repair the UNK and teach you at the same time
now the first job he did was to get you well UNK with the tools which we had quite a number of them
er UNK and such like and also UNK tools
you was expected to er to get to know these and also you was to taught to er UNK the wood tools
such as UNK and so forth
and er cold UNK you had to keep those sharp and er use a hammer and er watch as you didn't hit your fingers and UNK
now after that you was er taught all the parts of the UNK and er this took quite a long while because we didn't know anything about them and er where they all went and the parts they went
and then after that you was taught er about six month you was taught then er to measure the timbers up and also er start to er mark the er timbers out
because everything was UNK er all the holes in the er timbers they had to be carefully er marked out so that y er when they went to the wood machines there was a er they would be bored in the right place and the right size of holes
which was UNK from half inch to two inches and then of course the UNK and UNK they had to be marked out
and then we had to cut those out by hands hand that er of course UNK quite a lot of work er for er for the UNK to be cleaned out and the UNK to be cut by hand so that they fit in the proper places
those were joints were they
UNK
they were join UNK
right
and UNK a joint
er now after about two years er you got more UNK and then of course you could also help with the UNK down of the UNK
the frame was er one section and the body work was er the top of course
er but the framework that was all made from english oak
it UNK from er about eighteen foot long sixteen to eighteen foot long er twelve inches wide and five inches thick and we was taught how to be able to handle these by balance
they the frame was er constructed on er two UNK and of course er you put your UNK so that you could balance it so that it wasn't so heavy to lift
and er then of course when you got the frame er right y you put it together by using UNK and rods and such like
and then of course when you'd got that completed or the er bad parts pu taken out and the new ones put in of course then you put the floor down which was er s er seven by two and half timber that was UNK
and er then of course then you came along to the er to the UNK which was er two and a half timber UNK or p even pitched UNK
but y you'd got to watch there again that er you didn't exceed the width of er of your waggon which it's maximum limit was er would be er eight foot three or er eleven foot six high
so er you see you'd got to really watch what you was doing all the while
now at this stage i'll er i'll go to the er to the wages
er when i first started my er wages a first week's wage was er e eleven and sixpence
that is the old currency
and er the firm payed me er four shilling a week and er the man i was working with he the rest of it was taken out of his er his er wage packet er and put into mine and so i got about eleven and sixpence a week
er and er that went up the UNK pay er by sixpence a year
sixpence a week per year see
er in other words er when i was fifteen i got sixpence a week extra and a little more from the man i worked with
and er that went of course on for a year
and er then of course when i was about eighteen er i became what is what be what was called as an UNK
then i would be able to take lighter jobs on my own what we'd call er light repairs
and of course i gradually built up then to until i got the er the main overall jobs and er w by the time i was twenty one of course i was considered a full waggon UNK
ha
so when you
twenty one was when you finished your apprenticeship
yes that's right
did you carry on working at the same place
yes i c i was fortunate to be able to carry on at the same place
and where was that
that was at er m er at UNK it was a private firm but er they repaired th their own er their own stock of UNK
and did your wage go up a lot when you'd finished your apprenticeship
er yes wh yes i came on full rate then
it was piece work and i earned i er the firm payed me as a retaining fee ten shillings a week and then was what i earned you see
each item on the waggon had a price on it
ah i see
you see
er for putting in er one floor plank in as an illustration we got er a penny three UNK for it
but you see if you'd forty of those which would be about the your maximum you got er forty penny three UNK
and so on
how long would it take to build a whole waggon
well w i wasn't repairing them but er i wasn't building but to UNK er a waggon er it would probably take you probably a week
but if it was a light repair job it would be a day
you see it was all hand done you see
f er your UNK was er it was cut off you measured and cut it off with your er at the at the mill and er of course then when it got to the er you cut it you know when you got it to the er your waggon you put it in and of course then you'd got to bore all the holes by hand for the bolts to go in to fit in
so everything was done by hand in fact
everything was done by hand
you had to buy your own tools as well
when did you buy those
at the beginning of your apprenticeship
no at the end
when you'd got a little bit more money
of course we had to have good quality tools we had er now we had UNK and UNK always because they was the best quality
and UNK we had a special bits what we called a fast bit for er for the er o the UNK an and instead of having the pointed er UNK on it was the flat UNK you see they was a bit faster
and then if we had to bore er through the oak er we had w er twelve inch bits and they was very slow m er and we a also had er a special er UNK with them a fourteen inch sweep UNK
which the normal one was er w i think it's a five inch UNK for the er it's five inch UNK in other words it's er about is it six inches
twelve inch sweep for the er with the UNK they had normally
were there any other special tools that you had to have
er yes we had to have UNK and er they was they was also provided you see
and er we had to have er for the UNK er for springs the er the UNK er we had to have a er a tool then to put the pressure on to the UNK springs
that was provided you see
now er the er the draw gear it's not just er a UNK and a draw bar it UNK up with the er the UNK spring which also er serves for the UNK as you know them on the outside
well then there was a bar went right through well half way through and then i it a UNK fitted on and then there was er a UNK spring fitted in there and er a set of UNK
and then same the other end and so it went right through that waggon and your UNK took the strain for the next waggon and so on and so on until you'd got the complete train fitted up
i see
erm was the place that you were working at very big then
how many people worked there
er yeah well no
it wasn't really big there was about thirty of us about a dozen er waggon UNK and er and er a apprentices
and of course then you'd got the er you'd got the mill er and then of course the UNK shop
you see all the iron work as you took it off it had to be UNK out and if it was broken it had to be UNK
there was no spot UNK in those days it all had to be UNK
mhm
i see
so quite a long job
yes
in fact
and were you in a union of any sort
er l after i finished my apprenticeship i was in a union
which union was that
er transport and general workers union and of course then we was taken o b over by the a e u amalgamated engineering union when we changed course and we all became a e u members
i see
erm you say you started work in nineteen twenty two so
that's right
you would have been working when the general strike was on
that's right
do you remember anything about that
yes
i was er i was out of work then for er four month during the er nineteen twenty six strike
er of course i was an apprentice then again
er what would i be
er i wasn't eighteen and er i got er seven and six a week dole money that's in the old UNK currency which would make er let's see er g twelve and twelve and five about twelve shilling a week
something like that
mm
and er we had to walk to long UNK three times and week which would be from here would be two and a half mile away and then we'd we er on the friday it was UNK and UNK and we got paid on the friday
and you was given a time to go in to sign on
we had to sign on er three times a week
we was er given a time to go and er it was anything after nine o'clock in the morning
i see
and then you got you had to go three times a week
three times a week then yes
why was that then
well it was UNK years actually
can you remember what it was like managing on that amount of money
well we didn't
were you living at home then
i was living at home
how my mother er managed we UNK we'd never know
it was
did you
hand to mouth
yeah
you gave all the money to your mother then did you
yes
yes
yeah
but you remember it as being
y yes
a difficult time
yeah
and you were out of w work for four months then
a yes
were you out of work any other time during your working
no
no
no
life
i was on er what happened after that er when we was er winter time in particular er we was short of work er you see er well er the UNK didn't get er damaged so much because they was er they was extensively but er they was all they was UNK you see
and it UNK the timbers up
mm
well of course then you get a hot summer and it er it er revealed the cracks and the breaks see
now er when we'd done a waggon er it wasn't just er right that's alright er we had a railway examiner come along and er he'd go round it and if there was anything as he was wasn't satisfied with or any other further repairs he he'd stop that waggon from going out and er of course we had to go r go back and do it
of course we got paid for that as well
well then every three years all the UNK at the end er they had to have an m o t
in other words it was called general repairs
now when it had a general repair on it there was a little plate put on it and er then i it w it was supposed to go out again for three years
now er all the UNK they had a registration plate on
that's surprised you hasn't it
like
y
a car
right like a car only it was a cast plate and it was er on this plate was er who it was registered by what railway company it was registered by er it's er load capacity we used to have ten and twelve ton and er it's registration number
ah now that's it
and er of course er there was one either side of the waggon
and from there oh y these UNK were oh nothing to be one forty year old
really
yeah
that's a good age isn't it
mm
mm
erm how long did you actually work at this same place for
oh about thirty year
as long as that
yes
so what happened during the second world war
i was still there i was in er it was classed as a reserved occupation so i didn't have to go to the war
but with the same rule i wasn't allowed to leave i couldn't leave
see
what
what does reserved occupation mean
er it means er you was er working er now you was a reserved occupation because i it was of great importance
that's near as i can tell you about it now it has a special name i know but er that's it
y your er you was er now
that's it yo you was er reserved because you was more important to be on your job than er go to the war
i see
but what happened er you didn't quite get off quite free i was detailed to join the home guard
ah
can you tell me about that
yes
er i think i had two years in the home guard
er we had to go to er do UNK er every sunday see
when we weren't working
and er we used to go into er UNK park and er manoeuvre er left UNK movements and right UNK movements and drill and er and then of course and then occasionally we'd have a mock battle
and i was learnt to er go into a quarry and er fire the er rifles then we had UNK practice
and er then we was all sorted out this was the UNK for the home guard we was sorted out er to go to er man the guns at UNK on sea the er UNK
and er i was er one that was sorted out to go but they wouldn't let me go because er i couldn't get b they couldn't get me back to work for seven o'clock on monday morning
that was a weekend do you see
so you weren't allowed to go along
no i wasn't allowed to go with
so i had to stay back in er in UNK the UNK home guard
mind you it was er it wa wasn't er really dangerous because of course they as you know the germans never came
so you never really had to use any of
no
the skills that you'd learnt
we had all the equipment gas UNK and er and UNK and all that
rifles and UNK but the UNK and rifles were UNK at the drill hall at UNK
i see
erm working at the same place for so many years you must have had
do you remember any of your work mates in particular
oh yes
yes
oh yes
er i'm afraid they're about all passed on now
really
you know i'm very friendly with one of those that are but er we lost one this last year i was really friendly with him
there's one big friend now he comes up about oh most weeks we come and have a UNK and er and one thing or another
can you remember any funny stories or anything from work
no i don't know as i can
er you see we was er we was kept busy you see all the while
er of course it was rather dangerous work really because it was stuff we was dealing with
was anybody ever injured then that you can
oh yes we were
remember
yes there was one or two had er w er there was one or two got UNK and er and one or two had broken fingers and such like
UNK and such like
did anything ever happen to you
no nothing happened to me
what about those that were injured did they get any kind of compensation
er yes they got compensation but not lump sums
so what would happen
it was paid out gradually
weekly
weekly
yes you got a weekly compensation
i see
now er when er i was er eighteen i had to do pay er national health and er it was UNK er about a shilling a week and
and that was UNK health insurance
national health insurance yes
and er of course when i er i became twenty one the national health insurance was er now went up to one and UNK
now er that if i was off sick i could go to the doctor and er i got as a single man i got er a pound a week from the national health
and of course when i was eighteen i think it was about er seven and six a week
that was i instead of your wages
instead of my wages
i see
so
and er but a man a married man it was twenty two shilling a week you see
an but the national health for his er he got medical treatment for himself but there's nothing for his family or his children they had to pay the doctor
was medical treatment very expensive then
er yes and no
er the doctor provided the medicine and if he visited you it was seven and sixpence each visit and if you went to his surgery i think it was four an either four and six or three and six
that's what it was
mm
did you notice the difference in how far your earnings went when you go got married
er oh yes i got married in nineteen thirty five and er my er take home pay then was would be round about three pound a week which was a good wage in those days
you see my day rate then of course i was piece work but my day rate then would be er two pound twelve and six pence
less one and UNK
and how did you find you managed you and your wife managed on that amount
oh we managed very nicely
was she working
no
no
er now i don't know whether you'll put this in your in your er talk but er in UNK if you er when you married the girl got married er she got the good wishes of the er boss she worked with in most of the industries i'm not saying all
most of the industries and w er the day she got married she got her cards
she was no w no question she ha it was one of the laws of your firm
now as soon as you got married they did not employ married women
i mean i can mention the firms there were several of them in UNK because i know two but er perhaps as well not to
so in fact you were supporting both of you
on what you earned
well erm my wife as er as a UNK she could go to work but she didn't
we manage we did manage well w we managed and we was able to g have our week's holiday a year
three pound a week was considered a good wage
so did you
a
save out of your weekly earnings to go on holiday
yes
how did you save
well er i think we put ours in the bank actually
in the bank
yes
yeah
oh yes
y you put so much
yes
away a week
oh we didn't er any surplus went in the bank
of course er the er the hotels and such like they weren't as expensive as they are today
you could get er a r a decent er hotel or boarding house
the cheaper boarding houses was er would er be er four and sixpence a day full board
and the UNK ones would be about six shilling a week full board
so how much would a week's holiday for two cost you
oh round about twenty pound
and when
about what year would that be
er nineteen thirty five
twenty pounds for a week's holiday
yeah
that's pretty good
ti till nineteen till nineteen forty till the war broke out
of course then ho holidays was all off
see er now coming to that holidays er you only had a week's holiday with no pay
there was a er and then you had bank holidays with no pay
you had er two days at christmas boxing day and christmas day er no pay
er easter we had er good friday and monday no pay
UNK er one day with no pay
er august bank holiday august bank holiday monday first monday in the month no pay
if you had a week's holiday still no pay
they were the UNK years
two legs good or four wheels bad or does it depend who's in the driving seat after all who ever heard of a road UNK
today we all have access to the speed warmth and comfort of cars buses trains and planes if that is we have the money if there is a service running when we want it to where we want to go and if there isn't already so much traffic ahead of us UNK the roads UNK the atmosphere that we wished we stayed at home
whatever transport you choose is UNK delays break downs parking UNK and baby UNK proof buses UNK our lives so should we re think the whole business of getting from here to there one hundred scottish women have
and proposals and i'd like to start with a vote just to find out what kind of hundred this is do you have a driving licence button one for yes and button two for no seventy two of this hundred have a driving licence which i think is some way above the national average let me ask you do you have the use of a car or other vehicle whenever you want it button one for yes and button two for no and of seventy two er licence holders sixty three have the use of a car which again i think is some way over the national average now what cars do you have now let see what people are driving here there
golf
aha
nissan sunny
nissan yeah
mini
a mini
a UNK
a UNK
a UNK
a ford UNK
a UNK another ford
a UNK
UNK
a UNK
a what a UNK
UNK
UNK
rover
rover
UNK
UNK no UNK yet
right now what do you like about driving i mean er the you know you all know what the car is what what's what appeals is it just something you have to do is it a necessity or is it actually because you enjoy it
i enjoy
i enjoy it
yes
independence i like to be independent
what do you use the car for
shopping going on holidays i really love driving so
in this country or also abroad
well mostly no not abroad no definitely not
its a pleasure for you
its a pleasure for me yes
yes
i'm just learning to drive at the moment and i find its more for my independence than any thing else
yeah
i like to drive because its the freedom it gives you no standing around at bus stops and even it saves you money going from place to place
mm
its your necessity its an umbrella its a UNK its a shopping trolley its an ambulance its a bus
its a wardrobe
yes
it means you can pack in a lot more things in your day you can work you can look after your children you can take them out you can do a lot of things that you couldn't do otherwise
mm yeah
er from the necessity in an area with no public transport
where's that
in the island of borough the western isles there's no public transport within the island and er
does that mean every one UNK to drive as soon as they can
or even before
tell me more
better not
right okay so its mostly independence and er does do any of you hate driving do any of you drive out of necessity but really wish you didn't have to yes
yes definitely
why
i really don't like driving i just think its such a lot of work involved in it
what sitting there
yeah aha cos you have to concentrate constantly and i think it really is a lot of work involved in it
yeah the
yeah its just er i feel you know its a waste of your life you know sitting i have to drive through the necessity to work every day its an hour of my day spent just behind a wheel when i could be in the train you know reading or doing something more productive
mm standing at a bus stop
and i feel i find it a bit frightening at times as well on the road you know with things
what
that you see other drivers doing
like what
over taking you know cutting right in front of you and er you just i see things in front of me and i can hardly believe that there hasn't been a horrible accident you know just seeing the things that happening on the road
have you ever been involved in an accident
no not myself no
okay there
you become a free taxi service for every body
you find that people just say your going to a meeting can i have a lift or of course your going well i'll go with you and your never expected to drink your always expected to be the last as you drop every body off so erm i've had a years of that
can't you say no obviously not
the ideal way to avoid unwanted passengers is to get a mountain bike instead
well that brings us on to those of you who don't have a license and don't drive which is my sums are right something like twenty eight of you
what do you do what do the twenty eight of you who don't have a license and don't drive do
a bicycle
you bicycle
or walk or use the bus if your going shopping
is that by choice
well i did learn to drive but i couldn't UNK pass the test
how many times did you try
twice
UNK i listen i
that was enough
it took me five times
i don't know whether that encourages you or UNK my friends but i mean up there
i take a bus but er i'm learning how to drive now because i think it gives you a lot of independence
do any of you not drive because you can't afford to or because yes
i take a bus i live in UNK and you know
that's in that's outside glasgow
yes and i live in a pensioner's house UNK away from the shopping centre and i've got to take a taxi of one pound forty a day to shop
so what wouldn't it be more economical to learn to drive or would it not
i'm seventy odd plus
the roads are far too busy for me now i used to drive but not now
what's public transport like then
i mean its obvious erm
hopeless
really
absolutely
is it worse than it was
definitely
is that the general i mean i don't know for all you car drivers have any thing to say about public transport maybe you don't know any more but those of you who use it i mean is hopeless the general view yes
its quite boring being in a car its just yourself but there's always people to look at its quite an UNK
going on public transport and just
what do you use and where
you erm i use buses and cars and i use a bike as well er i think that we used to have a car and i stopped using it i used it we had it when the kids were small and i found it really good for getting them around and it really was necessary to young mothers but their big now and i don't have to chauffeur
i thing recently the bus service has got dreadful since they brought in er private buses to their local areas it was good for the first few months but when they find out that its not paying at all they take them off they don't tell you the bus just UNK so your left with the usual one that used to be on
er yes i am a person who uses public transport and i believe in it very much but i must say that erm its very UNK i have to rely on three different forms of public transport to get to my work and it takes twice as long as it would as if i if i could go by car and so i can see the attraction of going by car and there are many improvements that could be made where i live for instance in glasgow so that you would only have one change and not constantly UNK to and fro between stations and buses and so forth
now we haven't erm talking about er cars as to other forms of transport and on the whole there's been more complaints about the public transport than they have about cars but you surely don't think or maybe you do i mean what's bad about cars
i mentioned a couple of things at the start that er yes
you have to always look for a parking space in
true what else yes
i think for people generally i mean there's a lot more pollution with cars and for the children who are at UNK level or at the UNK level its it can be quite lethal in city UNK with cars UNK to park and such like
yes
i don't think the whole question of cars and safety has never really been looked at properly it all seems to do to be to do with cars and performance and i would like to see a lot more about cars and safety and like
what kind of things
oh any thing at all just looking at cars and getting the design right so you cut down on accidents really i think that this hasn't been looked at because its male dominated
its not necessary the vehicles that are in the wrong its the people who drive them who are in the wrong
yes
its them that should actually be looked at as opposed to the to the UNK themselves
you said something interesting which i didn't pick up there that er you said that policy making presumably you were suggesting is male dominated
well i do feel that a car is looked at from a performance point of view i mean i agree that a lot of bad drivers but i still think you could help a lot by getting the design of the car right because sometimes accidents do happen even though nobody is really at fault and er i feel strongly that were looking at it from the wrong way round
mm
i agree i find it quite difficult to drive a lot of vehicles because i'm very small and especially if you've got small feet and i think there's a big problem in that area and that it should be looked at for small people driving cars
mm
er i think that advertising has a lot to answer for er we have this er you know on UNK there are so many notices and yet we get all this UNK in television ads about cars well cars are basically to get you from a to b and er there should be restrictions in advertising and try and get away from this macho image that the car has its in its a necessity of life its not something which UNK your ego
oh does it not
well it seems to of done a great deal of UNK cases
well it has been suggested of course that the people do experience personality changes when their behind
yeah
the wheel of the car i mean i wonder i wonder what you think of that let me ask you this question do erm do men's personalities change behind the wheel do you think button one for yes button two for no and vote now and you'll be interested to know that in this hundred eighty five of you think that personalities change do they get better
well let me ask you this in this case do women's personalities change behind the wheel button one for yes and button two for no well
well eighty five per cent of me well eighty five of you think that men's personalities change only fifty seven of you think that women's personalities change what is the difference i ask you yes
i happen to drive a very small car er a UNK one two six and you can't get much smaller than that and i am much more aggressive when i'm driving that for the simple reason i think its this sort of principle although i'm nearly six foot in that i'm a small person and the small person UNK comes out because i get cut up continuously they don't do that when i'm driving my husband's car which is a UNK er they will cut in front of me i don't think they if they knew what my brakes were like they wouldn't do it
behind you yeah
i think women have got children to be responsible for and that does make them more responsible and careful drivers
mm yeah
i'm a very oh sorry
well both of you one further one yes
i'm a very new driver so i'm very careful and very cautious not a very good pedestrian i tend to wave a UNK and walk out whereas i always give the other person you know i always sort of wave them on UNK in the car being a very new driver i am very cautious
you'll change
i'm a very careful driver but i will admit i don't like men getting away first at the lights
why what does it matter
because they do it to me so often so i'm determined their not going to get away first
yes
i think er a lot of it has to do with confidence the more confidence you get the UNK driving erm i'm afraid the more aggressive you become whether your a man or a woman but er quiet
its a very stressful situation and its a very artificial situation very often your on your own and there's a lot of things happening your in busy traffic or your on a very dangerous road or whatever and i think sometimes and i'm not saying there's any difference between male and female as far as that's concerned but i think its a way of your getting your er aggression out
mm
your frustration
there
i drive many buses as well as cars and i find i'm very aggressive in cars but when i'm sitting high up in the seat of a mini bus looking down on every one your not so aggressive you feel well i've got the right of way nobody's going to argue with me
well the suggestion is this then if we all drive around in tanks or
well then we'd all be tremendously specific well let me ask some one who does drive around on the closest we've got to a tank driver here UNK you drive something very large
yes
and does that mean your a very calm person because your so big i mean no one
no one 's going to get you on the road i mean what exactly do you drive
no well because your looking down on every body else you tend to feel erm well i feel sort of that you've got to er feel responsible for them and look after them
mm
and that's the criticism that i'm told is i'm not quite aggressive enough when i'm driving a truck but i don't see it that way i'm not being aggressive
who tells you your not a i mean aggressive truck drivers are frightening
idea
who's telling you your not aggressive enough
well its not its
what are you supposed to do
its it the other truck drivers and i have to say that erm to a certain extent you do need to be UNK and positive because er they need a lot of space to manoeuvre on the road and a lot of people who drive cars don't quite realize how much space they need and if they won't give you the space you have to take it
do you i wonder if you think your a good driver i mean there are i mean i should remind you there are five thousand people killed on britain's roads every year there are sixty three thousand people seriously injured they reckon that car accidents cost something like five thousand million pounds in britain every year
why is that is it because there's too much traffic because were driving badly yes
i used to drive UNK but i can safely say that i live on the a seventy seven aggression is equally as bad as drinking driving because you see it happening on that road every day aggression they cut out they cut in you don't know where their coming from er at least a UNK driver tries to go straight and UNK the mistake
its true their both their both at fault and i think a bad UNK driver is every as bit as bad as a UNK driver
yes
survey show basically that men have a greater accidents i e they do proceed when they shouldn't etcetera erm women tend to do stupid things like erm reverse into parking spaces that are too small
that kind of stuff
you see i get the impression that most of you more or less are willing to except all the bad things about cars because given at this particular hundred has sixty three car er car or vehicle owners you'll put up with the danger and the pollution and er all the various bad side effects of the motor industry because weighing things up you've got independence you've got freedom you've got shelter a wardrobe some where to carry the kids is would that be a correct estimate is that is a general
yes
feeling
i should ask you actually which is a have you ever been in an accident erm hang on a minute button one for yes button two for no have you ever been in an accident
now you see this is an extraordinary figure you all UNK
well three of you aren't sure
but fifty seven of you out of sixty three car owners have been in an accident is that yes
yeah but your saying been in erm they may have happened to you i've been UNK into time and time again
really
and i've had three accidents and i've been stationery every time so somebody's done something to me so i've had three
fair point its still er i mean its a considerable number i mean you can see why the insurance company's are doing quite well but your willing to put up with that as well for the for the good points of a car for the freedom that er that cars give you and the safety someone has said the individual safety as a woman yes
can i make the point as a country UNK
mm
that driving is not a choice driving is a necessity
mm
i have never lived any nearer than a mile from a public bus and at one point it would be maybe two and a half miles from that bus so my children well my children are grown up now but my children got nowhere or did nothing if i didn't drive nobody UNK the shopping nobody goes
brings it to the door
brings the prescription er we've talked a lot about town transport
mm
but in the country er public transport is essential but er access to a car is UNK is really essential and for those who can't afford it i do not know how they survive in the country
behind you
i think that its choice that's something we haven't sort of looked at tonight i think its the important er factor in a fact that we've got an audience here with a large representative er percentage of er access to a car and certainly erm i working in the transport field in west central scotland er that is not the case in glasgow where the car ownership is something in the order of seventy per cent of the population do not have access to a car or do not have access in a household we you are then talking you have to look very seriously at what public transport must provide in order to meet just day to day activities and i think that this choice aspect is something that is absolutely vital as the lady in front says
now if this is erm a perhaps a non representative hundred in so far as if you can compare it with er the average in the west of scotland i know your speaking as an expert because you work well tell me exactly what you do i know your with the transport
yes er planning officer with the passenger transport executive in glasgow
do you think women's needs are
which covers the whole of strathclyde
sufficiently taking into account when it comes to planning transport policy
what i'd like to say is i think erm certainly in scotland and in strathclyde area that four years ago erm the first women in transport survey was actually carried out erm and it was carried out elsewhere in britain and er this was as i say the first study that had been done and the results were very surprising
erm i'm not saying that er there weren't problems in security and using public transport and fear of using public transport after dark but we were quite surprised that compared with the rest of the u k it was erm not acceptable but it gave us an indication on where to go from there on erm and also i think er the important factor that in the lower in strathclyde that we've actually consulted women in terms of er what they want and what they need er in the transport world erm in public transport and that's not lip service we've actually had discussions groups and that information has been fed into the large erm public transport review that were undertaking at the present time
i would like to ask why when there co operation at the strathclyde bus company they have buses that are running UNK a block constantly full but then again suddenly a bus that doesn't pay its full way is taken off and people that are dependant on that bus are left without any transport why can't the busy bus UNK the bus that isn't because after it its public transport so is it a complete and utter profit that the buses are running for or is it for the convenience of the public because it is
what do you think
a public service
i think its profit definitely profit
yeah since deregulation the er local authorities have had very little er that they can do apart from UNK certain services and obviously
now you work with edinburgh district council don't you
i work with lothian UNK council
oh sorry pardon me
erm and obviously there is there is a set budget and they can't UNK all the off peak journeys but a lot of women do travel off peak times they don't need they don't necessary always travel at the peak times when the buses are most regular
yes
well when it comes to talking about er transport in a rural area and talking about transport in the western isles er were not talking about buses or trains were talking about UNK and planes and you just wonder when you hear some of the statistics erm from these companies just what sort of service they are at providing to local people where your talking about UNK at arriving in port at half past eleven to half past twelve at night that's not a service for local people i mean you hear about british airways increasing their domestic fares to er by seven per cent as of the beginning of april er you just have to ask is this a service been put up provided for er local people and it just isn't
i'd just like to make a point and its UNK what the young lady said down there about deregulation and although you
now your speaking as a bus driver
i'm speaking as a bus driver yes within a company that's about to be UNK and yes of course the bottom line is important and management think that it is vitally important and we know no longer get subsidies from any where including the government unlike your erm local district council operated services so its very difficult for people in our position to actually keep services on the road if they don't pay
mm
could i also say that erm again going back to strathclyde that there is a social there is a subsidy for those services erm where there is a social need up to a certain point and that is governed by the finance available but its not as though this is just the commercial network in fact er i think its erm something in the order of ninety two per cent of services in strathclyde are UNK operated and it is strathclyde region that fills the gaps
i'm glad all your transport users are now coming out of the woodwork but you are the minority in this hundred now of the majority the car drivers do you feel any resent of responsibility towards users of public transport i mean there are all manner of er plans UNK to slightly further tax or er charge drivers so that roads can be UNK i don't know that it would UNK public transport but there are UNK coming up for private car users and drivers do you approve do you UNK do you think that's fair enough no one 's said any thing about pollution yet yes
oh i quite agree because i think that there people that have i'm a car driver but if i'm in inner city i tend not to use that i use public transport
mm
because er the roads are UNK and i think that er public transport in the city should be improved and people UNK from using their cars in our city
so you would be willing to pay more would you for the to use your car in the city
i wouldn't use it in the city i just don't use it
you wouldn't use it
in the city
yes
i'm a car owner who's actually thinking of selling my car because i don't use it much in glasgow i don't need to i can actually walk to work and to come to somewhere like edinburgh tonight i would much prefer to use the train but i think we could have much more UNK plans to do with UNK city centres so that cars were banned from them altogether they could bring back trams which are much less in terms of pollution they might not make us big profits for the company's but they are a very good way we a lot of european cities still use trams
lady there
can i make a plug for the glasgow underground system
i'm a great believer in it i park my car close to that and find it a most convenient way of travelling around
well it may be an accident but strathclyde in glasgow seemed to er be taking all the UNK tonight yes
public transport could never meet every one's needs but it should be seen as a social service and erm we feel that more passes should be issued to people on buses and trains that are disabled or the elderly to encourage them to use it more
well we had a secretary of state here who is now minister of transport i do hope he's watching this programme seeing as i promised we have had gains and proposals
we are coming to an end let me remind you that er of this particular hundred sixty three of whom have the use of a car fifty seven have been involved in an accident fifty seven and i'm sure it can't be a er it must be a coincidence say their personalities change behind the driving wheel
let me ask you one final question and its a UNK one and er i want to know whether you drink and drive i'm not going to we haven't got any time for debate i'm just interested to know would you say that you drink and drive this is not policy any more button one for yes button two for no your told it as a simply for a kind of statistical er oh er some of you are being rather UNK and not voting
seven of you say yes you do well you know who you are don't good night
love the ultimate four letter word and were about to use it all over your television screen
where do you start with love every body wants to love every body wants to be loved every one at some time or another is disappointed by love and while its difficult sometimes talking about it not talking about it can have some really serious consequences so let's try to get to the heart of it tonight one hundred women are prepared to share their wisdom if not their secrets i'd like to start off by seeing if we can differentiate between loving and being in love
have you ever been in love are you now button one for yes button two for no and in this hundred UNK ninety three people have been in love what happened
i mean what how did you know you were in love
how did you know that was that was what it was yes
temporary UNK
can
only temporary
er well it does wear off you can't you can't you can't
sustain it UNK
and what were the symptoms in your case
oh can i remember that far back
erm
loss of memory
yes definitely that erm
loss of common sense certainly
would you agree the ninety three of you is that what UNK being in love temporary UNK any other no well what then yes
er yeah sorry i write UNK not just lust
yes
being in love i think erm its not something that you have to end it happens to you its not because er a terribly admire the person i er your only achievements its just something that happens and common sense goes out the window
so you suggest that sandra might be right
something like
and
there might be something in it yes
erm yes up there
well i don't agree with that i think that when your in love with someone you want to be with them all the time you think about them during the day you think about them at night you just want to be with them and usually you like how they look you like how they talk they like you like how they treat you and er to me that's its wonderful just
has
wonderful
how many times has this happened to you
many times
many times at one time i thought it would never happen again i thought this was it forever but life isn't like that things happen and it does change
yes
it is a form of an UNK and it is an excitement and there's a warmth and there's a UNK about it and it just wonderful better being in love than not being in love surely
mm yes
no i feel er kind a be lost it depends on what relationship your looking for
i think if its the right one its definitely not lust its every minute UNK for them just to be with that person
so lust is what you feel for the wrong one
that's afterwards
yes i first meet them then you can say its lust
there
can you not start with being in love with someone and end up by loving them
yes
it isn't always a drastic ending is it
mm
i think its just an extreme form of friendship you've become extremely friendly with somebody and it can be kind in love with your with your girlfriend it don't have to be in love with your boyfriend you can have you know some body who's a same sex and you've got the same feelings towards them
that's UNK that's love is it
its definitely not lust
but
but there has to be something to trigger the interest in the first place and whatever that is and however mild a form that might be lust might be a more extreme form of it but there has to be something to interest you in the first place before you can go on to love to knowing more about the person and having this in love feeling develop into love
well what is that thing then
i mean what is it that attracts you ninety three people who have been in love or are in love why what is what are the attractive things yes
you see exactly what you want to see when your in love and you ignore the bits you don't like
until there pushed home after long erm bit too much to being together to often sometimes ruins the love er loving means you except the person completely for what they are and you don't mind they are what they are and your you care for them like that
i actually start off quite good and then right or wrong i mean you find it god what a pig
sitting there maybe picking their nose or nails or i mean really its that
that their all UNK and then later on you think this is not for me
so then you go and find somebody else and then maybe their just not to my expectations maybe its because like i love myself
without being bull headed or any thing its just that if i love myself obviously i've got to love somebody else no i said that wrong
what you mean is you wish you could find one that didn't pick his nose and his nails
well exactly
yes
which ever way we look at it its UNK way of keeping us going its what's there to keep us surviving as a species so its very clever the it worked nature worked it out very UNK indeed that we should have this wonderful passion for someone and it should become love and then we should have children and then it becomes a the whole cycle and that's how it all goes
so we are we UNK a pure biological function or is all this talk of love and
in a way i think so i mean if were quite honest about it but we also see ourselves UNK in whoever we love we see ourselves UNK in their eyes which is a very comfortable sort of feeling
what if they if they love us back
oh yes well hoping so
yes
i think its a bit of a UNK to say that its UNK way of keeping us going because actually er ro the idea that UNK love is the start of a life long relationship that produces off spring is really quite recent erm for most of history er UNK were on the basis of continuing er lines continuing property and people had to erm some how or other cope with living with UNK another person that might not necessarily have been the person that they would of chosen from love and this is still true in many societies and situations now
so were onto marriage you see i started trying to talking about love and here we are
talking about marriage
let me let's try a couple of those thoughts put them to the vote
do you think being in love is let's call it the mating UNK is being in love merely the mating UNK operating button one for yes and button two for no let's er let's seal that little lust UNK there well forty seven say yes basically i suppose basically being in love is lust fifty three say no and what about that other point i mean should you marry for love button one for yes and button two for no should you marry for love well what very modern people you are cos eighty two of you said yes fifteen said no who said no
i think its possible to fall in love with the same person more than once you fall in love with them and you get married for that as well as other reasons perhaps and then you have children and you hardly see them really for the next ten years at least this is what every one sort of understands and then and then erm and then when you have more time again you can fall in love all over again with exactly the same person i think this happens to lots of people which also doesn't happen to a lot of people so you haven't
well it sounds UNK but of course i mean a lot of terrible things happen in the name of love including crimes of passion as there UNK called in france i mean people have killed for love yes
i found that love went out the window when it was UNK socks and UNK and dirty nappies and all this in front of me and i thought well this is not UNK this is bloody hard work
and then and then did it did it go the way someone suggested that the you fell in love again i mean UNK said
yes one once the children had gone it was different and i think its i'm a widow now and i think love still remains somewhere
up there
i think apart from loving them you must like them
mm
and that's the basis if you like them they'll become your best friend there's times you don't love them but you still like them
mm were talking about what happens when people who have fallen in love get together and decide to stay together for a bit and its been suggested that marriage can put some strains on er what started off as a very UNK mutual experience if your lucky let me ask you this do you think marriage UNK love button one for yes and button two for no does marriage destroy love as you understand it mm a few are not sure but thirty people have said yes who said yes
erm i said yes to er UNK being married for love and i must admit i think when i fell in love my head completely went some where else
mm
and my heart went some where else and i think erm the marriage erm the love in my marriage was definitely killed by an act which my partner did and i would fall into the crimes of passion i think because i mean to me he committed the deadly sin of all and that was UNK and i could never forgive him for that and i think that picks up on a lot many issues which have been raised tonight about you have to have trust in a partnership you have to give and take and people change and some people can accept all that but i was not willing to do so
so you didn't go on loving him
no i stopped instantly
yeah er yes
i think the problem is perhaps that when we love that we no we never love the same degree the two people don't li love exactly the same way that in every relationship there is one who loves and one who is loved one who UNK and one who is UNK and i think perhaps this balance if the relationship is weak this kind of works it out that then they eventually split up that one goes the other way and the can't stay together
i feel erm personally when i was younger that i was taught about love long before i feel in love sort of idea you know UNK the old UNK gave us expectations about what love was all about and i felt that had a has a big influence in how yeah when you grow up you feel you meet this man and
mm
it just all starts then were taught
and i think
about it as well
was it a good influence i mean do you think the magazines and the books did
well i don't think so i mean its getting beyond real perspective i think sometimes
right now we have well we've already heard from sandra who's says she's er a UNK writer and there are some other UNK here jean erm margaret elizabeth are you are you UNK which are er completely UNK people like UNK when she was young are you worried that your actually affecting young particularly female minds in a dangerous way
mm no
i asked for that didn't i
erm
what do you think or are you satisfying a market
yes and if you can make somebody think from your writing well that's good
yes dear
its the market is there because people want it and this about er i think its just too easy to say that people are mislead by them
people live in the real world their not really going to be influenced its about as sensible as saying er a mills and UNK novel for example tells people about love are saying m i five use from russia with love as a training manual its the same kind of level of
things people read them because they want to enjoy them they know that real life's different but its fun
but your a writer yes
i think this idea that these magazines are read only by the young is totally wrong er elderly women go to the libraries and the mills and UNK section is one of their favourite places its got more stock there than any of the more serious fiction so there must be something in it that is satisfying their need for UNK perhaps
mm yes
yes because i think its a form of UNK
mm
as the lady says its not real life erm
is that because real life is very disappointing
yes
i think i think when your reading it i mean the female always gets her man and he's always perfect and er i mean real life is just isn't like that so its nice to see that it works out for someone
nice idea
well actually i think your quite right but i think the problem is that the older reader reads it for UNK and enjoyment its fun but i think the younger reader reads it and thinks that's what life is should be like and that's when the trouble starts
is this your problem is this why you ended up with a
i think i'm gonna have to read one of these books
so that was that wasn't the case in your that wasn't the case for you
no
no
i just feel that even if you have read the book i mean my point would be i would maybe be reading the book and have a look and say oh god
that would be me
i read one once and it was the best comedy i'd ever read in my life
i think there's more to love than just simply UNK love erm i'm a volunteer UNK with oxfam and to me love includes love of my fellow man and fellow women throughout the world and i find it very hard at the moment that millions of people are starving in this world and i feel that i've got to show my love by helping them
mm
i think that's important
its my own personal opinion that the only true love and er i have to honestly say i've never heard love here defined as i would as the totally UNK love that happens between a woman and a child probably from the moment of birth that bonds them through life that's the only love that i could ever admit to
that's two different kinds of love though then love loving your neighbour i suppose is the UNK sense and er and the love between a parent and child are those more UNK as true love if you like than the kind of UNK love sexual love that we've been talking about yes
third kind of love a bit more UNK love of chocolate
which i was which i was very worried about because i was told it was a substitute for sex
and then i read this amazing article which said no its completely the other way around sex is when you get sex when you don't get enough chocolate
i'm beginning to wonder if we need more words for love i mean if love is the only word we have for chocolate er
for your fellow man for your child and for your for your partner is there a UNK of vocabulary here
i er i was gonna spring another type of love because we all spend a lot of money on it the love of pets of animals
mm
and there's a lot of er of what people even leave their UNK to look after some animal and they don't leave it to people like er the lady sitting here who are folk are starving but then its because people are needed and people are needed by their children but there also needed by their men folk and i think its when they turn to being a mother to their men that you know even the love that they have er whether its been a sexual love at one time er friendly love becomes a very caring love and er i think that's what we all remember erm those of us who have lost our husbands that would like to have that part back again
mm
of being needed and being er allowed to care for someone
up there
i think the mother and child love isn't always pleasant and i think that's quite worrying to some mother's if they can't love their child in the way that people expect them to
UNK can i be the odd one out and say i've been in love with one man for forty five years i haven't heard any body saying any thing very nice about that i would like to say its wonderful
oh i
here
there here they a lot of them say i don't know if you are the odd one out i mean there are
no i quite agree i also agree with the lady who said that one of the important things is that you like the person i well speaking from experience i started out liking somebody
mm
for whom that i had to decide whether i was going to marry him or give him up and decided i couldn't give him up so i married him and was extremely happy and was UNK when he died and i a it went from you know i never real thought i would be as happy could be as happy as i was
mm
er but i quite agree one person er there's nothing greater
yeah i'm interested that so many of you go from love to marriage as er UNK as the horse and carriage similarly would suggest i mean it every one's experience of love is different every body here is we've been talking about love between er men and women but there's also love between women and women which we haven't talked about at all
do you think society er UNK on all forms of love or do you think some kinds of love and loving are actually seen as being lesser than others there seems to be less sympathetic for er i mean yes
well you've just got to look at section twenty eight now section twenty five how like we are being UNK against how even like
sorry erm your not like getting
start again start again
getting attacked in pubs you know like that's happened to me being verbally assaulted in the street has happened to me because i am with my UNK who is a woman who publicly i cannot show like that love publicly you know cos oh i'm scared of violence you know i like my face the way it is
who has threatened you
men basically feel really erm threatened and UNK like by women loving each other or by men loving each other you know
any other views on that i mean is that a yes
its just the very fact that erm there's no equivalent to marriage for UNK and gay men it means that society is looking down on it
do you think there should be
yes
not so much now i don't think
i feel that erm a bit like yourself what i object is the fact that its again we use
the illusion of love and the actual wording of love
mm
UNK up images and i just object to the fact that people impose on us UNK i mean i think UNK and gay men have got a right to their life style as we have and i don't think we should be actually imposing and i think that's what a lot of society and what people come out with does er more or less we don't agree with that and its wrong and its UNK
its not so bad now either way it was years ago always look down on people like that but not so much now
oh i can assure you i work i work in a women's unit and i can assure you its still UNK on by lots of people
i was gonna say its interesting to hear you saying that its men who attack you but again with gay men its men who attack them
i i've never really heard of women attacking lesbian women or women attacking gay men its usually if there's a if there's a row something or other because the male of the species seems the one who's been feels very threatened at the
by there own people
UNK or the lost of a er female UNK or something
UNK
can i er compound the issue more
mm
and say there is again UNK or whatever for i don't know what to call them UNK relationships
mm
because that's another problem and i think maybe people haven't you know like addressed that
can i just move on to one other issue that i'd like to look at er because i think we've covered that reasonably for the moment which is how will you find love ninety three people said their were in love seven said they weren't of those seven were you've never been in love was it have you wanted to be would any of the seven who voted no at the beginning yes
not really
ah
you didn't fancy it
no i'm too in my i like my independence too much yes
any one else yes
i think i was er i thought i was in love a few times but erm in UNK it was lust
so that's
thought that half of you being in love was lust any way
where do you find love if their are people out watching this programme tonight who would actually rather be in love
love finds you
eh
love finds you
don't give up hope it finds you
thank you
also like why do people want to find love like is it maybe UNK them into a false sense of si security erm and i think that it is really important as like one woman said earlier on that its really important to love yourself first cos how can you give any body any thing
mm
i think love is like when somebody loves you loves you for just being yourself
aha
i think to me that would be the greatest
respects you also
yeah no matter who you are
UNK
and when you do find its beautiful
up there
sharing your life with someone you want to be with that person and you know that if any thing happens you've got that person to rely on and i think if your alone you don't have that
if you can find that person yes
yeah well i did because my husband before were married was my bus driver on the s m t buses
he certainly found me and from there we just went from strength to strength and erm were still have together
lo yes
if your looking for love and your absolutely desperate there's always a thing called date line which i believe is very successful and i know at least two people who've got very happy UNK from that so
really
oh yes
advertising
yes advertising it seems UNK incredible to me but erm if any if any thing
i haven't tried that but thank you
well no er lets put lets put that to the vote erm have you ever advertised for love either through a UNK agency or of course many newspapers carry erm what they called lonely hearts columns now its alright you can vote i'm not going to pick on you particularly
because er so few so few of you have admitted to doing it well five people here have dare i ask if any one would like to say whether or not it was successful yes
well yes and no erm every body that seemed to get involved there seemed to be some strange thing missing
erm like finance for instance
oh
you know they were willing to share what i had but could give nothing financially in return
i don't know i'm very sceptical
you've heard a lot of wisdom on this programme tonight
yes
i didn't advertise for a partner but i went to the UNK and UNK club and met my second husband and its magic the second time around
yes any other yes
hi i haven't advertised myself but i'm aware of friends who have and the biggest problem seems to be that when they respond to the ads and then they meet the gentleman in question who's described themselves as six feet two who's UNK and extremely UNK
turns out to be five foot two dark hair and really not all that good looking after all and so the problem with the advertising is that you know how one person sees themselves and UNK themselves not always the way they actually appear so its er UNK
ah so the message there is erm there's short dark men out there if that's your fancy
is there advertising for a partner i mean is it can't does it come under trade description act
can they be can they be sued afterwards
okay well i think we'll er we'll probably have to stop this as we've run out of time let me let me ask the people here one final question are you in love right now button one for yes and button two for no my goodness sixty two people are rushing home the other thirty eight
are staying for a coffee good night
its a during the course of the time of the UNK jesus is on the cross and its says there were two others also who were criminals were being lead away to be put to death with jesus and they came to the place called the UNK there they crucified him and the criminals one on the right and the other on the left but jesus was saying father forgive them for they do not know what they are doing and they cast locks divided up his garments among themselves and the people stood by and looking on and even the UNK was UNK at him excuse me and even the UNK were UNK at him saying he saved others let him save himself if this is the christ of god his chosen one and the soldiers also UNK him coming up to him offering UNK wine and saying if your the king of the jews save yourself now there was also an UNK above him this is the kind of the jews and one of the criminals who was UNK there was UNK at him and saying you are not the christ save yourself and us but the other answered and UNK him said do you not even fear god since you are under the same sentence of UNK and we indeed UNK for we are receiving what we deserve for our deeds but this man has done nothing wrong and he was say and he was saying jesus remember me when you come in your kingdom jesus said to him truly i say to you today you shall be with me in UNK i wonder if you've ever been in that awful position of facing of what you thought was certain death perhaps you were seriously ill and er there seemed little hope of your recovery perhaps you were facing some danger some risk and it seemed almost certain that short of a miracle you were gonna die i wonder what sort of thoughts would have been going through your mind maybe w may well be that you were with other people i wonder what sort of things if you were in a condition of speaking what sort of things you would of been saying to them
now i suppose for most of us because of the very fact were here this morning they have been few and far between such experiences perhaps what is more common is that we may have spent time with someone who was dying their last few hours their last few minutes and if they were not unconscious i wonder what sort of conversation would be going on between us and them what sort of things would we would we of been saying what would we be asking us well in this passage that we have been reading we have just such a conversation two men who are on the verge of death can only be hours away for both of them and here they have this conversation it was in that sense it was one of the UNK interviews any body ever had with jesus not only is the account here of er a death bed conversion but the one who is saving is also in the process of dying
jesus had many interviews with people we've looked at some of them over these past few weeks the time when he met with UNK the religious leader the time he went out of his way to meet with a woman of UNK in her UNK need the other occasion that we looked at er a week or so back when he called UNK from that tree of which he was hiding last week his judge pilot but of all those interviews and as many others that we haven't looked at this surely must be one of the UNK as jesus himself is in the process of dying and as he is dying he is confronted with another person who has a need but jesus your need is as greatest as any body UNK your pain your suffering your physical suffering was every bit of great as those around you why be bothered with others isn't that so often our story when we are in need we can forget all about other people it doesn't matter there need its poor me what about me what about my need what about my requirements what about my suffering but we see here how jesus apart from any thing else deals with his own suffering he deals with it by UNK to the needs of other people and this surely then must be one of the most strange and one of the most interviews that our lord ever had when he was here on earth with this dying thief but he was more than a thief he was a er he was a re a UNK he was a terrorist or a freedom fighter depending on which way you wanted to look at it and he was dying for his crimes and he wasn't alone because there was this man we've been talking about there was jesus and there was another one another criminal on the other side and we find that this is all in keeping with what god had promised all there in line with his UNK way back in UNK chapter fifty three it tells us that he was numbered with the UNK that he died with sinful men with law UNK and here it is its happening right in front of the very eyes of the jewish leaders and the jewish authorities our lords intention in coming into the world was to save men and women to seek out and to save sinners remember thirty odd years previous to this event the word had come for mary his mother to joseph we will call his name jesus because he will save his people from their sins and later on writing to timothy the apostle paul in the first chapter of the first book in verse fifteen he says it is a trust worthy statement UNK full acceptance that christ jesus came into the world to save sinners this was his purpose this was his reason for coming into the world not to be a good man not to be a great leader not to give us some model that we can you know that we can plan our life out and try and live up to his standards he says i've come to give my life as a UNK i have come to save and to seek that which was lost and here in this incident as he himself is dying and is in physical pain and UNK he is carrying out this very work of seeking out and saving of those who will turn to him those who will put their trust in him he is saving the lost and we see in a wonderful how great the compassion of jesus was and is in reaching out and rescuing those who are lost here we see our lord suffering the most terrible UNK and yet in the midst of his own sorrow and pain and UNK he thinks of this dying thief and UNK his grace and mercy to him
perhaps the book of UNK is not the book you normally turn to find words of encouragement but there are tremendous UNK to be found in it listen what the profits says there in the third chapter he says this i recall to my mind and he's talking about the time of his own UNK the time when he is going through it the time when nobody loves him the time when everybody's against him when he's suffering and he's in pain the time when life is full of UNK for him he says this i recall to my mind therefore i have hope the lords loving UNK indeed never UNK for his UNK never fail and here jesus is demonstrating that he's UNK never fail he's loving UNK they never cease here in his dying hour jesus is showing that in reaching out to this man but as we said the other week the UNK the most important significance of what jesus did then of what jesus said then its not just of the historical account but that he is able and willing to say and to do exactly the same today in your experience and in mine what he did for that man on the cross he's ready and willing to do for every one of us the incident may of happened nineteen hundred years ago but there's the old hymn the verse reminds us picks out that very story and it says the dying thief UNK to see that fountain in his day and there may i though via us he wash all my sins away and that verse from william UNK hymn it takes up that great historical event that tremendous happening in that man's life and he links it with a present and it applies it to you and to me and says this can be our experience as well
so lets just as we hurry along this morning notice several things about this interview that this man had with jesus
i'm never quite sure really to be honest whether these individuals had an interview with jesus or jesus had an interview with them because whether they thought that jesus or whether they thought they were doing the UNK and the questioning really it was jesus who was in charge of the interview you may of watched er certain chat shows on the on the television or heard them on the radio and er depending who the person being interviewed is very often it actually changes and its the UNK who really is being put through it its the its the person who's being interviewed is in charge of the situation and that was the case here jesus
but lets just notice two or three things in this particular interview the first thing that we see and its so obvious is that the way of salvation is so UNK simple it couldn't be easier you know there are so many people who think it is hard to get saved who think it is hard to come to christ and to become a christian well the problem is you see the devil has UNK their eyes they've UNK the eyes of men and women so that they think that they can't do this but what is actually happened paul tells us in UNK in the first er in to UNK in chapter four and verse four he says the god of this world has UNK the eyes of the UNK that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory of christ who is the image of god and there is this UNK this covering but the thing is god takes that away so that we can see and so its not difficult to become a christian it is not hard to get saved sometimes as christians we are guilty of making it difficult for people to become christians we put all sorts of rules in we make them UNK various periods of er of probation before we wer we've were willing to call them christians remember the UNK he cried out there to the apostle paul who was er in jail there with UNK the be the tremendous UNK and they were released all their UNK was were broken and the prisoners were all could of escaped and the UNK the UNK he UNK out a question that i'm sure he doesn't even know what he means when he calls it out he's not thinking of heaven he's not thinking of the future life he's not thinking of having his sins dealt with but he just UNK out what must i do to be saved and the apostle paul and he gets opens the UNK and he starts in genesis and he explains the plan of salvation and he tells him what he's got to do and he explains all the requirements and then about three or four hours later the UNK mind is completely UNK he doesn't understand a word of it its gone way beyond him
now we're not talking about UNK here we're talking about eating disorders
what they are how they can affect people and why
and perhaps what we can do about them
all of us or perhaps not all of us but most of us do worry about our food we eat too much we eat too little we eat the wrong thing
i'd like to try and define what the difference between and eating disorder and simply wanting to be a different shape or a different size is
but perhaps you could first start by answering this question do you ever worry about what you eat
button one for yes and button two for no
and in this hundred my goodness
eighty six people said yes fourteen no
those eighty six why did you say yes when yo when i er ho how did you interpret what i said about worrying
yes
yes
i was a previous anorexia UNK
mm
i didn't have a view of what my body should be like i always thought i was fat regardless of what weight
yep
i was and it's never gone away even though i've put my weight back on
yes
i think there's another point around that about erm the image that's portrayed by the media and to be successful in your career you must be a slim well made up woman erm and UNK with success and an ability to get on in life
it's also true that we make moral and ethical judgements about women in particular who are UNK even
mm
by a small amount
and studies have shown that women and men tend to judge a women as being less intelligent and less competent and certainly obviously less attractive if she is UNK
mhm
yes
er i wonder if there is in fact er a view that women expect men to have of them that's th the desirable woman
and i just happen to have with me
pain painted in the turn of the century er a UNK
ah yes
a very famous one
in which all the women are well UNK and all enjoying food
and drink
now if you compare with today
aha
when the does when the UNK came in and the UNK woman er of which i am not i wonder if that was the male view or what is the wo the view that women have of themselves
i think women who are UNK have to work an awful lot harder to prove that they're just as good
mhm
as somebody
and generally speaking do twice as much work put in twice as much effort and just to prove they're as good
not better or anything else just as good so that i'm all these things that fat doesn't matter
and we're constantly trying to convince ourselves that fat doesn't matter
right now what has this got to do with eating disorders
i mean where do eating disorders come from
do they come from the kind of perceptions that we're hearing or is it something different
yes
i think eating disorders are very much weight is a UNK
mm
it's not the fact
eating disorders tend to come from childhood or problems or ways people have approached food in the past and the pressure is on women to be slim to fit into these categories are er just more pressures that make it very difficult for somebody who has an eating disorder to sort the problem all these pressures just make it more difficult
it's they are not actually responsible for it i don't think but something that has happened that has caused somebody to see food in a different manner
would somebody with expertise here like to define for the rest of us what UNK somebody with a an eating disorder er from someone who's er a UNK or a UNK or no not a UNK at all but someone who just thinks about it a lot
when it takes over your life you know anything that happens to you is related back to food whether it's you know connected or not that is when it becomes an eating problem
instead of you saying oh perhaps something's gone wrong and trying working it out it's all reflected back yourself with food
right are you ta are you talking from er personal experience or people you know
i'm a UNK
a UNK of
anorexia
now anorexia is much written and talked about but perhaps not accurately how would you define anorexia
i would say that the criteria that's sent out at the moment is far too strict for the lot a lot of women and at the moment you're expected to be UNK whereas th you can very well be thirteen stone and UNK it's it depends on your attitude towards food
we have to find criteria for anorexia
mhm
UNK which essentially means er loss of body weight or fifteen percent your normal UNK with weight and loss of your periods for three months and a UNK fear of gaining weight
and why you may argue that those criteria are too strict those are criteria that are used in a medical sense
well perhaps while we're doing it all we're talking about anorexia we should talk about the er the associated erm disorder UNK which is only recently become something that people are generally aware of
wo would you like to offer er a definition of UNK as well
well UNK is a disorder of UNK
er these UNK take places regularly and they may amount to between three to five thousand UNK in one UNK
what does that mean three to five thousand UNK
i mean er
a normal day you might eat two three and a half thousand UNK so within one short period of eating you would take in maybe double that
er associated with that are certain UNK typically UNK abuse erm use of UNK which are water tablets or excessive exercising
again there are very many over valued ideas about weight and what that means to the individual and a pre occupation with weight
i believe that the root cause of anorexia and people who UNK and in fact they are failed UNK really
there's th the aim is the same the aim is not to not to gain weight er and the control has been lost when th when it's necessary to UNK
but i believe that the root cause of UNK is a is a deep seated UNK in the individual
mhm
erm i would agree that erm what you saying about the UNK thing and the fact that's it's a sort of deep seated UNK but i think that's far too general
you know i think that erm this idea of UNK being erm sorry UNK being failed UNK is a wee bit kind of unfair
erm i think the sort of emotional erm sort of like characteristics of both eating disorders are very similar
but i think the reasons why UNK need to UNK erm is completely different from what than erm
an emotion that an UNK could be suffering from
it's er more to do with the feeling of it's like filling gaps erm
yep
erm emotional gaps UNK go you know just a whole sort of like range of various emotions
erm where possibly like the UNK well i don't know cos i'm not speaking from an UNK point of view but i think the point we're saying emotions are there but they're dealt with in a different way you know they perhaps UNK themselves erm to sort of like erm you know ge get across these emotions to deal with these emotions
mhm
yes
and one of the differences that anorexia can become much more visible and UNK whereas those of us who have experienced UNK which i had for thirteen years can be extremely secret and well UNK because we normally don't change from normal body weight
what's the difference between UNK and UNK eating
is there a difference
well in the definition that we heard it tends to be associated with trying to rid your body of the food that you've UNK during a UNK
UNK eating normally doesn't go to that extent
how did you stop bu UNK i mean it was
in the end it was the
thirteen years of UNK i mean
yeah
wha what effect does that have on you
erm it makes it very difficult to imagine how you'll recover erm but in the end it's a personal decision to try to achieve self respect to care for yourself better to adopt good habits of UNK and exercise not UNK cos UNK are the biggest con trick of all and certainly to rid your life of people who don't respect and accept you the way you are
can you identify why you began doing it
i mean how old were you when you started er UNK
fifteen
yes
fifteen
i was certainly to do with feeling that i would have to be a little bit UNK that i would have to be acceptable to other people that i would have to change my shape and at the same time i could not resist consuming large amounts of food
now fifteen seems terribly young
that's right
for a girl to start to start worrying about that kind of thing
is that a UNK pressure
i mean is it a ah th wi is there any history of it in the family an and what did your family did you family know
families don't generally know
and it wasn't until many years later that i told anyone at all that's the thing i was saying about UNK it's very secret
and in the end did you i mean wha did you get the support of professionals or
yes
erm but in the end th o only one had any impact and in general see seeing a female professional was i have to say a lot more helpful than seeing male professionals
mm
yes
er my experience is slightly different when erm when i had been trying to sort of recover i didn't i didn't feel as if i've get any help from professionals that i approached
and in fact i get an awful lot of support from friends erm not family because my family aren't weren't aware of it erm but i mean really it came from UNK really close friends that i could sit down and talk to and that could understand me and accept me just like what the girl said as well
mm
yes
i think my g p actually sent me further down hill into anorexia after i'd lost about when i was seven stone i went to see her i'd never seen her before and she said well you look perfectly UNK acceptable to me so i went on to lose two more stone before going back to see her and was admitted to hospital as a medical emergency
and did continue to get professional help after that but i think she was actually one of the factors that sent me further down by telling me i looked well
what age were you then
twenty
yeah
and can you identify why yo wa was are yo are you now over it
are you
yeah i would class myself as a recovered UNK but as recovered as i'll ever be
i don't think i'll ever totally get over it
i've still got a very distorted body image that i have to live with
i think i'm fat
the reality of anorexia for you was what just not eating at all
cutting down on food i was university missing whole meals telling people i was training i'm a p e teacher so sport and the perfect body was very much up front so the more weight i lost the better i was told i looked until it became totally out of control and i was eating an apple and black coffee a day and then UNK so that i had nothing in me
erm my UNK was out the window
now as a p e teacher you're working what boys and girls
yes
do you see ah th the pe the boys and girls or the young people that you're working with erm having the same UNK towards the same kind of thing i mean do you see pressures on girls towards achieving that perfect body in the way that you felt it yourself at one time
i see boys calling the girls fat and it makes my hair stand on end
erm it goes on continually and these poor girls are oh you're fat
you've got a great big bottom
and they're not they don't have they're normal
i wonder what you think of what you're hearing
yes
i just wondered how much actual help professionals are
i mean is there really enough help given
i mean we talk about eating disorders
yeah
but do they really actually dig into the real reasons for the eating disorders or they just try and get you back onto a stable diet
yes
i think what put me off in th and certainly em UNK was some of the comments as around control of our lives
mhm
and maybe hope that we as people as women need to do is regain control of our lives so they belong to us so it doesn't matter if boys say we've got fat UNK or not yo you say my UNK alright an and you live with that
i'd be interested to know the lady who mentioned that er she got help from friends what sort of help did she get from her friends
i mean how can you help someone with a problem like this
how best can you help someone with a problem like this
it was really difficult
erm she started really by well th well there is two of them involved at the time but they started by reading a book on the subject and really just talking to me about it certainly because i mean they really didn't understand you know because food to them is just food you know it was just some meal they had to eat because they were hungry and they couldn't understand why i had got this whole thing completely distorted
erm there was a i mean there was a lot of friction i mean i mean i'm really lucky to have the strength of a friendship that i did because you know if i wouldn't have got you know where i am sort of without it i think
aye so you related to that more than you would UNK related to a professional a doctor or someone
erm when i first approached
trying to help you
doctors they started putting me on anti UNK sleeping pills erm and you know they were their whole manner was just absolutely terrible
i mean i felt that it made me worse as well by going to them and i decided that i would never go back to them again you know
that's quite interesting
is it a yes there
can i just sort of say i'm somebody working on a team er that deals with eating disorders
i think things have changed quite dramatically in the last few years certainly we admit very few people and we see them mostly as an UNK
i think it actually depends where you go to seek help and who your first erm person that you go to
mhm
i mean there is a i don't know if anybody saw there was a programme on it was actually b c erm this week it was about somebody who felt that she was very UNK and actually had her stomach UNK
and i mean i find that really horrendous
i think your g p is maybe one of the first places to go but the trouble i think with people with eating problems is it's very hard to explain what the problem is
mhm
and i think that's what a lot of problem with condemned by the g p is they're not able to UNK the UNK that's coming from the eating disorder so they're told to go away and put on a couple of pounds and because they haven't expressed that feeling the g p can't or isn't thinking enough to try and UNK into it a little bit more
so what would be better
i think one of the most important things is finding a trusting friend or a member of family so that you can then try express some of the feelings so that you're in a better position erm to try and explain the problem
one of the great difficulties is that many young people find it extremely difficult to admit that they have a problem
and in fact even with as many professionals as one would wish it's often extremely difficult to actually engage people in treatment erm and the whole process of getting people into treatment or into health can be very difficult both for the young person and for the UNK or UNK involved
i don't want to give the impression that professionals are UNK at all
i mean UNK said earlier it's a question of eventually making your mind up that you want to do something about it but then professionals are maybe there to assist
what you've described must be something that erm that families of people who are suffering from eating disorders must feel very much that there's nothing that they can do to help
families feel very rejected by professionals erm in my research i've found that er the families of younger UNK tend to be involved in treatment but they feel very much that they're under the UNK that they UNK that they're seen as being UNK families
with older UNK erm usually families are excluded from treatment they're kept out they're told that they're daughter erm must be seen on her own and they feel very UNK and very UNK and UNK by the professionals
mm
erm in fact i've found that the families are no different from any other families there's no typical UNK family
i think erm yo e you know you asked about the support and i think having identified that there was a gap in the support in
mhm
times of i mean i actually think it's a an awful lot of ask of a friendship or of a family situation and also indeed if you i mean i think sometimes they can be very supportive but th the true understanding may not be there and erm i think that's what led me to start up a self help group in edinburgh erm which is has been erm running for the last two years now
and i think that level of real understanding that you do get from fellow UNK and indeed it's a su it's a support for erm families as well who are able to come along and share that kind of support
mhm
after my own experiences i wo i wouldn't advice someone not to go to their g p but firstly i would advice them to contact the eating disorders association er because they are very helpful and they're more supportive than any g p i've ever come across
okay
yes
you mentioned er earlier about yo the fact that you were surprised that it was fifteen year olds and that was quite young
yeah
and yet in fact that's the time when you're most vulnerable yo it's time of UNK your
mhm
interested in fashion your interested in the opposite sex and th the ages between fifteen and eighteen teenagers ar tend to be UNK if it's not er their body shape th it's UNK
i think there's a third fact that you touched on earlier that i think it's just worth mentioning and that is that we know it's also a genetic pre UNK to anorexia UNK in other words we know that in certain families it is a disorder that will run from one generation to another
na yes
erm i'd consider myself to have an eating disorder but i don't have anorexia or UNK
and er i first started feeling i was UNK when i fourteen and i was i was twelve stone and i went to the doctor and got black UNK to take which had me as high as a UNK for a long time
and then there were the dose was reduced and then i had to come off them altogether and after twenty nine years of UNK i gave up UNK and i haven't put on any weight since i gave up UNK
and what UNK why did you stop
erm a friend started a self help group which i went to
and i realised well i had realised for a long time that UNK wasn't the answer for me
and erm
oh so over twenty nine years you're saying that food was controlling your life in a way
oh yes
very much so
i mean that was that was the dominant thing was wha what you
i could have told you every single item of food i had in the cupboard every down to the last UNK
and now i don't know
i have sweets lying on the counter i don't have to take them if i don't want to
i'm not controlled by food any more and i don't feel guilty any more
i think the lady who said earlier when you go to your g p you can't express yourself
mm
i went to my g p having avoided her for fifteen years having getting the old story every time you went well you must go on a diet
i had been on UNK and to put it in context over twenty years i've lost a hundred and twenty stone
which if you break it down is only about a pound and three quarters a week
and i think a lot of people are like that
but when you look at it in that context it becomes very much erm part of your life and it takes an awful lot to break that habit and there's no help
up there
i think it's very easy to fall into the trap of feeling guilty
mm
erm i went on a diet last year to one of these clubs and within record time got to the weight i was supposed to be UNK counting and then i had to come off and i found for weeks after feelings of terrible guilt if i ate
mm
a chocolate UNK
i was mentally UNK counting every time it took me ages to get back to a sort of normal life
can you identify th that the point at which worrying about food we've all agreed we shouldn't be but there it is we do er pitches you into eating disorder and er i know ca is there UNK action to be taken apart from changing society completely
yes
i think it's when you become UNK absorbed around the areas of food i think too because i work with teenagers
mm
that early intervention is the best way of coping with it and certainly it demands that parents and friends and teachers and people concerned are aware of any change which is sustained over a period because by early intervention then you're probably coping with the problem rather than the eating disorder because the problem is there before the eating disorder
erm can intervention as you call it be effective do you think
very
if it's early before the UNK really UNK
yes
i think it's wrong to UNK erm i it's particularly initially how positively reinforced it can it can be around you erm just this the idea of losing weight and that er you know people will be wha for whatever reasons are either UNK or they want to know how you can do it they want to know and particularly if it's linked with exercise then it's all very good things to do and you know the UNK telling you and a everyone's telling that this healthy lifestyle that actually then goes out of control through being so controlled erm e there's a well there's a thin line between it being a very positive experience and you're suddenly buying smaller jeans and erm you know it's just everything is feeding if that's the right word this idea that it that it's tremendous to be
mm
losing weight to UNK that you can't do anything about it
i think the advice i would give any mother of an UNK is to tell them how awful they look
i wish i'd been told early on what i looked like and what i was doing to my body
nobody wanted to be cruel enough to hurt me because they thought i was so vulnerable at that time and i really wish i'd been told that i looked disgusting
but at another level if we could show love respect and acceptance for each other in the magnificent diversity that we show as women instead of UNK and attacking each other on the basis of our body shapes that would be a great step forward
UNK
yes
i'd like i'd just say that i the are professionals now that do know more about eating disorders and i do think there are UNK being set up
erm we do know quite a lot about erm why it is that when you diet you start to think about food all the time and why it is that certain things happen and i think that there's more and more information and knowledge being gathered and yes the na the desire to change has to come from the individual but perhaps having UNK available where people can go when they're ready to change or where they can get help
i think very often you do need professional help and it isn't possible to do it with family and friends because of the interaction that actually makes it worse
so there's a practical suggestion and i like i like UNK philosophical suggestion that we could start celebrating the diversity of human kind
i mean that's the kind of thing one often hears on this programme is it UNK thinking or d'you think we could actually achieve it
oh
UNK
yes
i think the media have an awful lot to answer for
yeah
i run one of the self help groups that one of the ladies mentioned and we looked at an UNK catalogue recently and it went up to size twenty six and in some cases up to a size thirty and the ladies who UNK the clothes were no bigger than a twelve possibly a fourteen but a very UNK fourteen
mm
mm
so the media even when anything you do depends on your size yo your image is all for a woman your brain or your ability really comes way down the line
you have to look good first before anyone UNK to your other abilities
but looking big and good are not UNK are they
i was just gonna say i think we should possibly stop blaming the media or whatever actually happens and perhaps echo what the lady earlier said i think that it's in our hands we're the women that could make this happen
yes
well i
i was just si oh sorry
i'm sorry
one at a time
i was just sitting here wondering why men don't have this image problem
because there are an awful lot of UNK men and i don't see any problem with them at all
they don't seem to have any problems between each other either
i'm quite concerned that my four year old daughter is after a UNK and wondering whether perhaps UNK shouldn't be produced in erm such UNK figures as real life
well there's an
are we are we providing
an interesting idea
our future generation with women with an ideological figure such as UNK
a lot of ideas and certainly worth talking about it
it's something i hope we'll talk about again
i hope you've learnt something and i know that i have
thanks very much for joining us
football
let's talk about football
just a boy's game
a good UNK for male aggression
a bad excuse for UNK
a religion
all of the above
or something completely different
i know what your thinking there's enough football on the box already
or maybe what have women got to say about football
i can just imagine
well i wonder if you can
let's find out
let me ask you this question first of all do you like football
button one for yes and button two for no
goodness knows there's enough of it around in scotland
so do you like it since you have to be aware of it
sixty one of you say yes
thirty nine no
who said no and why
why did you say no
yes
well i think it's er too UNK
i er and i don't think there's er all that much intelligence in it
it's a physical game and erm i it seems to me that er people should er develop their brain a little more and play games er which have more i interest for everyone not just the people who like a good shout
fair enough
who else said no
where are the UNK
yes
i think there's too much publicity over it
the big games are good to watch they're quite exciting but week after week you get the english divisions some of the scottish divisions and it's really quite boring
personally
but you don't have to watch it
no but when you switch on the telly on a saturday afternoon there's football
especially sunday nights too
right
so there's too much on television
on sunday all afternoon it's flipping football and it drives me crazy
there's far too much of it
there's other things on
i think it should be UNK
you don't see enough tennis
but by god there's football
aha
so it's so other sports you like there's just too much football
well t to me there's too much football
here
i think football seems to bring out the worst in a lot of people and that's the part of it that i don't like
when you say people
well erm the fans of football and especially if it's like old games etcetera when you see the results of the UNK with them
so you don't mind the game it's everything that goes with it
yes
or some of the things that go with it
some of the things that go with
yep
it
yep
i was going to say you say you don't have to watch it well you want to come and stay in my house
why
because if UNK on it has to be watched
it's like a religion
fi
who
UNK followed every week UNK rain or UNK
stand in the UNK and watch it and then come back and watch the highlights on UNK at night
discuss if we should go out socially er it becomes a kind of religion
who is this who's watching it
husband
just him
well him and virtually ninety nine percent of male population in scotland yeah
but not all in your front room
hopefully not no
okay
yes
it gets worse when you've got a satellite television and it's on up to about five times a week
it's really quite it can be a real bore
that's your situation
i'm afraid so yes
yeah
yep
and i have a sister in law who used to play for a women's football team so she's very interested and a as soon as there's a big game on the satellite they all come round and it's sort of into the kitchen you can make the half time
so it's not just
the ninety nine percent of the male
no
male UNK
no both my sister in laws did play at one time for scottish women's football
up there
women should not play football
it's far too UNK a game
women shouldn't
especially when the a woman is UNK she could kicked in a womb she could get kicked in the
don't say they don't kick they do
it's not a game for women
yes
my husband made me wait while i was in labour till a game finished
until he'd before he took me to hospital
but how
can we can i how he made how did you
it was my first baby and i was UNK and he said there was no need to panic
there was time to watch this game
before we went up to UNK
yes
i must admit that i one of the reasons i don't like football i think it is in fact it's probably a very it is in fact a very nice game
a good game
yeah
but them the way that it's played now is it's not erm it's not good to watch
there's too much UNK
and that's one of the reasons that i don't like it
you seen grown men kicking and pulling UNK and
yep
i mean it's i think it's quite ridiculous really
yep
yep
i dislike like the UNK it brings out in the game
it really it's it shouldn't be
it used to be a family sport here father and son and mother even went with them
but the UNK now UNK the game
it really does
okay
so it UNK our screens it UNK our man it's a religion it encourages UNK it encourages to neglect their se their er domestic duties plenty of reasons for not liking football
now sixty one of you said you liked it and you've been UNK listening to this wha er how would you reply to all those various views
yes
i disagree
i find it one of the UNK most exciting games about
i exist with a primary school football team and th the two skills that they're able to develop the powers of concentration and hopefully a sense of fair play
er the involvement of parents er in the school life too
i like football and i find all the other views i've heard all a bit negative
if you don't like to watch it on television there is the switch off
depends who's in control of the switch though doesn't it
yes
well i would just like to say i find football an absolutely beautiful game
mhm
if played properly it's poetry in motion
and as the lady down here said if the ladies don't like it switch it off
if i had the chance i'd watch it twenty four hours a day
well let's find bit a ba a bit find out a bit more about the people here
let me ask you a couple of questions
do you go to football matches
button one for yes and button two for no
and out of this hundred thirty six of the presumably of the sixty one who like football go
i don't suppose any of those thirty six are dragged along UNK or are you
well we'll maybe come to that
i expect some people watching might think that wo football is a boy's game rather than a girl's game but of course that isn't the tradition is it
i think it's a great game
football for women and men
now you're speaking from experience aren't you
yes
i played football for when i was ten year old
but i don't go to football now i watch the television cos i'm seventy three now but it never any harm
some people say it's not very good for women to play football
that's a lot of rubbish
well tell me what's good about football for women
because it's a good sport
mhm
there's a you could do a lot worse things that play football
well i UNK probably i do but
and
i don't play football
there's
so how
did you get into the game sixty three years ago
well i was born in UNK
aha
and i played football in the street with the boys cos you had nothing else to do you had nowhere else to go in my time
right
mm
so i played this and i taught myself and i had i played at england and all over for oth a ladies team played a on a man's team and er the we the west and that
but the men didn't play you rough or anything but we had some good games
what you played against the men
aye well i played against men but i mean it's not the same
i mean they the men are more stronger and that but i've run around a couple of them and i've lo
not lost a heat
and put it that way
now ther so the there's a UNK and there ar i know there are other footballers among whe where are the other footballers who are here
identify yourselves
yes
yo you've played haven't you
who
aye
do you play with
er i play with UNK ladies
since when
and how did you get into it
i can't really answer how i got into it me i got three big brothers so maybe that's got part to do with it
erm i've played with UNK ladies for about five years but previously i played with UNK
er i played the game for a good number of years as well
i wouldn't agree with everybody's saying it's a physical game
what would you say
it's a sport that's really enjoyable i mean if you want to play you play it
if you don't fair enough you sports you want
are there good opportunities for women to play football if they want to
i cannot answer that
do you think there's a prejudice against women playing football or do you think it's easy fo for women to play football
it is easy for them to play football it's like other sports but i mean people say that sports is nay for women
but that's not true
if you want to do it you do it
the difference is that football isn't really encouraged at schools cos
mm
i played football after school but was never encouraged to play it erm within the school programme within p e or anything it was hockey or UNK and women just aren't encouraged at all to play football
up there
yeah well my local schools the girls say there's a football team and they've done quite well through to the UNK so it is en encouraged in local school of mine
yep
there
in some places abroad they have the women playing football before the actual big games which it would be helpful if it was here
i think i would maybe go to a match if the women played a wee game before the men came on
i
and
think it's UNK that actually do that
would you watch fo women fo i mean given the
i would
yes
and what about th the woman beside you who who's television is on a lot and it's football
would yo would you watch it if it was women playing
possibly not because i've grown to dislike the game
aha
aha
it is a case isn't it that if you want to be a er a professional woman UNK certainly there's more opportunities on the continent than there are in britain is that the case
yes
you get erm twenty four UNK clubs women's football in scotland giving you three divisions so it's quite widespread
erm i work for scottish women's football and the plans we have for this year erm shall hopefully encourage more women to come into the sport
it's a good sport for women to play in and there's lots of developments going on in the sport and we would like to go into the under UNK and the under UNK
so hopefully erm if any ladies are interested in a couple of years their children and even themselves if they want to come along and play
now am i the only person to whom a lot of this is news
i mean it's partly i suppose because i don't watch a lot of football but women's football is not generally it's occasionally you get an article in the press and it's seen as a kind of UNK thing
it's very unusual
look women are doing it too
and yet as er as linda said women have been playing football for the last seventy and before that i mean op throughout the century women have been playing football
but it's never really taken off in this country
well this is a problem we have basically because again your media etcetera is male dominated erm everything we come across in our line is male dominated so we have got to break down these barriers and it isn't easy to do
erm we have quite a few helpful people within the sport but we could do with a lot more friends
okay
yes
i and in glasgow and we attempted to break some of the barriers you're talking about by holding a girl's week and part of the girl's was to run a five a side UNK and we were also breaking down UNK barriers we had girls from different housing schemes within the east end of glasgow but i feel the opportunities don't exist
we did that and they did self defence as well as five a side football but the opportunities aren't there for them
there's one young i work with who can't afford to be a member of UNK football ladies women's football club she's seventeen she's on UNK allowance she hasn't got the money to pay the six pound a week it would cost her
mm
mm
so i feel that women are very restricted
well how do young boys manage to find the six quid a week it takes to
because there in more er they play within the school system there
yeah
are there are more clubs youth clubs promote it
down there
yes
you had your hand up
i work for team sport scotland and part of my UNK is erm coordinator for women and girl's football and i find that with the equal opportunities policies of many of the education regions now that more football is being played in primary and in secondary school and the district councils i go to visit i would say that the majority of them are definitely wanting to put money into promoting girl's and women's football
what about the media problem
i mean why do you think there isn't more channel four i know ran some women's football er recently but th they haven't kept it up very regularly but wh why is that
i mean is it simply because men dominate the schedules
is there an audience for women's football out there
how many of you would watch it
in fact maybe i should ask you that question
if there was women's football on television would you watch it
button one for yes and button two for no
now i wonder if there are advertisers and UNK well i know there are advertiser and UNK watching out there
sixty two of you have said yes
there's nowhere that you see anywhere advertising
mm
where the games are getting played or i've never seen it in a paper that i've picked up in the morning it's never been in it
mhm
don't you think the s f a could help a lot more
well
promoting it financing it from the
i've a feeling you've put your finger on a UNK there
why doesn't the s f a give more support to the s w f a can i ask you that
er yes you can ask me that
i think if you ask the s f a er at the moment we have currently very good relationships with the s f a we're not UNK to them we're UNK we're recognised by them
would you like to be UNK
i don't know if we'd like to be UNK
we do have erm slight UNK with the sport then
aha
erm which is maybe a good thing to have
it would depend on the benefits you get that come with affiliation and i'm not sure what the benefits are
yes
the only way forward for scottish women's football is to become UNK to the s f a and i can remember back as far as far back as nineteen seventy one when we pushed for that and agreed to recognise us
now the only way we can go forward and progress is to take the UNK advice and UNK we need UNK for the kids
and how's that gonna be achieved
th they just need to think about the game
aha
be a bit more UNK
yes
i understand that are
mm
a lot of women who are enthusiastic
yes
well it was we started years ago
yes
i mean there's would recognise us they would no of gave you ball
all don so miserable
and the write up in one of the papers well i was well i'd to tell that guy if he's watching i can ya nip
yes
i think men don't like women to play football
men have got this thing that they think it's their game and they just don't want women involved
they wouldn't watch women's football i don't think if it was on
mm
television
i do think we should encourage more from a very young age when children are in school so that
mm
young children are encouraged to play football when they are
but that seems to be happening
it's seems to happen to i
not
i mean it seems to be available for youngsters but afterwards
not as often as one would like it to be
not as often as you would like
they could do more after school
yes
the er in response to your question about scotland i mean i think
mhm
perhaps we have to look at the UNK thing in that there's something very macho seen as macho about football in scotland which is stand on the UNK with a short UNK shirt in zero degrees and having someone UNK down your leg and
sort of assume that's a good saturday UNK entertainment
seriously i mean people i'm sure here have seen
yep
people going to football matches and there is this very macho attitude that
mm
football belongs to men
if we were sitting here just now debating tennis or
mm
UNK you know there's women's tennis men's tennis women's UNK men's UNK
mm
there's no issue
the minute you mention football there's an issue
why
no sport belongs to any one sex
yes
right i'm very involved in women's hockey
yep
and er i think until women's football take it on board all the way erm they're not really gonna stand up with the men they have to become UNK they have to become coaches and more and more of these people erm taking responsibility
i go along and watch women's football and get really UNK to see a man out there UNK the game and often in a very UNK manner
instead of UNK someone he'll put his arm round her and say don't
it's not very nice to do that
don't do that again
and i think that's really important that it stands up
yep
on it's own
yep
and i think similarly you have to be very careful about having women's games before men's games because
mhm
sometimes the women is game is seen as a warm up for the
aha
man's game
and it's only a bit of entertainment and we must really stand up and say this is our game and it belongs to us
up there
erm just to go back a wee bit to the thing about th the image and the fight that we have on our hands er to actually break into the media i don't i think people UNK the control an and er the feeling that men have that it's their game and we're not gonna take it away from them
it's as if it's one of the UNK of male power
i mean we had for instance at th i don't know if i'm allowed to say this but the UNK sixes were on recently there was an international match at the half time between er scotland and england which was a really good game
and we had we had been invited to take part in that and it was really good publicity and it wasn't even mentioned on the channel that showed those th those games
but we didn't even nobody even said that there actually game had actually taken part
mm
never mind showed a UNK of it within the UNK sixes
a lot of women actually prefer to watch play football
mm
golf tennis
i mean i do myself
i'd rather watch men play tennis than i would women
and a lot of women feel the same
a lot of friends and my family they all prefer watching men's games
now i think you're quite bold to say that in this company
i know
does anybody agree with that view
yes
yes
aha
yes
i'd i would rather watch UNK cooper play football any day
than er some of the females because he's got skill
that's what
mm
it is you see
aha
i played it
er
i think to change the subject slightly to the managerial type
mhm
in the nineteen seventies i ran a school primary team and at that time a woman UNK football was quite a UNK
mhm
and it was the attitude of the other men going to a play another school i came across this man who asked me who the referee was on that particular day
and i said it was me to be met with what the UNK do you know about football
mm
and i pointed out that both teams would suffer equally
and i got the great UNK the following season when he said well you're not as bad as i thought you would be
congratulations UNK
can i just say er in primary schools you've got to catch the children young but you never hear of any of the mothers taking the football teams it's always one of the fathers
i think they like to hold that position that they're doing their bit for the school
i remember being at primary school and the boys went to play football and you sat in the corner playing talking or the boys played football and the girls would you believe it got sex education
there's one for you
if that's not discrimination what is
and what happened when the boys got sex education or didn't they
they didn't
they didn't
we got put into this wee room sit down
we'll tell you all we used to look out the window and the boys would be playing football
no i've things have changed since then
yes
er nobody's mentioned the religious bias yet and i don't know how strong it is in edinburgh but in glasgow it is and if people are UNK biased they are ve very often biased a about other things and i da i think people should adopt an attitude of live and let live
if women
mhm
want to run about a UNK field and think it's fun they should do so
i do i don't really see why any one person should tell another what it can and cannot do
mm
but i think you'll find it difficult i in er scotland with men because er they are and same as the north of england they are rather erm er difficult about women coming in to do anything aren't they
i remember being UNK at because i was wearing trousers when i came to live in scotland forty four years ago
yes
yes er yes
i wonder if it's not the game of football that's a problem but the attitude of many of the people involved
mm
i teach physical education erm in the primary schools in edinburgh and because of the equal opportunities obviously i teach football to primary girls and boys but i feel that the girls are not getting the opportunity
mm
to be again learning about football for the stage that they are at
consequently they're always coming in a bit behind the boys because the boys have been playing for a bit longer and i think it's very important that if girls are being offered the opportunity that the opportunity is good for them and that it's not going to put them off the game of football because they're always in the position where the boys consider themselves a bit better
and i see it as part of my problem in education is to erm change the attitudes of the boys who are you know at a very young and i'll be sorry to think that in ten years time they would still be having erm the rather arrogant attitudes that they have
i think it's sort of accepted that men need their leisure time you know it's vital to them to either get out to the pub or get their leisure time and it's women that's considered they don't need it they're you know i don't think it's se considered as important
yes
i think it's often thought of as a way of men getting rid of their aggression and if they can go out there on a saturday and shout and ball and scream then that's fine
and somehow that's okay and women don't need this
which i obviously don't agree with i think they do an UNK just as much and i think that's where sport comes for them
mm
yes
not maybe because like the women have er got young families they're having to look after the families maybe on a saturday afternoon while their husband goes away
aha
alright i mean there's i think we've got more responsibilities where the husband tends to be able to go away and do that a lot easier than what a woman would be able to do
maybe child UNK the ma the main thing
yeah
no chance of a woman playing football while her
mm
while her husband
yeah if she's got a young family i mean nine times out of ten it's her that's got to watch them rather than saying to the husband oh i'm off to play football dear
see you later
mhm
do you see the husband washing a strip
my friend plays for the united and her husband UNK up her boots on a saturday night
he also watches her daughter and er he's quite keen to come along and watch her play
and i think that's where you can start getting the males in the family and just say
yes
it can start for there
yes
it can grow
they can get their friends interested
yes
and take off from there
i mean supposing women's football did get more support and i UNK and i it did become more widespread more popular at every level there was time the resources to do it do you think the things that people complained about football at the top of this programme er the UNK the aggression the UNK do you think they would begin to UNK women's football in the way that some of you think they've overwhelmed men's football
what do you think
yes
i think we're being kind of unfair when it comes to football pa fans on the UNK because the majority of people who go and watch football are not UNK
mm
you know but they're UNK as UNK because they go and watch the sport
now it is a sport and it is a skilled game you know and i think women can play it just as well as men or against men and you know you can have your fans who are very strong for your women's team tha just as much as the men but yet would they also be UNK as UNK because they go along and stand on the UNK and shout for the girls
fair point
yes
i work in a football environment and erm i'm listening to the comments about UNK and UNK in football
we erm at UNK football club as in a lot of other erm UNK and first division clubs specifically develop family UNK areas for women to come along with their husbands and
mm
their children and they've proved very successful
one of the few areas that we sell out on most match days and there's facilities for men and women and we actively develop these areas
we actively develop the toilet areas the canteen facilities so that women are not left at home on a saturday that they can come together on a saturday with their husbands and UNK and watch the game
all the discussion seems to show that the same attitudes are coming through in society
whenever women begin anything it's UNK and shocking to begin with and as more and more women do it more and more people accept it whether men or women
but i think one of the things that men are afraid of is that when women get into the things the attitudes change as we were saying about UNK and religion and so on with football i don't think that men want that because this is the perfect club they can enjoy and UNK all that but if women really get into it the thing will change as society does
splendid
on which note we shall finish
it's been a very UNK programme for me and i hope for you
sixty one of these hundred women like UNK football sixty two would watch it if there was more of it on television
i hope you'll join us again
goodbye
okay if you'd like to push on
just for those of you who have just arrived we're actually recording this session as part of a large spoken database which is gonna be part of a national UNK and so you're being recorded for UNK
we've got a UNK for roger so they will be able to understand him
okay
so that you're gonna database then
erm right
er martin see sends his apologies i'll be actually UNK the meeting for him
erm so if you'd like to kick off
what i'd like to do is go through the minutes of the last meeting
first for a matter of record and each other accurate accurately recollect oh we're actually UNK this
so if anybody would like to shout out if there's not an accurate well if somebody actually listened to it
onto page one page two page three page four and five
so we all agree that's a accurate vaguely accurate reflection of what happened
okay
i'd like to go back to the minutes in terms of matters arising which don't arise under the agenda items
on page one i think that we will record the
mm
on page two i think the first thing was the erm results of the air conditioning on UNK house is still omitted
yes
yeah i'm
still be waiting on them
well we've had interim or final interim reports and wishing now that UNK are actually gonna look at UNK for me
mhm
but erm we're nearly there
okay
put against the letters that i wrote they've all been sent out
i've actually got thirty one copies of at the moment
but it's interesting to know that a lot of the copies either must have copies which they should have or that they know what bin it
it should be a long drawn out process
and i'm sure you'll find a way steve
very long drawn out process
mhm
with regard to any regulations on fire precautions erm department well the government is sitting on those it's unlikely they will be out much before january of next year
as soon as i get a draft i'll let you know what the UNK are
okay fine
now v d u and eye tests i'll take over the main primary agenda
just to give you an update of price
my next comment about erm concerning it's getting saving tables and the like we've actually er agreed accommodation schedule for this year and that's following fro from some changes in customer services o in july
so er to programme a new network
in terms of review of UNK hours erm the review is sort of a constant one which has not really come to head yet in terms of actually being able to write something down so i'm we'll be able to as soon as we as soon i've something which we erm come to any conclusions in terms of UNK hours
the one about the security guard bill he he's now made arrangements for the attendance a first aid er meetings
mm
that is in actual fact a bit difficult for
mm
at the moment you can appreciate
mm
cos if he he's on a twelve hour shift and those meetings tend to be have been around the same sort of time then obviously what we've gotta be careful about is adding any more hours
mm
onto what he's already taken on here
so that's what we've got to understand is that
mm
i think obviously need to be making an appearance now than
yep
mm
suzanne you you're reporting martin
yes
back in the index of UNK
erm
erm paula
paula
twenty four
yeah erm she's nearly finished it paula and it will be issued shortly that
mm
okay it goes onto the main primary agenda for most of the time
moving onto safety am i right
yes
mm
we did at erm we've actually erm sorted the issue UNK out about erm UNK the car park
it erm security are actually carrying it out and clearing the best positions to do so
right
then er overnight
they've also issued to me the appropriate er protective equipment as well and so that er they don't you know so i'll assume that is on the way
good
and we've al we've also
sorry
sorry carry on
and also erm spoken to the police in relation to emergency evacuation in the back
the police have UNK have got a copy of our emergency evacuation procedures at the moment we're waiting for them to return it to us
once they've done that then we shall take the appropriate action needed
right
erm if there's anything else
well there's the
yeah
right
john did you get any reply from the police on that
well yeah i spoke to them like on the telephone erm and basically they er and we agreed that we wouldn't take it any further so it er happened to be a police officer's view as against our view and whilst we didn't agree with the view er we sent enough references to make our point known anyway
so you can take it up with the er do whatever he felt necessary but we left it at that
erm i mean the point the police have made has been addressed
right
but the reasons why have er
okay
i'd like permission
mm
i think that's supposed to mean something i dunno
yes it's yeah
well the next point is between roger and john i didn't understand at all so could you
good
i think someone's already john
maybe you'll like this one
at erm that's that big lighting is there on the basis that if the switch goes down we should have a number of telephones that still have to be available erm and we need to identify them suggested by a red telephone or using a red telephone situated somewhere
er and the issue was yes we need some for emergency use and erm we will also need UNK probably need some for business use
i have spoken joe and i sent a memo to a copy to martin er suggesting where these should be placed and how they should be dealt with
and er we're now sort of waiting to get serious enough
yeah
mm
okay so have gone down there to emphasize the importance of accidents
erm i'll take down the other the main agenda cos we've sort of set up a special group for the
and the next point on the on the number of things that are being reported in the accident books
erm i've in fact become a bit of a artist on accident book and between the nineteen of june ninety two and sixteen and september er december rather there were twenty two complaints UNK about sickness diarrhoea sore throat sore and headaches from the first floor erm of which twenty of these complaints were from females and two were from males
and it is er
it's not very popular
indeed not
let's hear this out
merely presenting it in er as analysis
i actually UNK er
what's the proportion of females on that floor
er good question
actually noticed with an UNK of as well
so er she was the one who pointed that fact to me
i wouldn't have worked it out so erm
stop digging will you
there haven't been any other erm any other areas er of complaint with er
mm
i er in tha in that on the second or third floors but i did in fact look at the first second and third floors to get a comparison
erm the conditions were erm slightly different on the second floor in the sense that there were a few people and a few items of equipment erm and there is a relatively great density of staff on the first floor than i would have found
but if we then we then considered non air conditioning explanations erm which i don't want to go into but there's all sorts of text that one could mention
but if we look at the air conditioning explanations we reckon that the conditions likely to lead to sickness and the related illnesses that were mentioned er was the low UNK that we thought might er be in the area erm because it UNK out the and enables UNK to enter the body more easily
and the other one was the potentially reduce UNK because erm the insufficient air supply air flow within that area means that the UNK aren't getting shifted fast enough
and we also face with a certain stance there where if people blame er turn round to us and say there's a draft here because er the air UNK working they don't wanna sit in a draft
we have in the past switched the air conditioning down which reduces the UNK which means creates makes the situation worse
erm there's
there's two elements in relation to the air conditioning itself er spreading UNK and we take two preventative actions one of which is that we spray all the air conditioning UNK work quarterly with what's known as a UNK and i relate that to the equivalent of sticking a toilet block in the toilet it kills all known UNK sort of thing
and the other thing is that all the air that is within the building is directly supplied from outside the building and is then extracted to the UNK of the building
we don't actually UNK the air within the building so there's no business of people on the second floor giving UNK to people on the first floor and then people giving UNK to people on the ground floor
so those are the actions that we actually take with the air conditioning itself
erm
can i just so can i still
the
pick them up
sorry
yeah sorry
i was looking at actions
yeah
next
yeah
but if you've got any questions on that front
mm
a just a question of whether the sorry you've done all these statistics whether actually the first floor was seemed to be a problem
UNK
well ah that's one of the things i'm leading to
mm
this was this was if you like a record of the eye approach we went round we felt the air and erm er made judgement in the same that people like to be making judgements
mm
about how UNK it is and the like when we agreed that is was erm not as good as it could be may i just say erm but we haven't got any if you like er statistical measurement and one of the actual points that were starting to do now is we're actually going to start reporting tu temperature and UNK on the first second and third floors within g p house
and we're gonna start publishing that information
in actual fact
can i just ask why you're ignoring us lot on the ground floor
why
well you've
i mean
got the doors open presumably
i don't know why you're getting so
because i'm responding directly to accident books and similar conditions
ah i see
and the conditions on the ground floor are somewhat different
cos it's mainly men on the ground floor they don't
i see yes
complain you see
i think i've been UNK grouped
erm
but er
but erm anyway i've forgotten what i was saying now
i be so one of the things we're gonna do is publish that information on a regular basis
erm and we have in fact done some tests on the first and second floor since we did this eye test and er UNK is in fact within the er the health and safety legislation it's within UNK
presumably the temperatures are too
but one of things that we are UNK is that when people complain about UNK er we've been switching the air conditioning up and down to balance it up to suit the individuals needs
what we may have to do is actually balance the air UNK needs up to suit the building if you like rather than individuals concerned and then we'll have to address the individuals concerns the same in terms of moving the desk or moving the person if they're in a draft
erm and we also need obviously to educate people there
the consequences of them wanting the UNK to be turned down
because if we don't actually UNK the building then we're not actually gonna solve the problem
mhm
and we're gonna get hot spots and cold spots
fine
in terms of your research on the action book itself or th or the reports or whatever you said sorry there's nineteen on the first floor you say
i gave you a copy of the notes actually mark
no you said at the start of this
there's erm there's twenty beg your pardon there's twenty two complaints
right
that we had in a six month period
yeah
of which er that was to do with sickness diarrhoea sore UNK sore
UNK headaches
right
which could be air conditioning related
right
we don't know whether they're on they're on the first second or third
that's just the first floor
they were all on the first floor mark
no complaints on the second floor or the third floor or the ground floor
what
well that's fairly UNK fa significant innit
one of the four floors has a got a problem
yeah
roger wasn't i correct in thinking that paula was also going to look at erm not just accident reports other sickness for the area to actually
yeah i did look at it from after christmas and there have been no complaints at all in the accident book up until the eighteenth of march that were of that nature
there was a
mm
exact
ten of that eleven people in the last two weeks sort of complaining about but they don't always let me know so that i can document it that's the problem
yeah
where is that still on the UNK first floor
oh yeah
so
mainly in f two and f three rooms
it's now like the stomach UNK rather than
mm
and it's not people that have eaten not certainly not the restaurant what should i say
it's the food the food
but they're not actually having been to lunch and
yeah
i know for a fact one person us never uses canteen at
one
well it's yeah
one
i mean the problem is i mean that the significance of the com the sort of the numbers of those are still particularly low
mm
and trying to one was one would assume that to a certain extent if you've got a problem with air conditioning that we would we would have a higher a higher incidence of erm of those sort of complaints
mm
and we don't
no what i'm saying is i don't think from the accident book you're getting a true picture because people don't always report it they'll be off several days afterwards
right
just don't UNK i just wondered whether that was actually
ah yeah again
but the information we
all
do have does amount to something
and something
well it's something that we're prepared to actually act on here is
yeah
erm the thing about it is that i mean one of we we've at the minute we've been faced with some individuals UNK that they have er UNK forming around the face er in a number of areas and there's an indication that and it's nothing more than that it could actually be to do with the laser printers and people sitting near them in the light
people suffering from dry skin but it's the only wo odd one case or another that actually reported but it we don't know how widespread these things are
we've had UNK in
but they're actually they actually
last week
made out a UNK comfort test on g p house over the last few days er and we're now awaiting their results
and that's really to look at the sort of the dry skin issues and so on
i think the thing we've gotta be careful about is also trying to er i if we ask everybody put all their analysis as such we could start thinking UNK or whatever
mhm
for all the wrong reasons so we're trying to sort of pick a number of tests which will determine whether there's a problem with air conditioning and it's UNK or er or if the temperature
and if we can pin those down and as roger said we've also now over the last few weeks co begun carrying out erm regular testing two or three times a day now on each of the floors and looking at the UNK
mm
in there
and we've gotta wha what we'll do we'll get those set up at the sort of the appropriate working temperatures and working UNK and then we will have to deal with people on an individual basis if basically they're uncomfortable because of draft or whatever it might be
i think that's what we're aiming to do now get things set up as a standard er operating erm levels having done that then we begin
mm
to UNK them
oh sure
as i say i'm not convinced that it's air conditioning erm but then again there's more detail more data that's required
next twenty
mm
i mean if they want
so essentially what you're saying is we've got the erm the sort of environmental checks in place to help
yes indeed
track down ho home
yeah
home in on the
yes
but it will take time
eventually
and i've done myself a on that UNK because until we've got that sorted anyway
UNK actually er quarterly check the air within g p house and the water within g p house
mm
and erm to that extent we can respond very rapidly if those results aren't within the limits defined
and we've never had any problems in that area at all so to that extent
we are taking if you like all preventative UNK medicine we need to take and always difficult to in fact to pin these things down
mm
is there any er other things anybody wants to ah john did you want
no
what i was gonna suggest is that we actually put something in the UNK not in the sense of well you know please report your illnesses kind of thing but if we just make people aware of actually this sort of environmental control thing would be a good idea
yeah i think that's a fair comment
and the and the measures that we're here that's a good idea actually
been my major struggle for a long time now
yeah
mm
mm
mostly definite the restaurant
what have i done
not bad
we would do it
okay move on to first aid
do we know whether we have the updated
yes we have
we have
on the erm there won't be the first aid room over the we're looking to move that to the first floor
oh i'm sorry
can you speak up then
oh sorry
have i
mm
have they UNK with you
not yet no
ha
that's alright then
i gave the list to martin at the last meeting
and attendance is much better cos i think the message is finally getting across now
sorry
can you er mm
yeah just saying that when we move the erm the first aid room to the to the first floor from house
that's a definite is it
erm yes
i erm as much as anything else so that we don't block a fire exit on the UNK on in the basement
mm
mm
have you seen the timetable for that
er no not yet
i'm sure you'll tell us er
yeah
okay fire
mm
involving the fire the exit th there we actually talked about er issuing a memo to all the branches and telling them there ought not be electrical equipment on overnight
mhm
i counted something like and at the moment it UNK just to the telephone system and regard to the enquiry system
and but very shortly the branches are gonna be getting some more appropriate and it's gonna be a lot more that needs to be se sort of kept on overnight
mm
but it might be more appropriate to wait until nearer the time to send a memo i don't know
erm on the audit side both karen and i have been round to all the branches in order to deal with our old equipment
erm on october ninety four i'll be guess there won't be any old prices in the
you've been round to all the branches
yeah
it's on a different project but we were
mm
incorporating that on the way round
with regard to leaving electrical equipment on overnight mark erm once or twice be nice if you already be bought it to my attention that people are leaving things on erm now when we've had this discussion that most of these items are safe
but erm i th they are worried certainly one or two of them are worried but er some of this equipment is left on and left on unnecessarily and we ought to be encouraging people to switch off what isn't
that's right
doesn't have to be left on overnight
erm sort of a general memo about the just er literally good housekeeping if nothing else
if you're not using the equipment or you don't need to use the equipment overnight then please turn it off
mm
er
presumably you get some card license installed so mind you you'd the outcome
erm yes i think i think you know immediately you're thinking of doing it the branches and obviously you're running po pretty big in
mm
the way i see it anyway you know if there are things that are meant to be left on
er as far the these building are concerned i think your point is valid i mean i think probably printers i think that you suggest are left on because you never know when it'll be to
er only got one persons
assume the responsibility
but other than that yeah i think you're right
presumably with an arrow you have to mark
i think there are some things mark that have to be left on
mm
as an necessity there for all these working overnight
but those that aren't erm should be switched off and whether there's a way
mm
of sort of having some kind
perhaps i'll perhaps i'll liaise with chris
yeah
through his team and see how it see if there's
yeah
anything
you also probably need to liaise with erm probably with mike
yeah
and you know find out what they're doing but general
i've gotta liaise with the information centre in the computer centre tomorrow see if there's any guidelines we could probably use
there may be some kind of notice on them that says you know these machines should not be switched and then everything would be switched off
mhm
if they came round
mm
i mean that's the sort of thing
it's
yeah our UNK actually got something on especially one of the machines it's got little spots across the screen saying do not
do not switch off
switch off
yeah
but i mean
yeah
so they wouldn't switch it off
but are others
still switch off
oh do they
but they're very
okay fine
okay
onto any other business
ah sorry
have you done the done the agenda
mm
finished that
i think pa paula on the 's information
er she said it was done
and she did check and we weren't telling them no we did
mm
do you think it's a representative coming to this meeting rather than just simply
think they actually go off site
the information
in places like
i presume i presume
that they they'd be the only one
oh right
yes
the th
ye yep
the UNK chair
is erm is a mystery
and it's not just a mystery to me but a mystery to the individual i spoke to
er the chair being the offender given the chair that collapsed underneath her er she couldn't or she couldn't explain to me how the chair managed to collapse underneath her
so i'm afraid i wasn't able to do a great to do a great deal more on that
the only thing i would say is that we're looking to er start in the next quarter various plans for maintenance UNK one of which will be o actually on furniture
er there's a number of issues that will start UNK up with furniture fairly soon
and it's things like that i ne hope and anticipate that we can actually
i can only guess that for erm some reason the bolts on the back of the chair fell off or came lose and when she sat on it she UNK on the back in an unusual position and fell through
mm
mhm
okay
let's go onto UNK regulations
we've had a meeting on UNK and we've sort of put the erm the UNK of UNK into action
basically this is updating the original UNK re register
and UNK is the only one that sent a reply back
that's very prompt of you UNK
gold star
okay point taken
i don't think the date was due actually was wasn't it
no it's not yet
it's erm the week
yeah
of let's look in my diary
if ever that's forgotten once that's done again it will be erm the up to date part of the UNK
and the fire and train records i'm not sure where
well the meeting that we're doing all branch
mm
probably
mm
and i'll take that management one
no er dust UNK
yeah er can i go back to this point before
mm
about erm i've actually got some cleansing UNK for
mhm
i was actually going to give to you sue so that you could test them but i understand you've already got some new ones
yeah
you're talking about to send some aren't you
yeah
i'll drop that off with you today later on
fine
what exactly is the intention i in the
well we'll see how much UNK first
are they not in
cos they won't be used to just
cleaning telephones up like that one
foot and mouth
well how many joint telephones are there
sorry
how many joint telephones can you have
there seem to be a number in client services
yeah
mm
in some teams there's
it's obviously
about four
oh
people share a phone
yeah
mm
sorry
that's what i used to do with them
yes
now that you've gone
well
i'll talk to sue about that one
right UNK gonna have two goes next time
still haven't told me what i've gotta do with them
we could try it on our floor couldn't we
yeah
see how we get on
mm
what exactly are you trying
that the people complaining they so sore UNK sickness and diarrhoea
that's exactly what been the problem down there
oh
oh it's good money
telephones
you can go and have a look
especially where those people are passing the UNK down the telephone
it's a good idea but i don't really see what you're actually sort of measuring
have been
well i wasn't here so i won't take any of the blame for this at all
it's a really good job whether yo sa say so or not
it could be sort of spread throughout the company
may maybe a hygiene requirement
what sickness and diarrhoea
it's to provide to provide people with the opportunity use the UNK if they require as a safety UNK
oh we'll sort it out anyway sue shall we
right
on the dust UNK
on the dust UNK yeah
erm the cleaning of the carpets on the first and second floors erm they obviously UNK them erm but we don't do the dry clean like we do the carpets over here
er what we'll do is spray the carpets erm quarterly
erm one of the problems that we've been facing in the past certainly in g p house is the amount of stuff that's on the floor and therefore we haven't actually been able to tackle these things very effectively
erm but one of the things that i am doing is over the next quarter with various people begin to review the cleaning schedules of what they actually do whether we clean them on a on a more frequent basis rather than just responding that particular area
get in the dust UNK couldn't you for this one
there's actually another complaint this morning i've had on the first floor of g p house
it's only the second offence according to the last
what's wrong with this first floor
i mean when they gonna
it's my wing as well
erm
UNK in there
so i'll be coming to see you
okay
okay fine
okay
if we move on to the main agenda
for the sake of this
oh
erm as i mentioned with the group visitors we've started up a branch action group fo specifically focused on the sort of branch issues
aren't we just leaving that till last
this is basically to ensure that the branches are UNK er to UNK
er we're looking at to whether the branch and the manager sort of be take a more active role including the branch sector
because at the moment there's no one looking at health and safety on day to day basis and in any of the branches
there's just point if anyone someone from head office goes in
mm
and what this actually came out on was this overall health and safety assessment that we've been doing for g p erm we've actually just filed that overall group focused on the branches as a potential issue and i know it's been very su successful on a number of times
what we try do and is actually sort of focus in on the branches so that so to try and get try and get all the strains together
what are the issues are we dealing with
and we've had one meeting be between just really detailed some of the some of the issues that we find and focus on them a bit more
mm
erm mm the other thing i was gonna mention which is which we've sort of really gone through is the air conditioning and that we're actually sort o we are doing the monitoring of the environment and all and have had wi
UNK in erm doing special exercises for us
er i think we should look for through in the terms of the UNK
the only thing for me is really just to bring you up to date in terms of the v d u project and where we are with that
erm so if you remember this is the UNK of work stations
erm the particular one i'm focusing on here is sort of the vision screening part of it cos the assessment of work stations is gonna be a longer term thing we're going back to pre where they've actually sort of ticked the various boxes on the sheets and said this is like that and so we are UNK that information currently
but in terms of the actual vision screening itself erm we've UNK those people who've been identified as v d u v d u UNK we've had about five hundred and fifty replies to that from the v d u v d u UNK
erm of that five hundred and fifty approximately four hundred have requested eye tests or vision screen tests sorry
erm we've had about approximately seventy tests take so taken place so far
i don't know an anybody's in this group's UNK in this
but it's basically down on the down on the first floor we've set aside a room which erm the people from the occupational health centre here in harlow come up and do vision screening for us on a regular basis they come when do they come
once a week or
erm it's once a week but i think they're coming in the they're here twice this week er and i think it's as and when they can so if it's more than once a week then they will be here
yep
erm right
so of the er yeah of the people who were identified as being UNK v d u UNK we've had about eight percent of the replies have actually been returned so we are chasing some
mm
some outstanding ones
yo for your own information as th say health and safety group in terms of people who ha who undertake vision screening and then get referred on from a for a full eye tests it's usually around
mm
between sort of two and four percent tend to get referred on
erm and we have had i think about four or five people who are currently being referred on
mhm
er in terms of eye tests
and what happens to them again through the occupational health centre th they UNK arrange for an UNK to give them a full eye test and then we get a report back on that situation
i've certainly had no a excuse me no adverse comments back in terms the vision screening etcetera itself as er people have sort of responded to it seems to have had a so something which will be quite good sort of go going along in the right spirit
have you any feedback anyone at all
have you
no not yet
mm
a report from vision screening
okay
though it not be for a safety to anybody else in terms of operations i think
i had erm those well it's actually been reported in the accident book erm a girl UNK and ted mick john and roger
ah yes
yes
are aware of this
erm the wires have UNK up now
she fell and hit her head or something
erm you say that they're going to UNK in july thi this year
erm yes
when the moves take place
not all of them no
depends when it happens i mean we we're still waiting to find out where some of the changes erm in terms of UNK and the like are gonna be done
erm but following on from that wherever we change UNK now we try and be very specific about organizing the cable management up front and so that they don't present any UNK
erm in the customer services area once we've seen what changes customer service wish to make during this year that they myself and roger and gonna find that out hopefully tomorrow erm then we'll be more specific about the areas that we have to address on th the first and second floor
we could that's one of our biggest areas
anyway erm and if p d er remains a problem or isn't gonna be addressed as far as the changes
i've been told since i was told yesterday
then
that they wouldn't be it's
in which case then we'll address
mm
that erm
before the other moves take place
i cos i know our people and ted have are reluctant they think it's a danger to sit there the wires are coming down already
erm
th this is the cable wires is it
mm
er
oh
yes it is
erm the UNK
i can't comment specifically to that
er we'll have to take that as it goes
se i send somebody up there and they cou you know put them up as best they could
erm UNK is a problem on most of the first floor
mm
because it's the one area of g p house where there is a co wide scale movements take place
mm
but there is
but you said when we do a move we do try to you know where we can
mm
by and tidy the UNK as well
and there was a memo to john from yourself tenth of jan that my manager has passed to me it said you'd given two options that you could go in on saturday and erm
that's alright i mean
also that
tha that's the activity that we're trying to sort of resume erm
that's the main
erm
thing
but that comes after any moves that i'm making because clearly they need somebody that can be
so do you know what the price is going be
sort of to put it i'm gonna be is that as from tomorrow we will have identified what erm UNK and so on will be moved during the reorganization erm and obviously any of the UNK that isn't gonna be moved until the organization we'll be UNK up the UNK
the others and that maybe just a question of tying them up and
mhm
making sure they're safe even though they'll still be sort of visually erm they'll be seen erm they'll be actually UNK on the desk
but er the others anything that isn't gonna be changed where the UNK is UNK is dangerous will have to picked up before that
right
and that's the sort of thing that we will be identifying as from tomorrow
tomorrow
then we'll be putting it back there on exactly how and when action ca can
oh okay
be addressed hopefully
yeah
it is it is a problem it's not necessarily
something that can be addressed wi with a few cable ties cos sometimes tying the UNK together make a more of a danger than
yeah
leaving them loose
because you know like if people can get a foot caught round them if they're individual they come out
mm
and sort of those will get people trip over
mm
okay
well clearly we need to you know the long term moves which we you're obviously taking of in terms of the long running programmes is fine
but i think once you've decided to schedule it there's areas we still look at and the managers are saying this looks dangerous then we have to
yes in hand yes it seems
mm yes i think we've done that
specific areas
that's actually been identified and that's the route we're taking on
right
what else
aha
i see
now is it
erm yes
any other safety
we'll move onto the accident books any things or any issues that anybody's seen from the reports action
erm something came up yesterday i in the catering unit found out that erm a first UNK in area hadn't actually been reporting all minor accidents erm and i think she felt perhaps they were a bit too minor to report
erm i'm wondering maybe due to the small amount of incidents actually in accident book whether this is perhaps a general trend going on throughout
i did speak to paula yesterday and she said she was gonna speak to you suzanne
mm
about bringing it up in the next erm meeting
i was gonna say the same to you
yeah
but erm
generally i enter in the accident book if i give any treatment
erm had she be giving treatment
yeah
should do i think
i think she felt wi you know some of them are sort of like a bit UNK
she's now erm aware of the situation
mm
but erm i was just concerned you know that
mm
perhaps it might be going on
mm
right well i think
elsewhere
it's only if you can reinforce it
you know there's that and then you can also
within the first UNK and the and obviously to try and try and drive it to them on that issue
well i did wanna follow this up with some other items
of a person and need to write how important it was the little ones in the accident book but looking in the erm the handbook for the company it says that an accident form should be filled in and
mm
handed to the office services manager so that's not the procedure we follow at the moment is it
no
because i mean i haven't seen an accident
no
form
no
so it's what is the procedure
is there a written procedure that says if you deal with it then put it in the accident book
say the first UNK off sick
mhm
who's responsibility is it then
yeah okay
well the procedure is anything that's if there's an accident which does require treatment from the first UNK i mean then i think we should send it off don't you
so that means that
what we've had forms being filled in
yeah
mm
i mean in terms of the new issue of the handbook which is coming out in due course that's clarified
oh right
and i think it was one of things which never really took off in terms of the accident
mm
book
well
what
i was just looking for a reference
for it you know
in terms of what should be reported and what shouldn't be
yeah
cos one of the things that i said you know just when i was looking through the last five or six months is that it did seem er to be inconsistent in terms of certain areas like the first floor there's an awful lot of reporting going on but there was very little from the other from the other areas
erm i think the same is the case was that you know
mm
is there one book per floor
is that how it was
is it one
okay
book per floor is that how it works or
just one book pe per first aid room i think
so we've just got one book in the whole building
is that right
as far i know yeah
yeah that's right
that's a problem
maybe they can't find the book
yeah
well that's probably a good point actually really once you've only got a
and course we have more accidents in the kitchen
right
no i wasn't
i wasn't trying to
yes but
yes there are
oh well you might as well say that
yep
i don't mind
okay well let's perhaps look into that see whether there's a more appropriate way
cos i know the principle used to be that is er it was in the first aid room cos that's where all the first aid UNK
when you
are based
but then if there's no form
to remind somebody they'll fill it in the accident
yeah
book then it's gonna get UNK forgotten from one day to the next
i think that's what happened with this particular person as well
because she's not been going to the first aid room
she's not been going
yeah
there
so she's writing them down and then forgotten about them
yeah
okay fine
well then look at that to see if there's a more appropriate way of doing it
shall i speak to paula about that then
yeah
paula and perhaps we'll bring it up in a first aid
get that easily
well that was another thing one of the new first UNK we've got erm didn't know where the accident book was and i thought was quite an important thing that would probably have been brought up
yes
at the initial training
so
who's that
UNK
ah yes
okay
you know what i mean that is down to the individual really is that er that they should actually find out and i that needs to be highlighted to all
mm
of them
well if there's only one for each building then
well perhaps when each new first UNK they get like an induction pack or something
get a tour or
mm
something
yeah
mm
are you intending approaching health and safety in clients in the employee handbook
er yeah and we're looking
right
is it gonna very released t to everyone
aha
in due course
mm
mm
the section on health and safety could be could be quite large especially in the light of further installation
yeah we've actually er way we've designed is that erm it's actually a sort of it's inserted in the ham handbook itself as actually a sort of separate removal section so they can
aha
use it sort of separately
okay
well in terms of the
literally i think the only i said is the thing we get from the branches
mm
well i think that
well needs a i think one of the things we discussed in the branch action group meeting is actually weren't quite sure what the cos we'd been sending out for quite less than ten of the branches because to do something to them which was mm apparently lots of them in but erm well they keep disappearing so that the what we've been talking about is to try and get some points erm health and safety station within the branch which actually just has all this stuff for it
at least everybody knows where to go and it's all there an but obviously that has some difficulty in terms of where to locate it and where to
that's something to look at
okay
in terms of actual accidents themselves anybody raising things or anything
i did erm mention i think on one of them which was the erm tim this is the upstairs i did actually mention that when i saw it to roger
he was very UNK but erm you probably did address
yes
that one
yeah
okay
if there's nothing apart from that we can move onto first aid
suzanne anything
not really no
no
this time
any other issues in terms of first aid mark
about first aid improving the
right
are we i in terms of the first UNK availability does that tend to work
okay in terms of people are aware that they can their first UNK where they can get first aid and don't tend to have any reports these days
well i think the erm you said there was like a plan on each notice board with first UNK and fire UNK on each floor
mm
but they look a bit out of date at the moment
mm
they're constantly
mm
but certainly when we first went into first aid and we used to get regular calls in personnel all about oh where's the first aid
but since it happened in these days
no
people seem to finding the sort of first UNK
i think we've got quite an extensive coverage now
okay
right if we move onto fire
who's in charge of fire
jonathan
what you want one
i've got nothing other i don't know whether anybody's aware of what went on last wednesday and probably that i mean there could have been there was a sort of a cable that a mains cable that heated up and started smoking and er we had to deal with that
but erm fortunately it didn't heat up but we're looking at erm it didn't catch fire but we're looking at er some safety features that we may actually have to install in the plant room to erm to actually identify these problems er somewhat earlier
it was just happened to be spotted by richard fortunately whilst he was erm between jobs and actually being up a steps walked in a saw the smoke coming out of one of the er main switch areas
at that stage he didn't seem to have any effect on anything in terms of erm UNK anybody so erm we need to er we need to deal with that with more action than we ha have at the moment
mm
actually i think you're all aware of that we caused some number of issues on that wednesday afternoon and for that half of our systems
i suppose it erm did widen so the wider view on that is at that it is important that we carry out the possible appliance testing on a regular basis
this could have led to a very nasty electrical fire
erm and to that extent i'll reiterate that we are in fact working our way through all of the
the electrical equipment in the building in terms of appliance testing and the like
we're also mark reviewing our preventative our maintenance systems erm and we may excuse me
we may well be extending the number of er shut downs that we over the weekend so that we can carry out more extensive maintenance on the electrical systems around the organization
certainly bits that look pretty interesting i should imagine and a report on the end of the day with a number of er proposals and actions for er hopefully preventing this happening again
mm
i think it just erm also demonstrates our UNK on the bigger systems in that regard
or we tend to
yes it does
grind to a halt
but not but not as much as on the electrical systems
well no
mm
i would think mark knows that
yeah i was er being naive and thinking of them in the same capacity
actually norman though i'm not terribly precise in my technical
okay
good
any other
on that point i've got
yes
quite a few dare i start with
mhm
them
erm
hiding them from
erm apparently there was a training course held on the twenty eighth of jan erm the procedures were actually out of date at that time and mike on security
is he the head the fire
the deputy
mike is yeah
the deputy he's actually going to
he's
issue erm the floor plans erm and procedures to everyone which they still haven't received
erm
will that be will that please
i don't really know who yo to direct to cos do the fire UNK not meet regularly
only to try and
probably we should organize it
i think they no
yeah
erm another thing on the erm fire warden training it was stated the company did not want erm fire UNK to use the equipment around the building whereas the notices say actually states erm attack fire if possible with appliances provided without taking personal risk
erm but the training UNK that and said that they showed them how they should be used but they shouldn't tackle a fire and they
mhm
wanted to know which
mm
they should be doing
mm
ya
mhm
yeah
like she says i think the position is UNK effectively what we're trying to reinforce is that we don't want any UNK
mm
in a sense of UNK into the flames and trying to battle with it
