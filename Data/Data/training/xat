erm but obviously if somebody can take some assertive action that stops the fire
yeah
down and that's a difficult that's a judgement that have to make
and clearly in terms of the fires as a particular the rationale for them being there is to
can get out of the building which is why
mm
the position of our doors are attached to the system is the fire UNK actually blocked by fire and that's their only exit at least you got some opportunity to
you was quite right
you said i can do with some clarification which we seek to do
erm
so are the fire appliances only supposed to be used by the
by the UNK then
mm
is that not sort of i mean i wasn't aware that anybody wasn't supposed to pick up a fire appliance or not
again it's a similar sort of issue which is it's it is difficult to put across that if you notice you haven't got a fire warden there and that's your only
right
exit then you use the fire
fire UNK
though obviously one of the things that you worry about with fire UNK are you using the right one with the correct
mm
sort of fire
erm you can cause as much or more damage to yourself or equipment in UNK by using the wrong one
service is done
right i mean the point i was making i don't think there's anywhere
where you have said positively don't use a fire UNK
no it's
in the event of bomb
mm
i think it would be crazy to actually say that positively
i mean people it is question of how you say you well enough that
aha
people do understand that there ar if there's a problem and you can do something about it without being a hero as mark said then something should be done
erm but how you UNK for common sense and so on
mm
i know that looking for a purple heart or v c erm are but i do believe it needs to be it needs to be clarified
mm
okay well i will se i'll seek to clarify tha to be able to join that to er sort of form of words
erm something that was actually also raised before and after working hours erm there was a fire evacuation i think in october about to quarter nine
mm
erm
in g p house
yep
which was complete chaos apparently
all rushing around
mm
erm
that's happened
what are the procedures then if fire UNK aren't there
i mean check it as in for checking buildings and erm
i didn't think it was chaos
i thought it was quite well organized considering
apart from all the people didn't come out
half the yes
did they not
yes that was the main thing
the ones that i saw were
yeah
did the alarms
did the alarms actually keep ringing
actually organized it
yeah
so they weren't switched off
half way through
yeah
they kept going
yes they did definitely
for some time
right
yeah
it's a good point there
develop a procedure for out of hours then
and something that was suggested by fire UNK that they could do a five or ten minute erm presentation and could go round each floor to make people aware that they are the fire UNK why we have to UNK and the importance erm
mm
it's UNK
and just issue UNK
mm
which you can
they've erm volunteers to see if you can show this committee the presentation for the
aha
is it actually
is that the sort of the general feeling towards
erm bevan
fire
and mark he said it was suggested and it was a general feeling that would be more
i haven't said that
useful than issuing UNK
oh yes
that's er true
gold star
that's it
thank you
actually that out of hours issue probably UNK to first aid treatment as well doesn't it
yeah
yeah
perhaps we ought to make people aware that just coming along security isn't
mm
yes
mm
erm
mm
that's a good point
i could if i just pick up one other point about you know like the non standard times or the non standard occasions when we do fire UNK currently er i don't know where we think the fire is but we all UNK out via our normal fire UNK and to our normal assembly ports erm it maybe men maybe an idea to do some fire UNK where we stayed where the fire actually was and people have got to take other routes to UNK the building
mhm
mm
yeah i think we can probably try blocking exit next and see what happens
and not on the as well
well i'm a da no sorry
i did get and proved the place i've been going that actually more accidents due to blocking and you sort of back up the stairs with you
yeah
yeah and create accidents but erm well perhaps we could do it in a sort of floor by floor actually this
yes
just your rear UNK are blocked off find more routes you know you can take of course without much potential danger
okay
so we'll do some thinking about that then
we
wha
also mark need to able to bring out most of the computer people as well
erm and i know we tend to make allowances for the operations
it's in their contract that is if they get out
they go they gotta hold especially and try and get through
like the captain of the ship
but i do believe that we ought to be doing more in terms of making sure they do come out erm you know i we know it's only a training exercise even though you leave one or two in there but i think we ought
mm
to be drawing most of those people out
mm
can we do a separate
and we
we could do a separate exercise then couldn't we
we could but i dunno how realistic it would be i mean if there was oh obviously it'll more realistic than doing nothing
mm
but er we need to be dragging those out at the same time as we're dragging everybody else out
if it were real it would happen
and i just feel you know that er
so i think it's part of the early morning set up and we were actually gonna talk to steve weren't we about
that's right
about
what they actually bother
yeah
coming out for
yeah
and er
yeah i think you ought to take that up with steve cos i don't see why you should getting taking people
no
out on the machines
oh no
i mean a lot
well afterwards
of people there's nothing apparent with them apparent then the machine would be er would be
that's right
and the machine can wait another ten about ten minutes
well and that's a serious
course not
and i think we've gotta UNK yeah UNK leave it to steve
mm
okay
you gonna pick that up with steve
yeah i'll do that
mm
is the fire UNK sort of aware you know which way they're meant to go if their UNK they would normally are used are blocked
i mean shouldn't we sort of going well that area you
that
start off with
i think that was th one of the things raised the procedures and floor plans
mhm
and the UNK
mm
and weren't actually er correct and some
mm
weren't now being used so i think once that's out of the way
so sorry say it again
they will
the floor plans that they were actually shown on their training course were out of date for the procedures so that's what my whatever erm security
we don't actually know but we are
but we said
oh right
we're UNK addressing that once
yeah
that's a point to what we are addressing and what we aren't
that's a very good point
with exactly the same one we
mm
our floor plan is because of the number of moves and so on we've gotta have
oh this is where desk plan
i'll wor i'll work out the
yeah
with the exit
yeah
and all the UNK are clearing off
all the UNK at the moment
yes they are
erm
yeah
nothing's changed there
and we whenever we do UNK now as well we insure that all fire UNK are kept to a minimum of one and half metres wide er in terms of main access ways
and we're becoming more and more UNK on where people pile boxes and other various items of rubbish
erm but we need to get some plans up together
i don't really want to have to do too many commit myself till the UNK here but we are in fact actually er addressing this very specific issue
fe feel vulnerable for another a number of reasons mark in terms of updated floor plans
mm
and yes we're doing something
mm
to
cos i was asking for a number of reasons i was asking for floor plans for our you see
didn't seem to be there
i'll ask for information norman
yeah
i'm having trouble with my UNK today
anyway thought that'd be the general issue
yep
can we go onto computer design then
oh
while you've got them out
no
it was just someone got one
we got the same taste in
UNK sod
well you see
you can get him some nice
we well if we don't get the package if
yeah
we get one mark we're going to get one for the right reasons indeed
there's a UNK system in your end isn't there
yes there is
yeah it's a very good one
we use it all the time
well
yeah
we've already beaten them
yeah we have looked at but erm
very good part of the investigation
distributing one
but they won't share you know what they're like in my team it's
oh you don't mean it
told him you can use our UNK any
erm
time you like
it's
hold on a minute
UNK
one other thing is just to chase up procedures we're going to put on the passes for UNK and visitors and that still hasn't been done
and i've spoken to paula since the last meeting and chase it but it still hasn't been
right
okay
we put together some sort of words on anyway we've er
yeah
but not very far
almost
yeah
you gave us five pages to get in one
i gave you five pages yeah but
it is now a hell of a lot less
i hope we can do other things
that's right
did a good a trade in restaurant
okay
good
may i make a separate point
yeah
that does link in with that point that UNK made
erm me myself and steve are currently working on er health and safety for contractors coming on site purpose to work etcetera and one of reasons why well he than ever before on this UNK information when they're on site on the back of cars it would it would have been a nice thing to do would have been to have joined the whole lot together
erm and anyway on the health and safety contractors on site thing stuart has actually read the documentation and he's quite happy with it and we're waiting for you and martin to feed back as well on it
right
mm
well i was getting you back for one
yeah
why not
once we've done that perhaps we can sit this particular lay UNK information on the back of the card so we're covering
excellent
all visitors
mm
yep
okay
right
anything on fire from anybody else
okay
let's move on to any other business
i've just got something well i'll take over
mm
right a little
erm
note here
i don't know if i was the only one that didn't receive the check list
i mean has anyone else got these wo it's off the last UNK
erm the check list that i think des UNK is gonna go to UNK and
oh right
there's the health and safety committee
has anyone else received it
no i haven't
no
suddenly everyone seems to be talking about the menopause so we thought that you'd better hear what women really think
there's still a lot of mystery worse UNK surrounding this UNK in a woman's life
so tonight the UNK are off and i think you'll UNK surprised by what you hear
i'd like to start with a vote
do you want more information about the menopause
button one for yes and button two for no
and in this hundred goodness
ninety one people say yes only nine say no
now why did you why did you say yes
is it because yo you haven't got the information
you don't have enough it's not available to you
yes
i feel that there is an awful lot of gossip and scare tactics about it and i'd like to have a real expert information on it
have you tried to information before
not ver not very much
mainly
i
mainly through mainly through gossip
gossip
aha
and what does the gossip say
every for everything er from it's all in your mind to it's dreadful
right front line
yes
i think actually i would like to get some more information and men should get some more information because they are the ones who are UNK and er not sort of going along with it
mm
well out there they're watching so who else said yes
i'd feel the local doctors your local g p's are needing to be brought more into to line with it
i've personally had problems with one doctor cos he was out of date he wasn't you know wasn't aware of some of the UNK and i had to actually UNK him to some of the UNK that was available for people
really
aha
yes
ho and how did you know he was out of date
because ee er some of the subjects i brought to him but he didn't know nothing about them
he had to you know he'd to leave it and consult with colleagues or whatever
so i feel that
and where were you
you know that g p's that's been practising for a long number of years you know er elderly g p's are probably not as up to date on these kind of things as they should be
aha
this one
i had a few problems when i was about thirty and my doctor told me it was just my age and the menopause
from thirty
and i started it about fifteen years later
now when do yo when your doctor said that when you were thirty di did you believe him or her
it was a him
a him
a doctor younger than myself and i didn't believe him
and i just tu but there was nothing else i could do
i couldn't argue with him i just had to go and say oh well it's just my age and get on with it
yes
i'd like to know more about it because having gone through it without any UNK i'd quite like to know what i missed
if anything
and if in fact this h r t i'm really missing something you see that's what i'd like to know
i don't think that er i think that unfortunately some of the older doctors definitely were UNK and weren't educated and i think nowadays that the doctors are becoming very much more educated and perhaps the ones who have the bad time are the fortunate ones in so far as they're getting the hormone replacement therapy if they're lucky and they have sympathetic general UNK
and the ones who haven't had the bad time might well be suffering because they're not being allowed the benefits of hormone replacement therapy
now you're a g p
yes
and so obviously you're very well UNK up
th does that mean the older people here have had a raw deal
i mean th those people who've gone through the menopause wo would any of you like to say anything about experience
yes
er well
er
no yes
nelly
na er well of course i'm UNK seventy nine but i can still remember most of it and i did have a very bad time
UNK bad UNK and going to i gave my husband a terrible time
i really did
but he was very understanding and the doctor just seemed to think that was a natural course i had to go through
but er it lasted i was forty seven and it didn't finish till i was about sixty
but people complain sometimes about the UNK but i was glad when i had a UNK because i felt better after having UNK
i think we've got to look at the other side of the
aha
as well that i personally a agree with the lady over there as i'm now with all the talk of UNK hormone replacement wonder what it was
how much better life would have been if i'd known about that or used it
i'm from the group the change you change
mhm
and er when i was going through the change and i'm post menopause er and having terrible feelings i'd nowhere to go
i went round all the hospitals in edinburgh and leith all the doctors surgeries and there was nowhere and i ended up at the women's unit in edinburgh city chambers and i got help from the women's unit and er from there we started a pressure group to get more literature to people you know to get them into doctor's surgeries so as they would know what to do what to expect
helen
in we've had a menopause clinic in glasgow for the last twenty four years erm it's run by a male doctor erm but we have been treating patients for that length time
we're extremely interested in the women we try to treat them as individuals we cope with a lot of problems and i think if we look as women as individuals each individual woman has a different problem
we all basically have UNK depression and various other problems but basically the ladies who present with UNK and UNK are the ladies who in fact get help for ladies who don't present with UNK and UNK finish up as UNK and they're the ones we are very concerned about
we don't see them until they're too late and they're having UNK of the UNK and UNK two percent of bone less in a year
are you suggesting that every woman going through the menopause should get some kind of clinical help
it should be offered to her
mhm
if she wants it
i'm not telling every woman to take me h r t i'm suggesting that it's preventative medicine
we don't stop UNK having UNK
if the UNK are removed UNK stop working there is treatment there to prevent us having disease why shouldn't we take it and why shouldn't we have a better life
linda
i'm er the director of the national UNK society and we started five years ago and as helen said just now we are in the business of UNK women not saying all women should be going on hormone replacement therapy
some women certainly will sail through menopause with never a hot UNK and no problems at all sadly that's no indication that they're not going to have problems from their bones later on
now i let's do a bit of definition of terms here UNK is what
it's bones that are too UNK literally so that they break very easily
aha
and that accounts for the hip UNK and the er UNK in
mhm
older women losing height a lot of pain from these UNK and it's bones that are too UNK so they're not holding you up sufficiently as you get older
and how can that be UNK
by hormone replacement therapy that's the main way of helping
you can do things for yourself in the way of diet exercise good lifestyle not smoking and so on but a lot of women will need hormone replacement therapy just to replace the UNK that dear old mother nature stop supplying to us at the menopause
hundred years ago we didn't live this long
now that we do live much longer with better health care generally what we want is for women to be able to live that last third of their lives in health and being able to enjoy themselves and contribute to the community not feeling that they're UNK by pain
now am i right in saying that there has been some controversy in the past about hormone replace let's call it h r t it's shorter that er that not everyone's convinced it's a good idea that there are maybe some negative side effects
i mean wha what is the latest information on h r t
you were right in saying that there was very bad press given to hormone replacement therapy in the early days when they used very high UNK of er un er of normal UNK and this caused an increase in the amount of end of UNK cancer and this i think has generally er mo ruined the course for the older doctors because they still think that it's associated with an increase in cancer and they haven't got up to date to realise that the more modern UNK are not causing this and that's where i think th the problems li lie
yes
we are in the course of giving h r t
the ladies are monitored very carefully and UNK and sometimes they pick up cancer in another part of the body which
mhm
is a bonus and a benefit to the UNK and that is er an extra thing with h r t
here
i'd like to say that i'm actually on hormone replacement therapy and i'm not being monitored
i've been on it for over three years and i'm quite concerned about some of the things i've heard tonight and i'm going to make an appointment
well that's all the things that concerns us
and see my doctor about it straight away
it's not only woman who need to be better informed it's the doctors as well
here
yes
i would like to ask if one of these medical ladies could tell us
how what percentage of these signs of the menopause are inherited UNK
who would like to who'd like to answer that one
yes
i will
i there is no evidence that it's an inherited or UNK problem and this is the you know you we have there has been lots of sort of studies done to see which woman might be more at risk and which women you know might have symptoms and th the fact is that the reason why you why the menopause occurs is because the UNK stop UNK they stop producing UNK and every woman's UNK does this and they do it you know at all varying ages the average age is fifty
but the most interesting thing about it is that i the actual level UNK bears no relationship to your symptoms as er sheila has said you can have two women with the sa exactly the same level of UNK and one woman is having awful problems and the other woman is as we have heard having no problems at all
a year i had all the symptoms and i went and got a book and read about it and tried to find out as much possible about it and the book scared me silly because it told me all these things that could happen
oh yes
and i was upset so i went to my doctor who's a lady doctor and she's young she explained things to me and she put me on h r t and it changed my life completely
it th i was depressed i had UNK night UNK and my husband was all he couldn't sleep at night and it changed it completely
and the worse thing for me was i lost my self confidence i had no confidence whatsoever
in all areas work wise
mm
at home with my family whenever i went on the h r t everything changed
i felt better i looked better i di i didn't feel my skin was better my hair come back it was just marvellous for me
absolutely marvellous
h r t
well women don't want to
le let louise say
may i just say i thi i think it's important to point out that h r t isn't a miracle cure
and although it will UNK greatly help some women unfortunately some women are unable to tolerate it the side effects it gi it gives them are worse than the actually symptoms they're having in the first place
it means having periods back again which after and now er several years break and erm many women find unacceptable
we all have to have that
you don't have that
we do have we ha we have tablets for that
yes
over here
i must admit after i'd finished with the menopause i felt absolutely great
i wasn't on h r t i had a very easy transition from having periods to stopping having periods
er i did go on h r t because of the UNK risk but i was UNK i was one of the i think twelve percent who had developed breast trouble and had to come off it
i think that er it is probably a very useful thing if you can tolerate it
but i must admit having a lifetime of painful periods and not having any more painful periods was absolute UNK
and that's one of the UNK of h r t it all came back again
down here
yeah
i was just going to mention the fact that if you have had breast cancer you cannot go on h r t cos it was a hormone that caused it in the first place
is that right
yes
i think one fact that probably i'm sure yo many of us know here is that the actual number of women on the h r t is really very small in this country
it's probably less about between five and ten percent
mm
so i mean th the instance of breast cancer is rising the instance of breast cancer the number of cases of breast is rising it rises with age
currently th UNK h r t in this country will not be influencing the risks of breast cancer
on the other hand and it is extremely complex and it indeed it probably erm amounts to the fact that each UNK woman has to consider how she feels herself
mhm
about whether she would wish to run the risks of a b and c
and the other condition we haven't mentioned is er th the risks of UNK artery disease and strokes which actually do are the main cause of death o in scottish women
and it's almost like saying that the if you take h r t er this is in our sort of survey that you will in fact erm reduce the instance of heart disease but ma might you in fact increase the risks of breast cancer
your making it sound like a heads you lose tails you lose situation
it's a it's a very complex issue
i mean
and un UNK and this is in fact is why indeed general UNK and even specialists find it very complex
i mean last month er
and that is you i mean you are a consultant UNK and
that's right
and
you're describing the complexity of it
yes
if we're if we're agreeing that women ought to be able to make informed choices there's so much information it's actually very hard to make a particularly if your
yeah
g p isn't as up to date as you might hope with the information him or herself
yes
i sailed through the menopause but then had lots of back problems
and this was cracked UNK from UNK now if i had been getting h r t at that time i might have been less UNK
but at least i'm on it now and hopefully slowing down the UNK and i don't care about the cancer er UNK
i'd rather la have the treatment and ha and have a reasonable life
yes
as a younger and have plenty of time to worry about the menopause before it happens
erm all i can say is i'm glad to see that it's stopped being referred to as women's troubles you know and we're actually bringing it out to the forefront
but is there anything that my generation could do now that might stop us requiring h r t in the future
alright
mhm
i think it's important especially for young women up to the age of about thirty five when your peak bone density is probably UNK and after that you do go downhill to UNK the calcium intake
nowadays people are worried about er drinking milk and dairy products because of the UNK bit but i think that we've got to remember that there's a lot of calcium in milk and you should drink milk and take plenty of exercise and that is the time when it's probably extremely important
yes
wha what do you do if you're allergic milk
cos i haven't drink milk from since a baby and
well tha that's a bit more difficult
there are other foods that you can get it from such as ice
erm
cream UNK
UNK
UNK
no co oh well you'll be allergic to that too
i'm allergic i'm allergic to a lot of foods
can i want to pick up er something that margaret said which is i've got lots of time to worry about it
now obviously you know yo getting the menopause out into the open so that everyone can talk about it exchange information that it's not seen as a as a taboo or something to be particularly fearful of by men or women isn't going to be much good if it just makes everybody worry for er for the first half of o of their lives and then UNK through the second half
i mean
there is an argument ha and it's been put by er a noted UNK who's recently written on the menopause that work and you should just make the most of being a UNK or a UNK or an old women
no
now i'm not saying i se but it's a view that has been put forward wha what do you think of that
yes
i wouldn't actually say that you know one has got to suffer unduly but i think we do have to be very careful that we don't just play into the hands of the drug manufacturers
see they've got most women UNK on er UNK pill for all their reproductive life and they're dead keen that we should all get so worried about menopause that we would also be buying their products until we die
now although i have great respect for er the representative of the UNK society i se i still think as a UNK that there haven't been enough women on h r t for long enough
mhm
for us to prove one way or the other that they co the advantages out weigh the disadvantages
so you think we have some UNK pigs here
you have to be cautious
how long do you want them to be on h r t for
we've been following a group through in glasgow who've been h on h r t now for twenty three years
up there
i think if you went and saw our own doctors a lot of our fears would be UNK because most of the young doctors wouldn't would recommend to you my own doctor asked me all the questions and different things and then he says he's a young doctor he says if i were a women and if i'd answered all the questions as you did i would go on h r t
so there might be a lot of doctors who would do
right
beside you
yes
yes
i think you really highlights on working alongside with your doctor
i think you'll be able to read up as much information as possible and see a doctor and consult and especially th where women's clinic are a great boom
and we should attend
mm
it more often
up there
i would just like to say that erm it's not all UNK and UNK
mm
the menopause isn't necessarily the end of our life it can be the beginning of so many new different things
yes
i think erm that it can be looked at to without h r t or looking at it UNK because lots of the women at dean terrace in fact have
that's a family planning
er problem that's right
situation
yep
but erm have erm problems with what this lady has described who can't come to terms with
mhm
the er loss of their UNK and the loss of their children and have sexual problems and problems like that and they don't necessarily need h r t they need lots of time which they're given
and i think that helps them an awful lot
is it impossible that your sex life might improve after the menopause
i mean i wo er would anything like to say anything about
do we have to
no
a UNK experience or anything like that
nelly
yes i would like to say it was smashing after the
because you didn't have to worry that you were gonna have another child
so though i had a bad time well i had a i've had a great life since
good
up there
what do you do about er a doctor who says no
i mean do you change your doctor or what
yes
who would like to answer that one
yes
get more information first so that you know all your facts and if you ask us we'll send him a booklet without saying who er who asked us to send it and then go in and see him and say now the UNK society have said this and it's a very brave doctor who will then say absolutely no
i'm not listening to you
but in the final analysis if you can't get any help if he won't refer you to a specialist for help change your doctor
because if the garage did your car badly you wouldn't have any hesitation in changing your garage and your body's a UNK sight more important than your car
i think women
can sail into a beautiful old age with enthusiasm for hobbies taking up new interests of all sorts and i've taken up UNK after the age of fifty and i'm i feel i'm getting on well with it and this fresh air and you know getting out and finding who you really are after you know looking after children is a wonderful thing
and this will keep you young
i don't have h r t i didn't have any problems luckily with the menopause but i feel i've found a bit more of who i really am you know
i'm very interested in that
because that is what UNK says in her book it's only after the menopause that you have the freedom and the liberty to find out
yes
yes it
who you really are
does
exactly
does anybody yes
yes
well i had a UNK when i was forty nine and to me life really did begin at fifty
i go dancing
i'm now sixty two and i go dancing twice a week
so i mean apart from arthritis life's quite good
here
can i say i'm thirty six and had a UNK a year ago
mhm
i'm taking UNK and whatever but i feel brand new compared to what i felt before i had a UNK cos i was totally UNK
and i can agree with the ladies that say life begins once you get by all these problems that you had before
up there
as a younger person i would expect that i've probably got another fifteen years to go to the menopause but i'm looking forward to it as a relief from pre UNK syndrome
and i wondering if any of the experts can say if there's erm a link between the UNK of UNK symptoms and pre UNK symptoms
okay a final expert view on that
who would like
to offer a
fortunately no
yo erm your er it isn't your fate in life to have all this pro though major problems erm and i think p m s is a major problem
and in fact er i would hopeful that you will be feel better
yes
mm
i have a question to the politicians
the n h s cannot cope in the moment with you know regular sort of UNK cancer UNK
mhm
how can they cope in the future with sort of er monitoring the effects of h r t
well er that's for politicians watching think about it to care about
yes
well if er more women do take hormone replacement therapy and we cut the UNK we will in fact have far money in the health service UNK because it costs a hundred and eighty million pounds a year to treat hip UNK alone at the moment
UNK has UNK a term which you may have read which is er which is called UNK
or UNK i suppose in america which she terms post UNK
is post UNK something that er every woman could look forward to if she gets the right advice the right
definitely
treatment
yes
i think this being an old UNK is what is all in the mind
if you're determined to enjoy the rest of your life you will
be positive
be positive about it yes
i don't agree with that UNK
no
you only have to listen to what women here have told you and it's not psychological
it's a myth
it is physiological
and there are plenty of people who have spoken here tonight have UNK that
mhm
my first years had two children had no breast problems and i'm having a horrendous time just now and i'm on h r t i'm on my third different kind
and i've had so UNK and my doctor is very good
do the doctor i have now is very good and very sympathetic
but she feels there's nothing you actually can do to help me with
final word
as i've said i've been on h r t for three years and i have since went back to work after being on h r t i don't think i'm an old UNK
i don't want to be like a film star but i do want a better quality of life and i've got that with h r t
we're going to have to end and i'm sorry about that because er it's been very interesting
you've heard a very broad range of views erm of all sorts
i think the most important thing that we've done is talk about it
ninety one people here wanted more information
there is information available
i hope you can find it er if yo if er if you want and the important thing is to keep talking about it keep UNK information
thanks everybody here for your experiences and information
goodbye
with mr but what i thought i'd do today is see how much you've remembered of one or two of the basic topics
so topic i want to start off today with is iron and steel
who can remember what four things which four things go into a blast furnace
let's have one of them from somebody
copper
copper
we're trying to make iron and steel UNK
oh
oh right yes i knew that
you knew that
good
okay
so what four things
there's four things that go into a blast furnace
come on you've done this
zinc
n not zinc if we're trying to make iron
iron
should be iron or steel
iron what
ore
iron ore
right
ha UNK we're getting somewhere
right iron ore
most of the iron ore is used UNK in the form of iron what
somebody said it actually
oxide
oxide right
and they're iron UNK
right there are two iron UNK commonly used in the blast furnace one of which is named because of its colour excuse me a moment
er right as i was saying there's two iron UNK one named because of its colour and the other one named because of its properties
anybody remember what they are
simon
no i think UNK the UNK is not going to help you here
i'll give you a further clue
one of them is because of its blood red colour
what's yes
what's the name of the department in a hospital that deals with blood
the blood bank
the blood bank
no
no
that's where they store it not where they er play about with it
UNK
begins with h
h
hospital
hospital blood bank
h a e
UNK
mm
a e a e
a e
UNK
UNK
UNK
UNK is the department that deals with blood and the red colouring in the blood is UNK
UNK
sir is it erm are they the people who tell you what erm group your blood is
yes basically
and the way they do that is they take a sample of your blood and mix it with er agents taking taken from the blood of other people
UNK
so for example when i've given a pint of blood instead of giving it into a plastic bag with sodium UNK to stop it UNK i've actually given into a plain glass bottle and when i asked what this for the erm UNK nurse said that they're going to let the red cells all UNK together at the bottom and use the UNK that was left for blood grouping purposes which of course is very important
so when they're actually blood grouping they're using human blood UNK to er test which group you belong to
so UNK because of UNK the red colouring of the erm red cells that carry the oxygen around the body and UNK contains iron which is why when people are short of iron they suffer from UNK because they've got en not enough of this red colouring in their blood cells to carry the oxygen around the body
UNK is f e 2 UNK 3
iron three oxide
iron three oxide
the other one i n said named because of its property is called UNK
okay
so what's the property of UNK that makes it interesting
it's UNK
right
and it's believed that UNK in its er one of its forms UNK was er the earliest form of UNK
you had this lump of rock that you UNK from a thread and people discovered that it always pointed in the same direction so if you were on board a ship for the first time people were able to travel in a ship without having to UNK a coast all the way across or UNK to where they could see
er the i know this is basically not iron and steel but if you take the UNK er very UNK
that's italy and er the home of the UNK there's UNK and turkey and so on and you come back round again there's the UNK of UNK
in the early days of er navigation within the UNK people used to actually have to UNK by going all the way round the coast
so if you wanted to go from there to there you went all round that way
the reason being that you had to UNK where you could see
and in the bible it's recorded that for example there are some cases where there was a big storm and they lost sight of land and all the sailors er promptly UNK because once they'd lost sight of land they hadn't got a clue where they were
but with a UNK which was er UNK iron oxide hung up on the ship you could actually then work out that you go straight across from there to there no problems
and it then made possible going by the shortest route
so UNK is a very important iron oxide
where do we get our iron ore from these days
well you're telling me other countries
in other words we import it
why do we import it
cheaper
it's cheaper yes
and why is it cheaper
what's happened to the iron ore in britain
it's gone UNK
finished
it's gone UNK
no
er it's
yeah
finished
it's finished
yes
it's run out
right
the two main areas that i'm thinking of are in UNK where the iron ore works there have been completely exhausted and the other is UNK in county durham
and if you go to UNK from nottingham you
UNK
c erm c o n s e double t i think it is
if you go to UNK in county durham you come along the road and there's the town and what was left of the old steel works because the steel works was built there because of its easy access to the iron ore deposits
and you come over this hill and suddenly there's nothing on the other side except a huge hole in the ground and the road goes along almost a cliff edge the side of this erm hole which is this worked out iron ore quarry
it completely all the iron ore deposits there er have gone
so we import our iron ore from other countries
for example australia produces quite a lot UNK produces a lot and it's imported into this country in bulk ore carriers
so we've got iron ore obviously from which we get the iron
three other things to go into the blast furnace
me
anybody
iron ore is one
what's the fuel
erm
right begins with that letter yes
coal
coke
no it's con
coke
coke
right
obviously
coal is converted into coke
no it's not UNK
oh
all right then
you're confusing the UNK for UNK with coke
coke in the terms in which we're talking about it is er it's not that soft drink either
it's actually a black UNK substance made by heating coal in the absence of air and consists of virtually pure carbon
the er coke is produced from the coal and the coal gas that's driven off is then used for heating and UNK things elsewhere in the steel works
so we have two things we've got iron ore coke
now for that coke to burn in this furnace what must we add
heat
heat yes
i'll give you a clue
it's the sort of thing you might collect from the house of commons particularly during a er big debate
producing lots of
possibly but er that's
not quite what i'm thinking of
politicians are UNK for producing
hot air
hot air right
hot air
air obviously makes it burn
hot air means that it's burned better
and the hot air is UNK near the bottom of the furnace where the temperature is about fifteen hundred degrees celsius
whoa
which is just a little bit warm
if you UNK cold air you'd actually UNK the furnace down a bit
the reason that you use hot air is to keep that UNK going at a good temperature
and finally coming from derbyshire from up the road in UNK the biggest quarry and the UNK in europe
spring water
no
yeah but there is
there is derbyshire spring water from UNK yes
o
er excuse me we got the answer right
spring water in a blast furnace
anyway carry on
yes right
so what is UNK in large quantities in derbyshire
you saw a video about it
UNK
UNK thank you
now UNK has a very important function in the blast furnace
what is that
what does it make
erm lime water
four letter word
used in a er UNK sense of certain people
UNK is used to make
come on think
burn
burn
burn
make it burn
slag
slag
thank you
anybody would think you haven't done this
come on
right
so
the UNK in iron ore is about one third sand which is UNK oxide
now if you have UNK in your steel it becomes very UNK and useless
for example if you think of the UNK advert where they're UNK these UNK all over the place if you had a UNK er a UNK based steel instead of UNK nicely the steel would actually crack and break
so basically you have to remove this UNK which was in this UNK
to do that you need to add UNK which then UNK into er calcium oxide in the heat of the blast furnace and then UNK with the sand to form slag
the equations are as follows
what's the formula for er UNK
simon
come on
i don't feel special no more
don't feel special any more UNK let's at least
oh
get english right
even if UNK in class is not allowed in a science lab
calcium oxide heated in the blast furnace turns very rapidly to calcium oxide plus carbon dioxide
which makes erm
now
c o three
it's easy
calcium UNK
now calcium UNK is the slag
what happens in the blast furnace is that the slag is lighter than the UNK iron and it UNK on top of the UNK iron and by some means that i s
UNK off
but they don't actually UNK it out off from the blast furnace they drill a hole in the side where they've plugged it with a lump of clay
cos they have to keep the blast furnace going don't they
that's right
yeah
i'm coming to that good but that is a very important point
the UNK from the furnace is done by means of tap holes in the side of the furnace and these are plugged with clay and what happens is one of the workers has a lump of clay on the end of a long metal rod
he then pushes this clay into the hole and the heat of the furnace means that the clay UNK almost UNK blocks the hole and then the furnace can go o carry on working
and the slag is normally UNK off first
they then run it into pits break it up and use it for road stone or alternatively the UNK slag is run over water UNK rollers where it forms little tiny UNK with a high air content which are used for making UNK blocks
but the slag making is an important part of the process
by the way interestingly enough this is a sort of acid plus base type reaction where you've got calcium oxide which is a basic oxide UNK dioxide which is an UNK oxide and the salt that it makes is calcium UNK
let's have a look at the reactions
the most common ore used in the blast furnace is UNK so i'm going to restrict my equations to dealing with UNK
because that's the one you may be asked in your exam
f e two o three
UNK
UNK
blood red colour
if you rub it in your fingers you'll find that your fingers are actually stained red by the UNK dust and it looks just as if you've cut yourself
now there are two ways in which iron oxide can be reduced to iron and they depend exactly where you are in the blast furnace
the first one is by reacting directly with carbon
when you get iron and carbon monoxide
that is a high temperature reaction and tends to happen near the bottom of the furnace
nearer the t higher up our reducing agent is carbon monoxide which is formed by partial burning of the coke and that forms iron again and carbon dioxide
now the carbon dioxide formed can react with more carbon to form car more carbon monoxide
so there's a whole a series of complicated equations that take place at different layers in the furnace and different temperatures but the end product of all of these is basically to produce the iron slag and carbon dioxide carbon monoxide and nitrogen
so coming off the top of the furnace we have a mixture of nitrogen quite a lot of that carbon monoxide and a bit of carbon dioxide
now what do you know about carbon monoxide
what happens if you react carbon monoxide with oxygen and UNK it
it burns
yes
have you ever looked at a coke fire the coke fire has been UNK up with only a limited supply of air
what colour are the flames
blue
yes
you've seen it good
they're blue flames
now the blue flames are what's happening is this there's two reactions taking place in that coke fire
down in the heart of the coke the limited supply of air is reacting with the carbon to form carbon monoxide
you shut the UNK doors on the bottom of fire
this carbon monoxide comes up through the coke and then comes in contact with air at the top of the fire and then burns to give you carbon dioxide
the carbon monoxide burns with a blue flame
so there is a fuel
it's called blast furnace gas
blast furnace gas
which is harmful
it is
would be if you discharged it into the environment because of course carbon monoxide is what
poisonous
yeah
come on to the poisonous nature of carbon monoxide in a minute
so carbon monoxide is poisonous
so they don't discharge it and since it's a fuel anyway they don't want to waste fuel they use the heat generated from burning this fuel to heat the incoming blast of air
they do that in brick s UNK called er cooper UNK
they've got effectively three of those
two of those are being heated by burning blast furnace gas and the third one has the cold air blown through it and the brickwork inside gives up the heat to the er cold air UNK the air and then that's blown into the blast furnace
blast furnace gas is what is called a low grade fuel
why is it a low grade fuel
compared with so many things
simon
er
you looked like you were going to try and answer
i w well actually i wasn't but i'll have a go
cos it cos it's cheap to make
no
no
low grade fuel
use it
no
what are we after when we burn a fuel
lots and lots of
heat
heat
so a high grade fuel will give us
er plenty of heat
right
and a low grade fuel
why doesn't that give us a lot of heat
it doesn't react very well
right
what doesn't react very well out of that lot
er carbon
carbon
well look
oxygen
you've got three things in blast furnace gas
nitrogen carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide
which one burns
nitrogen
carbon monoxide
the carbon monoxide
what about the nitrogen and the carbon dioxide
do they burn
no
no
so th most of that doesn't burn
so out of a large quantity of fuel this blast furnace gas only a little bit will actually burn to give you heat
but there's still enough to make it worth their while doing it
talking about carbon monoxide
carbon monoxide poisoning
how can you deliberately give yourself carbon monoxide poisoning to a mild degree
get in a car and put
that tends to be a little bit permanent
i was thinking of a slightly less permanent way and one which the chancellor's made slightly more expensive
erm
cigarettes
cigarettes
cigarettes
that's right
oh yes of course
okay UNK
cigarettes
the average smoker at any one time has approximately ten percent of their blood out of action with carbon monoxide poisoning
that's why a blood UNK if they've given a pint of blood they're told not to smoke afterwards if they're a smoker
the reason being that having given up ten percent of their blood roughly er in the blood donation if they then continue to erm smoke afterwards they they'll knock another ten percent of what's left out
they may be dropping their oxygen carrying capacity of their blood to a level at which they pass out
so er that's how people deliberately give themselves carbon monoxide poisoning although perhaps without realizing it
simon
sir right you know if you go for a blood UNK and you're a smoker how do you know that when you have the UNK you won't get the ten percent of the blood that's not working properly
what it is that it would be UNK out over the blood as a whole
and just bear in mind that if you're having a blood UNK you could actually be having the blood of a smoker
other things are if the erm person giving
yeah but wouldn't that get you UNK on smoking
it wouldn't be enough to get you UNK no
but bear in mind that if the person
what if there were plenty of smokers
if there were
plenty of smokers
it still wouldn't be enough er UNK to get you UNK to cigarettes
the UNK takes quite a time to develop
the erm other side of the coin is if the blood UNK has had a liquid lunch and what do i mean by liquid
UNK
lunch UNK
UNK
right
if they've been UNK you could end up with erm enough blood to
make you quite er high
ooh
yeah you
if you go for a pint at UNK you'd yeah you're driving and you can't you get done for drink driving
yeah
if you needed a blood UNK er you're not likely to be driving a car straight afterwards
you tend to be rather poorly which is why they've given you the blood UNK
but they are extremely careful
the only things that they don't seem to worry too much about your having taken beforehand are alcohol and smoking cigarettes
if you've got carbon monoxide poisoning one of the problems is that your blood can't carry the oxygen because the red blood cells are being put out of action by the carbon monoxide
you form UNK which er doesn't carry oxygen
how do you treat somebody who's er had carbon monoxide poisoning
give them plenty of oxygen
right
now the problem is with this that the blood as is it won't normally take it up
so what can be done if you live near er a naval town or north sea support town to actually get that oxygen into the UNK
oh erm ask them if you can sit in one of those er machines that erm get you out of the bends
right
absolutely right
yes
er the h it's called UNK oxygen
basically what they do is they stick you in one of these UNK chambers
oh yeah
flood it with oxygen and you're putting so much oxygen in that the normal mechanism of the oxygen combining with the UNK in the red blood cells is UNK and the oxygen under high pressure will actually dissolve straight into the UNK
that's how you get the bends because the oxygen nitrogen have dissolved directly into the blood
so that it's actually the blood itself carrying the oxygen round in solution
and you keep the person in that condition long enough for the damaged red cells to be replaced
the only problem is if you don't happen to live near a port which has one of these UNK er UNK chambers then you've problems that erm just putting a mask over the person and giving them oxygen that way is normally isn't enough
it may actually UNK the person and put them on erm a life support machine
footballers sort of when footballers get injuries they go in them to get fit quicker
you're right duncan
do you know why
no
well instead of just saying no how about taking it through and working it out
when you're growing new muscle or replacing tissue what is needed
apart from the food to supply the UNK to make that muscle what else
what do you need all the time
oxygen
oxygen right
some of that UNK used in the processes together with the UNK to repair damages tissue
so if you increase the amount of oxygen present what happens then
the tissue will heal quicker
the tissue will heal up quicker
and that's the way it works
another advantage is and this is another case for being put in one of these UNK oxygen chambers if you've got erm an anaerobic infection
now anaerobic excuse me
think of jane UNK and UNK and i'll come back to you
can you be quiet please
i can't hear on the phone
thank you
right folks
sorry about that
happened yet again
erm that was er steve from the youth centre because we've just er told him how much it's going to cost him to use the school premises next year and he's thrown a UNK fit
who
good
the youth leader
oh
erm because the problem is the school's s now supposed to be making economic charges er which involves UNK fees plus heating costs and everything
erm and it comes to quite a high figure and he's not happy
sir school trips
yeah
at the moment at the moment i don't know because er i had er one or two problems with organizing that
but i will leave that with me and i'll come back to you
sir could you do something because ages ago you promised to do a chip pan fire for us
yeah
yeah sir i
and you still haven't done one
every time you've done
i haven't forgotten the chip pan fire
every time you've done the chip pan fire i've always missed out
yeah
yes
i will er demonstrate it again
that is the effects on the ceiling are the effects of the last one
i'm going to be doing one or two more over the next erm few weeks or so
i will do it for you
because then when it's been er finished i'm going to UNK the ceiling to cover up the
well i'm s sure if you wanted to i could give you the paint and you can do it for me
you'll notice it doesn't
it doesn't
if you notice the smoke and flames reached somewhere nearly to UNK head
last time
which was quite effective
back to the blast furnace
we've got our four elements going in four main components
we've got coke iron ore UNK and hot air
hot air is blown in to the furnace
we've got the blast furnace gas and dust coming off the top and the UNK removed and the blast furnace gas is used as a fuel
coming out at the bottom comes out what
at the bottom
ash sir
no
iron
iron
right
UNK iron
which is very hot indeed
yeah
which is why in the iron and UNK trade they refer to the UNK iron as hot metal
if you were to let that iron cool what form of iron would you actually have
is it steel
no
it's not steel yet we've got to convert it into steel
what's that iron
solid iron
begins with c
four letter word
cast iron
cast iron
good right
okay
says it's cast iron
now cast iron if you are in the metal workshops and you are hitting something with a hammer and you hit the vice instead mr will throw a UNK at you
why
snap and break
because it will snap and break yes
cast iron is very UNK
which is one of the reasons by the way why another thing you will get murdered for in the er workshops is taking two UNK and hitting the heads against each other because they're UNK and y they may well UNK quite UNK if you do that
why would you wanna do that
pupils do all sorts of peculiar things
so cast iron is UNK
so what is cast iron used for
making UNK
yes
because
well not d er it's a special form of steel for UNK
but in a vice what are you putting that cast iron under
are you stretching it or UNK it
UNK
UNK
so cast iron is extremely good under UNK
if you stretch it cracks very easily
so cast iron res UNK better than steel does
cast iron is an UNK
that's a mixture of two elements
normally UNK are UNK of two metals
but in this case for cast iron it's a metal and a non metal
which is the metal first of all
for cast iron pretty obvious
iron
right
and what have we put lots of in the blast furnace all that black stuff
slag
coke
coke
the
coke
right
which is carbon
so cast iron is approximately four percent carbon
it's an UNK of iron and carbon
that makes it's the carbon that makes it UNK
and during the UNK process the excess carbon is burnt off by UNK what gas into the UNK iron
carbon monoxide
much more reactive than carbon monoxide
carbon er
not carbon anything
take the last bit
oxide
oxygen
yes
so beside a steel works you will have an oxygen making plant because they actually use oxygen by the ton
simon said something interesting earlier about the s the iron works
you said it runs all the time
yes
yeah
david said then
iron runs a iron works run all the time
it's a continuous process
how does that compare with UNK
yeah
UNK is a batch process a bit like making a cake where you put all the ingredients in together UNK the cake then put another batch of ingredients UNK another cake
with UNK they work in er two hundred and fifty tonnes roughly at a time pour it in the basic oxygen UNK furnace blow oxygen into the steel which takes about twenty minutes then the steel with one or two other processes is basically ready to be used
but it's a batch process whereas UNK continuous
now cast iron contains four percent carbon
when i had a lock that was sticking what did i blow what powder i did i blow into the lock to make it work better
baking powder
no
UNK
got to tie up with the cast iron
it's black powder
coke
also well coke is
carbon
carbon
in what form
beginning with g
yeah
yeah
er diamond is one form
what's the other form
oh gold
UNK
used in UNK
UNK
UNK
good
so UNK is the black form of carbon
diamond is the other form
and UNK cos i blew this UNK powder into the lock it acts as a what
oh a UNK
UNK
UNK
UNK
so UNK is a dry UNK
now why don't you put oil in a conventional lock
it would UNK it up
right
because the oil would attract dust and the d oil UNK up and the leaves the dust deposits sort of UNK inside the lock and it will UNK it up
UNK is a dry UNK
cast iron contains a lot of UNK
right
so can you give me a use of cast iron which ha one of the effects of it is that it relies on the occasional UNK properties of the UNK in the iron
er ice
er clue it helped me to come to school this morning
car
right
UNK
so what do you make the cylinder block out of
cast iron
why cast iron
because cast UNK hard
what do you make the UNK out of
cast iron
oh steel
steel
no
you want to be light and a good conductor of heat
a light metal
aluminium
aluminium
right
your UNK are aluminium because you want a light weight because it going up and down and if it's very heavy when th the UNK rod wants to pull it back down again it will want to carry on straight out through the top of the cylinder head
so you want a light weight and a good conductor of heat
and you have a hard metal sliding against a soft metal because that actually produces less wear than two hard metals rubbing together
now normally your cylinder is UNK by what
oil
oil
if the oil film breaks down UNK for a very short period of time that little bit of carbon that four percent carbon in the cast iron will actually stop the aluminium sticking to the cylinder
so the UNK it actually helps to make it self UNK
to a certain extent
now obviously nobody would be daft enough to try running a car without oil although some of the garages doing their p d i 's pre delivery inspections can cause that sort of problem
the one i was thinking of in fact was a poor lady who bought a ford UNK from er what was then garage it's now in UNK
oh yeah
oh yeah i know
right
opposite builders merchant
near the train station
yeah
near the what
well er you can see the train station from there
think you mean railway station
where
hang on a second
wait
let me just finish this off
it was delivered from ford on a UNK to in UNK run off the UNK they did the p d i she went to collect her brand new car and got as far as UNK save in sherwood
that's when the engine UNK solid because there was no oil in the engine
they forgot to check the oil
right see you sir
mirror on the wall who was the UNK of them all well okay not me and maybe not you either but it doesn't stop us trying does it
were looking at the body beautiful and what we do to achieve it we all arrived in the world with more or less the same package of features limbs faces UNK since then all of us i bet have tried to improve or disguise the way we look what do we do why do we do it well let's start with a few questions er are you well let me ask you this do you have a beautiful body button one for yes and button two for no
pretty straight forward question okay thank you very much dear eighty five of you said no
just as UNK fifteen of you said yes in scotland i'm impressed
what do you think of that question
i mean has any body ever actually asked you that question before
no nobody's ever asked me but i did say yes but only because i want to believe it i don't care if the rest of you don't but i think its very important that you you've got the body that your born with and i think its very important just to go on with it and make the best of it
mm what do you think of that yes
just want to know what is beautiful its only in the eye of the UNK every body sees something different
what w what can you define can you define what beautiful is you recognise beauty when you see it
erm yes i think so
maybe i should ask you another question does
any one you know have a beautiful body button one for yes and button two for no er that's interesting almost a complete UNK there
seventy seven UNK somebody with a beautiful body and twenty three of you don't
will the seventy seven who said yes like to say who this is yes
my two year old son i think he's
i knew you
he's just gorgeous
yeah it
and i hope that i can train him to keep it that way
mm
any one else yes
erm most of the people i know particularly the one's i like i look at them and i look at them being beautiful just because i like them erm but i'm aware of also looking at other people and thinking oh that's gross you know
really
yes
yes
i think its a case of the grass being UNK on the other side you know you never seem to be happy with what you have yourself you always see it in somebody else gosh i wish i had her hair or her skin or her body shape you just never seem to be satisfied with what you've got and yet other people see you as looking very attractive
mm yeah
does it matter i mean does it matter how you look
oh yes
what a silly question of course it matters how you look up there yes
it ought not to matter but unfortunately i think it does i think we live in a society where the visual appearance is every thing
do you think that's changed i mean do you think a hundred years ago two hundred years ago five hundred years ago
i think
that didn't apply
i think the UNK have definitely changed you know the
mm
sixties UNK was a very in figure in UNK er nowadays that would be termed UNK i would imagined
mm yes
i think UNK have changed but i think people's UNK haven't really changed people have always been UNK to improve their appearance even like in roman times when they used coal and
mm
UNK for their hair and erm the men put oil on their bodies to make themselves look better you know more attractive to the UNK and so i think erm we've always UNK to improve ourselves our UNK
so its a basic part of being a human animal yes
but beauty isn't the say beauty is only skin deep but what about the million people who live in this country who are dealing with UNK for whom that they'll live their life with no cure no prospect of cure and er those are people who we only wish i'm one of them er i also run a self help group in UNK and there are a great many of us who would like to i think extend a more of an understanding to the general public because its not how we regard ourselves
mm
unfortunately its a UNK by the other members of the public they think it looks and we often say we feel like UNK so
well how do you change that attitude because i mean it is it people for whatever reason are drawn to admire and like people who look UNK attractive
i agree with what that lady said down there i think its very much erm an inner confidence
mm
and how you feel yourself that's how you present yourself to other people i think if you present yourself in a confident manner i think people pick up on that and i do i don't think beauty is necessarily what you see i think its how you feel within yourself and how you present yourself to people
now confidence has UNK in lots and lots of ways and its appealing to that confidence as much as the UNK er that makes the UNK and the UNK of all manner of products er their huge profits now i guess we all spend money on various products and er do you do you worry about how much you spend on the body beautiful or just the body do you or i mean does any i wonder if you think you spend too much on it let me ask you that do you spend too much money on your body er button one for yes and button two for no
er now you see all good UNK here ninety one said no
that either means your very confident in what you spend i think you haven't got enough to spend as much as you'd liked to spend or there is no such thing as too much
why did you say no out of interest
i mean would you spend more if you had it or are you all well balanced
yes i would say i would spend more if i had it i think UNK a question of money
mm
money for erm operations for changing your nose your ears whatever
really
we would all spend more if we had it to spend we would all like to look more beautiful
so they so they
and isn't it hoped your buying hope that you will look more beautiful
up there
you don't have to spend a lot of money to look just nice looking i mean d'you know er just you know nice appearing clean appearing or something like that will do and beauty most of it its come from inside
i don't spend any money i just use soap and water
and boots own cleansing UNK for my UNK and that's it only buy UNK eye UNK and UNK and UNK and that's it and it does me six months of the year
only the UNK that's right there yes
i can't agree with the lady over there that you know if money were know object we would all go out and get knew UNK and
mm
pinned back ears i wonder if people realize just what a UNK thing it is to have plastic surgery
i was forced to have it because i smashed my face up in an accident
mm
and while i started off thinking i might finish up better than i started
mm
by the time i had gone through five operations i decided that as long as i could breath that would do me and i would really recommend every body to think twice before having any form of plastic surgery particularly unless its if its not absolutely necessary
mm is there any body here who's had UNK plastic surgery who who'd wants to or has any views on it up there yes
yes erm i had a new face made eleven years ago and i'm very happy with this face
wha what why i mean what were the circumstances
i had no bones in the jaw which meant having to start below the eyes and re build a whole new face
so from your point of view despite presumably you had a number of operations like
no i had it all done in one
and that
which lasted approximately six hours on the table
i think a medical problem different say for instance for myself i got an awful bash on the nose playing UNK and they thought it was broken however it UNK and i wished it had broken because its UNK a bit but i do not believe in spending money on UNK surgery because i think if you make the best of what you have and think of all the people were UNK by disease
mm
you should be UNK with what you have
i think its the UNK you see in er magazines at the moment its the full lip look you know erm that certain models have sort of erm put in UNK at the moment and
mm
i think no mine are too thin or maybe their not and this and seeing this in magazines seeing it on television it UNK me think that maybe i could have that
mm
and if i had the money i could have that
mm
i could look as good as that
yes
i think its very difficult to be yourself these days because you see so many magazines with beautiful people in and you think that's how i want to look and its a sort of pressure thing all the time
mm
and even if you think no i wouldn't really spend the money to make myself more beautiful you think oh maybe if i really if i did have that money would i do it
mm
you know just to keep up with the times really
mm
well i work as a UNK and it seems to me that for some people change is impossible and when that is the case then its my job to help them to come to terms with who they are and what they are and how there going to remain but the other side of it is helping people to change and i have to say usually its to loose weight that's the biggest reason people want to change
well i can say personally that i went from a size twelve to a twenty and its a medical problem its the not an eating one though you know any thing to with any diet or any thing like that completely medical so er it takes a bit of coping with when you've been slim and then all of a sudden you have this weight that no diet will remove
i recently lost three stone in weight and wondered how else i could improve myself and i was lucky in that i had a UNK for a cancer about seven years ago so i went ahead and had breast UNK
i wouldn't recommend it was a very traumatic nine hour operation
really
mm its i'm delighted with it
yes
but i think for people to go and have plastic surgery of that length of time for erm any thing else other than medical reasons
mm
its a very individual personal choice
i lived in UNK for fifteen years and i knew many people who after having had their children would have UNK and they just felt that they'd got back the figure that they had before the children and particularly one of my friends she had twins and her stomach was so stretched and after her pregnancy she'd got all this sort of UNK skin and what she UNK was that she waited fifteen years before she decided to go and have something done and she just felt so much better about it
now what's the difference between UNK and scotland is it is it that the UNK have more money is it that the UNK are more body conscious is it that the UNK are more UNK they think that there are more important things to think about what do you think
yes i think that the UNK are more UNK and also i had three babies erm i was pregnant out there and i flew back to scotland to have them and the difference between going to a UNK and seeing a doctor here was incredible
in UNK the UNK would not let you put on too much weight because he was concerned that you'd end up looking like an old cow and
because you come back here and all the scottish women were vast and they lost their UNK and it was just sort of almost taken for granted that you have a baby and you loose your figure but you don't mind because you've got the children
yes
i must admit i really don't agree with that i mean i find that many women who have had erm children actually their figure has improved after the children they look a great deal better and i certainly don't think that many women in scotland looked vast after they've had children i totally disagree with that
it was interested to hear what this lady said about putting on so much weight
mm
and twice in the last nine months i've been in the united states and i was amazed at the number of very large women
mm
but they were all dressed in bright colours and fashionable clothes and obviously thoroughly enjoying themselves there are very few jane UNK walking about the streets of washington or new york
it seems to me that british manufacturers are missing out on a market that would be welcome by bigger women
aha
if they would only produce the same styles that they produce for the up to size twelve
talking about image i mean my body's like a UNK without my clothes on
but that's no problem for me it used to be a problem but it isn't now because i've worked on building up my confidence in other things so i'm good at quite a lot of things and i always keep re UNK that i'm good at doing these things
we've kind of UNK away from the whole thing about image and about fat
mm
women are not UNK skinny women are not UNK really skinny women we have to be like the UNK type woman and i think that the its about money and its about co its about the consumer and about money and about making money from an image that somebody somewhere has seen as the normal perfect woman and the norm can be any thing it could be whatever you want it to be
i work for a large UNK surgery company in england
yeah
and i think its true that if women did have the money particularly of their own they would spend it on their body's or their faces
what makes you say that
because surgery does give a lot of women more confidence and men as well
and men what kind of surgery do men go for
they like their UNK done or their ears done
yeah
a tremendous amount of surgery is done for men
okay down there
its all this talk about ladies who are fat what about ladies who are thin who just cannot put on weight
mm
erm the ladies who are a bit UNK and get all the sympathy you get all so skin or just skinny and suddenly you try to put on some weight you just can't
fifty seven degrees of UNK here yes
er after i had my children my whole body UNK and i'd lost a lot of weight and i couldn't put it on and i was really skinny and there was no way i could eat a lot and i still wouldn't put weight on so i started on the weight training and that doesn't cost me money and now i've started putting weight on so for the skinny kids i think the thing is to do the weight training
okay
and build yourself up that way
yes
my husband is a minister and an artist and he says that the UNK of the female figure is various and he sees beauty in all types
yes
and unless its a real medical problem be content with your figure
do you say that as well
er yes but i would need to loose a little weight
oh
who said that did you say that or your husband
oh no it was myself yeah
well you see that's exactly the problem though
yes
i mean you know we can all be very er liberal minded and enlightened about every body else but when it comes to ourselves with a and there are some exceptions and you've identified yourselves here amongst this hundred but a lot of us if were absolutely honest we would like to change things i mean one way or another and we all do various things i mean we certainly wash our hair and people say you don't need to wash your hair if you leave it long enough it'll wash itself i don't know what else you do maybe you UNK bits of this and wax bits of that and
and i'm certainly wearing paint tonight quite a bit of it because its very hot under here and you wouldn't want to see me without it but that's me saying that i mean why do i why do i why are we all wearing make up do we actually think we look better are we trying to disguise something yes
erm i pressed yes for having liking my own body and i do erm but i also like the slight improvements that i make on it like erm my hair
yeah
colouring and but its for myself erm my husband never ever says to me oh your not wearing make up or erm when i go to work i don't wear it
mm
erm because i'm pre occupied about with what i'm doing
mm
but if i'm thinking about myself then yes i look and i put on make up
mm
and i perhaps then wax my legs or erm but not to the extreme of having some one else involved in my improvements i make my own improvements in my body
mm
er the one's that i choose to make but i wouldn't go and ask someone to help me with it
behind you
its the pressure that er everybody's under to look a certain way and the look tends to have you know UNK or and every thing else and that's what's expected of you so most people do it
but is there any thing wrong with that
that's up to yourself i personally don't do it at all
mm
i've not worn make up since i've got married but even then it was just a wee drop but i don't enjoy wearing make up i feel dirty with it on but what ever you want to do its up to yourself
right yes
erm i wear make up as a mask basically gives me confidence and it stops me having to be myself which i feel isn't good enough for the public
but then with your mask on do you feel more like yourself
er well i'm a UNK and erm when i'm working i consider the restaurant my stage and i have to be somebody else because i'm worried that you know who i am isn't good enough to entertain these people
i just feel i'm a mother so er all week and i don't wear make up all week and i don't dress up all week just a jeans and a UNK whereas tonight you knew you were coming some where
yeah
so's tonight i'm a different person cos i've put make up and i went and got my hair done and i feel different tonight but i don't feel under pressure that i have to wear make up all the time cos nobody treats me any different whether i've got make up on or whether
right
i haven't got make up on
so its not for your man and its not for society and its not for
no its not for my husband cos my husband says you look nice whether i've got make up on or whether i haven't got make up on so really
it does UNK bother me you know
yes
sorry i run a health UNK in scotland and i see an awful lot of women who obviously come in for some slight improvement but quite frankly it is the stress factor that shows in the face that doesn't make them quite so beautiful because their personalities comes across for when their stressed it shows in their face and i notice when they leave only after a few days the stress has gone and their personality UNK through and their far more beautiful
where was the little girl or er younger i don't want to make up because but now i feeling i'm aged it i should be wearing some make up here with just a feeling we should be when i look in the mirror oh its getting old so
how do some say just like er that when was younger don't need them is erm face is perfect i like it yeah
right okay so its to make you look younger
yeah i think so just
there's another UNK and
incorrect truth
were all supposed to look younger than we are we yes
a lot of what has been said about make up has been very negative its to disguise or improve its also an expression of er inner identity and its not something that's new to the twentieth century its something that we've been doing you know since the beginning of time with war paint and what not
i think that its often what's inside that comes out and what we wear and make up and i think perhaps its men who have the restriction of not being able to do that they are not perhaps getting the opportunity to express their inner self
i work in a very male dominated field and the amount
what's that what isn't
what isn't
i work in the local government but i work in economical development which is predominantly male its building construction surveys architects
mm
my make up and the way i dress reflects the meetings i'm going to
if i'm going to a meeting where i know i'm going to be the only woman i put my war paint on if i'm just going to be in the office all day i UNK around in a skirt and a UNK with very little make up
you know i'd like to ask a question why is it so why is it so frightening to spoil yourself why is it such a wrong thing to spoil yourself erm we've been talking about make up we've been talking about
mm
beauty products if you want to spend fifty pence or a pound on something and you know from your high street chemist or your going to spend seventy pounds on the same sort of cream that's up to you if you if it makes you feel good go for it
if you want to spend seven thousand pounds on
that's right if it makes you feel good inside i think you should go for it
yes
pretty much on what the lady's saying surely if you get up in the morning and you look in the mirror and you don't like what you see and you apply some make up and you feel better or you hate your nose so you have it you know altered surely if it makes you feel good then why not if you've got the money and its not UNK any one then go for it
i think there's a more serious thing that we haven't actually touched on which is that many people feel that they are UNK against when they go for certain posts
mm
and jobs because of the way they look particularly if they happen to be
slightly over weight or very over weight and i mean that is something we haven't really looked at but i mean is it UNK people quite seriously
mm i think maybe at the start though when i said do you have a beautiful body maybe i asked the wrong questions let me ask you this question at the end do you like your body er button one for yes and button two for no and maybe we'll get a different answer then eighty five people said no they didn't have a beautiful body but fifty six people here say yes they like their body forty four is too many people who don't why not who said no why don't you yes
the UNK are in the wrong places
says who
i do because its not for UNK sake i do feel at times going upstairs or
yeah
UNK that i carry too much weight and i know that and its like the lady said its not the chocolate biscuits but it is erm self erm
you can't get the self discipline
that's right
some how up there yes
i think its because erm i don't i'm not happy with mine because it shows signs of UNK and it reminds me that i'm getting older and i don't like that
yeah any other yes
i know my body UNK is in the wrong places and i know i have signs of UNK i was reminded even this morning by a close friend about my grey UNK which i don't give too UNK about
some friend some friend
but
i'm happy with my body because my husband loves it and my children UNK it and i feel great about it
yes
i should say that you should think well those of us that are healthy any way we should be glad that our body's have stood us this length of time and have allowed us to come here to this programme and to take part in it i'm certainly delighted that mine's a gave me three children nothing to complain about
mm
i just find it very difficult to understand paying over two thousand for er to have your tummy UNK removed
i can't see how any body can justify spending two thousand pounds on getting a bit of fat removed some
i think that's rather that's a cheap deal i think isn't it two thousand pounds
surely its relative i mean two thousand pounds to you might be quite a lot of money but to someone else its not a big deal
oh i think a fact i think its a fact two thousand pounds is a lot of money even to some body that's relative you know
yes but who can afford it
there's people in the states who have this sort of thing done and its not its not a problem
but were scottish women and i think to a scottish woman two thousand pounds i mean i know a lot of scottish women
not all scottish women
well perhaps you know we'll be able to find out for UNK if a hundred scottish women with two thousand seem like a lot of money
but it depends what your buying for your two thousand pounds if your buying happiness and your content with yourself then its surely money well spent
well i put it
its not guaranteed
i put it to this hundred would you spend two thousand pounds on having a tummy tuck if your tummy needing UNK
i mean i know some of the some of the more UNK women i won't say skinny here what aren't in need of a tummy tuck but well there's you as a twenty two scottish women would spend two thousand pounds what do you think of that
their mad
their mad
yes
i just go to bed at night and hope for a miracle that i'll get up in the morning
well maybe you'll get it
and i'll be slim again
yes go on
i know many scottish women who will spend more than two thousand pounds going on a UNK holiday abroad and the risk is far greater than UNK to surgery
let me ask you this final question
people have talked a bit about their children and er and how beautiful they are supposing you were a fairy god mother and you were at a UNK and you had a UNK and you could UNK one gift would it be beauty is beauty the most important gift button one for yes and button two for no and i'd love to go round the world and ask this question but out of one hundred scottish women seven of you say yes but ninety three of you think there is a more important gift than beauty and what that might be we shall talk about another time but for all thank you now thank you for watching good bye
saint andrew and father christmas
what have they got to do with our real lives today
do you wish your nearest and UNK happy saint andrew's day on the morning of the thirtieth
yes we're talking about traditions
let's start with christmas
now we all know about the UNK of christmas and the pressure to spend money to give the kids the best which often means the most expensive
not to mention the pressure to play happy families which often leads to arguments and tears or loneliness and depression
the point is it never used to be like that in scotland hogmanay was the main event short and UNK and UNK in a scottish kind of way
it's not that long ago that scots worked through christmas including christmas day
so christmas two months of panic before it two months of UNK after it tell me honestly with exactly one month to go are you really looking forward to it
let me put that question to the hundred women here are you looking forward to christmas
button one for yes and button two for no
and this hundred don't share my apparent UNK seventy three of them are twenty seven said no
of those who said yes why
what are you looking forward to
yes
young children
it's always a happy time with young children in the house and everybody UNK around it's a family time for us and we enjoy it
who else said yes
mhm
well my family has is now all over the world so christmas give me a good excuse to sa to tell them to come home we need you
who else said yes
mhm
i love it because it's christian and christmas to me is basically a traditional christian festival and that's the part of it that i enjoy
i must admit i do enjoy over UNK on the christmas pudding as well
but firstly it's a it is a special religious time
okay
who else
any of the UNK
yes
yes i love christmas because family comes together
we are rather living apart now some down south
mm
er and er it's grand to have er the family together again
i just don't like all the hassle or the money spent all the food that's eaten all the washing up
and quite honestly i'd my family are quite happy where they are
i dislike the UNK and the pressure to consume
i'd i'm find it quite offensive sometimes and particularly i happen to work on a project that's to do with poverty and i'm very aware of the kind of pe pressures that sort of UNK can
mhm
put on people
so i dislike that
i think the other thing i dislike as pressure is to be with people and to be happy when actually lots of time i would rather just be on my own
how do you UNK the commercial pressures and the emotional pressures the seventy three of you who are looking forward to christmas
yes
well i started when my children were quite young and taught them that er advertisements on television were just an invitation to be ripped off
aha
and i seem to have been fairly successful in that i've never neither i nor father christmas has ever been asked for what i would consider to be a greedy UNK present
that's er so you've been a successful UNK
i've UNK them yes
er yes
up there
yes i was very successful in that respect as well that er my children i taught them that just to wait till the january sales and they'd get what they wanted for half the price
and er also i like the religious side of it too i
mm yeah
i emphasize the true religious er feeling of the
yeah
the occasion
there
i wanted to answer yes and no
yes to the fact the family gets together maybe
right
you ha it's first time for the whole year you've seen some of them and so on
and the other thing is i don't like the UNK i think it's just
mm
gone over the top
mm
up there
i think a lot of people tend to find it hard to get by on a monthly pay packet as it is
you bet
and then there's the as everyone says the UNK coming up to christmas it's
yeah
it's even harder to try and get by on your pay packet and to get all the christmas presents
so in that respect i find i mean i'm just gonna be making my first monthly pay packet and i don't know how i'm gonna manage
mm
here
yes
it's interesting the lady
mm
saying yes and a no
mm
the reason why you say yes and no is that everybody wishes christmas is the ideal and perfect and everybody gets together but there are so many people who are not in that position and therefore it UNK those who are not
mhm
beside you here
er i was at a UNK recently being in edinburgh in the shops in the middle of september where everywhere you looked there was christmas ball balls and
yeah
christmas trees and i have two small children that to try to sustain christmas for three or four days is very difficult to do it for three months is impossible
well a my kids always got a something at christmas not very much at times and they looked forward to it
but we always before hogmanay because we used to go out fresh
aha
fresh UNK people and i used to have people coming to my house
mhm
and we miss all that
it seems to have died away now
yeah
well i think now in general in scotland th the drinking license has been different er hogmanay does not exist as such because
mhm
nowadays most people have hogmanay every weekend
no well i mean let's be honest today you know clubs the opening of pubs in places liked
mm
and the changing of the licensing laws and i think traditionally now more scots enjoy christmas better than they
mm
used to do years ago because they were working or whatever
you know i think it is now more a traditional family time christmas and you know they don't look at hogmanay the same
yeah
at christmas and hogmanay well i'd like to go away and get outside do you know where the country because that is more scottish you get that's the countryside
i wouldn't like to be stuck up in the city and have an being forced to buy people lots of christmas presents that i just can't afford
so do you think you're UNK your own tradition which is a perfectly time honoured and respectable thing to do or do you think you're UNK back to an old tradition or what
well a mixture between both cos i can er ah go back but there's lots of things i do just now that weren't about in those days
yes
yes
i would like to say that in these days of environmental awareness and so on that is a kind of UNK back to times when there was a mid winter UNK
mhm
it was all to do with recognising it was the middle of the winter sun was at it's lowest and the sun would be coming back again and maybe that's some sort of gut feeling
yeah celebration
that you're having and i think other people have too
beside you
yes i i'd like to go back to that very traditional hogmanay i mean i think that hogmanay is very important not the hogmanay that we have now where everybody UNK round a t v but it was very much erm like a i always think hogmanay at my UNK as do er most of the people in th the mining area actually her house was a focus
and some of the things that led up to it erm yo you had like a form of spring cleaning yo you know
mm
everybody here will be aware of that turning the house inside out erm getting rid of all the old things and i
mhm
that went out to erm making up UNK you know if you'd fallen out with somebody you had to make up with them before the bells and in fact what my granny did was to erm to empty the fire and to UNK the fire for the new year
mhm
and at ten to twelve my grandfather would take out the bucket with the old UNK and bury it in a garden and that would UNK the old year
mhm
and looking forward to a new year
and i mean i still feel very emotional at er hogmanay
mm
you know
i think about the year that's gone past perhaps people who've passed out of my life and think of it as a new beginning and i wish as scots that we would hold on to it and UNK that tradition and get away from gathering around the t v in hogmanay
in my tradition on a christmas day and hogmanay we have the old fashioned scottish UNK
mhm
pipes playing UNK traditional UNK song and that is our what we do at christmas and new year is to have the old traditional UNK song
so are there particular UNK sung and sung and UNK played at christmas that aren't played at other times of the year
i mean what UNK that kind of UNK from
well er at christmas time and the new year time we can let our hair down and sing the old traditional UNK maybe
yeah
forty or fifty verses where other times of the year the young ones would UNK sit and listen to that
but christmas and new year is our time to let our hair down and sit our old traditional UNK
you should say who we are
i mean i don't
we are the UNK of UNK er traditional UNK singers
mhm
and story UNK of scotland
and that tradition is UNK and
it's
it's UNK by ti by the passage of time
it's UNK in our family
it's er the travellers tradition and it goes back to the old tradition of the scottish people as well
mm
which is dying out now but we are UNK to keep it alive
mhm
down here
i wo i would like to go back to the days of my youth when we at hogmanay there was usually frost and ice and er we used to celebrate it partly on UNK and it was great fun when you UNK perhaps a mile and a half out of the town and er had a lovely ice festival and then we UNK back and we had
where was
dancing at the cross and er
where was that
that was in UNK
in UNK
yes
is there no longer frost in UNK at hogmanay
well i've been away for three well th the UNK aren't as hard now as they used to be
like the UNK aren't as golden
aye
i mean is that is that
well
did you feel as if
yes
there's a sort of UNK coming over everyone who's talking about it can't have been all that wonderful all the time somehow
there was a lot of hard drinking in those
yes
days
a lot of women must have suffered in those
mm
same UNK
well looking ahead to the events er a month hence but of course this week er on the thirtieth of this month er we will be celebrating saint andrews day or will we
do you celebrate saint andrews day
button one for yes and button two for no
now this is supposed to be UNK national day however amongst this hundred eighty people don't celebrate it twenty do
the twenty who do wha what do you do those tho those twenty
yes
buy a bottle of whisky and order up a UNK
whisky and UNK
give him a good UNK
okay
who else said yes
aha
yeah
i UNK i usually go to a st andrews dance about that time
right
the la wo in front
she said not
er in front
i go to er a st andrews dinner
aha
run by UNK
and does it feel like a traditional scottish
yeah we run it as such very much
ah yo sa so you use the day as a as a as a reason to have that event
yes
who else
yes
i'm a UNK so st andrews night is one of the great weeks of the year and erm invariably turns out to be male orientated erm
no
yes it does
oh yes it does
it's usually male singers and all sorts of things like that
erm but it's a nice week
do you think that's the reason why eighty of the people
no
here said no they weren't celebrating st andrews because it's actually er a male tradition
perhaps yes
it's also a lesser tradition st andrews day
i mean the eighty of you who said no do does st andrews day mean anything to you at a at all
yes
why st andrew
i mean i know his bones were brought to scotland but why st andrew
it's celebrated in the schools with er my school children always acknowledge it so it may not actually be celebrated within the family as such but it's certainly acknowledged
yes
well it
yeah
well it's part of the reason that er it's not celebrated is that because it isn't a holiday
mhm
yep
lots of people want it to er suggest that it ought to be holiday but
yes
obviously not enough
would you like it to be a holiday
sure
yes
and what would you do to mark st andrews day
would you
i would do as i do now probably and go to
some kind of st andrews night do or something like that
yes
there
i was just going to sa er ask the question if it's not more celebrated by UNK scots
well
and the rest of the world
might be
you know that's the that's scotland
mhm
that's it's day
there is a point
you know
there though isn't there are st andrews day dinner and dances held
mm
all over the world where there is a scottish community from UNK kong to new york
in fact th the new york saint andrews society which exists to er i think to er apart from to hold er meetings and er get UNK also to assist er scots in new york at least that was one of it's original er principles they have a er a splendid dinner with all these gentlemen in full UNK and UNK the whole UNK and their women folk can come and watch them from the gallery upstairs
i mean do they
i mean maybe that's but then we have something not un er un UNK to that which is er a traditional burns night
now do you go to burns nights do you enjoy those as a good scottish tradition
yes
oh yes
yes but it's not so male UNK orientated now as you're making it out to be
cos
oh i'm sorry i didn't i was sa i was simply suggested it used to be i mean it did originally start as a
yes
as a as a male thing
well many of the traditions nowadays even the male orientated ones are depending a lot on women to UNK hold them
mhm
yes
i think actually there are still a few erm male only burns UNK
i'm a singer and i have on several occasions sung at male only burns UNK which means you get UNK in after the meal is over and then UNK out again after that which doesn't worry me at all
because i'm charged exactly the same whether i'm there for three hours or twenty minutes
and er frankly you would UNK want to go to a male a male only burns supper they they're a most un UNK looking crew by the time they've finished their dinner
yes
i think it's a good idea that more and more schools now are having burns UNK
mhm
both at the primary level and the secondary level so what's coming across is not just er the fact that perhaps burns was a UNK but also as a nationalist and an UNK
mhm
and a UNK
up there
yes
can somebody tell me here why robert burns is so celebrated when he was a UNK and UNK his wife why
no
nelly could you explain why
i'll explain why he was a socialist
UNK burns was a socialist
that's why it's er celebrated so much
because it's one of his poems was when man to man in the world ever shall UNK oh gosh
well be for all that and help me god it's not happened yet
yes
i don't really think it's good enough for nelly to say that he was socialist because i don't think his attitudes to women
yeah
would be UNK by women in the nineties definitely not
if you have a look at some of his poetry
a oh yes but
and i would like to make another quote if i may he was the one that talked about scotland being the land of cakes and brother scots where the women made the cakes but he's only addressing the brother scots
yeah
okay
yet these traditions which are kept which have no status whatsoever women's traditions
down here
but the fact remains that he has written the most beautiful love songs that
here
we have in this country
and he also had the write UNK poetry
and th they're known all over the world
mhm
there
i think if you ha if you look at burns in the context of the time in which he lived he was not an exceptional UNK or an exceptional UNK we're a lot like him
mm
and it was the ma it was the custom of the times and we shouldn't judge somebody living in another age by
mm
the standards of our own
mhm
i'd like to pick up something er that UNK touched on you said women's traditions now wha what are women's traditions
well we're all struggling to think of them i suppose but what the one lady said over here about UNK making and story telling
mhm
maybe that's one of women's traditions i believe they had a big part to UNK play in it
by the way the reason i ask is because th that suggests from the phrase you used that you see there are men's traditions and that perhaps scottish traditions are very are very
i see that men's traditions are held in higher esteem and some parts of women's lives like cooking and making clothes and so on
mm
because they were women's work they were held in a
mm
mu much less esteem
these
but
kind of UNK traditions i mean
yes
i imagine that there were erm distinct women's traditions in pre christian times erm and that these are lost to us now
there has been a UNK of er of some of those old UNK for instance UNK
mm
is has been celebrated er more recently in scotland and i think quite successfully
liz you're a you've been UNK queen
now i don't know how many of you are familiar with UNK so
no
assume that none of us is and er what happens at a UNK
well
night
it's certainly erm well attended there's you know thousands of people attend and basically it centres around erm a fire UNK means erm sacred fire and erm a UNK of UNK leads me to top of a path and along UNK carlton hill and erm fire UNK are lit around me and i UNK ha have this great costume that i UNK in and erm process round the hill and round hill are different UNK erm painted in different colours to represent different elements of nature and finally we come to this big fire where which i light with hands which have been UNK and UNK are given to the people to eat and erm the tradition that you're supposed to cross the fire as a sort of a erm UNK ceremony or through the UNK of the fire
and you as the UNK queen are the you know so the focus of this or one of the main focal figures yes
yes
that's taken i it refers to UNK that have happened in the past i mean we've invented our own UNK as well but based on the may queen figure
so that that's why i'm sort of representing mother earth
mhm
so it's an UNK festival
yes
i think i think the reason why it's women are erm somewhat cautious about talking about these
mhm
essentially sacred times
mhm
is the knowledge that if er we'd been talking about them two hundred and fifty years ago we'd be put on trial and probably burnt to death
well there's a grand old scottish tradition burning UNK
and er it's not one that's er that's currently UNK but it's not all that long ago in folk memory that women in their particularly women who had practices and UNK were seen as UNK
do does that
mm
is that what's making you all UNK up about the potential for women's traditions
are you keeping yourselves to yourselves
yes
erm well i've talked a erm about women's traditions in the sense of singing and celebrating
mhm
and so on but what about working traditions in
mhm
scotland
you know when i was bringing up my children in the early seventies i read about the UNK of the new working woman you know how to balance a career and a home and children and i couldn't for the life of me think what was new about this working woman
because the women in my family and most families in scotland had always gone out to work
erm this was in fact something you know coming from i think the feminist movement and very much a it was quite new for middle class women to go out and work and you know they are now UNK that they're you know having to UNK all these things but these were traditions that had in fact been handed down
where i come from erm most of the fish the fishing part of the community up until just two three years ago we had a tradition of women's working practices which were handed down for hundreds of years from the female side
now most people think that you were a fish wife because you were married to a UNK that had nothing to do with it
you were a fish wife because your mother or your granny or your auntie was a fish wife
it was in fact a closed shop and those working practices and skills were handed down from mother to daughter
i actually became interested not so much in the women locally but my o my own grandmother UNK was a herring UNK from UNK i never knew her i have one photograph of her taken with her two children and when my children were small i used to look at this and think how did she get away for weeks to work and follow the boats
mm
when i can't get the ho out the house for an afternoon
mm
now there's a tradition
there is no job that women today where they go away together and work
and i think the practise of women working in a group like that and supporting each other has long gone
in UNK th the women were economically independent they had flexible working hours
mhm
they organized their own child care practices all the things that women say they're fighting for today has actually been done before and done very successfully
these women gave all their money they ha they made till the day they were married they handed it over to their mothers
once they got married they never told their husbands how much they earned ever
now that's what you call UNK women
definitely
and i think it's a pity we don't carry it
today
yep
yep
erm in aberdeen we had our first woman's festival in nineteen ninety and we're ready to have our second festival in nineteen ninety two
mhm
up there
yes
yes
ah women's tradition that eh seems to have grown up in the workplace or maybe it's it er UNK outside the workplace originally is er when a bride gets dressed up we must all be familiar with that er when she's going to get married and carries a UNK round about to make a collection
i'm not su i'm sure i don't know what it's called i'm ashamed to say
but er that's definitely a woman's tradition men don't do it
but they do other things
well they UNK in aberdeen don't they
they chase the
potential groom around and cover him in UNK
yes
i would just like to say that women from the ethnic UNK i'm talking about our community and they've have children that have been born and brought up over here we have double trouble cos we celebrate christmas new year easter and then we UNK our own traditions and have o all our own UNK as well
but you say double trouble but i mean that's isn't that good because you're bringing more traditions in
do you find tha that you're bringing traditions to people
well yes because in the schools now they've started erm some of the schools have taken up celebration UNK which is coming up in november and erm they celebrate some of the other UNK as well
yes
we say that er women's lives have changed and the working patterns have changed because
mhm
we are more in the forefront
we can be managers now
mhm
erm and i wonder if our traditions have disappeared because we have had to adapt to working lives and changes in lives and i wonder if men have held onto theirs in the face of women being a threat to them in working environments and other aspects of their life
we've UNK into their pubs you know
how far are women gonna go
are we really gonna take over the burns UNK now
esther
erm th i'd like to make a couple of points about traditions women's traditions one is particularly looking at th the oral tradition o the tradition of poetry in scotland and there's a very rich tradition of gaelic poetry and UNK singing as
mhm
as has been mentioned which has been something that often has been composed by women and UNK by women and there's recently been an UNK published of scottish UNK poetry i think that's a tradition and is perhaps related to second point the fact that the UNK only just becoming available to us
mhm
that part of th of the issue i think about us perhaps feeling that we don't have traditions th is that we are still UNK our own history and i think a lot of traditions grow out of historical events or historical UNK
there is a rich erm history of women in scotland and we're only just beginning to discover that and publish that and i think that we will establish traditions by doing that
well we're go we're going to a close so let me finally ask you yo thi this i if you wanted to UNK one scottish tradition either an old one or a new one wha what would it be
what would you like to be er a scottish tradition which at the moment is perhaps fallen away
yes
up there
just UNK
sorry
UNK in the house
when yo people just gather informally and friends and neighbours and you make music and you sing songs you tell stories play instruments do what you like eat drink talk
well i haven't said her heard anybody say anything about the grand old tradition of switching on the television set and i've a horrible feeling that er that th that the one day in the year when people want to get together with their families probably means switching off the television set
so i'm very grateful to you for sticking with us and getting away from your traditions for this half hour
thanks to all of you for sharing your views
goodbye
who told you the facts of life
did they tell you the truth
or are you still working it out for yourself
sex education used to be UNK and UNK about today we're more enlightened or are we
exactly what should be taught to whom by whom and when still UNK heated debate
so we thought we'd find out what young people want to know and what they think of the education they've had
after all this hundred young women have all benefited from the open healthy society that's developed over the last few decades or have they
let's start with a question
have you had formal sex education
button one for yes and button two for no
and in this hundred UNK twenty two people say no
seventy eight said yes
let's start with the UNK wha what was it the formal sex education you seventy eight
what have you had and where
sex in section six in a biology class about plants
flowers and that
that
was it
that was it
yeah
plants and flowers
yeah
didn't you even got on to UNK and rabbits
no
flowers
what about so
and that's all anybody got was section six this UNK section six which we were taught at the end of the year
and that's all anybody got in my school
how about humans
no
no just about plants
seriously
yeah
beside you
yeah we had erm a class an actual sex education class every week for a year
our biology teacher took it but it was it was also so it was the facts about erm sex abortion contraception but we also talked about the emotional side of things
so would you say it was quite good
yeah it was quite
i mean of course there were things that were missed out i suppose but also i suppose we were quite young so it may have quite embarrassing and we didn't want talk about certain things
was that the case or
round about twelve or thirteen i suppose they kind of
do you think you were too young to talk about the th the emotional side
yeah
of it
probably because most of us weren't really well quite a few of us anyway weren't thinking about sex at that time so i suppose it was kind of you know you just started
your periods and everything and you
yeah
you're not exactly thinking about sex
okay so two not absolutely satisfactory er experiences there
has any do has anybody had formal sex education of those seventy eight who that it was very we it was well taught that it was good
and you got a yes
erm sex education at school was
mm
similar to well the girl mentioned earlier on that since then i've had within the last couple of years
mm
erm i do voluntary work for the brook advisory er through the peer UNK and that has been very erm beneficial for myself and for the work that er we do with
what
youths
wha what is that
i mean te tell me tell us more about that
well we go to youth clubs or schools and talk to youths from eight to eighteen about contraception erm drugs and other topics of concern abortion UNK things like that
what do you think of that
i mean i don't know what do yo what do you think sex education should be
is it is it important at all
it wasn't it wasn't much of a subject when i was young is it is it a necessary part of the school curriculum
is it something that should be taught at home
what do you think
i mean wha those of you who have children wha what do you what do you hope for them
yes
i think it's very important
it's important people know the real facts about it instead a lot of this playground UNK
i also think it's important that people have this sort of emotional side of it taught to them as well you're often taught like the straight you know the wee sperm and the wee egg come together and you get a baby but you don't not taught about the emotional side of it a lot
mhm
of the time i think that's really important
is it possible to teach that
yes i think it is
i think it should be done a lot younger as well
primary age
yeah primary i think roundabout primary four or five cos that's when they start talking about it and that's where you start getting all the wrong things told to you in the playground i mean i know that's what happened to me
really
so i mean so wha when i mean how old when you found out and who told you
oh
i was about i dunno about primary four age and someone in the playground i think it was can't remember exactly what i was told obviously but it was something silly you know like
really dirty and everything which
yeah
it isn't
yeah
it's not a dirty thing
yep
yes
yes
there
oh erm i just want to say how can a four or five year old er understand the concepts and the emotions involved in sexual relationships
well they don't have to know
if it's just erm
exactly what it is but th we should be told that it's not a dirty thing it's not a bad thing
you know what i mean
at th a lot of people are just told that it's so dirty which is isn't and i
mm
just think should you should get across that it isn't dirty
mhm
isn't it but you don't you think that's more so for females than it is for males the fact that it is such a dirty thing that applies more to females than it does to males
i think it applies to both sexes
can you avoid the kind of dirty UNK aspect though
i mean is it possible to have a holy healthy attitude to sex
i think erm we could have a much UNK aspect to it if it was taught to u in a UNK way i mean
mm
so many of the teachers that teach it are far too embarrassed to UNK the subject sensibly you know and they just pass it on and so kids don't treat it sensibly
i feel we're expecting
but don't you
an awful lot from teachers you know we're just expecting that they know everything about sex education
i feel that teachers must be educated if they can education us
yeah
any other views
yes
that last point you were saying about you know UNK and laughing about it i think that that's a part of it i mean sex can be fun
mhm
so what's wrong with er it shouldn't be dealt with in a like a really serious way it should be fun for everybody and what's wrong with having a laugh about it as well
what about home
i mean er i wonder in fact i mi i might as you this question have you discussed er sex with your parents
button one for yes and button two for no
and in this hundred sixty one yes thirty nine no
does do those votes surprise you
do you think er yes
i think that everyone seems to pass the UNK i mean the parents think oh they'll learn it at school and the teachers think oh co they should be learning it from their parents and yo you never learn it from anyone just from your friends
yes
i think erm sexuality begins with UNK and therefore it should begin in the home and it should be exaggerated at school i mean it should helped but fundamentally it's with your parents or UNK whoever who should begin it
is that your experience
yeah i mean i'm very lucky because my parents are very liberal and i mean they discussed sex with me quite early on and i've never had a problem discussing it with them
but that's not the case with everyone er i mean un unfortunately i wish it was
yes
yeah that i is precisely it isn't the case with everyone i mean i think that what the girl was saying up there about the groups going round it's a great idea
it was the same in the biology teacher at our school it was very UNK and very embarrassed
mm
i think if you got maybe a twenty five year old who came to your school for a week and got you in a small group and talked about it would be great on a one to one basis
mhm
erm a my mother didn't speak to me about sex until i was pregnant
you know which i wa i wasn't totally embarrassed about it but i just we i think she was you know that sort of generation and that era which i hope with my son it will be totally different like come to me and say anything you like you know
yeah
i'm a liberal parent
yes
yeah there's probably two points i would want to say one is that what about the children and young people tha that refuse to go to school
and where's the education for them
i think the other one about the woman across there said about should start at home with UNK and stuff and many of the young women that i work wi i've heard very negative experiences of sex
mhm
through sexual abuse and i think we spend a lot of our time and i think even for teachers we spend a lot of our time UNK a lot of the damage of helping young people undo a lot of damage that's done by sex
i don't think they view it as a dead happy enjoyable fun thing and it's something that they do if you say is really serious and
mm
something that is nay er positive for them
it doesn't matter i mean where or whom you've been told by as long as you've been told you can take precautions later in life from sexual diseases and getting yourself pregnant
mhm
what comes into sex education
i mean th tha that's interesting what you said because you said how to avoid sexual diseases and to er avoid getting pregnant are those the basics of sex education or what more would put onto the list of things that you would teach
yes
i think when somebody teaches it they teach it in the premise that everybody they're talking to is heterosexual
what about people that are UNK
what about like contraception should be integral part of it and abortion and the options open to you but i think it's very important that we are taught it we're taught it in a heterosexual basis and that's just not the case and that just UNK people any more really more from a very early age
mhm
i'm still doing sex education at schools and look like it's changing a lot cos there's a lot more to do there a lot more emphasis on aids that's why they've got to UNK teach kids in primary school we've got to prevent them from getting a disease
mhm
i was gonna say about sex education that when i was learning at school it's also very male dominated erm it was i mean you were talking about erm what's i li the differences between males and females learning about sex education and wha and we were learnt about the man having pleasure we were taught about the man having the UNK and the man having the UNK i mean we didn't even know what a UNK was
th i mean i've never even heard of the term UNK and a friend of mine thought her UNK was actually her UNK i mean it just got
the whole the thing just got completely confused
and that's when
but do you think it's appropriate to teach sex in that kind of detail to school children
erm
to UNK to teach pe school children about sexual pleasure for instance er rather than the biological facts of reproduction
i think it's part and parcel of sex and so yes i do think it is very important and i think it is a process that does have to have to be started very young and is on going throughout our education
now i would guess that goes further that most school UNK
i mean has anyone learnt about sexual pleasure at er at school
or about er the male and female UNK
well obviously you learn about the male UNK because that's what creates a baby but i think she was right the female UNK is never mentioned but it's there
or should be
ha
yep
i think it's very important that er females should be taught that it's UNK for them as well you
mm
haven't just to literally lie back there and the man says what happens when it happens and they're to do as they're told sort of thing because that obviously UNK sexual abuse women being raped and attitudes that lead towards these things
it's very important you're taught that er such feelings as respect love emotions all come into this and a woman has a right to say no if she doesn't
yeah
want this and it's not up to a man to decide what happens
but it seems that isn't what's being taught and therefore in information about that comes well either via your own experience or talking with friends or reading UNK magazines or i mean whe where do we actually get our education from
learn through
like you said
more through magazines than i did at school because in school i was taught nothing about pleasure it was all very biological with a diagram of the male and the female exactly what happened there was nothing about er sexually UNK diseases pleasure or abortion contraception nothing mentioned only the mere basics
now normally in this programme when we talk about UNK magazines people are UNK against them because they carry various advertisements that they find offensive or UNK but are women's magazines actually erm performing quite a useful job by filling in the gaps that schools and parents are failing to address
what do you think
any yes
i think they're a very dangerous mode of education because they provide a very stereo typed image of everything everybody that they're talking about if they're talking about sex they presume to be able UNK they're UNK to be white generally they're UNK to be heterosexual if they're talking about UNK then it's definitely male UNK
mhm
never come into it
i'm sorry but i think these must be in the wrong magazines
the magazines that are out today are very informative of where you can get the addresses of places to go they give both sides of UNK you know male and female as far i've seen and definitely in the past two years or so
now is that our best hope is the commercial provision of UNK magazine is the best hope we have for getting in any information we want
i mean in an ideal world what wha what agenda would you draw up
i don't think it's necessarily about teaching er children primarily about sex or about sexual pleasure i think it's all initially about personal hygiene and then developing that into how they can make their life safer for UNK or giving them choices to say well i can choose to become pregnant or not to become pregnant and i think it's more about choices rather than saying UNK and erm sexual pleasure or
mm
telling youngsters when they can't actually understand the concept of having sex
mm
yes
i think if erm perhaps if television did something more about it you'd be able to erm home in on the people who are excluded erm people who are outside school situations people
mhm
who don't actually go to school
erm looking at certain problems a lot of erm young women who get pregnant don't get pregnant at school they get pregnant as soon as they leave school
mhm
erm in say an area a deprived area it's very often hard for women to get access to information
basically there's a comparison of figures that erm one pregnancy in every two hundred and fifty six in UNK is to women under twenty yet one in four in an area like UNK is to women under twenty so there's a big sort of difference
and you need to access you need to key in to certain areas as well so television could be the ideal way to do that
but it's not doing it at the moment although there's
well no it certainly doesn't seem to be with one in four girls getting pregnant
well people generally complain about sex on television so the way it's being presented
up there
you often find that erm television with sex and everything they always put it on after a certain time for children go to bed
it's like aids and that like the glue UNK advert for instance put on fo when the children go to bed but they should be able to see that sho they should be able to see look well that's putting a message across to me as well not just the parents to me i'm the one that's involved and i think that if well maybe the producers would maybe or the people that do television would maybe put i to say seven o'clock or that where young children primary school age can actually sit and watch it
i think if you got taught sex education in maybe smaller groups you know erm if they could with individual teachers
mhm
er they you know were people that you trust and that you could ask questions that you wouldn't be embarrassed
mhm
that'd help a lot
yes
erm i think if they were more honest and open i mean like parents and schools and stuff it wouldn't be so difficult for people to talk about it and there wouldn't be as many the jokes about it
if everybody spoke about the communication was better then it'd be a lot easier for people that deal with it
yeah
beside you
i think it's just our culture as well
mm
that influences our opinions on it you know
and i think it's really important that sex education in schools should be taught by somebody that the pupils can relate to
cos i know when i was at school we actually got our sex education in fourth year and it was by a visiting lecturer it was this wee old man about fifty he said basically this is a male body this is a female body nothing about sexuality UNK anything
it was terrible
so i
aha
think that's really important
i'm going back to the thing about erm and boys and
mhm
today in school we had a two members of a family planning association and er we were in group and we actually had the guys in our class they're seventeen maybe eighteen sitting laughing and UNK between themselves
and that's at that age
and i would say in our school we've had the aids team in and we've talked quite a lot about sex education and they're still UNK
they're still having their jokes between
mm
themselves
mm
and whatever
i don't think we're ever gonna get away from that
why do you think that is
it's i don't know what it was er they hardly we were having a discussion with the doctor erm none of them would put forward their opinions or their views or what they thought
no
we're talking about abortion who's responsibility it was erm they just were nay prepared to put forward their opinions
is that your common experience that young men aren't really up to this
yeah
no
i work for the same pre project as UNK and i worked with five fifteen sixteen year old boys just yesterday and they were one of the best groups i'd ever worked with because
mhm
they were interested
and it was contraception which as you all know is predominantly female and they were interested like what their partners would use what they will use and it was wonderful
i couldn't believe because i always thought that it was the guys that UNK the guys that weren't interested
mm
and through past experience it is changing
was it a mixed group or er
no
no we had five sa boys no mixed
do you think ma do you think maybe that's one of the answers to separate the sexes for these discussions or
no i think maybe if the girls had been in they might have been a bit UNK and felt you know oh we have to act you know the lads
yeah
you know so maybe but
yes
i think the guys UNK because they're covering up for their embarrassment that's
mm
their way of breaking the ice and showing that they just they that's way of coping with it
i think that they may be frightened to speak up and that they're scared that if they say something that they don't know like a lot of them don't know the facts like today in the same class as UNK across there some of them didn't know even the very the pro progression of the male pill or anything like that and they did learn a few things but a again they never spoke up and they weren't interested but i
mm
think it was because of embarrassment
yeah
up there
i think you know i think in answer to the embarrassment question i think although it is about that erm people are nay do people wi on just are nay prepared to commit with information i think in areas there's a wealth of information and experience
mm
and people who are prepared to discuss the issue but they just don't come out the door to where erm the people are that need the information
i
mm
think there has to be a er family planning centres have to more on the street i think family planning UNK have got the people there who are able to go out on the street
i think the other issue is that we have to be defending erm the family planning centres that are being closed down like the forty or fifty in glasgow the thirteen in er edinburgh th the east of scotland
mhm
and i think that is just gonna create you know a bigger ignorance amongst young people erm you know a bigger ignorance about contraception itself
mhm
which again there is nay a hundred percent safe contraception
mhm
to prevent pregnancy or any other disease for that matter
and i think that's something
that we're gonna have to start er defending you know because we er we have got a wealth of experience and information it just has to be shared
you're not suggesting UNK a disease there are you
for some of us aye yeah
a
it is a disease
in holland er young teenagers are taught in school how to how to use UNK now i don't know whether that's taught in schools or classes in scotland i is it
it should be
has anyone i mean has anyone had that experience
yes
well i got a video and like that's all we got a few videos and the video showed you how to use a UNK and that was it
and that was at school
yeah
but that's probably more than a lot of people did and everyone's being UNK to use UNK but how many people are actually given any instruction on how to use them
yes
well yesterday we actually went to a school and you show them how to use with a UNK and allow them to touch the UNK and in youth clubs you allow them to do practically anything with them as long as they're returned they can blow them up or they can
yeah
shoot them across the room or whatever
but i think all the UNK is all part of actually UNK to the UNK and something to do with the embarrassment that because they don't know enough about it they don't want to be er seen to be silly
mm
so they put up a front and
mm
i think it's all part of it that they will be silly initially but they'll som soon co er come to realize that it's sensible
mhm
in a in our school we were shown by our guidance teacher how to put a UNK and he used a UNK
so that just shows you that can happen
and we it was fourth year when we done it and we'd never been shown anything like that and it was interesting because it's the sort of fact that you never really think about
mhm
until yo you're actually gonna do it sort of thing which i thought it was interesting
do you think er as young women you have a right on behalf perhaps of women ten years younger than you to suggest changes in what's happening now
you're obviously in and the other people in the in the brook are er advisory peer groups are doing work people are suggesting they think that should be extended what more might be done
UNK
i think it erm it possibly could be UNK and actually funded
i was wondering if erm the girl at the back was actually a volunteer or if she was in fact paid for her work
because i do know of various different groups who are working in this field as volunteers there's no money behind them there and i mean i it should be a priority it should be given that kind of priority where
mhm
funds are made for it
mhm
voluntary
it is voluntary
yeah
i mean yes
can i just say that about the age thing again erm i also do with the brook peer group
right
and erm i went to a youth club and i was speaking to eight year olds and they're asking about UNK cos they've seen them in the street so it's obviously they're wanting to find out about it cos it's everywhere around them even doesn't matter what age
and what will you tell an eight year old
erm well we let them and again we brought out the UNK and we let them touch UNK erm do anything they wanted with them as long as we got them back
but they're fi they're going to find about it cos it's everywhere
i think one of the main points is not so much the way it's taught but who teaches it
because going back to the point earlier on erm when i was taught i say it was a local nurse from th er the clinic that taught us i mean i've UNK nothing against elder women in their fifties and whatever but i mean there again one it shouldn't always be females who teach about sex it should be males and it should be younger people to relate
mhm
to because one of the main points about the embarrassing er aspect mainly boys UNK and UNK whatever maybe some girls do but it's mainly er males i think a point to be made there is it is a well known fact that boys took longer to mature emotionally than girls and i think if it was a guy a younger guy maybe in his late twenties early thirties teaching it and if he had the sort of UNK to turn round and the UNK to say look son what is it you're laughing at what's so funny
i mean
mm
you're seventeen years old if you're old enough to have sex surely you're old enough to you know think about it in a mature way
and it would ta take someone like that just to make them think yeah well you know what is so funny in get rid of this sort of stigma about boys being UNK
i also work for the peer group for the brook
mhm
and er we have two boys that do it with us as well and when they come out to youth clubs with us the girls and the boys that we go and speak to love having a male there
mhm
that they can go and the boys have a good laugh with them and the girls have a good laugh as well and it seems to work
a any UNK thoughts on er on the future for sex education in scotland
i'd agree that it's important
yeah
that people can make their o they have a balanced education which allows them then to make their own choices about that things aren't over i mean if we've lived in a UNK society in which men are in power and that UNK and male sexuality maybe has come through more in sex education those have been the issues that have been co ha have been given more importance and female issues have maybe been UNK a little bit and now erm with aids as a problem we don't want to turn out and suddenly become really UNK or really you know right UNK it has to be you know you need to kind of keep the balance so that people are given the information and then have the freedom to make the choice themselves
i think they should get rid of the stigma in UNK cos what UNK me is that in about ten years time my daughter will come and maybe ask if she can go on the pill and at least i can tell her no use a UNK there's less chance of sexually UNK diseases but it's my sons they won't come and ask
yes
i think the problem is that at the moment sex education is so arbitrary and it varies from school to school and from house to house i think they have to make it like a core part of the curriculum make it compulsory and make it uniform throughout the country so everybody's getting the same education the same quality i think that'll help
lots of good ideas
thank you very much for discussing this and opening up watch what is too often a taboo area
i hope you found it interesting
i have
and thanks for joining us
goodbye
you need help but who cares
and who gives a damn about the people who do care
let's find out
maybe we should start by defining what a carer is
a carer i suggest is someone with responsibility for a child or an old person or someone with a handicap or a UNK illness
there are professional carers as well of course who are paid to care for other people but this discussion is probably going to concentrate on the problems of home carers
now why did i say problems
isn't caring a UNK occupation
well perhaps
and a hundred women will share their views and experiences in a moment
but let me offer you one figure to consider one third of the population in scotland is either over sixty five or under eleven or is UNK disabled how much care will they need
how much care will they get
and who's going to give it
it's a challenge that's been talked about all over world but who's going to respond and how
let's talk
let's start with a vote
are you or have you been a carer
button one for yes and button two for no
and there's a hundred here sixty five have been or are thirty five a third not or possibly i should say not yet
now of those sixty five who would like to say something about their experience whether it's present or past
what are you talking about
yes
ten years ago i had four dependent relatives i took both my parents and parents in law into the one house the fathers are now both dead and i still have both the mothers
are you working as well
er i run a voluntary help line for other carers and i've got sixteen hundred and fifty carers on file right across scotland
did you set up this help line yourself
i did yes
when
erm about five years ago nineteen eighty six because there was just nothing
i mean i knew from my own experience that carers were not getting the help they were not getting the back up so any sort of really good telephone numbers i had laid my hands on got sort of written away in a wee book and i was lucky enough to come across an association that actually backed up carers and actually were willing to sort of put their life on the line and say to me yes you have got rights and you need support and we are here to give you that support
do you think things are better now than they were five years ago when you started your help line
well for me yes because erm there are now things like the independent living fund things like that if people fit into the right boxes and contact the right people then they can get some sort of help but i mean it's still an absolute UNK out there for anybody who doesn't have that sort of back up
okay there's one experience we'll come back
who else
where who are the other sixty five
what's your experience
yep
i was involved in setting up a charity called UNK which is a special needs information point for parents and carers of children with special needs to get more information out to them about benefits or help in any way
would er th er over here it was described as a er it's still a UNK out there if you don't know where you're going would you agree
i would agree er that it's strange er once you start something i mean people come up and say well we've got a whole information bank here and other people have a whole information bank there and yet the ability of people who are caring for adults or children to get out run round forty agencies and come home loaded with leaflets pushing three children and a parent you know is quite difficult
and we found that er UNK
this is why phone works
in the sick UNK which we do
mhm
is ideal it's easy and it has to be much more available to people
so is the support there
is it the communication system that isn't quite working but the support is adequate if you can simply find it
yes
i've been a carer for quite a few years now until recently when my grandmother died
now she had UNK now the hospital helped a lot in the caring but i didn't have time or the energy ha frankly
mm
to go running around looking for help
i have looked after my husband for seven years he had a brain tumour operation nearly eight years ago and he's in a wheelchair he can't walk but his after the first two years of caring for him he's become bright enough to do the daily telegraph UNK and so he's er erm UNK alright
well i did it alone just with the help of crossroads and the district nurse in the mornings five days a week and really that is all the help i had except that i get domestic staff myself and any help that i need i have to pay for
the doctor my own doctor has been very good and very kind and helpful but er i know of no other support group other than crossroads who help people like me
and it is a day and night job
and my husband although i'm only very small and under five foot my husband is thirteen stone and six foot two inches so moving him about has been a great problem
well i'm a carer by choice
a friend came eight years ago for his tea he's still here
he's multiple in disability but we get help in UNK from salvation army who take him during the day UNK club where i go with him at night and the hospital UNK now who take him for UNK social and everything
now plenty of people are carers by choice and people want to look after the people who need care in their family but th i it's a problem isn't it
i mean what are wha what are the pro inevitable problems that go with being a carer by choice
first of all you can't work full time even if you want
i do
to
and what
i do work full time i'm a community worker
but i have a need i had a need cos and he fills that need cos i didn't have a parents and fills my need
he gives back a lot more than we give him
yes
down here
i think when you're a carer caring for a disabled person in my own case it's child you're not just erm it's not just a disabled child you've got a disabled family because the whole family's disabled because of what holds you back with this one child
i'm a carer through choice er i took both my parents to live with me erm when they no longer could cope on their own and it totally changes your life
yep
i took my parents when i my son was two and a half and i can honestly say that my son i wasn't able to UNK as much time as i would have wanted to give
you've not only you're not only yourself but you've got UNK your child to look after you've also got who you're caring for you've got their emotional needs as well and you're emotional needs tend to take a back seat for want of a better way of putting it
it totally changes
so did anybody else have that experience of caring for children and parents or parents in law at the same time
yes
er i had to care for my elderly parents when my son was two and a half and i had a six month old baby and er i would agree with the previous speaker it certainly does change your life
my memory of those days was being tired all the time UNK up tired going through the day tired going to bed tired
i would say the thing that kept me UNK during that period was the fact that i had a part time job and erm we were able to pay for some home help
now this situation is multiplied thousands of times all over scotland
plenty of people are in this situation
of course we're all women here tonight th there are men carers as well but would it be fair to say that the bulk of care responsibility falls on women or is that is that unfair
yes
yes i would think that would be true because i think the woman is more intelligent and more capable of coping
with er you know the problem
and i think what's getting to me tonight they're all saying it's a problem and it's tired i mean so is life
mm
it's part of life
you know i UNK for my father who was disabled and i mean it was nay till i was much older oh he is disabled
he was my father
he was you know nothing wrong with him till somebody said oh it's got a disability
oh and you start thinking what is disability
you've still got to get on with life
and i had five sons a disabled father according to the media and er i got on with it
it is part of life but er wha sa so is death and so is schooling and so is education and all these issues are social issues they are only problems when there aren't the resources to help support people who need support
now the community care legislation says that carers now have a right to ask for their needs to be assessed i think that's very important
many carers i have heard say time and time again that they feel guilty even asking they didn't even know they had a right to ask well this legislation now allows people to ask doesn't mean to say their needs are gonna be met but at least it gives them a right to ask
it says that they have a right to have their own needs assessed the wishes of the family and other carers erm have to be taken into account carers have to be involved in drawing up local plans
mhm
for services information has to be made available so that you know what sort of services are available erm on which to base a judgement about what so what sort of erm services you would like
do you think it's working
the legislation i mean do you think th this sounds like an improvement
er do you do you think it is
well it sounds like an improvement but without the financial commitment and the political will then i'm afraid that the erm the UNK and the principles will all for nought
at the moment the evidence is that the sort of money that's being put into developing new services is very tiny five million pounds towards the specific mental illness grant which actually isn't new money but top slice from local authority money and then erm directed
mm
particularly for mental illness and UNK services
wo it's less than the price of a cup of tea
can i just say that my father who is eighty four is caring for my mother er for the past eleven years and we keep sort of saying well is it not time that she should maybe go into hospital
that's we as the family
mm
but dad's attitude is your mother's looked after me all these years it's my turn
which i think's lovely
UNK
well i work for the organization crossroads and i think what i find in my contacts with carers is that they need help in the way and when they need it however our organization is restricted by lack of funding
mhm
because obviously we can only help them when we have space
now crossroads helps carers it gives it gives
yes
UNK or relief to carers is that right
crossroads exists to relieve carers on a very short term basis
yeah
it can be weekly UNK monthly or just occasionally on request but quite often we are finding that a person who's assessed as needing help weekly but all that we have got is UNK and all of the time there are clients waiting for us to up the amount of help that we're giving to them and very much it needs to be when it benefits them and when it fits in with their lives
mm
the lady who founded the UNK help line er in the literature that you provided for the programme was suggesting that the government should recognise that there are six million UNK carers
i believe that the government do recognise that there are six million UNK carers er i believe that the government depend very heavily upon these six million people and i do not believe that the government intend to reward them
mhm
erm th i think it's the government's ideal to promote the role of the extended family which to me is UNK in the nineteen nineties
if we look at the look at the role that women play in our society today they have a very heavy burden already placed
mhm
upon them
they're very often er a worker they're a wife and they're a mother and all that contains er the basics the shopping the cleaning the cooking the decorating they cut the lawn they wash the cars they pay the household accounts
if we go back socially to the days of the extended family women did not have to play that role in those days a women a woman's place was very much in the home looking after the home and not much else
and quite frankly i think that women these days have very little time in which to UNK themselves in their own hobbies and interests and i think women should stand up and say to the government no you will not UNK this responsibility upon us
there
certainly i'd very much like to agree with what that lady said
i work for nupe and three
mhm
out of four of our members er are women and many of them are both the paid carers the home helps the care assistants and so on but also then go home to look after the young or the er elderly relatives or disabled and so on and as well as seeing wanting to see far more support in the community
mm
for people who are caring for their family we've also said that employers should recognise that people should be able to get erm some kind of leave occasionally from their work er perhaps ten days a year when they find the person they're looking after is sick
all too often women say to me basically they've had to UNK a sick line themselves because their mother or their father
mm
was ill but there was no official way they could contact their employer and say i need the day off because i need to sort something
there
out
we've not only got to say to the government that you're not coping you've got to say if you're a mother a worker and a wife you've got to say to your husband look i'm not coping
you can't e expect a body to cope with everything in your life
you say to your husband help me
and they should relieve you of it
i do well do husbands help
i mean i was interested a couple of the people who were speaking earlier margaret and in fact th the two UNK who both said i look after neither of you said we look after
now i don't know whether that's because i in your house there isn't a husband or a partner or whether it didn't occur to you to say we whether you always think of it as i or whether he's out winning bread or you know wha whatever it is but
well
are do men do men take the UNK a apart from this fabulous
yes
er father of yours who's looking after er
erm
you mother
i couldn't have done it without the help my husband gave
yeah
me
i mean my husband has even at one point had to come into the bathroom when i got my mother stuck in the bath er couldn't get her out it was it was him or the fire brigade tha that was the choice basically
erm i'm not saying he was truly happy about having i think he was quite embarrassed for my mother
but no my husband has helped an awful lot i couldn't have done it without him
then what's your up there
yes
i UNK my mother who was blind and bed UNK for four years before her death
now my husband was a wonderful support to me during that time
and i was sort of UNK i didn't realize how much i was doing until one day shortly after mother's death a lady stopped me and she said has something happened to your mother
and i said yes she died
she said i thought so it's the first time i've seen you walking instead of running
mm
mm
and that i was my UNK during the time mother was ill my husband took ill now this is where authorities don't give you any back up instead of sending him to hospital which was fifteen minutes by bus i could have visited him every day they sent him to the other side of the county which only allowed a visit once a week and meant i had to leave at twelve o'clock and get home at six
mhm
now no nothing was done
the worse word you can say to authority is i can cope because they leave you to cope
down here
my husband he was very good but he didn't take any care with my grandmother but he was extremely good about the house
he looked after michael my young son he did UNK he even makes now a good pot of soup he done better than i do
but he took over most of the UNK whereas i was looking after my grandmother
i mean without him in the back i wouldn't have been able to do it but i always tell everybody i was the carer
yes
up there
we're still talking about men helping us instead of expecting them to do it automatically
are we
i think we are at the moment yes
is that is that your experience
yes i mean i have a very helpful husband but he's helping he sees him himself as helping me rather than doing his share of it without having to ask what help i need
now that's an interesting distinction
do you think that's right
mhm
aha
mhm
yeah
at the same time men usually have got full time jobs as well
well i meant
i mean if they're working full time
and they are helping with the children in the house i mean they can't do much more
well i'm working full time too
i think they can
so
i work as well
mhm
i think erm i don't men take a lot of responsibility
i mean i don't want to er UNK my partner here but erm i mean he does his share but he doesn't do his full share
erm i think that erm men don't like to take on women's work because it's erm
ooh
ooh
the hours are too long the hours are too long and the wages are really bad th really bad
so that's er the women's work is work that is the hours are too long and the wages are really bad
yes
that's your definition
well i mean who'd want to take that on you know
i mean
it's UNK
well okay it's
and invisible
it's badly paid yeah alright it's invisible
yeah
for
they don't take it on take it on full time
up there
mm
it actually takes the two of you to pull
i've been listening UNK to them talking about carers now since time began women have always been carers
i mean when you get up and i believe that it's a children's duty to look after their parents
i looked after my mother i was the youngest of our family and i didn't consider that i was doing something unusual it was my duty
mhm
and that is why th with the government talking about and they're talking about authority why should they be looking for money from anywhere when after all the youth of today are the pensioners to of tomorrow and it's only our duty to look after them
mhm
i would have to say that social conditions have changed a great deal today going back to what the first
mhm
on my left said earlier and wo women have a tendency to say yes to everything that they can do just because they can do it and they know they can but they tend to heap up far too many obligations and that causes many carers
mm
er to UNK to health problems UNK er emotional problems and so on
hazel
my er circumstances are entirely different i am the person who's being cared for and my husband died in nineteen eighty seven and my son in nineteen eighty eight and i was left with my young son and he looked after me on his own and then my daughter who li i was living in ireland my daughter lived in england and she decided it wasn't good enough that it should all be left to him so we had a long talk and we discussed it at length for two weeks at christmas and then they all moved UNK over here we got a house in scotland and i'm looked after by my young son and my daughter and since then a year ago my daughter got married her husband moved in and he looks after me as well so i'm looked after by three young adults
i wonder how many of you are now or expect to need care
button one for yes and button two for no
it may take a bit of imagination for some of the some of you but what do you think
do you think you're going to need care
and it's something you might think about as well sitting at home do you think you're going to need care in due course and if so where's it going to come from
and er where's the money gonna come from
and who's going to look after your carers
fifty four of the people here think they're going to need care forty six are going to UNK it out independently to the end
erm very briefly the fifty four of you who's gonna care for you do you think
i've got a young son
yep
he's erm twenty three at the moment i've got arthritis sometimes i'm in a wheelchair sometimes i'm alright and he says don't worry mum i'm there to push you around and i'm quite heavy
yes
i on picking up on one thing that was said
mhm
earlier that the hardship i mean i it's okay for some people who have the money and will not feel
mm
the hardship
i know er a gentlemen like yourself who's looked after by his young son by a younger son anyway and he he's given up his work to look after his father
well in fact eighty percent of full time carers give up work to
but
look after whoever it is they're looking after
we were hearing from jenny about the government but we must look into other parties i mean there's a general election going to be coming off soon we as carers should be looking into who is going to benefit us
but it's not just we as carers or your as carers
no
it's anybody who cares sufficiently about
it's anybody who needs help
yes
i'm an ex carer and i looked after my aunt for three and a half years and could i say that it's not all negative although it times you could scream
really
i mean at times yo i can looking back now i can say that i learnt a lot
well i sa i mean i took her on to look after her and i didn't think there would any problem
mm
about it but after a while ah i you know things got more difficult as she deteriorated but th i did learn a lot
mm
and now i almost felt empty when she died and i didn't have anybody to care for that really needed me all the time so i wanted to help out at a local UNK centre to try and make up for it and to pass on
i think that's
what i've learnt
i think that's a very good er point
mm
and i mean i think we've heard earlier a lot o people who people who've who have become carers because they need that they need to care for somebody and they want that dimension in their life
what's also come out very strongly er in this programme is that it's a struggle for a lot of people both financially and in terms of UNK time and the multiple demands that particularly women have in trying to care for young people and old people to the point where women may spend their entire lives between twenty and sixty looking after somebody or other
and maybe that is part of real life maybe that is a fact of life that women have to take on board but perhaps men have to take it on board a bit more as well
can we have a couple of final comments cos we're gonna have to draw to close
we've heard a tonight about carers erm not knowing about
mm
benefits not knowing where to find out about benefits and i think it's right to say that benefits agency staff are there to give information and there is a
and that's what you are
yeah
there is a UNK service which carers i think a lady said earlier over the phone is the best way there is a UNK service and i think it would be a good idea for carers to take advantage of that if we can help we will
i it's unfair ask you
this but do you think it's sufficient the care that's UNK the help that's available
erm that is difficult for me to answer but obviously
right
fine
i'm going to implement
yeah
government policy not to comment on it
right
yes
i'd like to end on a on a slightly different note
i would like to look at the people who are being cared for the people that we're talking about are the elderly quite often these people have lived through two world wars and given up their young married life they have brought up their children through the bleak days of the general strike is it right that these people have to suffer the UNK of charity hand outs
the eve of their life should be free from worry and stress and anxiety and wondering about who will bury them and who will pay for it
i think it's quite wrong er the way the elderly are treated that they
yeah
have to rely on charity hand outs
as ever we finish with er a lot of things touched on lots more to talk about
i hope you've heard something that'll make you think and think positively and perhaps act positively
UNK
somebody once said that if UNK sharing the gospel was one UNK telling another UNK about bread where it could be found and undoubtedly when he was saying that he was thinking of that story that account that we had read to us earlier from the second book of kings chapter seven and i'd like us to er turn back to us for a few moments this morning and perhaps draw some lessons for ourselves sometimes as christians its very easier for us to say what sins are and we can see other people's UNK you don't have to be a christian to do that of course plenty of other people can do that they see the UNK of other people they see the wrong doing they do they see their UNK their UNK whatever words we want to use to describe it and we say well that is sin perhaps for most of us this morning we could make er a list a UNK a table of sins and we might say well they are worse sins and there are lesser sins and i would i suppose by and large there would be a fairly reasonable consensus of opinion regarding what was sins and what were not sins
sometimes the bible UNK us a little bit of course and it puts it finger on things that we perhaps don't really want to talk about or we don't even consider as sins and the bible is quite clear that not all sins are what we do often there what we don't do in parable that jesus told concerning the UNK the man who went down to UNK we don't condemn the priest and the UNK for what they did but we do condemn them for what they didn't do their sin was not what they did it was what they left UNK going over and looking at the man was very note worthy as least there was some interest there and we don't condemn them for that but we do condemn them for UNK along and not reaching out and helping the man in the UNK of james and chapter four and verse seventeen james says there any one then who knows the good he ought to do and doesn't do it sins so the sins that you and i comment or the sins rather that we are guilty of are not just the things that we do there of times the things that we don't do and sometimes there more difficult for us to put a finger on we can justify them so very easily its been said that all it needs for evil to UNK is for good men to say or to do nothing well lets look at the that UNK illustration there that we have in the second book of kings
as i mentioned early the city of UNK it was under UNK and the army of UNK was UNK all around it ben UNK was a great UNK he would of been the UNK or the UNK of his day and he had set up this UNK around the city of UNK nobody could get in nobody could get out and very quickly the stocks of food and water er were used up rationing would of been introduced but it only lasted for a certain period they'd got to the stage it tells us in the previous chapter that er that a UNK head was sold for eighty UNK of silver and some folk had even got to the had sunk to the level of UNK of eating their own children and the city was when they heard about this they were in an UNK and they started blaming god and in between the city of UNK of all its suffering and UNK and UNK and the army UNK about with all of their supplies there was this area of no UNK land in which they were caught up four men who were UNK and they were trapped there they didn't want to go over to the UNK because they'd be killed they didn't want to go back into the city because they weren't allowed there and any way what was the point they'd only die of UNK in there and so these four men are caught up in no man's land and yet their no better off than people in the city now god had promised deliverance through his serve and UNK he had promised deliverance UNK said tomorrow about this time a measure of fine flour shall be sold for a se UNK and two measures of barley for a UNK in the gate of UNK he said the gates are gonna be open there's gonna be food and its gonna be a reasonable price and it says the royal officer who's hand the king was leaning on said the man of god said behold if the lord shall make windows in heaven could such a thing be he said don't talk stupid man how can such a thing happen for us he didn't believe what god servant said and UNK brings out to him a terrible judgment he says because of your UNK you will see it but your not participate in it but lets look at these four men for a moment cos that's where our real interest lies this morning i just wanted to say three things in their experience the first things is that they were amazed that at what they found because after they come together and they talk about it and they said well what shall we do and they weighed the UNK and the cons and UNK doesn't look very attractive with its UNK they said well the least if we stay here were gonna die if we go into UNK we'll die lets go down to the UNK camp the worse they can do to us is put us to death and were dying men any way but they may just take pity on us we maybe allowed to UNK around in their UNK and get some UNK of food they may at least allow us that and so they make their way down just as evening is falling they make their way down to the UNK lines and when they get there they are amazed at what they find you see their condition was UNK and hopeless they were dying men any way they were UNK but they were dying of UNK that was far more UNK than their UNK their problems and their needs were greater than themselves they could not meet their own needs their problems and their needs were greater than their government the king in UNK and all of his court could not meet the needs of his people and then in verse five we read something there they arose at UNK to go to the camp of UNK or the UNK and when they came to the UNK of the camp of the UNK behold there was no one there they expected to at least meet a guard there would surely be somebody on UNK duty even if the rest of the soldiers had gone in to their UNK and were perhaps getting ready for their for the evening going to bed or whatever they were gonna be doing having their evening meal there would at least be somebody on guard duty but when they got there was no one there god had stepped in god had intervened and the good news of the christian gospel is that god has intervened in our in the midst of our UNK in the midst of our UNK god has intervened he had stepped in to history so often you'll hear folks say well why doesn't god do something why does god allow this to happen why does god allow that one why doesn't he do something all they really show by that comment is their own ignorance because god has done something god has intervened listen to what it says in john three sixteen for god so loved the world that he gave he's only son and the er the er apostle paul and he's writing to the UNK in chapter four and in verses four and five hear what he says there but when the time had fully come god sent his son born of a woman born under law to redeem those under law that we might receive the full rights of son er of sons god has done something he's sent his son jesus christ into this world in fact his done the greatest thing he could do he has done the very ultimate thing he has sent his son into the world that's the greatest intervention god could ever have made it was far greater than just intervening in UNK in some small local event were you see some UNK happening and you say well why doesn't god do something there or there's a war situation going on in some other part of the world well why doesn't god step in and stop it god has stepped in not in a local situation not in some er passing problem or need but he's stepped into the greatest way possible by sending his son jesus christ into the world to UNK for men and woman to take away sin to pay the price that god's righteousness demands for sin so god has intervened and his intervention has changed the whole situation its brought a whole new UNK on things its changed the colour completely no longer is the world now under darkness and in and in pending judgment in UNK because jesus christ came and he took that judgment and that UNK upon himself he said i've not come to condemn the world he said its already condemned its already under judgement the UNK of UNK is already hanging over the world and jesus christ came in and to take that judgment and that UNK on himself and when he died there on the cross and rose again there came that burst of light in a world that had been UNK in UNK and darkness a world that had been UNK in sin suddenly for the first time sees the light god has paid for himself the price of sin god has intervened and changed the whole situation and the message of the gospel is that if you and i allow that intervention to effect us personally then like those four men surely we too are amazed at what we've found
if we've come to guard and received forgiveness of sins if we have become good followers of jesus christ and we are not amazed then there's something wrong with what we've received that god should so love not just the world but should so love me that he gave his son to die for me and that was the sort of er discovery that these four UNK made they've come down there they've found that the sight before them was amazing there was no enemy there the enemy had disappeared and the UNK with all their contents were there before them they were amazed with what they found and you and i when we come to god through jesus christ we are amazed at what we find we find forgiveness we find the restoration of a relationship between ourselves and god we find an access to receive god's blessing to receive his favour to receive his gifts that he has for us no wonder the apostle paul UNK out thanks beyond to god for his UNK gift but then again these four men they were not just amazed that what they found they were they got absorbed in what they got because they got a lot more than they UNK for they possibly in their UNK dreams thought they might at least get what the cook was throwing out they might get to the UNK they might get what was left over that would of been great they were dying of UNK the UNK would of been like a UNK to them but they got so much more than they anticipated and they got absorbed in it every thing was there's for the taking as they pulled back the flap of the tent as they go in and they see the tables laid out there they see the food and the drink they see the plenty these men who for weeks have known terrible poverty there might of been a time earlier on in the UNK when a few UNK got thrown over the city wall when the bins were put out the side of the city of an evening er they would go there and UNK amongst them but all that had stopped long since and it was only the bits and pieces that they managed to UNK for themselves and get for themselves that they'd been eating of late but here every thing is there for the taking they rubbed their eyes they pinched one another to make sure their not UNK it really is food and drink in a in an UNK they couldn't of thought of a few mo hours earlier one moment they had nothing the next they've got every thing what was it they needed food the tables would of been UNK with it was the food enough food for an army and there's only four of them did they were they UNK here was drink here was wine and drink in UNK the UNK the UNK they were dressed in there were garments and wardrobe full of clothes here for them did they need money well the UNK were full of the gold and the silver and UNK there were a sufficiency every thing was there you know the idea that the christian life is UNK and poor is such a terrible false UNK its an UNK lie of the devil the tragedy is that we have actually often made it that way we have made the christian faith something UNK something boring something for old folk er and er you know people who are who are just wanting a UNK because their coming to the end of their natural life and we've made it something UNK and dull listen to what the apostle paul says when he's writing to UNK in his second letter in chapter eight he says you know the grace of our lord jesus christ that though he was rich for your UNK he became poor so that you through his poverty might be rich god he's purpose follows his people he's not that we've a UNK grey dull UNK life jesus said i've come that you might of life and that more UNK that in all its UNK and god has purpose for us and when paul is talking about UNK there he's not talking about pounds and pence he's talking about the UNK of the life that we enjoy its not a case of not doing this and having to do that the other thing its a case of enjoying life as god purposes it as god UNK it you know if you don't enjoy your christian life now let me tell you your in for a rude UNK when you get to heaven because the quality of life is not gonna change the only things that'll change is its la it will it will be in his presence the quality of life will not change because already now we have received eternal life he has given his life to us and he hasn't got some other special you know super UNK life laid up there's nothing there's nothing greater ahead god hasn't got any thing greater for us than what he's already given to us in UNK form here and now why if we take on er a UNK new UNK and UNK when you get to heaven that life is already given to you and to me know go back to these four men at the moment they had never known any thing like this before this was better than all their UNK rolled into one this was the greatest day in their experience and if they would live to be a hundred they would never know another day like this they were having a tremendous time it said they went into one tent listen to what they did they went into one tent and they ate they UNK they had a party and they carried from there the silver the gold and the clothes and they went and UNK they returned and entered another tent and then they did the same there they were having a tremendous time this was a UNK to end all UNK this was the greatest day in their life they were having a wonderful time and why shouldn't they why not you know there are folk who would who'd want to make us as christians er and er ee put us into a straight jacket the bible tells me even the UNK free is free indeed and i don't see any suggestions as i read the new testament that first of all the life of jesus was UNK and UNK or that he expects me as his follow to lead a UNK a grey life oh its not always gonna be a UNK an easy life but that doesn't reduce the UNK and the excitement in it but you see the danger is when having a good time is the reason for living and the only reason for it you see if god has intervened in our life if the message of the gospel is true if god in christ has taken away your sin and made you in christ a new creation then you have every reason to enjoy life in a sense your only able to start enjoying life now you may have enjoyed some of the things that folks suggest that make up life but they've finished there gone what happens when the when the wine has run out what happens when the parties over you know all about it the next day don't you what happens then its such short lived its only worth having whilst its coming to you all the time but that's not so with a christian life because it UNK depend on just the things that we have or the experiences that we go through because it is something that we have within it is it is a quality of life that we possess because we possess the one who is life himself listen to what paul says when he's writing to timothy in his first letter in chapter six it is command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant or to put their hope in wealth those who think that er in having possessions that is the secret of life or in having a good time and the rest of it that is what life is all about he said warn them not to do that because that is so uncertain he says but to put their hope in god who UNK provides us with every thing what for our enjoyment why has god given us these things why is why is god even he is natural creation there for us it is for our enjoyment its not to make us miserable or to make us grey and UNK and burden by it is for us to enjoy when god created UNK adam and eve and put them in the garden the they were told to enjoy it even the fruit enjoy it its there for your benefit and then the new creation every thing that god has provided is there for our enjoyment but the dangers is when that enjoyment is the reason for living and that's all we do it for and were so taking up with ourselves i am gonna have my good time i'm gonna enjoy myself as a christian and i can do it and you can do it you become UNK and we become UNK and the only thing that matters is me having a good time my world centres around me and me enjoying myself and me having this and me having that this blessing and that gift and that other blessing we become self centred and taken up with our own good times as long as i can be there in the centre as long as i can go from this celebration to that celebration as long as i can go from this er festival to that festival to this special meeting to that one i'm gonna have my good time well that was what these UNK were doing they were going from tent to tent from celebration to celebration having a great time and then the truth hit them they were ashamed with what they had done they said to one another we are not doing right this days a day of good news but we are keeping silent if we wait until morning light punishment will overtake us now therefore come let us go and tell the kings household how guilty are we how guilty are you how guilty am i of the sinner silence remember how we started its not always the things that we do its often the things that we don't do how guilty are we of the sin of silence these men had known nothing known poverty and UNK they were amazed at what they'd found they'd became absorbed in what they had got and now they'd became ashamed of what they had done with it what was the sin that UNK these men they said we are keeping silent
back in the city there were thousand of people UNK dying and all unnecessarily because here was plenty here was sufficient for the whole city and possibly the greatest sin that you and i can be guilty of and that the church is generally guilty of but you know when we talk about the church generally its so easy because that's general you and i that are the church not the UNK not the organization it you and i possibly the greatest sin that we can be guilty of is the sin of silence i'm not talking now about a rude UNK hole button holding of people i'm not talking about that i don't see any place in gods word for that sort of attitude or that sort of approach but are we still silent what about with those with whom we have the right because we've created a relationship because they know us and they've seen us and they've seen the experiences we've gone through and they've seen what god has done in our lives what about with those people do we wait for others to do it shifting the responsibility
thinking in the context of our of our mission this town wide mission well that's UNK job he's better at it than i am but its not his job its my job as much as its his and its your job as much as its mine we do not well to keep silent these men they were UNK by their sin of silence perhaps you and i should be UNK by our sin of silence because the extension of that and here's the really great thing as far as they were concerned the ex the ongoing because they were UNK by their sin of silence and they did something about it they were UNK at the sight that they saw as they see the city being delivered and as they see starving men and women eating food perhaps for the first time in days or weeks buying good UNK food at a reasonable price that was the UNK that UNK them and you can imagine them and i think they'd be entitled to a little bit of pride that i'm glad we told them i'm glad we went back and shared the news apart from any thing we couldn't of coped with all ourselves it would of been so wrong to of kept it would of been so wrong just to of eaten it ourselves i'm glad we went back and told them
jesus said just before he was living his disciples his followers you and me he said you shall receive power after the holy spirit has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me yes we witness by our life but there's a danger in making that a UNK out because one other requirement of a witness is that they talk they've gotta say what they know these four men were good witnesses they went back and they told the city what they had found and there's placed upon you and me that responsibility to go back and to tell what we've found this is a day of good UNK we do wrong to keep silent
do men hate women
of course they don't
they respect admire like and often love them
don't they
now why am i UNK in the age long war between the sexes
isn't the UNK light UNK and fun underneath all the rough and UNK
men really care for us don't they
i mean the things they say about women when they think they're alone they're just jokes aren't they
right
well tell that to the UNK
and that's the polite version say many women
how many women
let's see what this hundred women make of the question do men hate women
button one and button two for no
ge generally speaking i mean as far as you can tell living as long as you have done how would you answer that question
and in this hundred sixty seven say no but thirty three which is exactly a third say yes
who said yes and why
i think UNK is very ancient it's as old as man
it comes from UNK it's come right down through literature and history
and perhaps today we would not say that men actually hate women but there aren't isn't much UNK er evidence of their respect
they're not willing to erm recognise women as their equals
why
well i think it's been a UNK world they they've had a wonderful time
why should they give it up
i think erm like the main issue is that men are really afraid of woman and really
mhm
afraid of woman's power and the only way they know how to combat that is to put out this kind of this UNK or this UNK in the language in the way they behave towards women
but i think it's there underneath it
like fear in trying to keep women down so that women can't discover their power because women are just so powerful
and we're only just beginning to realise that
and what is the UNK that they're putting out that you talk about
what is the evidence
oh it's just you know it's incredible
like advertising erm language you know like erm any courses that you study most of the text books will always be in male identified language
yeah
erm you get comments on the street
mm
you know in the pubs oh
it's so tremendous
like it's just so huge it kind of feels quite overwhelming to even begin to combat it
mm
i think that it's only a fear of women but it's also a belief in the innate or learn UNK of men over women
mhm
so that men from a very early age learn that women are not important creatures that they're not to be respected or erm understood certainly and that they can be erm beaten and abused and raped
i think er male society is built on women UNK
erm we hear a lot about the UNK that happened to the jews in the second world war but not so many people know a lot about the UNK that has happened to women over centuries and centuries where millions of women were burnt as UNK but er just because they were women
sorry i think this is a complete UNK
mhm
of men
men there are men who hate women i agree with that but there are men who love and respect a th what a woman is for how good and UNK the strength of women who can make you feel good and who gives you the power of being able to be yourself and i i'm sorry i that is part of it i think there are two sides
mhm
i think a lot of men do hate women i think a lot of men don't
but i think the problem is that many men who hate women don't realise that they hate women
they think for example the UNK who UNK with a lot of women he says oh i love women
i UNK them
and he doesn't realise that he's abusing and using them
mm
because it's accepted
it's you know he's a jack the lad or whatever
and i think that's a you know and it's the fact that society allows a lot of abuse to happen to women and therefore it's not seen as UNK to women it's seen as perfectly acceptable
mhm
yes
yes i think really it's a er faulty gene in the system and no matter how men hate women the majority of men really like women other than perhaps envy or UNK or women earning more than their husbands and throwing it back in them in their face but the main subject the main point to me is there is a faulty ge gene in their system and there's no way you will UNK that
that's a rather UNK view
but is it is that true
yes
well what about the images that men see of women every day in page
mm
three
i don't think that's UNK or liking women that's just making them as sex objects
that
mm
i can't see that as being loving a woman
mhm
if men like women so much where are the men who are speaking about what other men are doing to women
where are the men who are speaking out about the abuse of women in the home
where
mhm
are the men speaking out about rape and sexual assault of women
it's women who are speaking about it out
mhm
about these issues not men
well i think men really do believe that they are better than women
they don't want to recognise that we're equal
i mean they're the ones that point out no we can't do that that's women's work
mm
you don't hear women saying i can't do that cos that's a man's job
mhm
up there
i think it's actually still UNK in erm children's minds and i think it's sometimes the mother's own fault because they still bring them up you know like girls will do this and boys will do that i think that is actually still there you know
so you don't think it's the faulty gene that UNK talked about you think it's in the
yeah i agree i actually agree with that as well because erm i have a son and i think and he's brought up by myself and there's no man about you know so well i think it's actually UNK in the man that he
you know that he's actually like that
beside you
i think one women that most men dislike is the mother in law
the mother in law gets the UNK of everything
prove mother in law's wrong no matter what she tries to do she's wrong
all
yes
men seem to say that
are you talking from experience
well
i shouldn't ask you that should i
erm i think it's less a problem to be thought that men hate women so much it is alright to be rude about women
mm
i compiled an UNK a few years ago about of UNK quotes and it's everything from the bible the UNK the UNK to every UNK in there all the judges are in there pop singers are in there i mean everybody under the sun
and the things they say yo you read them and you think oh yes that's pretty awful
but like er all women are evil and are the cause of all the evil in the world says shirley UNK
and you think well you know that's going to sell her lots of records and it's jolly good
but if you changed it and said all black people are evil and are the cause of all the evil the world
it gets your flesh creeping
mhm
in a way that it wouldn't if you said women
and i think that's where the danger comes as it's a sort of acceptable thing to say
one very easy way to find out how much men dislike women is not to behave they wa the way they want you to behave
mm
so i mean a true real example is you get drunk men in a pub
mhm
they came up to you if there's two women together they assume that they have the right to talk to you that you're going to be interested in them and if you tell them to get lost however UNK you can get a very unpleasant response because they assume that what they have to say is more important
mhm
up there
i think this is not is more evident within marriage
erm i think the idea is that a woman is a man's possession that she should be UNK she should do as she's told and that she has no intelligent to think intelligence to think for herself
erm one er main area i think is in when it comes to domestic violence
now if you if a woman gets hurt and she goes to the police for help they come to the house and they tell the people concerned it's a domestic argument
what still
so it's still a domestic argument sort it out for yourself
the wo it seems to be the age old theory that women should do as they're told
if a the violence is within marriage it should be sorted out within the marriage which i you know i don't agree with
has that not changed at all over recent years
i mean has er are there not more enlightened attitudes
yes
i think th the publicity that the police give out about the
mm
their attitudes would lead you believe that they have changed and they have become more UNK to the kind of things women have been saying over the years
but i think if you listen the stories of women themselves er who are abused in the home and who call the police i think you would find that the same old attitudes are still erm been found
mhm
you do read terrible stories in the papers every day of men who've murdered their wives get off even though they've chopped their wives into a hundred bits driven to the lake district overnight dumped the body and gone back
mm
his school sports and said i did it for the sake of the children
and they get let off for that
mm
you know they say oh she moved the mustard pot one morning and it really UNK me so much i killed her
and the judges UNK with it that's a
mm
that's a dangerous
yes
mm
there was one place quite recently
mhm
when erm the wo the woman had UNK her husband the husband killed her and she got le oh he didn't get let off but he got erm i think he walked from the court because the sheriff said the wife had UNK you for erm he she did have to be killed
i mean
mm
this is what we're coming up against
mhm
i think it's really important to er define this brief that it's women responsibility to change men and to change their sums
because er inevitably man has gotta leave their home even if they've had a father erm who's been a if they've had no father at all they're gonna leave and they're gonna face a world where they have to be a man and they're gonna have to find their own male UNK and i think the responsibility basically has gotta come to men to change not for us to change them
yes we have to fight for our equality for our own rights but w we can change men and our the responsibility is not for women to change men it's for women to change our own lives our own situations and for we men to change their own
well there's much talk at the moment about what's called the backlash effect that in fact th the any advances that the feminist movement may have made on behalf of er of women is having precisely the wrong effect and er and men are UNK their the their more old fashioned style
i don't know if you would agree with that or what you think of that and one might to combat that if you agree that is does exist
yes
well er i don't really think there's been enough improvement to backlash against and er
one of the things i would like say is that although many things have changed a lot of things have stayed very much the same
mm
and perhaps some of the have UNK grown worse
i'm thinking really of the way UNK has become a sort of public UNK
mm
and the subject of so much popular entertainment
you know er twin UNK the silence of the UNK
mhm
erm american psycho whatever
i mean er video games which turn on the UNK up of women i think there's real UNK there and it's UNK our public media you know real erm UNK women UNK
and parents are really not alone in bringing up their children their children are exposed to all sorts of outside influences through the media in their peer groups and those in many ways i think are getting worse rather than better
yes
things like the diet industry
yeah
the diet industry is teaching us to hate our bodies
mhm
so that we spend millions of pounds on diet aids that we don't need at all
mhm
that's UNK
yes
i would i worry terribly much about this discussion and it was suggesting that men are somehow the root of all evil and all
mm
all the things that happen all these UNK of UNK because i think really what we're talking about whether it be within the family or it be within the media all the signs of women as er sexist
mhm
images or whatever aren't so much to do with UNK some horrible male plot some UNK or UNK it's to do with the way our society is run and i think that's we look far more at class
i feel more UNK if you like with er a male working class person than i do perhaps with a female member of the class margaret thatcher would be a very good example of that
i feel far mo less sympathy and far less identification with her than i perhaps do with a male worker who has to cope with the same kind of exploitation that i do day in day out
i think that really is perhaps where perhaps examples of UNK come from i the structure of society rather than men being evil
what do you think of that view
yes
well if you look at erm a female worker er as opposed to a male worker and you look at the o UNK that she suffers does she not suffer both the UNK of being working and the UNK of being a woman
so to me she was more UNK than her male UNK part
sure she suffers both if you like she suffers from UNK of being
yeah
a female in society and she suffers the exploitation of being a be being a worker of course that but the a ruling class woman doesn't suffer from exploitation
deborah
well i'm i think er although i have no personal time for mrs thatcher politically at all i think she's an absolutely classic victim of UNK
that the way in which mrs thatcher was UNK criticized you know ditch the UNK
all those kinds of UNK were a very good example of how er women UNK comes to the fore whenever women get in positions women are not supposed to be in
i agree with you that mrs thatcher is a representative of her class first and foremost but i think the way she was treated showed up a lot of rather unpleasant things about the er the political movements which opposed her
i wish somebody here would define exactly what UNK is
i thought it meant a man who hated a woman
it seems to me that the discussion right now is that we are all seeing all men hate all women
mm
and that is not true
some men hate some women
yeah i have worked all my life in various jobs and i've never yet met a man who hated me nor have i hated any man and i think there must be many women here who think the same thing
so all men do not hate all women
would you recognise that we live a society where some men hate women and are able to use whatever power and influence they have to project an image of women which is which is UNK
no
i think it depends
right
on your own attitude
i've
does
never UNK it
right
i would agree with er the lady behind strongly
i mean i think that i would really a lot of what we're talking about here is actually male UNK
mhm
and i
yeah
deal a lot with men
yeah
in my course of work i have three grown up sons and i think an awful lot of what we're talking about is in your own attitude to men and generally the most difficult men to deal with i find are men who for whatever reason are actually inadequate a little bit sensitive to women being competent i have no difficulty at all in dealing with that but i i'm aware that it seems significant to me that a lot of the younger women here are much more shall we say sensitive to erm what i perceive as being basically male UNK
i'm not UNK violence domestic violence i
mm
consider that to be exceptional i'm talking about the general
there
yes
i think the evidence though is that men like okay we're talking generally but if you look at the evidence of how many women are raped one in four of girl children are UNK before the age of sixteen that to me suggests UNK
i mean the statistics for boy children being UNK there are boy children are UNK but the statistics are nowhere near as large
like so many women are raped
so many women are beaten
so many women are UNK when they're really young
and that to me looks like UNK that looks like trying to destroy UNK something that is beautiful
let's le let me let me take a couple of er votes
have you ever been raped
button one for yes button two for no
i'm not going to pursue anybody on this one so i mean i'm not yo you ca you can answer with er with UNK
now fourteen people in this hundred have said yes which i think is shocking
have you have you ever been physically abused by a man
button one for yes button two for no
and that's ha even more shocking
fifty three people have said yes they've been physically abused
and have you ever been emotionally abused by a man is the final question i'll ask at this stage
button one for yes and button two for no
and there we have e have UNK seventy six people have said yes they've been emotionally abused by a man
now maybe that is male UNK that the status quo that's just how life is it
i mean how would you respond to those particular votes
well you know er as i said i think really an awful lot of it is in your own perception of i mean what someone here might call emotional abuse i would just regard as a challenge
i really don't necessarily find every time a man and i'm perfectly aware of the fact that
yes
a lot of men are not very good at taking a women's opinion but i don't necessarily regard that as a translation into some form of male UNK
okay
some men hate men
some men hate people full stop
they
aha
hate children
they UNK they hate animals
some women do and i'm not quite clear that it has to be so definite as er
there
some people feel
i think a lot of mis UNK is behind the scenes in the all
yeah
male world of the guilds the working men's clubs the UNK the UNK and even the pubs which have a UNK male culture and we don't know what they're saying about us behind our back and i think that is why there's so much UNK about
just like to ask the hundred women here we have the UNK and we have the men from texas now we always hear that they're sell outs you know
mm
th is the woman going there to abuse the men or to UNK them why
is it such a sell out then
what yes
i think that there's a o clearly a very different history behind erm the use of women as sex objects and the use of men as sex objects and a fundamental difference is that erm the background to erm using women as sexual objects in UNK or in prostitution is that is sexual violence the wo the women can be raped or can be beaten i in a sexual way and that simply is not the case with men who are used as sexual objects
so i think it's erm it's a non issue
mhm
yeah i would just like to add something to that and the fact that it's not only that women that men are taught that they can rape and they can abuse women but er that it's alright
i can walk out or and get erm you know tonnes of any shop i can get UNK that tells me that or tell any man who chooses to buy that magazine that's it okay to take a women even if she says no
it's okay to rape a women
it's okay to rough to be hard to push to rape
you can get magazines who tell
mm
you that that's okay and that women even enjoy that
if that's UNK i don't what UNK is
mhm
well years ago i was at a party which was er for a woman about to be married and there was a male UNK there
and the women were it was very UNK it was very jolly and lots of UNK and things i'm not making comment on whether i think it's a good thing
aha
or a bad
aha
thing
i have also been to a strip show which involved a woman in a in a club and it was a very different atmosphere
men were making all kinds of really negative remarks
mm
about the woman you know oh she's got a she's got a mole on her UNK
ooh i wouldn't have her
or i can't re i won't repeat here the things they said but you know spread it or get it out or whatever
you know really UNK things
very aggressive
very UNK
now getting back to the comment the woman made earlier about men being UNK within their own world i'm quite convinced that a good deal of those men would go home to their wives and family and be very loving to their to their wives and family be UNK of their neighbours but as soon as they got in the all male environment and this woman was there to be used she was their property for the time that they paid their money to get through the door they could be as UNK offensive and UNK as they wanted to be
mm
you see i think i mean thi it's been discussed seventy er seven of you said no men don't hate women and yet some of the UNK a lot of the discussion and certainly the votes you taken give a very UNK picture
and few people ar a couple of suggestions have come up th say that it things will only change when men actually decide they're going to change when men feel that's it's UNK to live a society where the kind of things which have been discussed whether it's the th UNK or the various UNK of women are seen as just not being acceptable any more
do you think that's ever going to happen
oh sure
or do you think
the difficulty is that all the religions of the world have text books which are still studied which all say that women are stupid women are wicked women are property and women are UNK
you know you're all taught that from childhood and always have been
i don't quite know how you change it
things have gone er better for women they have in the restoration of a women UNK and there weren't any in last century you know i er things go they seem to swing backwards and forwards all the time
but as a UNK
and we stay in the same place
as a UNK of an UNK of er of UNK er quotes was it hard to find them
no
but i di
i mean i didn't even have to look you see you
yeah
just everything you read you just you can just
yeah
UNK it all out
i'm not a writer of these sort of books i write theatre history
mm
and i'm an UNK that's my job you know
but i just came across so much of it every where i was i thought actually there there's a book in this because it used to get just get me so cross writing theatre history and reading these terrible things
there
yes
as soon as a woman erm or a lady stands up to be counted she's looked about she's looked at as being aggressive not assertive as first it's aggressive because they think it's the challenge again
instead of realizing that they have a right to say if god has no respect for persons why should men be
i'd like to go back to what the lady across there said about the strip show
yes
now do i don't suppose i'm the only person that's been in a pub toilet a ladies toilet and i've heard the females in the toilet saying what exactly what they would like to do the males
so i don't think that erm all lad all females are ladies
i'm going to try a little experiment which er which may not work
i did say to you at the beginning do you think er men hate women
an and you voted on it
can i ask you the same question again ho after this discussion do you think men hate women
button one for yes and button two for no
i have to say myself you know i feel one of the worst thing you can call a man in the english language is a term that's used for a women's UNK
i er i well there isn't another word that women can actually use it does it does make me wonder
however well now then th the er the UNK changed
thirty three of you thought that men hated women before now it's gone down to thirty one so
so any of you gentleman watching who have UNK yo you have your supporters here
e er any final word
yes
erm i think it's quite interesting what you just said about er men using the word UNK which actually
i can't UNK
i think
that could you say that again
okay
men using the wo er female UNK as a UNK term and if we actually go back to the roots of that word erm to me it's like basic shows you what UNK about the actual root of that word it means seat of power
and our women's power and men are scared of our power
so you would like to UNK a word that i'm not
oh yeah
allowed to UNK
yeah
i think we should all be able to say that word and feel proud about it
how many additions of scottish women will there be before we can do that
yes
i think i think you do need to look at power i think that's quite a crucial er
mm
area that we need to think about
a lot of women here have said it's up to women it's up to mothers
mm
but i mean if you look at where cultural power is who has control over images that we see books that we read films that we go and see
i think it's very interesting the film UNK fear that's out at the moment which says is the UNK film you'll ever see
and the fear there is the same fear as walking down the road in at night wondering if you're going to be raped
mm
it actually works on the fear of rape
and that's gonna be a box office hit
i think we need to look at who has control over what we see
have you ever complained about an image or an advert or a film
i mean have you ever written to anyone or phoned anyone
my complaining was only effective cos we actually took direct action over some advertising for erm swim wear
erm yeah we did take direct action and so eventually the ad was dropped but if we'd just complained and not taken any action the ad wouldn't have been dropped
what is direct action
were yo
wasn't exactly legal
did it involve th i mean a spray can or er
it actually involved destroying erm some of the product to just to indicate women were about it
and it
i see
was only after then only after actually threatening property that the ad was dropped
before that they wouldn't drop it
well it would be UNK of me to say there's a lesson for you in that
i shall simply say thank you all
very much indeed
and thank you for joining us
goodbye
in a classless society whatever that might be what role with the monarchy play
nothing sells women's magazines like a photo of the princess of wales on the cover
generally it seems we enjoy our royal family we enjoy UNK and we enjoy UNK them
but what's their real function in britain today
is the prime UNK vision of a classless society possible with the monarchy in place
and does scotland take a different with the whole subject from the rest of the country
one hundred women reveal their true colours
let's start with the vote
i wonder if you think we need the monarchy
do we need the monarchy
button one for yes button two for no
i mean you may like them but would you say that we need the monarchy
and this particular hundred are divided but the minority think we need them forty five said yes but fifty said no
let's start with the UNK what do we need them for
yes
i think them the UNK provide a stability for the country
erm yo see across the world that their political situations arise er because of an elected leader and also situations arise where you have someone who's pushed himself into leadership and i think erm we have a fairly stable society here because of that
so we're protected from UNK politics and situations
yes
if we didn't have them we would probably have UNK which would be even worse
i'm interested in your even worse there
up there
i think they can be very useful because a lot of having monarchy brings you know american tourists a big UNK into the country and whether that's good or not it's certainly brings money into the country so that from that point of view it's quite good to have them
they're also a UNK within the country i mean the state opening of parliament for instance it's just weird
when you look at it and they're all UNK up and down in their strange UNK and saying silly things to each other you know that's really weird but it's all tradition it's all UNK and it's taught by the monarchy
beside you
i think it's a sad UNK of our so called democratic system when they are afraid of having an elected head of state that they are afraid that we might have a UNK
i mean britain is supposed to be one of the founding countries as far as democracy is concerned
the british
mother of parliament
quite right
exactly
i was going to say about the mother of parliament
fine
we talk of the monarchy as something there er UNK the gossip UNK go to town they've got the tourists coming to see the monarchy to see the UNK the attraction and all the rest of it
