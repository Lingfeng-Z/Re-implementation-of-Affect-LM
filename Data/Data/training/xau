i think it's significant that in scotland many people have absolutely no time for the monarchy
they are either totally against or totally UNK
and i think if there was a referendum in scotland it might turn out that many people here wanted the monarchy ended
up there
i think that the monarchy UNK important role in preventing civilians taking posts which the constitutional monarchy actually UNK for example the head of the armed forces
mhm
this prevents civilians from becoming far too powerful and then becoming a UNK
yes
i wasn't sure how to vote er i think like a lot of people erm i'm quite fond of the monarchy and th the constitutional monarchy
mhm
but what gets me down is not the royal bit it's the family bit
and er i mean in these days give or take i know they've got this erm value as being a soap like UNK with UNK on but
er given the amount of poverty and misery that there is in this country can we really justify or can we really say that by paying prince andrew a hundred thousand pounds a year we're being cost effective
here
yes surely erm the alternative to that is without the state actually supporting the monarchy the monarchy can still exist you can't just go out and shoot prince edward today
you know that's not on
stop his money
the UNK still got to exist
because i
we could stop his money not shoot him
yes you could stop his money but that has the effect of UNK the monarchy
because instead
instead of the monarchy going out and they're supported by the tax payer if the monarchy go and say it's the queen goes
mm
and opens and supermarket then she'll get paid for opening that supermarket
it's not
yes
cos they can't
our
er
our UNK is erm we sort of put on a UNK and if you look at other european countries who still have royal families they're a bit more down to earth some of them europe go on bicycles and they don't need erm all the UNK
so maybe we could have UNK but they don't we don't have to have the UNK and ceremony that goes with them and also the cost
UNK
i think it's okay to have UNK if the people that want it pay for it
i object to paying for it because it does UNK do anything for me
down there
i don't think it's just the family i think it's all the UNK on
erm by UNK on i mean that there are all the UNK and the UNK and whatever else there is and that whole UNK in society which i think is english society erm i mean i know that there are UNK in scotland but there aren't so many and i mean they own quite a lot and i think that it's impossible to have a classless society because the monarchy UNK class divisions
up there
UNK
i was going to say i represent the tourist UNK industry in UNK and i don't think anybody can deny that our royal are a tremendous draw to tourists particularly tourists from overseas
it only takes a visit by the prince and princess of wales to japan for example and we're UNK with japanese tourists in britain
is that the best thing you can say about the royal family
certainly not
for example one of the attractions in my area UNK castle as a couple of exhibitions which are open to the public for part of the year now the entrance fees for that actually goes to charity so it benefits other people apart from the tourists themselves
apart from providing jobs in the area as well
jennifer
i would to just make the point that the royal family do a lot of work for this country
the prince of wales is president of my organisation scottish business in the community and ever since he agreed to take on that role he as dedicated a large amount of time to helping us and in turn helping communities not because it's fashionable because he really believes in it and he wants to do hard work on our behalf and on the UNK behalf
but presumably he would do he would work very hard were he not a royal person would he not
i'm sure he would but he has that greater degree of influence because of who he is
i'm hopeful with the royal family getting so involved in UNK and british charities which do lobby and for instance the anti smoking lobby where there's somebody that's supporting that there's always going to be somebody who's opposing that
so the point about the UNK erm getting involved with these things is there's always gonna be people that disagree with what they're lobbying for
and
but that's their right too
well then that brings them into the realm of politics and is it such a good idea to have a royal family with opinions that are funded by the state
angela
i'm with the scottish ballet and i think the royal family have a great deal to offer all of us through the arts
in what way
well industry and also i think in your papers industry the heads of industry are men mostly if not all and erm they do like rub rubbing shoulders with er UNK and the royal family and the UNK for industry by UNK or funding the arts
mhm
i'm not er a great fan of the monarchy although that i would say that i come from a family which is devoted a large portion of it's life in service and work to the royal family
i think one of the best things a member of the royal family has done is prince UNK and prince of wa and prince of wales have actually opened their mouths up and said they're opposed to wha a lo a lo a lot of what the present government policies are and it's not before time in my opinion
the other thing which i think is a another great UNK is er our present prime UNK policy of having a classless society well i think the first thing is you could do is actually abolish the house of lords and that will certainly be a start on having a classless society in this country
well would you take it further then and abolish the monarchy
erm yes i would like to abolish the monarchy but i don't think it's gonna happen over night and i think it will be a very difficult thing to achieve anyway
yeah
i was very angry UNK with what prince charles said erm about education because his ideas are just handed down without any ah without us ha being informed in any way of where he's getting his information from
we don't know upon what he's UNK what he's saying whether it's on his own particular memories of school whether it's been informed by department of education officials in england or scottish education officials up here and i think any up any where somebody something as crucial UNK any job er where somebody who's UNK is making UNK which are considered to be sufficiently important that they're read out on th on the six o'clock news and in the papers
ah
the next morning should at least be informed
mm
yes
but even if he's UNK why shouldn't he speak
i mean who's getting it wrong
oh we yo you think
yeah
he's getting it wrong you obviously think the UNK getting it wrong in reporting it
is he abusing
no
his position
i think if he's making UNK which are being picked up and treated as very important and they're only being treated as important because of his position then he should be ba getting his facts right
sandra
there are great dangers in the royal family speaking out because i have a memory of the nineteen seventy nine just prior to the UNK bill in the referendum in scotland when the queen spoke out against UNK now she in effect denied a large number of scots the opportunity to have some sort of scottish parliament based here and we probably wouldn't i think be debating this subject today if in fact we'd got that eleven years ago
why i if we had got UNK eleven years ago
well i think there's a distinct possibility that the people have scotland may have then decided that they could do without the monarchy
i have nothing against the monarchy in principle erm i think that perhaps if we had our own parliament in scotland and had the queen as a head of state as do australia canada and all the commonwealth countries that would be fine
i don't particularly like the set up as it is as the moment
pat
yes i'm hearing the business anti hostile feeling towards the monarchy in scotland and yet i can remember the silver UNK when these same UNK were about and yet she was UNK on her royal progress all over scotland even in areas that you wouldn't have expected with vast crowds
now part of that might just have purely the ritual that's associated with things like UNK and UNK but surely if people had felt so strongly about it they wouldn't have turned out in such numbers er to support her
mm
i think the one thing that really UNK me about the royal family is the way they speak and the fact that the way that they speak is still re regarded by certain sections of the population both in scotland and in england as being er the correct way in which the english language should be pronounced which is of course UNK nonsense
but i mean there are still areas erm where that kind of pronunciation is a si a symbol of prestige of education or even have said of good looks humour and UNK
erm and i think that aspect of the royal family is one which i would really do without
UNK personally in the UNK where i work
mhm
and she is a very caring person
i mean th they what they say in the press about her is terrible i think
i mean took the point of coming round all the staff talking to them personally every patient and she made a point of getting down on her knees and talking to the patient personally
UNK
i just worries me that these caring people are the same people that support the tory policies that UNK
yes
the people
they rub shoulders with UNK that UNK us pays low wages bad conditions
that's rubbish
poor hours
an awful lot of things that are tory party policy that the UNK don't agree with
mm
for instance prince charles recently made comments about electoral reform
you know i mean that goes beyond parties
okay there are liberal UNK who'll say that they are the party committed to electoral reform there are others and other parties who are as well
and prince charles is starting to say things about that and whether that was UNK in the press or whether he actually said it the point was it was UNK that he had said it to a group of UNK
i mean i would say that was an abuse of the position of power because if he was joe UNK in the street nobody would listen to what he was saying about electoral reform
right
er i think prince who perhaps dealt with domestic politics but one thing he has exposed is the green cause which i'm very pleased about because i don't think that the politicians in this country take these issues seriously enough
and somebody with his influence and power it's good to have him on our side as it were
UNK
i was erm i quite UNK actually by the fact that princess anne comes on the television and talks about how we have to give our lunch to save starving people when you think your one royal lunch would probably pay the third world of some
some countries
erm a th the UNK you know the situation UNK about charity we've seen it all before and it hasn't helped the starving millions in africa it's beginning to start all over again
you know i UNK into that idea i think that the you know people in africa are UNK and that we have to put into our pockets to help them when we're destroying massive amounts of grain
we live in a very UNK society
what
and the monarchy UNK that in equality
what do you think about then
i mean compared with other
yeah
nations i think we do very little i mean we do a lot for charity but if you look our planet is dying as you look at the green issue we are far behind so monarchy doesn't help us there
they er
yes okay
there's a lot erm women do a lot of voluntary work round the hospitals as it is but it's never they're never wrote about when they go
mm
visiting hospital
that lady said when one of the UNK went it was nice to see but i mean there's women that do that every day of the week and it's never writ about then
i mean they're just ordinary people
i mentioned at the beginning the idea of a classless society now i don't know what you think of the er the idea of a classless society it's something that the th prime minister erm er talked about when he when he took office and i asked whether you think it's possible to have we if you think a classless society is possible at all whether you think it's desirable
er if it is desirable is it possible to have one with a monarchy in place do you think
yes UNK
i think it would be a desirable erm idea to have a classless society as long as we're all middle class
i think there's a lot erm UNK about of this er this idea that there will be a classless society
it doesn't look like it
the gulf between the rich and the poor is getting bigger
so where on earth where is the er the proof that we're becoming a classless society
well i don't i was suggesting we were becoming one but i was suggesting that the prime minister thought this is desirable
maybe you don't believe him but that he has he has said this
i don't no
i don't
yes
i think to have a classless society in this country everybody has to be equal and not just from the rich to the poor and the poor to the rich but also there's many people in this country who suffer from UNK
now there's been lots of talk about gay and lesbian people not having no rights i come from a jewish society i've got people who suffer anti UNK ri feelings there's lot of erm multi ra ethnic UNK who cover on this programme and i think that issue has to be looked at as well
and i think this you know to have a classless society all these things have to be covered not just the rich and poor oh and getting rid of the monarchy
yep
you're talking about have and have not but have and have not in the sense of money surely class is not just money
what else is it
well class is UNK and er class is something you have or you haven't and if you have money or if you don't have money
i think the monarchy is stopping us from being a classless society but i can't think of one country in the world whether it's communist whether it's a new country like australia what doesn't have the rich the poor the upper class and the lower
mm
the monarchy doesn't stop us
so they're not playing any part in UNK
i don't think so at all
a class
i just thinks it's human nature
coming back to what
yes
the other woman said
no UNK beside you
there maybe societies where there is a privilege and inequality but as long as we have in britain a system where the head of the state is head of state because the person inherited the position of being UNK and as long as we have a institution such as the house of lords
we are talking of a system where people are born into certain families and by right of that
simply because
what about them
they're born into it they have this position
they were born into it and UNK doesn't have a monarchy
but the nearest thing americans ever had to it was the UNK
they all inherited
day
may i point out that we haven't had a UNK in residence here since sixteen hundred and three
yes
but i see no evidence of scotland having become a classless society
but scotland is part of the united kingdom
nevertheless we are a holiday place for the royal family
oh
UNK
i'm not all that sure how desirable a classless society is in that i can't UNK any society in the world which is classless
i'm thinking towards the eastern european countries for example where one is told or has been led to believe they were aiming for UNK and what's happening th barriers are coming down and they're heading towards our capitalist society as a
but
model
well you seem to have more or less UNK the er prime UNK vision of a classless society
so asking you
what the role of monarchy within the such a society would be becomes rather irrelevant
mhm
can i hear from the people who think that yes we do need the monarchy and it is the minority in this er hundred forty five of you said yes
can we go back to that i mean we've heard that they're good for tourism
they're good for UNK they encourage people who have money to er to put it into the arts they're they promote stability and they save us from a UNK is that it
i mean is that
erm
is that yes
the monarchy are non political and therefore when they choose to speak it's usually out of a genuine concern for that problem it's not for UNK or personal gain because they are there already and i think that is quite important when po politicians tend to do good it's usually to get votes
but there are other people apart from politicians who speak out who have public UNK too
well you feel with the royal family they do not need to go round visiting hospitals
mm
they do not need to go erm and th they have their own positions and i think a lot of what they speak is of genuine concern
UNK
but i think you have to remember that a at one time the monarchy were very unpopular you know er UNK during the time of queen victoria they were very unpopular and there was i suppose nearly a republic at the time and in fact the monarchy do have to make themselves popular
if they if they don't become media personalities and do all the things they do on the telly and visit the hospitals then we might very well get fed up paying the money for them when you consider the queen is the UNK person in the world is she not
well let's count the number of times so let's put that to the vote
do you think the civil list should be abolished
button one for yes button two for no
and it may come out very UNK to the er the earlier vote
well no even people think who think that we need the monarchy aren't very keen on the civil list
seventy five of them say yes let's abolish list
i object to the fact that no taxes are paid therefore inequality is there automatically
what we could choose to do if we wanted to keep them as that figure head and as a p r agency almost we could pay them a specific salary similar to other people who work in advertising industry
and leave it at that
mhm
yeah but i agree totally with what and the other lady has just said but the other thing is the amount of money that is spent when you know someone royal is coming for a visit because all of a sudden you know you have people in this country who are living in absolute poverty and yet because the royal sort of erm UNK is going past erm for a few seconds where they stay all of a sudden the front of the house is painted
and there was an instance a few years ago i think where they were going somewhere in glasgow and a toilet was put in
erm but other people for the rest of you know erm the time er that they live in they have to live in poverty
i don't agree with the amount of money that's spent on the royal family
even if their visits give a kind of pleasure that er elizabeth suggested er the th the UNK of UNK visit to brought to the UNK that she works at
i mean she said everyone was delighted to see it
isn't it
mm
worth a UNK of paint
i remember when i worked in UNK and the queen mother was coming and the same thing happened the UNK had to work over time to clean up UNK which is a relatively new hospital
when she did come we were all excited but we all got told to get off the UNK and hide
none of us because we were UNK got to actually see the queen mother
which i think how why did that happen
because she is royal family and we're so little
you know what i mean
i couldn't understand that at all
moira
you would think that i think that the people in your UNK would have been just as happy to see somebody from UNK and you wouldn't have to pay for
yeah
the privilege
mm
and i don't think it's the UNK
neighbours
angela would somebody from UNK er UNK the kind the cash flow from the UNK that companies that yours are looking for
i doubt it
i don't think so
no i mean in industry and also the artists they do enjoy er royal UNK because they know that it is an asset to the arts
mhm
UNK
yes i think er people should hear that er the royal family's had a lot of correction in the past with the outside world and er come and go and you know people know the royal family very well and they attract a lot of business a lot of things go on behind the scenes whether it's from UNK point of view
all also with the great work of princess diana with save the children i think it's wonderful
and i she at least goes and sees what happening i wish some of the politicians would do that and go and see
mm
well nobody's mentioned the queen and i think the queen's done an excellent job
cos she was put in that job when she was only a young girl and she's never brought any shame or anything not like the young ones are doing now
mm
i'm i
there
agree with that lady over there about er queen i think she does a wonderful job and it's come through lately there like she just suffers the same as any natural mother their family the way they live the way their
i know
is
the family she's got
well they're well lo they're well paid for it
but as i say she's a modern outlook is a difference from the queen i think queen elizabeth
she tends to be
you know
say she's a bit depressed and say
well actually i
maybe
i thought we were gonna a new queen
well
a couple of months ago will it will it be maggie
i said we enjoyed UNK
and UNK the royal family we have UNK and criticized them in the course of the last half hour
only thirty five of the hundred here think that we er need this monarchy so let me ask you a final question do you think britain therefore should be a republic
button one for yes and button two for no
and after half an hour of discussing the good things and the less good things about the royal family the vote apart from a few UNK we have worried a few people fo forty three people say we think that it should be a republic fifty four no so there is there's a swing factor in the middle
we don't need the monarchy we don't need a republic either maybe these are the pro UNK people that we're all so worried about
thank you for joining us
goodbye
starting a baby isn't always easy but nowadays doctors and scientists offer a range of assistance
so are we grateful
or do test tubes sperm banks and UNK mothers bring more problems than they solve
the desire to UNK and bear children is a strong one in many women not all of them in conventional relationships
reproductive technology now allows human UNK to be assisted in a variety of ways but such progress can bring difficult decisions for women and their partners for doctors scientists and law makers
today one hundred women discuss some of these decisions and try to identify who's body and who's baby we're talking about in different situations
let me start with a vote do you welcome advances in UNK in reproductive technology as far as you know about them do you welcome advances in reproductive technology
button one for yes and button two for no
and amongst this hundred ninety two say yes
only eight say no
so of the ninety two why
who voted yes and why
yes
i'm not married and don't have any children and i would love to have children and if i found out that i couldn't have any i would do anything to have them
but i think that you have got to regulate these things and choose couples like you may as you do for UNK children and not just like throw in anybody these things have got to be controlled
right so you have some reservations already about what you know is available
yeah
who else said yes
yes
well i feel it's the right of every woman that wants a baby to know what it's like to hold her own baby in her own arms
no matter what i she has to go through
yeah how she gets it
any other UNK
well of course there are other UNK
yes
erm i have children of my own that i had naturally and i said yes but with UNK because erm i i've often wondered in the case of a handicapped baby er that was born to a UNK mother and the UNK mother wanted to keep it simply because it was handicapped or if she knew she was gonna have a handicapped baby the UNK test and if she wanted to UNK the baby but the mother in waiting didn't who would decide
there were eight UNK would UNK would any of the eight UNK like to explain why they don't welcome advances
would any of you like to yes
erm i think really because it's actually a sign of erm self UNK
mhm
in some women it sounds very nice they would do anything to have a baby but what about the baby and what about the baby's rights
you know you're sort of turning the abortion argument on it's head that er in an abortion you can say it's my body i have a right to decide and this baby that dies is never going to be there to question that decision but in this type of situation the baby's going to be there and okay you'll get so many who will just accept their situation and won't question it but you're always going to get some or even one who will say i want to know my origins i want to why i was conceived this way why i was born this way why i have two mothers that maybe a UNK mother and a natural mother
erm that's just human nature
yes hello
i'd like to just like to say that a woman erm who cannot have children erm and re has got to the end of the road no medical UNK miracles can help her erm if surrogacy is the only option for her then they've these pe couples like myself have gone through such a long erm struggle to get where they are that any child that's conceived is gonna be a UNK loved UNK and explained everything's explained to the child as he or she grows up
there's absolutely not doubt in my mind that my mind that a child born erm with a special background will be treated and feel special about it and will appreciate and understand the erm the background of the case and the UNK of th their parents have gone through in UNK in order to have a child
you said that's your experience
yes
yes
i am a UNK parent
so when you say you went through what did you go through before you embarked on surrogacy
erm well my particular case was cut and dry no medical miracles as i say could help me because i had lost a baby at six months during the labour and erm in order to save to my life i had a UNK so there was no possibility of i v f etcetera
adoption was out of the question in this country i think in UNK region there was four babies for
mm
adoption and possibly a thousand people wanting those four babies
so it's erm out of the question to basically to adopt unless you're early twenties and have maybe perhaps eight years to wait
mhm
surrogacy was the last option
erm we went through an enormous stressful time trying to make the decision but in the end decided if this is the only way then we'll try it's either that or be UNK and i can't
and what was actually involved in your case
did somebody else bear er yo your child which was the product of what
my husband's sperm
yes
at that at that time we're only talking a few years ago
aha
host surrogacy i v f surrogacy was not done in this country erm so we ha we made the decision to go ahead as it was with partial surrogacy
it's either that or the united states which is erm on a commercial basis and very expensive
so erm the UNK was artificially UNK herself erm er it took us seven months to achieve a pregnancy and during this time we got to know each other very well
mhm
and a relationship built up especially between myself and the UNK and life was UNK when we UNK and my daughter will always know how much her genetic mother loves her and how much i love her obviously
it sounds to me when you talk about the misery and i'm sure it must have been miserable i don't doubt that for a minute but when you talk about this misery and everything you went through it's a wee bit like the old fashioned way you know everyone was saying my god what i went through you know to have you
you know the misery was from
UNK completely entirely hundred percent from the UNK of the law in this country
we were unsure as to what we should do what we shouldn't do wi will we contact social work will we tell our doctor wha how do we do this that and the other
erm the surrogacy act was very ambiguous
it's from fear of what will happen because you're doing something you're comfortable with you're proud of erm a and at the same time you don't know how erm these authorities are going to react
that's the reason for the misery
not between the relationship
jackie
i'd just like to say that you can have two mothers and that you can two mothers quite happily and that when you talk about women having the right to reproductive technology that includes single women UNK not just heterosexual women
erm i think that it's a right that should be open to all women
ann
i can totally agree with the woman here just now what she's saying but the woman at the back of me just now she'd said about UNK this is a different thing entirely
for two UNK to go and have a UNK mother and bring that baby up is a different thing entirely
this lady here yes
yes i totally agree with what she did
yeah but i ta when i think love i mean a women to women thing but it's not erm UNK or
no
i was speaking about the lady in the back
jackie
just yes it is it's a very different thing but it's still very valid
if two woman in a relationship want to have a child then there is the technology to have a child that's their right to go ahead and have one
i don't think that erm whatever UNK sexuality doesn't erm mean that she's not gonna be a good mother she could be a good mother she could you know just depends on the person on the woman
th there's a whole lot of issues here about erm how the birth mother felt and whether she has
mm
encouraged or put under pressure erm i would think that with a lot more talking we might actually be able to work out something between UNK mothers and UNK mothers they can do it with open adoption other countries were learning how to do it
i think we're all very interested in what's been said but i'm very concerned that we're not actually talking about those silent majority of children
mm
who do not know who their genetic parents are
mm
the thousands of children who are born every year we don't even know in this country how many there are because the figures the can't be kept er and these tend to be children erm born of er anonymous UNK and i think that as a society we are UNK such problems for the future we're creating secrets for families and i would really like to hear from my fellow women here about that
mhm
yes
it is storing up misery for children and i also think these people went through a lot of misery to get what they wanted
it's i want
so in the first place it's selfish second place or maybe the first place it's unnatural and who are who are they thinking about
they want a baby they're not concerned whether it's going to have UNK or have som they are looking forward for a perfect baby
the result is what ten to fifteen percent is successful sometimes they have to go and have the thing done all over and over again
now my view is it's entirely wrong it's UNK it's doing everything wrong
nature intended us to be as we are and we shouldn't UNK with reproduction
i think it's wonderful the UNK are to be made in medicine and they should make in all their research into making the people who are here able to enjoy a good life and fulfilled life
thank you
and not make other don't start reproduction
i mean we are not a an UNK species
can i ask why it's storing up misery for the children
now i'm lucky i have four children no problems as such and i have great sympathy for anyone who goes through all this to have a child
if they're doing it for the right reasons like the lady over there a loving couple with a child
i would go against just any woman having the right to have a child
ca an i just say one quick thing th i i'd really like to reply to this lady she said that it's we're talking about i me all the time but and that we're selfish
why are we more selfish please tell me why am i more selfish than yourself or your daughter or your other colleagues to want a child
why am i se more selfish
well i'm not i just think it's selfish in going in this roundabout way and this is why you're so UNK because you know you're doing something that is wrong
oh no
i have done something which is a wonderful thing that i'm completely comfortable with
can we answer this question about why we're UNK up misery
jennifer you raised the question so you can have first shot
i'd like to
but i'd like to hear other views on this as well
but the people are actually er UNK the issue
mm
i didn't say that surrogacy was storing up trouble for the future
mhm
nor UNK tu UNK but what i am saying is that secrets store up trouble and when doctors are
advising er UNK couples not to tell where their children come from that is the trouble that we're storing up
we've been through the whole thing with adoption
yeah
penny
mm
yeah
if you say that children have got the right to know their father does that extend to the UNK and the UNK
i mean some people are in a
yes that's right
great deal of misery because they know who their father is
mm
and i think being a father means something quite different than UNK from UNK some sperm in a tube or in a woman
UNK
well i'd just like to challenge the whole idea of this right of every woman to have a child
as far as i'm concerned and i've through the whole scene of UNK is about responsibility and privilege it's not about rights and it's responsibility that lasts a lifetime and it's tremendous privilege to be a mother
but that privilege maybe denied to some people because UNK they are not perfect in the way that other people are not UNK perfect and i don't think we can demand the right to
mm
have exactly what we want in life
and if you go down that road in every area of life i think we're storing tremendous trouble for ourselves as a society
UNK
why should we refuse medical treatment to people who are suffering UNK compared to other people who say who need a heart transplant or a kidney transplant
they've just as much right to have medical treatment of what is available
christine
i think i'd like to just take up the point about UNK because i am involved in talking to couples where the there is a basic problem of male UNK where th the husband of the couple or the partner of the couple is unable to father a child because he's not producing any sperm or not producing enough sperm and that couple come to us for help and advice
mm
they desperately want a child between them and to them a child that is born by the mother but is from a different origin than the partner is the next best thing an and most of the couples and we don't advise them that this should all be kept secret we leave that decision to be something that they will erm come to later on when the child is older and many of these couples will decide that this child will be brought as their own biological child and i don't really see that as being any different than many relationships where children are conceived out of UNK or out with the relationship and people make a decision to keep this erm to themselves
UNK
i would like to hear an opinion for somebody who can't afford the twelve hundred to two thousand pound that it takes for surrogacy
well now you've brought up another er element which is
the cost of
they're denied the chance though aren't they
they're denied the they're denied the
it's not just surrogacy of course that costs i mean a lot of er
but did it
but did the
a lot of
surrogacy cost
pardon
er did surrogacy cost
it depends on your individual UNK if your sister has a baby for you she's unlikely to say that i would be UNK for my loss of earnings
it's a it's a you know i can be from zero to going to the united states which is thirty thousand pounds
in fact i was
ma mary
i'd like to say i was a
they don't do that
UNK mother and i wasn't paid a penny for doing it
but i did it through the love fo that i had for the couple and that because they had waited sixteen year before they eventually found out they couldn't have children
and before they were
and they've now
and is it
got a seven year old child who i keep in contact with i've got regular photographs coming i keep into contact with er the now the mother and we all get on really well
was this a couple you knew
i met them through an advert
cos they advertised when before it became illegal to advertise
i bu but no money changed hands
nothing
they paid me expenses which was expenses to hospital and i think gave me about thirty pound for maternity clothing and that was it
and how did you actually i mean did you do all this er as it were in an amateur way or did you do through any kind of UNK wi with the help of doctors or
we were i think the first ones in britain to do it and it was all based on trust and if we made mistakes we made mistakes
but we got through it in the end and their happy and i'm happy
i mean
no UNK
a parent i have two other children i've had one since then as well
i've no UNK
if i wasn't so old now i'd do it again
perhaps you'll er
now what do you think what do you think of that
yes
i think we should discuss money in a in a wider context
mhm
we've been talking about individuals and what they want and we live in a context in which if people want a thing and the and we feel that they should have the choice particularly if they have the money that if to if you look at it in a wider context there are seven million children living on the streets in brazil
part of the reason that they're living on the streets is because of the financing of a foreign debt
there are women who are being dragged out of their houses in the middle of the night to have forced abortion
there are children starving all over the world
now th er these facts are not UNK
well i feel erm really that we should have a little bit more compassion amongst ourselves as women and when i had my first child i had a very good friend who went through the pregnancy with me who is waiting for a child to arrive by adoption and she had the baby a couple of months after i had my baby
and at that time i realized what my friend had gone through and i knew what i had gone through and i would UNK have gone on having babies for erm out of compassion for people who couldn't have children and i would have done it much more naturally
i would have used my husband
and i because er i enjoy being pregnant but i don't enjoy too much bringing up babies
i would be ve very happy to have born
children because i was very happy and very healthy and i would have liked loved to have shared that with the lady over there
yes
up there
erm i'd like to go back to some of the comments that were
mhm
made earlier on about erm women UNK of one woman doing one thing and not UNK another woman doing another
erm i would like to know who is setting the controls
yes
erm on women's reproduction
erm and on what values are they based
because i approve lesbian mothers i approve of single women having children i also approve of surrogacy my concerns are about the technology side who's controlling it and what's what are women's bodies being used for
mhm
and you know i don't want to enforce my UNK onto someone else or my UNK and i really would like to ask people don't try and do that to other women either
who does decide who is eligible for erm whatever reproductive te technology
i mean is it is it harder for single women for lesbian women to get access to the available technology what experience does anyone have
yes
well nowadays since they brought out the new law i think lesbian women and single women are being UNK against because they see there's some erm UNK er need for there to be a father figure around
and so you sa you don't think that's fair
no
yes
it's difficult enough for married couples and er for couples so i mean it must be very difficult for single and lesbian women
UNK
we're all discussing the rights of women
aha
UNK any women to have a child and i'm just wondering how many of us are thinking about the rights of the child
it surely is th the cha a UNK a UNK right to be conceived within the family background and a loving relationship between a husband and wife
well i'm a single parent and i was left pregnant by my boyfriend i didn't have a choice in the matter of having i was quite happy i was in love i was quite happy but i left on my own with a child so where does that leave me
you know i'm bringing up the child the best i can she has plenty of love i love her very much
she's quite happy
so you know it's not everybody that has a loving relationship behind them
well i think it's up to the people your the extended family to support people in your position who do have a child like that
i have several friends and relatives who are in that position two who have been left by a husband and it's absolutely not ideal for a child but compensation can be made by a loving relationship with extended family
UNK
hardly
there are there are other ways to come by children erm i have a relationship with a man who has three children erm he's been married he's divorced separated and i don't feel that i'm replacing the children's own mother i feel like i'm not even UNK i'm just their friend get on very well with them and we share i share UNK if you like with their own mother whom they see
erm
so you did feel a great urge to UNK or bear a child yourself
no i mean UNK enough that was one of the things that almost put me off the relationship in the first place because i'd never had any desire to be a mother
and yet when i met them i thought these are not children that i have to think of as children they're people and they're fascinating
UNK
i was just going to say that the social stigma already attached to erm UNK mothers
mhm
and so a woman having a child on her own without a partner i think that's the biggest fear that th erm that society sees in artificial UNK of any kind
surely it's part of the whole socialization process of women
i mean
mm
we are trained from a very early age that fundamental of UNK is reproductive capability and if we don't carry out that reproductive capability we'd lose part of our identity
i don't personally believe that but i think that's what is forced upon us by society
i'd like to make another general point
mm
because it's come out a lot in this discussion that is there's a big gap between the biological and medical knowledge that's accrued in the last ten or fifteen years and the actual social consequences of these developments and there hasn't been enough discussion and consideration of what will happen
now i don't UNK to the slippery slope view
mhm
that you know what we're go going to be overwhelmed by these erm changes in technology if you like but i do feel that there is a need to discuss changes in relationships in society you know what happens when your UNK actually your mother as well
barbara you wanted in
yes what concerns me a bit about surrogacy is someone was saying earlier that people will pay for what they want but what if what comes isn't what they want
mm
if a child is born with a disability and the parents then don't want it
mm
what happens to the child
what right does that child have
up there
yeah i think people feel UNK about the whole subject of surrogacy because we know that sometimes rich women have paid poor women er for surrogacy or adoption and i think we want that choice to be a free one in which case we have to raise their material circumstances so no one is forced to sell their baby just as no one should be forced to sell you know their blood
well i'm the mother of test tube twins
i was successful at having them
there's an awful lot of females who go through the programme and get nowhere or have unsuccessful attempts
erm these babies are UNK for
loved
when it does happen which is about fifteen twenty percent there is a successful well pregnancy baby at the end of it
i mean i really i can't see why they're gonna be treated any different
no but they can
jan
that was my point exactly if people go through so much hassle to have a baby then surely there's gonna be less chance of abusing all that kind of trouble within the family
they've gone through so much
yes
i'd like to say i'm one of those people who waited seven years to have my daughter who's now eight by the way but i mean erm i was one of those people when i heard about UNK coming in i thought this was a great thing
but my doctor was under the UNK oh yo you've plenty of time yet you've years to come because of all this idea of how much it was going to cost to go on to do other
mm
things or to find out whether you were capable of having children or not
mhm
but what i do object to is erm virgin mothers coming along who think that why shouldn't they use a man
if they so desperately want a child why shouldn't they for one occasion if they are lesbian or whatever use a man for that occasion and let the women who have a family and who want a child and can't have them use this UNK programme which is marvellous
it's just so expensive it's ridiculous
mhm
mhm
i certainly think there needs to be more UNK particularly amongst women lay women and professional women who are involved in reproduction
because i think it's UNK a lot of what's come out of this discussion tonight is that we're actually considering relationships which are UNK
mm
UNK for example yo before the capabilities of reproductive technology became available nobody sat down and questioned whether we had a right to have children or not whether it was a responsibility a right or whatever i mean it's very UNK that we've actually thrown ourselves into a realm where we have to consider all these fundamental things about human behaviour and human nature
mm
in a way so that we can plan for the future so that we can make UNK for changing relationships with people the effects of these things on children in the future
let's
and i think much more UNK is required
let me put one final er question to the vote well it's ninety two of you said you welcomed advances in reproductive technology se several people have said that they don't think women every woman has a right to have a child
so let me put that vote to the hundred do you think every woman has a right to have a child or to try to have a child
button one for yes and button two for no
and you'll be interested to hear that sixty nine of you said yes and thirty one of you said no
now isn't that an UNK vote compared with the first one
any final comments on
that
up there
erm i support i v f treatment and i UNK with the people that can't have children erm but my concern would be with the UNK right
i think it's a privilege to have children it's a tremendous duty but i'm concerned about the children
now you're
on which note we have to leave it i'm really sorry because we've run out of time
thank you everybody who spoke i'm sorry to those who didn't manage to fit in
thank you for joining us
goodbye
not long ago some highly placed career men resigned their jobs because they said they wanted to spend more time with their families
but did you believe them
we've all heard of women giving up work for their children but men
after all the government itself has felt it necessary to set up an agency simply to find fathers who want to spend no time at all with their families
but perhaps that's the minority
perhaps in these days of the new man we are indeed UNK a household revolution in the vital area of UNK
there again perhaps the virgin births and artificial UNK are the start of something very different
let's find out what one hundred scottish women think of parents today
did there's do a good job
are they doing any better
what exactly is a good parent
and how many does a child really need
let's start with a question since you are all children of parents do you think your parents did a good job
button one for yes button two for no
did your parents do a good job
and in this particular hundred eighty five say yes fifteen say no
who said no
would you like to say why
mhm
well i think my mother did a good job but my father was an UNK and that's that made a difference not just to him but to the entire family and i think probably to my own children
and even though he's dead i think it still has a relevance to how i treat my children
so that you would agree you learnt UNK from your father
no i didn't luckily erm my mother's family probably the men in that family i had the influence o of those men and i think that helped a lot
but if they hadn't been there if they had been different kinds of men erm i don't think i would have been able to pick someone to be my husband or my partner who could be a decent father to my kids
who else said no
mhm
well i think my parents did the best they could but the pressures that were on them they didn't do a very good job
what kind of pressures
i'm not well social pressures emotional pressures
mhm
i'm going into detail
ha
who else
anyone else
yeah
erm ma i think my father who's also dead erm took absolutely no interest in us as children whatsoever
and he didn't take much interest in my mother either and that put enough emotional pressure on her to maybe no not be such a good mother as she might otherwise have been
let me ask you another question
eighty five of you said yes your parents did a good a job now i don't know who your parents were or what you mean by your parents or indeed how many you have so let's ask simply an UNK question were you brought up by a mother and a father
button one for yes and button two for no
because of course now there are many more single parent families than there were then
and in this hundred and i think most people here are at least over sixteen ninety one of the women here were brought up by a mother and a father and only er nine by one parent
things have changed have they not
i think the best possible way to bring up children is where there's a father and mother provided the marriage is stable and balanced cos the children have a role model from the father and the mother
they can see parents falling out and learning to compromise and become friends again and that helps them in turn to create a good marriage
mhm
i don't necessarily has to be a mother and father i think so long as they are good role models that they have
i think that's the most important thing
i think it's important that children have both their parents but i think we also need to remember they don't necessarily need to live together in that family
i work in erm family UNK and lots of parents actually manage to stay parents and to be good parents to their children but they don't actually live together as parents
mhm
yes
i think in any marriage or in any family the father and the mother both play different parts and in my own life i can remember things my mother did and things my father did and together it made for a happy home
yeah it's interesting that we talk about single parent families but the two or three people at the beginning talked about erm the one parent the father was in actual fact i know he was actually resident there was probably his erm interest was non UNK
mm
mhm
so we tend to have a different sort of probably if you'd if you ask that question differently you would get a different percentage
mhm
it's not always possible to have a mother and a father
er mine died when i was nine and my mother has been my mother and a father to both myself my brother and sister and i feel she's done just as good a job as i could of as my father could have done
mhm
speaking as a single parent who was left with children of twelve and eight it is very hard and i often think it would be a good thing if social workers were better able to explain to young girls who are left with babies just what it's going to be like
i was lucky cos my children were a little older but to be left on your own with babies is not easy
mhm
er my natural mother er actually had me adopted when i was a baby and erm so i was actually adopted by a minister and his wife and i think erm i would have been brought up completely differently if she she'd just bought me up on her own you know so i think erm oh that's it really
mm
my mum was on her own
i had a mum as a single parent and two grandparents and they did an excellent job of bringing me up
i couldn't have asked for a better family
the majority of absent parents er presently are fathers so i'm going to ask you given the current er emphasis on er in well in the media perhaps rather tha more than in real life on women going it alone whether by necessity or indeed by choice
erm why do you think er fathers are actually necessary
let's put it as simply as that
are fathers obviously they're necessary at the well of course they're not necessary at the point of conception any more but
generally would you think fathers are necessary
button one for yes and button two for no
and vote now
well now are you surprised to learn that sixty of yes but forty of you said no
who said no
mhm
erm i don't think either a father or a mother UNK has to be necessary i think what's important is that children should have access to a variety of loving adults one or two or maybe three of those who they should have a special relationship with doesn't matter whether they're male or female so long as the children are loved and they feel secure and happy it doesn't matter about you know this is mother this is father
it's also very important from the UNK point of view that erm it doesn't matter if you are a so called single parent which i by the way am or whether you are within erm a couple but actually in fact you're a single parent because you're getting no support
the point is that you need yourself to be surrounded by other supportive adults for your own erm UNK and well being and that's why i think erm you need an a whole extended situation and you need to change the way people feel about children so that children have more access to adults in general and adults have more access to children in general
mhm
i am a single parent and i was over forty when i had my one and only son now the father walked out but i never deprived my son of knowing who is father was or what he was
and i find that my father who was old too at the time UNK for the father and i have an excellent relationship with my son
and he knows exactly what his father and he wants to see him he can go
mhm
i've been family member for twelve years and must have seen a thousand children and of those barely fifty had both their natural mother and father
now i'm not a UNK but i would say i it meant that children without both were more UNK to trouble or more UNK to erm lack of parental control or lack of love care there has i mean somebody can draw a conclusion from that but barely fifty
pat
i have to say in comment to that i don't the know the balance of statistics but i've been a lone parent for ten years now although i've pressed button it was because for ten years of being able to have a stable relationship with my children i've got two very stable teenagers and during that the course of that ten years i've been disabled person as well so yes there may be the case that there's trouble with the children of lone parent families but i think there's far too much emphasis on that nowadays
well i am a UNK and i don't think there is any evidence to suggest that children from lone parent families are more UNK to UNK or trouble
i think if you compared people who are struggling with very little resources with very low incomes and with er living in areas of kind of multiple deprivation erm then you would you would find that maybe people in those circumstances have higher rates of trouble and sometimes it's er it's also those areas that are more heavily UNK that children are more likely to be picked up in and picked on
erm so there's all kinds of reasons why children from such situations would be more likely to be in trouble but i don't think there's evidence to say that it's because of from lone parents
now we've had evidence and descriptions of actually quite a wide variety and different kinds of family groups
er single parents UNK parents erm ma th the traditional idea two parents
do you think at the moment society in britain in scotland takes proper account of that variety of options or do you think undue stress is put on one er one or other
i mean i suppose actually the conventional two parent family with er whatever th the current er average proportion of children is
yes
erm i'm from scottish council for single parents and no i don't think it does
i mean i think the er se emphasis on society is still o very much on the nuclear family and there is a great lack of recognition of the extent to which families have changed and i think there's still er hoping that erm mothers and children are going to continue to be supported by the parent and that's UNK with the governments er child support bill that it's erm introducing at the moment
i think that is a big difficulty that the diversity of family types simply hasn't been recognised and anything that's seen as a benefit for one parent families is a political no
i mean if you look in the budget this year one parent benefit was frozen the additional personal allowance that's paid for one parents for taxation was also frozen and the government does not like paying any benefits to one parent families because horror of UNK
i mean people might desert their partner for five pound sixty a week
i mean
well the suggestion is that people who aren't er maintaining a traditional family unit are actually being like being UNK by public policy is that a general opinion
i wouldn't say that was the case in strathclyde
our admissions policy and er pre establishments throughout the education department certainly takes account of erm single parents' situations particularly the stress that's involved in bringing up parents in that respect because it's the stress that's involved rather than
mm
the single UNK itself i would say that makes the difference
mm
yes
i think that it's not just the policy i think it's the whole of UNK attitudes because children learn what they are by how people see them and if they're in a society that says you're in an unusual situation if you're not with two parents then somehow your situation isn't right and we condemn it
then they condemn themselves as well and until society can say that's perfectly alright that's a good situation to be in whoever it is you're living with and that you as a child are okay and are valued then the children themselves will be okay and i think the UNK we lose some of the erm secondary deprivation and emotional deprivation that children in single parent families
now how
get into
how do you change attitudes
assuming you should change attitudes i mean i mean would you agree with angela that we should change attitudes
because wha we're talking about a very age old attitude which is that a mother and a father and their children ar is the correct unit should stay together at least until the children are grown up and probably well beyond
alright
i mean is that an attitude that should be changed
and if so how do you do it
yes
er i think that actually the parents the mother and father they just don't work hard enough at making a marriage work
they decide that
one's UNK the other and the other hurts back so instead of maybe looking at one another they just don't work hard
so if they can find a way at working with one another and realizing that this is their life
and it's the children's lives that they've got at hand
i don't think everybody agrees with that
and maybe
from the from the UNK that i heard
i erm unfortunately er agree with the previous speaker that a very strong UNK runs through me and i believe in the two parent family and also in the efforts that you should make to keep the family ge together but i think too there's sp er perceptions of individuals and particularly younger generations now in society are so much different from my own perceptions when i initially became married and started my own family but what society has to look at the perceptions and expectations of the individuals in society
erm well i tried for years to live with my second husband and it just was impossible
mm
not for just my own children but for my own health
i'm now in a stable relationship with my UNK and it's fantastic
what a difference
but there's still this stigma because we're not married and i don't wha i don't really know how to explain it but i feel that at times my daughter is being UNK to a certain degree because we're not married
and it's just a second
is that
does that suggest
just doesn't seem right
we're happy
that's your first
and that's all that should matter
mm
could policy help to change to attitude and indeed should it
le let me ask you about erm this th the new child support sue mentioned the child support agency which er is going to be established with roughly er the task of chasing UNK fathers who are not providing for their families is that correct
is that a good idea
i mean in fact may i think i'll just let me put that to the vote
should fathers be forced to pay child support
button one for yes and button two for no
and the view of this particular hundred is sixty forty yes say sixty no say forty
who said no
and is it the same forty who said fathers aren't necessary out of interest
yes
well i bought up three children
mhm
on my own brought them from canada and i brought them up without any help from my ex husband and i wouldn't of wanted it any other way
why
well i feel that way he didn't have to have access to the kids and the kids were happier without him
who else said no
yes
yeah i think some people don't want er the fathers having any sort of rights over them they don't want the access er to the children so in a way they prefer to go it alone
erm
so do you think that's UNK legislation rather than helpful legislation
that it's actually trying to enforce a pattern of family life that perhaps a lot of people don't want
erm well it's sort of UNK it's really up to the mother really you know or the single parent
i think it's kind of erm
does anyone approve of the proposed er a agency
no
yes
i don't see why i should support single parents
erm if a couple decide to have children they have children for life it's until they erm get married and i really think we're given too much of this me and my fulfilment of what you can be and you forget that there's two people there or three people who are dependent on you
not dependent on the state not dependent on your neighbours dependent on you
well these days a lot of women decide to have children er o outside er erm certainly outside marriage and indeed outside a couple and that is possible do you not approve of that
not if i'm paying for it
if they if they if they have enough money to do it themselves good o good on them
would anyone stick for the idea of women having the er the being we th the idea of women having the choice to have a child on their own being a good thing
yes
yes i mean you can't erm UNK within a relationship if the relationship is created that works well erm between a an adult and a child that's fantastic
and if somebody knows that they really want a child and they want it themselves and they don't necessarily want a third person then that it absolutely fantastic
let them go ahead with it
as for chasing up UNK fathers that's a complete and utter nonsense
i mean erm you yo the amount of UNK and completely ridiculous situations that is going to cause it is not going to solve any problems at all
all it is the government and state washing it's hands of it's responsibility of and of society as a whole is responsibility is responsible for the children of society
elizabeth
but surely by the women who can't afford to look after their own children they should be allowed at least to have access to their husband so that they can ask for money
i feel very strongly that there are a lot of people who don't have the money and have no way of getting in touch with their husband no way of forcing them to pay up
ann
yes
erm well ha
i mean i think really that erm children benefit from stable relationships within the family unit
the normal family of two point four children or whatever is not the normal family nowadays you've got lone parent families you've got step parent families UNK families policies and services should take account of all the different needs of those different sorts of families and very complex lives they lead these days
should you're saying and therefore you presumably think they don't
i should say that you're speaking you're erm involved with the scottish child and family alliance
that's right
now is that a pressure group or a representative group
it's a representative group
it's a membership group of er professional and voluntary organisations and individuals working with children and families in scotland
are you getting any way in persuading the authorities the relevant authorities both central and local government that they should be doing more to recognise what you've described as the diversity of family options
well we put pressure on but i mean i'm so i still governments tend to feel that the normal family is the nuclear family and as susan said earlier one parent families are seen as a burden on the state rather than a valid new family in society
i tell you what we haven't got onto at all yet and it's something i said we would try and talk about wh which is what makes a good parent
is it possible to define what makes a good parent
is it is it being there
is it yes
i don't think there is a super parent i all you can is your be do your best and that's the best type of parent is you do your best your best ch ability
mhm
love and time
love and time
that are the two main ingredients of being a good parent in my opinion
now the implication of time is that er which who go who UNK the money
it doesn't really matter who UNK the money
erm i have obviously there's a generation gap here in the way that i was brought up and the way that i started marriage thirty years ago
it was UNK that in a lot of cases wives were expected to give their jobs up when they're married but i see now the mo my er not my own children but my young UNK and UNK the men th the husbands are present at the birth of their children they are UNK they are making fantastic fathers because they are taking responsibilities
the wives are having to go back to work to maintain the mortgage and they are prepared to take their part of it
mhm
i think a good parent is someone who's prepared to put their needs and wishes of their children before their own
mm
and prepare to UNK their own personality to some extent for the good of a child
to change your personality when you become a parent
UNK
we talked about things going wrong one of the things that's disturbed me about the tone of the discussion has been the emphasis of rights
when things go wrong when families come into conflict people start talking about my rights
now you're talking as a as a solicitor yes
i am
i am also talking from a perspective of the british agencies for adoption and UNK and it's concern for children generally
erm i don't think we need to talk about parents' rights i think we need to look much more at the needs of children and i think we need to listen to children er particularly when there's conflict we need to hear what they say about their parents about what their needs should be
let's take the issue of responsibility seriously not the issue of rights
to be fair i didn't i did say we're talking about UNK and one could do another programme perhaps focusing on the child or the needs and rights of the child in specific but i think i've been looking at the almost the UNK i suppose of being a parent the challenges facing parents and the whole half hour really has not been about the UNK of UNK so much as the problems of UNK
ann wha what do you make of that
well UNK says we should listen to the children which is what i did i interviewed children of divorced parents five years after their divorce and i found that the children thought that their parents were right to di to divorce the parents couldn't sustain their UNK
but for the children there was a lot of sadness and they desperately wanted as i think all most children of divorced do to keep in touch with both parents and right from the beginning of a separation
it's very important that when parents split up the child has the opportunity to know where both parents are living and how to keep in touch with both of them
i think we have given rather a UNK vision of what being a parent is
and probably rather a er a wo one that will make you think twice if you were thinking of doing it
now i don't how many of you are parents eighty five of you thought your parents did a good job fifteen didn't
let me ask you if you could UNK decisions or maybe you are in a position where you could i wonder whether you would opt for UNK now i mean you be what whether you're able or not able to have children whether you have or don't have but given the choice would you opt for UNK
button one for yes and button two for no
and given some of the difficulties which we've suggested in the course of this half hour are involved
and eighty of the hundred women here say yes despite the responsibilities which have been outlined they would go for UNK
the twenty who said no let's just hear one or two of you why did you say no
given the choice why would yes jackie
i usually there are two categories of women
all of us as women have the right and the ability to give birth that is if we can there's nothing er UNK wrong with us but then added to that there are those who have the ability to be good mothers un unfortunately i don't happen to fall into that category
er but having said that i mean i have a sweet five year old daughter and i wouldn't change her for anything but given the second chance i wouldn't do it again
how do you know you don't have the ability to be a good mother
it's just the strains that i've had to go through raising her up and the time and the energy and just having myself to be UNK you know and well
to make to give her the welfare and i've proved it i mean i just sometimes goes off
i can't
UNK you had the first word you can have the
yeah i'm just thinking
last word
erm one or two here are UNK parents of children not babies but
aha
children and talking about the strain i mean some of these kids are very disturbed but i voted that i would i would do it again
erm but i wouldn't do it without a father
and i was brought up virtually without a well he felt as if he wasn't a father he felt as though he was my younger brother all the time
i certainly would UNK adopt again and despite the strains and she's quite right
she's quite right
but i mean as any UNK parent here will tell you the strains when you adopt a child or adopt children very disturbed children are much worse
and yet i would do it again
which is where we'll have to leave it
i'll tell you one thing listening to the range of views you've heard tonight the different opinions and the different situations whatever you think you're normal
see you next week
scottish women have spent a great deal of time discussing the UNK and cons of being an older women but what's it like being young in scotland in nineteen ninety two
everyone here was born after nineteen sixty eight the year of revolution according to someone
the sixties were in full swing and we all lived whether we like it or not in a UNK society
so here we are the children of the revolution what do they think of the world of the scotland that they live in
that's what we'll discover tonight and let's start with a question a pretty straightforward one
are you enjoying life at the moment
button one for yes and button two for no
and the majority eighty three say yes
why
who said yes and what are enjoying about it
yes
that fact that in a two years time i can go on to do the subjects that i want to do at the university in scotland of my choice
i will be able to do what and law which is what i want and i'll be able to practice it in scotland erm which is something that i think's really good
okay
any more UNK
why
why are you enjoying life
or are they all private reasons
yes
no i've got another couple of years and then i'll be able to do what i like when i like with no parents on my back
do you know what about the UNK
who said no
why aren't you enjoying life
yep
i still don't think there's enough sexual equality because erm a couple of years ago i studied mechanics and when i left college i found it very difficult to get on a mechanics course so i'm back again doing computing to try and get a job
would you prefer to be a UNK
yeah i would have in the first place but it was just impossible
you know nobody wants to take on a girl
seriously
yeah honestly
what about the computing
i mean is that gonna be easier
oh i like yeah i like ma you know computing but i would i preferred mechanics
yeah
what about th er UNK equality
i mean er has anybody else had a similar experience
i think it's actually got better
i'm a second year civil engineering student
mhm
at the moment and i think i would be some people would not have let me do that i think in the past
mhm
but at the moment most of the people i know are saying go for it
mm
but do you think you'll get a job as a civil engineer at the end of it
yeah
yeah
yes
i was doing UNK for two years and i wrote away to companies but they just weren't all that keen to ge give girls a chance
is that a common experience
yes
i'm actually a journalist erm
mm
i work in a newspaper that used to be male dominated and now i would say three quarters of the wo three quarters of the people on the news desk are now women
erm doors are opening slowly
mm
but they are opening for women now
what difference do you think it makes that three quarters of the news desk are women
well it makes it makes a difference in the content it makes a difference in the topics that we cover that we're interested in
erm women don't just want to write about knitting erm
baking which
yeah
one journalist one famous scottish journalist told me when i wo when i when i had ambitions to be a journalists oh don't go into UNK because you're a women and all you'll get to write about is fashion
mm
but that is not the case it's not the case
do you think readers notice the difference
yes
aha i do
we
why
i mean we get enough letters about the pieces that our women write
yeah
up there
well i'm doing a one year course for drama and media performance and
yeah
like years gone past it's always been male dominated but this year there's actually more girls taking it up
none of these males and i found like the tutor he's a male and he is really bad about females being actors
he picks on us to say how determined we are to actually go into the profession because he knows that er although there are more parts for females there it's harder for somebody to stand out
mm
mm
so although th the equality of opportunity may be there the attitudes maybe haven't changed that much or have they
what do you think
yes
well i think if you look at the main jobs in britain all the managers are male and i think it's gonna change when we do have females and males in all these erm these jobs that are managing the main n h s social work
mm
all things like that
yes
erm sorry just to come back er i work for an amateur theatre company
yep
and really i mean you know you can talk about male female bias as much as you like but there's an awful of UNK and not you know a lot fewer actors and a lot better parts for men
and it's something which is difficult to cope with but i work in a kind of environment where it just is sexually biased that's the way it goes
it's not something that can be changed like maybe management but erm it's just that you know to be careful that if you're doing these things there's some things which i think women can do and a lot of things that women should be doing maybe there's other things which just aren't there for them just now
the thing we've all got to concentrate on is the opportunity should be there and they should be there for us
mm
to do it and it starts a lot earlier it starts when you're at school and the fact that women are told that you can do like home economics an and sewing and all that and then they're not encouraged to go into engineering courses
and if that's gonna happen then how are women gonna be able to get on into higher education
mm
and how are they gonna be able to get the jobs
the equality of opportunity and equal pay for work of equal value and all those things are issues which er have been fought over for the last twenty years
now can i ask a self UNK question i mean how well do you think the women ten and twenty and thirty years older than you have done in achieving a better deal for women your age
up there
well i was given a really big chance a while ago it was by a single parent who was an editor of the community newspaper i'm now the business and production manager i'm a single parent my wee boy's three
she lets me take time off i mean she's really understanding
yeah
i think that's what we need is more understanding bosses
but it was a women helping you
mhm
that's a now i've had that experience
may i ask you a voting question actually on that
i wonder what you think
do you think at the moment women have equal opportunities in scotland
do women have equal opportunities in scotland
button one for yes and button two for no
and you'd be interested to know that eighty one of you say no
the nineteen who said yes where are you and why did you vote yes there
who said yes
yes
i don't think i've ever come up against UNK except from in the classroom when the teacher to the economics teacher tries to wind us up by saying women would should be UNK to the kitchen sink
but otherwise
i've had all the opportunities i would want
okay
any other UNK
or do you think she's got something to find out later on
yes
i think there's always exceptions but i think you've got to believe in yourself and go and do what you want to do and if you're saying there's opposition there's gonna be more opposition if
mm
you've seen it there
mhm
i know there is exceptions
so it's not that you couldn't fe it's it was it was actually you who weren't able to find the thing rather than the thing wasn't available for you that's the suggestion
no because i applied for a lot of jobs
yep
and i was better qualified than a lot of guys in my class and yet they left college and got a job right away
and i applied for loads of jobs and nothing ever came back
okay
let me ask you another question or looking towards the future
do you know what you're going to be doing in five years time
button one for yes and button two for no
and thirty five of you say yes sixty five no
the sixty five who said no does it worry you that you don't know or is that quite exciting that you don't know what you're going to be doing
yes
i think as a student i don't know what i'm gonna do and with the present erm grant system and UNK system it's even more frightening because es especially towards women it does discriminate against women and that's why less women are going into higher education
mm
or further education
and with the whole child care side of things as well it is frightening
as a as a student are you managing to cope with er very limited finances or
well i'm the women's officer in my college and i
right
this is what i'm fighting for i'm fighting for equal rights and i'm fighting to get more women into further education cos i think it's a very basic that we all need to go into and it's hard and the UNK aren't there women to go into you've got to fight for it yeah
yeah
erm my mother calls me the eternal student because i tell her that there's absolutely no way i'm gonna look for full time employment
but now that i mean i'm in the second year of being a student and i took on the position of women's officer for the we for the west of scotland area
mhm
and i just don't want to move out of being a student because i find that more and more problems are you know i'm coming up with because like melanie saying there is problems with child care there is erm positive discrimination against women and we are always UNK on the sexual harassment in the college is unbelievable and we have to campaign against this and that's what's gonna keep me being a student
might be useful to find out how many here actually do have children
do you have children
button one for yes and button two for no
and of this hundred fourteen of you have children
now you may vote in fo on this question as well do you have or want children
button one for yes er and button two for no
so if you've got children vote yes on that one if you want children
and of this hundred three don't knows that seems reasonable
seventy six say yes
that's something to be sure of i don't think i was sure
twenty one say no and that's something to be sure of as well
how do you know that you don't you twenty one who said no
yes
i don't like children
i don't get on with them
i just don't get on with them
i can't talk to them or anything so
you
i don't want to be tied i want to leave my options free so that i can do whatever i want i don't need the extra responsibility i mean i'd like them but i just i want my career first
mhm
of the UNK and that's majority the seventy six when
when do you fancy doing it
yes
er the next seven years or after that probably
not so not till you're what
thirty odd
well i'm only nineteen just now
ah but
about twenty five twenty six i think i'll
yeah
sort of think about it then
yep
na i mean answered a yes to that question but i don't think it's a matter of do you want or do you no cos i don't think the choice is there
i think we have to be freed up to have the choice to bring children into a society where that we can go to work that we can do you know fulfilling
mhm
experiences and UNK and you know even in er child care and so on
i think while i say that i want children and do i have a child that i it's not made particularly easy
mm
you have a job and you do the things that UNK a er UNK you to go on you know you know with er any other opportunity
up there
i have got two children and i'm hoping to go to college when my youngest daughter is three cos i can't get her can't go until she is three cos the UNK won't take them until they're out of nappies and three year old
yeah
but i'm desperate to go to college i mean i love my kids and my kids get everything they need but i can't go it's holding me back i can't get my two into the UNK
do you think young men think at all about looking after children or child care
i mean i in your experience is it something that you talk about at all with men
yes
when i done a y t s course
yep
like most of the child care was done by the girls but there was actually a few of the boys that decided they wanted to work in the UNK and o eh the five that done there's actually two that we know of a are actually doing child care as a career
really
yes
now that is a change
and i
yeah
no man of my age who er who are doing child care or anything similar
any other er any other views on this
yes
my boyfriend said he would stay at home and be the UNK and look after the children and do co the cleaning and cooking if i stayed at work
does that appeal to you
no
i'd be quite happy to go to work if erm if i had a good job and my boyfriend stayed at home that'd suit me fine
if i could go out to work and leave the child and do what i wanted to do i'd be quite happy with that
is anybody living in that situation at the moment
are there are any er there any yes
no i just started a part time job and my UNK come and watch them and he's helping me cleaning the house and everything's clean when i come home
we just started last week on this like that
what one week in
well it's every night but it's just a couple of hours a night
yeah but i mean you're one week into the regime
yeah
yeah
how's he doing
good
good which yep
yep
er i'm a first year primary school UNK
mm
student and i've actually come across books now that erm don't say the mother UNK the house it's always a father
there is lots of books that i've got either the father or the brother cleaning and it's not just the mother and the daughter
yeah i what i'm a bit worried about is whether it's come to the stage where girls are now scared to put their name down to take home economics at school
because
because there's like th the male dominated like a male dominated in the class
it might never come to that stage
up there
the thing is er you can end up feeling like a bit of a failure almost like a UNK to UNK if you do take courses that are traditionally female
mm
well i can remember whe when i was at school physics and maths were clever subjects they were male subjects
when er the headmaster when he was reading out the subjects that people were taking for UNK and one girl was doing physics maths and further maths he said oh one of our UNK girls
so the rest of us who were doing arts or UNK or whatever weren't as clever because she was doing
mm
the male subject
mm
and i just think that that's the real danger
can i sa i'll ask another question tha since we're talking about erm er advances er which at one time came under the general heading feminism would you call yourself a feminist
button one for yes and button two for no
and four aren't sure forty of you say yes but the majority fifty six say no
now that's interesting
of the forty who said yes what do you mean by that when you say you're a feminist
yes
i think there's still a need for feminism today there we
how
there were moves made in the sixties but i'm sure that the process is ongoing and we still
mm
need we still need UNK today
mm
yes
now some somebody famous once said erm i'm called a feminist because i say things that is to distinguish myself from a UNK
and i think
and the a the idea of erm the UNK woman in UNK as being the feminist erm and the women that burnt her UNK or whatever was a feminist of the seventies but it doesn't mean to say that the ideas aren't still there and i still want to be treated as an equal but i do i don't see that i should change the way that i dress or the way that i want to act
mhm
because of that it's my ideals
mm
UNK
i think it's possible that a lot of the women here are saying no because of the stigma that's attached to the word feminist feminism
the words the i mean it has always been UNK by men UNK and you know everything
mhm
else and i think that people have to got sort of clarify what feminism is and what sort of what aspects of it they want to take on
there
erm i'd like to say UNK that i think it was a difficult question that you asked are you a feminist
cos it's puts it do i know you were saying about it's difficult to answer yes or no to a question but i in this case it's really true because i answered no but i've got erm i mean i've got a degree in politics and i studied er i did a course women in politics
mm
and i've re i have quite a high awareness about women's position in society but because of that i feel that i've now come to reject the term feminism because erm i think it's also UNK the people who you know it's UNK the women that are holding on to that er label because it is label and that is erm because it's because it's a label it then it's blocking er forms progress for women
and er i think i agree i agree with a lot of the demands that feminist women have made but to kind of UNK it in that way it's bu i mean a lot of wha er white UNK have been attacked for excluding black women and that's one of the examples where you know to be to say that you're a feminist it's not just men that you're UNK you're also UNK other way
how interesting
yes
i think feminism was something that was very necessary from the last generation and we're now standing on the
mm
shoulders of the last generation
mhm
but we need to make a lot of changes with this concept of feminism
and really erm develop something new something that's going to be more equal something that won't discriminate against men and something that er that isn't associated with some more ridiculous aspects of
mhm
of the things that have been associated with feminism
so is it is it as much the word as the philosophy
i mean you suggested the philosophy you suggested that the term has become UNK because of unfortunate associations which may have been imposed by men
i think it is as much that the word is a philosophy but i don't think we should throw it out of the window altogether like i say it's a foundation it's our foundation stone
history
yes
i have a certain degree of sympathy for men because i think you have to take into consideration that men aren't given enough opportunity to feel se er sympathetic maybe again is the wrong word
mhm
but to feel sorry for women and put their view forward because i mean you still the situation of a friday when men go down to the pub and you know they're all jack the lad
men are frightened to put forward their opinion
i mean if a man UNK he's considered a UNK
it's erm even back to school i mean boys wear blue girls wear pink if you see a boy with pink i you know he's classed as UNK er UNK or UNK things like that
i don't think men are given enough room to express their emotions and feelings about things
up there
i think it's men that use feminism or feminist in a UNK term
mm
and it shouldn't be
it's something i'm very proud to say that i am cos i believe in equal rights and that's what feminism is believing in equal rights for women
i mean i think every women sho here should be proud to say they're a feminist if they believe in equal rights for UNK and it's only men that use in the UNK way
mhm
yes
erm what i wanted to say is erm in response to the lady in the red was that a lot of UNK have a lot to answer for because in the sense men erm can be UNK well not UNK but we can say things about men which are UNK whereas if a one man says one UNK thing about a woman then he's just you know UNK is everything and he's got a really bad name to him so i think it's got to be looked at from both sides
i mean i'm definitely a feminist but i'm not a man UNK but i mean i think everyone's looking for the new term and
mm
exactly as alice said the new term is UNK not feminist
and a i mean i think we have you know to be UNK because we don't want to be better than men we just want to be equal
mhm
wanna be a person then
i think erm
this is a good word because it well it's not because of the associations but it stresses the UNK and that's what a lot of the sixties UNK lost i think was their own UNK because they saw it as man's UNK
mm
of UNK onto them
i think it's far too early to give up the term feminist
i think we've still got so much to do to get to equality it's too early to give it up
and i know it's important to be equal in careers and to have equal opportunities and i'm not arguing against that but i also think that perhaps in doing so some women also lose the pride in being a woman and e equality isn't being a man which i think some UNK take that view that they're not equal to a man unless they're earning money
but that staying at home and looking after the children or whatever and bringing up a family is just as valuable as a job or a career
mhm
erm i don't think equality is being a man i have no desire to be a man
erm but we've talked a lot about erm labels being
mm
negative and excluding people but i also think that labels can be very positive and very important and that's i think that's why erm people thought up the word feminism and yeah okay we have to think about the word and we have to think about what it means for us so yeah a lot of pe er people don't want to call themselves UNK because the label has such negative UNK but it does also mean very positive things it's a way of bringing people together it's a way of supporting each other it's you know it's brings solidarity to the movement and people need labels
i thi because the society does want to UNK people so easily and so quickly erm it's a very erm easy quick way of erm knowing where stand
yeah i think it's important like in the nineties that we're facing not like the legal inequalities that we're the faced the generation the sixties but we're facing attitudes that are not
mm
changing
we've now got sexual equality in theory and pay and jobs and status and stuff but we're facing attitudes which are much more harder to change
we've talked quite a bit about the i suppose th the women's side of er of this UNK title what about the scottish side
right at the beginning someone said they were enjoying life at the moment because they were able to do what they wanted to do in scotland
now i wonder how many of you er are expecting to stay in scotland
let me ask you that question
do you hope to stay in scotland
i mean with UNK abroad i dare say but would you expect the rest of life to be spent in scotland or based in scotland
and those same three people keep UNK it's amazing
sixty two say yes thirty five no
of the UNK would you like to say why you voted no
yes
basically because the UNK terrible here and i'd like to move abroad
so you're gonna be heading for the sun
yeah
spain
yeah
okay any other
er yes
i have a strong interest in languages and although now we are trying to teach more languages in school even in primary schooling i don't feel that within er my i'm only eighteen at the moment by the time i'm twenty five things still won't have came far enough along for me to utilize this skill
i would probably end working in europe as well
mhm
because there's no job opportunities over here it's a lovely country but it's simply because of the work factor
so you'll be a civil engineer abroad
yeah
right
well of course there's a great tradition of scots leaving scotland and maybe there's nothing wrong with that i mean there's no shame in leaving is there
i mean of those of you who want to stay the sixty fi the sixty two er wha why do you want to stay
i love scotland and i wouldn't leave
par partly because i'd get UNK and i just love the whole of scotland
i mean i could go from anywhere UNK down to the borders and i'd be i'd feel at home but i wouldn't feel i mean i went down to england for something like four days and like from UNK ma about it must be about ten miles from UNK to the scottish the scotland thing and i was a UNK my head out the bus window to see it
i was i just love scotland so much
yes
i feel a sense of loyalty that after erm the education department has paid four years for me to
mhm
learn my trade that i ought to stay here and put something back into the industry again
what's your trade
erm i'm in government manufacturing
right
and i'd like to stay up here and sort of keep the industry going
yes
that's a very important point
it's sad to see that so many people feel that they have to move away
and job situation maybe is that but i think we should stay here and fight and demand that we have the industries up here so that people from scotland can stay and better theirselves here rather than move away
mhm
so far i've really enjoyed my life well no major complaints anyway and so i'd like to bring my children up here enjoying their life as well
mhm
UNK i mean i live in glasgow the chances of me leaving glasgow are pro pre pretty slim but yeah i certainly don't want to stay in scotland because of any loyalty that i don't think it's given me very much other than a lot of experience a lot of struggle a lot of opportunities to stand alongside working class people and fight against you know the UNK
but i think i'll stay here but i see myself as a UNK as well
i think that the money that is actually getting put into scotland in tourism i mean i come from sterling and
aha
it's sterling is gonna be quite really good in the future for jobs and for everything
erm i just love UNK scotland i think it's got a lot to offer it's beautiful place
i don't think i would leave scotland within the near future because i love iron UNK too much and i wouldn't get in some other places or
yes
well i know there are like problems for women they're UNK against but i think if you've got the drive and the motivation i think you can overcome these problems
mm
ah hands always go up when i'm about to finish the programme and you've been so
i'll give you a er just a couple
yes
it's actually women of our age group that has gotta take the responsibility for to make changes so that women in the next generation have got that opportunity that we did UNK have till now and that's the whole point of it
aha
i was just gonna say we've been talking about equality a lot tonight
mm
and although things may not be brilliant for in the workplace at the moment but we're making a move we're getting a foot in there
in years to come they're gonna be the managers so hopefully we can make it better for someone else
a great positive note on which to end and so we must i'm afraid
thank you very much indeed
thank you for joining us
goodbye
i've got a prop tonight this is it
it tells me on the packet that stopping smoking reduces the risk of serious diseases
actually i've got another one here with a different UNK this one says er smoking can cause fatal diseases
well
i mean i've seen lots of people doing this and er they're not dead yet so here goes
actually hang on
i haven't i haven't asked the people here whether i'm allowed to do this
erm may i smoke
well let's put it to the vote
button one for yes button two for no
well this er hundred women are divided but the majority sixty two say no i may not smoke
so i'm not going to
i wonder why erm i wonder why you said no those sixty two of you
why did you say i may not
yes
three years ago the independent scientific committee for smoking and health declared that there was a ten to fifty percent increase in the risk of lung cancer and UNK diseases for non smokers who became passive smokers
and therefore i would rather you didn't smoke
because i might affect you
yeah
up there
i find it unpleasant and it gives me an UNK so i'd rather you didn't from my point of view
even at this distance
yes i
yeah so you're thinking of yourself
a
no one 's thinking about me yet
but never mind
up there
do you actually smoke yourself
do i actually smoke myself
aha
listen i ask the questions here okay
who el who else said no i may not
you
yes
you have the right smoke yourself and UNK the UNK environment but not mine i'd rather you didn't
aha
yes
i wear contact UNK and it UNK my eyes
yes
i just feel you can smoke in the privacy of your own room car whatever
yes
i feel you can't smoke because you're gonna blow up beds in my hospital ward
mm
right
anyone else
yes
my doctor says i've to avoid UNK environments
okay
it's affected my throat
can i ask the thirty eight who said yes i may why you said that
why you voted that yes i may
well i smoke myself so i believe that i've no right to tell anyone else not to smoke
okay
who else
well i was i'm
yes
the scottish representative of forest which is a freedom organization for the right to enjoy smoking tobacco
mhm
and while i can understand certain people saying that yes smoking UNK my eyes my nose and yes they're quite right they are entitled to breathe erm u UNK air if yo if you want to put it that
mhm
way but we do believe that there should be accommodation in most places for most that we should have designated areas
mhm
for smokers and non smokers wherever possible
mhm
let me just check who what the representation of this audience
no close up vote so you can vote er you can tell the truth here
are you or were you a smoker
button one for yes and button two for no
and amongst this hundred forty nine say yes fifty one have never touched the evil or the enjoyable UNK depending on your viewpoint
do you smoke now
button one for yes button two for no
and twenty six that's just over a quarter of this hundred smoke now
in scotland er in nineteen eighty eight the official government statistics that thirty seven percent of adult women smoked
about thirty percent of fifteen year old girls smoke which is a very depressing statistic
erm the numbers are coming down but they're coming er but in fact we have among the highest smoking rates among women in the world er with UNK effects on people's health
ye you're concerned you're worried
you better say where yo who you're from alison
er i'm the scottish director of ash
which is
which is
action on smoking and health
right
yes
i think i smoke purely out of now more than anything else
i've smoked for over fifteen years and it has become it's something to do with my hands and i think that's what it is with me
have you ever tried to stop
i have stopped erm i stopped once for well over a year and er i went back to smoking shortly after the death of my mother who incidentally died of a smoking related disease
mhm
but that didn't stop me going back to it
i've been smoking since i wa twe since i've been twelve and i just UNK stop and i think it's disgusting
and it's all i've got
i just have a cigarette for to keep you calm
have you tried any other erm
i've tried that UNK you get but it still didn't stop me
behind you
if i don't smoke i eat
that's why i smoke i think
my weight is bu erm heavy enough
so you've tried not smoking and
i did stop smoking for three months and then with everyone else around us i mean i was putting on weight and then i went back to smoking
but i enjoy smoking
i found the opposite
i smoked for twenty seven years and erm i'm getting on to a year now since i stopped smoking and i feel a lot UNK i hated being a victim to cigarettes
erm
mm
but i never felt confident enough to
mhm
to give up and i thought i don't want to fail on my own so i won't even attempt and then i erm i joined this project and that was enough i think to keep me off
mary you actually run that project where do you find your people from
we advertised in fact for people who wanted to smoking but could do with a little help because i really do think that women do need a little help a bit of support to do this
we had over a hundred women in fact we had a fifty percent success rate thirty nine well almost thirty nine of these women stopped smoking and most of them almost all showed a tremendous improvement in fitness in well being and quite a few i won't say everyone felt that i they were much more relaxed
mhm
as smokers but coming on to th the real point of the experiment wasn't to look at fitness and wasn't just to set up a stop smoking project but what i wanted to look at was whether people gain weight or not
so we didn't tell them that was what they were doing i'm sorry
and in fact a third of our eighty people who were successful sorry
a third of the people who were successful in stopping didn't gain weight or gained less than a couple of pounds
does that mean two thirds of the people who were successful
two thirds did yes
did put on weight
yes
now one has to ask does putting on weight matter
i mean what do you think
yes
well erm i actually stopped smoking about er two years ago and was quite surprised at the amount of weight i put on in about five months which was two stone which i didn't think i'd deserved
er i could taste better but i didn't think i deserved erm er two stone
anyway er i fell pregnant into the bargain at the e end of the pregnancy weighed fourteen stone and UNK started smoking again
mhm
to get the weight off
in
mhm
six months was down to the two three pounds under the weight i was when i started
but that took about two years by the time i UNK started smoking to keep it down
amanda
yes
erm i think on that we must remember that cigarettes are a drug
mhm
erm and there are two aspects that they can a UNK and whilst i'm i would agree that many women it is part of dealing with problems in their lives coping with stress that part of that is also withdrawal symptoms from the UNK and
mm
we know from research even amongst very young girls who only smoke a few cigarettes a week that when they try to give up they get withdrawal symptoms and so having a cigarette erm helps them
mm
cope with that
can i just point out also on the weight thing
mhm
you said is it is it er a concern
mhm
it's a concern for the tobacco industry because right from the days they started targeting women earlier on in the century the UNK was reach for a lucky erm ma not for a sweet
and we've seen through their advertising in targeting women that they've tried to post the image if you smoke you're more likely to be slim and UNK
anne
yes but beating i smoke sixty cigarettes a day and i wouldn't care just now if i went up to twenty stone
if i could stop smoking i would stop
have you tried going to one of these groups or UNK or
i've had i to myself yes and it did nothing
nothing at all
will you try again
i could try again yes
well would you like to
for health reasons yes i'd
yeah
to
sue
i think part of the thing about stress isn't so much whether it's a chemical effect but it's a having a cigarette is a way of creating a wee break if you're if you're busy and as a that can be really difficult for women to do actually demand a bit of time for themselves
mhm
you know even if it's just five minutes but it can actually you know you sit down you have a you have a cigarette and that's a way of making a break that you
so yo
that you wouldn't be able do otherwise
so you're using it as an excuse
yeah
yeah
joan
on the lighter side actually my husband and my sister in law and brother in law used to smoke and i got very UNK to this because i sa noticed that they stopped working every time they had cigarette
but i didn't get the break
so i said okay i'm having a cigarette break now
and er this was this is fairly true
you
mm
do stop well you wind down
i find that when women start smoking it's normally in bike sheds behind the back of the school it's a UNK thing
it's
mhm
just to be one of the crowd one of the in crowd and once you've started it's very hard to stop
mhm
i used to smoke at school but i don't smoke now i've not smoked since i left school
but you felt it was UNK
oh very much so
aha
and how did you break the UNK
i threw them in the river
that was it
no more
yes
i work in a school and i know that the pupils they do smoke they start to smoke you know like in first second year
mhm
and er they think it's a cool thing
you can tell the kids who don't smoke from the kids who do smoke they do have an attitude at that age and it
mm
at the beginning i don't think they like it they just smoke and then obviously it becomes it's a drug and then you know they can't get off it obviously and le
mm
it's no longer a cool thing it's a problem
mm
but there still is UNK amongst kids some kids it's smart to smoke whether
oh yes
you're UNK authority or behaving like a grown up or
oh yeah
and they talk about
you know they like to tell you that they smoke
they like to they like to let know that they smoke
yeah
cos as you say just UNK
yep
sarah
yeah erm i er i'd given up erm about se seven weeks ago and i was told that it was an anti UNK and when i came off the cigarettes it was just terrible
you know all these emotions and anger and various other things
yeah
you know it's
but you're sta but you're staying off
well hopefully
well hopefully
yep
yeah
mary
if i go if i could just to bring go right back to a point you made much earlier coming off is exactly as you've described it for most people
mhm
what i most often heard when i phoned people a couple of days in was that it's been the worst two days of my life
mhm
mm
now a lot of people got to the one month happily the thirty nine but only fifteen out of these thirty nine made it to six months
now i think staying stopped is much more not much more difficult but just doesn't receive the attention that it deserves
mm
and i don't i think a lot of that is weight continuing to
mhm
go on like the
mm
lady because
mm
the original the first weight gain the first week ten days is bad enough you only gain two or three pounds but it's all going round your tummy
mm
your waist your waist UNK your jeans don't fit your UNK don't fit
after that
you know the fat just keeps on going
it's
right
very UNK
moira
i used to smoke but i just stopped smoking altogether
yep
and that was about seven years ago and i won't smoke again
right
i found it when i stopped smoking my clothes a UNK
yep
yep
yeah
there was a terrible and i
aha
think there's a stigma attached to smoking now
it's an anti social habit
right
UNK
i think it would be helpful for people who smoke erm to think about just how very powerful a drug it is because i know there have been studies done which show that it's actually more difficult to stay off cigarettes than it is to stay off UNK
there ar more people lapse to cigarettes
mhm
erm and i think people quite often feel very bad when they try to stop smoking i ha used to smoke about forty a day and i've now succeeded in stopped for about four years but i know that i did have several failures and whe when you try to stop and fail you feel extremely bad and low and depressed about yourself and people probably need quite a lot of support
okay
well there's a number of things there i'd like to follow up
can i first of all nail this health thing because er near the start anne said that th the court is still our opinion is still divided on just how bad for you for instance passive smoking is
erm would anyone like to give er the final word on er what the present view on er the dangers of smoking and the effect of smoking on your health
yes
i don't think that there is any doubt that we have known for more than thirty years that smoking is associated with er ma er fatal diseases and er not just fatal disease but diseases but very UNK diseases
mhm
the interesting thing is that it doesn't seem to influence our particular habit forming er take up rates and it doesn't influence it because there is this UNK period between starting smoking and developing lung cancer or developing heart disease or developing UNK vascular disease
mhm
and it is very difficult to influence children e who are starting at the age of ten to fifteen with threats of lung cancer at the age group between fifty and sixty regardless of the UNK that you can describe to them
i mean lung cancer is not a UNK disease
you work with you're a consultant working
yes
with people who have
yes
lung cancer
and i think that even patients with lung cancer find it impossible to UNK stop smoking that is perhaps not so important but what is much more important is that their families find it impossible to stop smoking
and that is something that to me is very difficult to understand
now i that sounds like a cancel of despair at least coming from fo from your view point if there's nothing to be said to UNK people and i'm sure you could if you wanted to give us horror stories and scare stories
mm
but you say that's not effective
no
it's not
i think what we have to do and there are people here that will probably know much more about that tha than i do is pro produce strategies which are much more socially and peer pressure group and acceptable to prevent youngsters from UNK from starting
we have heard for half of this programme how
mm
difficult it is to stop and how people are feeling vulnerable about trying to stop we've got to su UNK sa stop them starting
well we've also heard the paradox that as moira said there's a growing stigma now attached to people who do smoke
mm
but that it's still cool for kids to start smoking
now ah how do you how you um er how do you balance those tho those two different things
alison
i think that it's very important for people who smoke not to blame themselves it is not their fault they smoke
as we've heard from people in this programme tonight most of them start when they're children or young UNK
mhm
they have no idea what they're letting themselves in for
and i think that if people who are still smoking and i think nearly every smoker is unhappy with their habit if they will remember that and think that they can actually do something for the next generation it's not their fault there are people out there are forces out there who are forced them to start smoking and who are trying to get the generation to start
i think actually we need a social revolution
it's beginning to happen
mhm
i think we can protect our children much better than we do for one thing there is a law that says it's illegal to sell tobacco to children under sixteen that law is UNK every day in a large proportion of the er the shops in this city and in scotland
er we by our own views and our own concern could stop that almost over night there's a lot we can do
we can persuade our government to ban advertising and all forms of tobacco er promotion
we can actually raise a generation of kids who don't smoke
we know even those of us who are still smoking know what the what the problems are let's get on and do something about it
anne
i think first of all i think we've go what we've got to get clear that smoking is an adult pursuit
mhm
it is not a pursuit for children drinking is not a pursuit for
mhm
children and neither is sex
so first of all let me say it's a matter of choice
mhm
an adult nowadays cannot really say or even someone in school in secondary school cannot say that they do not know the dangers of cigarettes
forest has never said smoking is good for you
what we're saying it is your choice knowing the dangers to smoke or not to smoke
i believe the young lady over in the other side really told the truth more of the truth than perhaps anyone else she said she liked it
now i know many pe persons who have liked smoking but who have to for some reason or other maybe raised blood pressure to give up and they have managed to do it and quite easily because they have desperately wanted to
but you must want to
mm
it's like eating UNK or any of the things you like doing
okay
can i ask you a anne what your view on advertising is
you say adults should be free to choose to smoke now do you think the advertisement of tobacco should be permitted
it is at the moment in certain situations
yes i certainly do
there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that by taking away advertising you will you will er cut down smoking
absolutely none at all
there is an assertion
i wonder what you think
let me put that to the vote
should all adverts for tobacco be banned
button one for yes button two for no
they're restricted as you know at the moment
and amongst this hundred er thirty six say no possibly for the reasons you said
sixty four the majority in this hundred say yes
there are places that have introduced a ban on advertising
norway is a particularly interesting example where they saw a UNK rate of smoking amongst UNK they introduced a smoking ban er an advertising ban and in fact it's reversed and they they're youngsters are not smoking at the same rate as they were
it's really with regard to the advertising of tobacco
yep
products and i think we all agree that we do have a responsibility to protect children
and what we do from research is that children who smoke are more likely to smoke the UNK that are heavily advertised
mm
and we also know that advertising UNK smoking it makes people think that smoking is okay
so i think these are two very valid reasons why we ought to ban all forms of tobacco advertising
mhm
yes
erm there's another point that erm about choice erm the speaker over there said that we were adults we were free to choose
mhm
to smoke when it comes to stopping smoking there is an element there where people don't have the choice to stop smoking it's portrayed as something you do if you have the UNK
a to make it easy to stop smoking you need to have freedom from stress you need to have leisure you need to have circumstances
mhm
which make it easier for you to stop and a lot of people don't have the choice to stop if you look at it in that sense
yes
i think another erm aspect about smoking is i'm not a smoker but i often wonder if er smokers feel used by the amount of taxation on cigarettes
er you know they're actually paying money to the government every time they buy and every budget day the cigarettes go up
er th they must feel that erm you know it's getting UNK and UNK and is it is it all worth it
mhm
is it worth four hours of oxygen therapy for somebody with a cons er an airways disease
you put these people on oxygen therapy for days and days and days they come off and say can i have a cigarette
no i'm sorry
it's worth every penny to put the tax on cigarettes
another thing about smoking although nobody's denying it's bad for you is the fact is that it's overwhelming the core of women who smoke who also have worst UNK they also tend to have worse stress it's used as a very convenient UNK
yep
or catch all UNK when there are these other factors involved which are contributing to health problems
mm
because it's a lot easier for a government to say if you stop smoking it'll be alright than to deal with things like poverty
mhm
th erm the other one that came up was erm er and even anne agreed that er smoking if you must smoke is for adults not for children now how do you erm we've touched on advertising is there anything else that might be done to UNK children from smoking
anne has said that giving them th the UNK facts doesn't really impress them
UNK
i think there are various strategies that you can adopt with children i think the first and most obvious is work through the educational system through schools and there's been many excellent school's programmes developed
another method which is becoming very popular is to UNK the school work by having smoke UNK clubs for children
the really scotland is leading the way
there's actually some very good news on this front and there's now five or six clubs throughout scotland and the aim to encourage children obviously to remain non smokers
mhm
and we do that by communicating directly with them erm in their homes and it's proving a very popular strategy
you know the beginning when i said may i smoke
and sixty two of you said no i mean are any of you er do any of you impose the stigma of being a smoker on other people
do any of you say to your friends don't smoke
do you say no you can't smoke in my house
do yo UNK
both my parents smoke and my sister UNK and i can't any longer be in the same room as them
i it used to be something i put up with when i was younger now if my parents come to visit i ask them to smoke in the corridor go out of the door open a window something because i found it affects me so badly
and i would like to find some way of saying to people who do smoke for instance even on the top of buses where it's now banned you know please don't
but they take it so strongly they become so aggressive that it's almost more trouble than it's worth to mention it to people
mhm
mhm
i'm er ve very strongly against smoking and if someone comes to my house and asks if they can smoke i do say no and i ask them if they wish to smoke if they would go outside
but i take it a little step further because if i do go somewhere like a bus and people are smoking then i'll actually approach and ask them to put it out
i've done that on trains i've done that on a tour bus quite recently and of course the response you get can be very aggressive and that's sometimes quite hard to handle but i take the UNK of always checking before i go somewhere that i'm going to i'm going to be backed up for example erm before i go i purchase my holiday i actually checked with the tour company that they didn't allow smoking on the buses
mm
so if i feel i'm in the right and i fe i feel i can impose that upon them
do you think the day will ever come when we don't smoke
i mean i know that's what glasgow two thousand we various people here are er are hoping that smoking will become a thing of the past do you think do you think it will
i should ask anne
let me ask you
no
i don't think it will
and i think the main question and the best question that could be asked to the audience if they really
mhm
think it through is that do we want to live in a country where it is normal to see an advert wi under the job section saying no smoker need apply
would we like to live in a country where a UNK er UNK or whatever you would like to call it is used at the work
not to see if they were smoking at work but even in the privacy of their own home would we like that
as far as the children are concerned i would say that children always break the rules
if it's there
if there's a tree they will climb it UNK fruits always taste the UNK
and i think that the more you UNK the thing the more attractive you make it to a child
but maybe you can educate people out of it rather than ban
any
mm
other thoughts
yes
i'm interested i don't think anyone here has suggested the UNK measures which you stand to
but that's what's happening
erm i think what we've shown here is a shared concern about this whether we are smokers or non smokers
a particular concern about young people
mm
kids live in the same world as adults the advertising the pressures are there and i think we also this important point that it's women's health who's already most disadvantaged that's women on low incomes with very
mm
little support are most affected and we need to er go back to what UNK was saying about education we need to help young girls get self confidence more se coping skills to deal with these pressures but also as other people have said we need to get the government to look at the fact as that encourage women to keep smoking and address those issues as well
good discussion
thank you all very much indeed
i hope you've heard something that er meant something to you
if you need help i hope you go look for it
if you're all trying to give up good luck
and UNK
feeling blue
what do you do
one hundred women have an idea or two
talking about depression is not something we do much which is odd really because everybody gets depressed and vast numbers of us need help from time to time
though because perhaps we feel guilty or embarrassed about the whole area of mental health we're not tackling the problems when they come up nearly as well we might
so we're going to try and start to change all that now
let me ask the one hundred women here have you ever been depressed
button one for yes and button two for no
and perhaps the only surprising thing about that result is that is that seven people have said no
ninety three have said yes
let me ask you whether you would regard yourself a UNK person
would you say are UNK rather than simply get depressed
button one for yes and button two for no
and there only sixteen say they're UNK er people eighty four no but the great majority here have been depressed from time to time
about what
i mean th a great variety of things are depressing but can you identify what makes you depressed
lack of money
sorry
lack of money
lack of money
and that's something that must be a very
aha
common one
aha
and then that your household is well the sort of er someone's lost their job you know you start what are we're gonna do
you know how are we gonna manage
mm
etcetera
who else
ya
after a baby
baby blues
baby blues
did you have baby blues
yes
after my last one
just after one
after the last one
what's it like
absolutely terrible
horrendous
what did you
i well i just didn't realize it was anything like that i had i've had four children and the last one there was thirteen years difference between them and it was really terrible
he was about six months old and i didn't know what was wrong with me
how long did it last
about three months before i finally i was husband made me go to the doctor or go to the doctors for me and that's when i realized it was depression i didn't know anything about it then
really
had you not been warned
had you not
no
read anything
no
yes
sometimes you don't need anything to make
mhm
you depressed
mhm
sometimes you've got a UNK illness
you know a UNK or a UNK or whatever
yeah
beside you
living with somebody UNK has made me depressed on frequent occasions and th the feelings of UNK that you have in dealing with the person's depression
yeah
erm one of the things that UNK me is probably the main thing that UNK me is not being valued for what i am or what i do and i think many women suffer from depression because their strengths and their UNK are not recognised and valued
mm
anna
being a single parent
is that depressing
yeah cos there's on your own all the time and you feel you've got no time for yourself and that can be fairly bad at times
yeah
er it's not just single parents i think er married couples as well cos i think
yep
society expects everybody to cope well and they don't
so i think that can become quite UNK as well
up there
i think from what everyone's saying being a woman in scotland today is that in itself er a cause for depression
i think trying to exist in society at the moment is extremely difficult
and there's wi wide er spread unemployment and there's the stress of being as that lady said a single parent erm for women who work and have families they have their old conflict between what they're doing at home and what they're doing at their work and who should have a priority
so i think erm just a combination of trying to get through the week can be a sort of depression for many women
how do you cope with it the ninety three of you who get depressed from time to time whether it's severely or not so severely
i think it's a matter of giving yourself time of accepting that maybe you're feeling low or i fe when i'm feeling low i say right i can't cope with things i've got to give myself some time where nothing's gonna bother me if i can manage it an hour half an hour just doing something for myself that i really like and that helps me once i accept myself as being depressed then it helps UNK the stress involved with it
is that something you think would work for everyone
i think it's worth a try
doing something you like if you can give yourself half an hour or an hour you know just say this is for me and for me only
mm
i think with erm i was brought up in a household where it was com completely legitimate to admit to being depressed and that you would just have to cope i think cope perhaps my most
mm
least favourite word in the entire language
women coping all over the
mm
place with
mm
all sorts of terrible stresses and the only sort of legitimate reason for UNK is to allow somebody else to cope beautifully with your collapse
i think with er it's very interesting that people are actually UNK that they feel depressed and they have strategies for dealing with it
i'm sure it's re relatively recent
it probably is
it'll be useful
mm
to hear more of the strategies
yes
i think it's important to get a listening ear and know that there are other people around who will give you support
you have to search that out
i'm not su absolutely convinced in terms of saying
mm
having an hour away from it is enough i think there are a number of women who need to look and get support from somewhere
is that hard to do would you say
erm i think well i think it is at times
i think in terms of people knowing in terms of women knowing where they actually can get that support from
and also actually getting them there themselves there in the first place is very difficult
where's the yes
i think it helps if you can identify whether the erm depression is just caused by erm the circumstances round about you which can be UNK by changing them or if it's caused by eating habits or erm or erm UNK or chemical UNK in i've suffered i think from all them as well
say like erm th stresses we're all under will cause depression but after my had my children i suffered from reactive UNK low blood sugar and we that was UNK and i think an awful lot of women erm suffer th from this and it's not erm found out and knowing the UNK i can understand how a lot of children erm suffer from er problems with eating habits because i think this is being discovered more and more
mm
and i think society should be erm trying to get to the root cause of like chemical UNK and eating problems rather than just putting people on tranquillizers
well i wonder how many people here i mean ninety three people say they ha they th they occasionally do get depressed i wonder if you ever have taken er mood controlling drugs such as tranquillizers
have you
button one for yes button two for no
it's erm it's regarded as er as an increasing problem er amongst women
thirty nine have
now we're talking about how you cope the thirty nine who have do they work
don't they work
would you recommend it or wouldn't you
and obviously everybody has a different experience of this
yes
er i actually had two UNK babies one year after each other and they put me on valium and it didn't do me any good at all
and my little boy was he was only about three at the time and i used to be used to angry at him and my neighbour used to come in and take him
and i was married to a soldier so i didn't have any family round about me at the time so it was it was pretty hard
and coming off valium was a lot harder because you don't realize that when you're on it you can't get back off it again
did you did you get help coming off it
erm
well you were obviously well you prescribed it in the first place
well
that was supposed to be help
it was it was actually there was a programme on television and my husband took me to the doctor and he said he felt i'd been on it too long i'd been on it about six months and when i come off it i come off it pretty quick and i ended up erm i didn't know what was wrong with me and it ended up i've now got UNK and they didn't know if it was caused through erm i took a stroke about three four month after that and then i got the UNK as well so they don't know if that me coming off it
mm
straight away i just stopped it
down there
erm i was erm put on just for in ninety seventy three and your question that you're asked was and from nineteen seventy three till three years ago erm i know took my causes i trust put my trust in the doctors and erm over all those years i didn't realize that it was actually the tablets that was causing me the mental illness
and saying that in the last three years i since discovered and it was quite difficult to which i did find that there was alternative erm UNK which was lots of groups that were going on and once i got into it erm the it opened up a new you know i ne i've never saw the light at the tunnel that is shining UNK now
has anybody had the opposite experience with er with the kind of the drugs we're talking about whereby they have been helpful and th and they and they would recommend them
yeah
er i think anti UNK can be helpful for a certain length of time but not for over a UNK period of time
erm and i think there's a big difference between them and tranquillizers and people tend to get the two mixed up
i think tranquillizers can be useful as well for a very short time limited period
erm but i certainly found anti UNK helpful
mm
yes
yes
i just wanted to say that speaking as a UNK
mhm
valium is not an accepted treatment for depression and that we have excellent anti UNK drugs particularly ones that have come just in recent years that are very effective for depression and i think bringing a great deal of benefit to depressed people
well ray say i mean it's important that we yo you find out whether you are UNK whether you have er ag oh something UNK wrong with you whether you're just feeling a bit down
but perhaps we don't really know enough and we don't know where to go for information i mean i don't know er i i'm not an expert but there are experts here how would you assess the services available to people who feel they do need help or for people who perhaps don't know they need help
yes
yes i think the situation in scotland is very poor
i'm an alternative medicine UNK and i tend to get a lot of people who are depressed coming to see me people who have been through the normal routes
mhm
gone to their UNK and often have been given some sort of medicine for their depression but haven't had the counselling side of things dealt with and they've just been given re UNK not necessarily seen every time for a re prescription
behind you
i think there are a number of counselling services available but i also think it's very difficult sometimes for women to get there
mhm
and it's something about the shame around depression that we don't actually come forward for counselling and there's certainly not enough free counselling services in scotland
there
i'm also an alternative UNK and i do find that this is one of the major problems that ninety percent of my patients who come to me suffer from stress and depression and really what has happened in a lot of cases is that they have been put on valium and drugs they find the side effects are UNK
and actually really in a last resort in many cases they come to you
mm
mm
i went through a period of depression erm i'd been attending the doctor i'd been told that i was suffering from various illnesses but nothing helped
i was given anti UNK that didn't help and it wasn't until four years later when they actually admitted me to hospital and then an UNK and the depression disappeared once it had been diagnosed
but all the time i'd been attending the doctor i'd been told first of all it was UNK stones
mm
then it was something else
mm
then it was something else and i honestly thought the doctor thought i was cracked
there's nothing the matter with me
and i was taken into hospital and it was an UNK and the depression disappeared after that
mm
there
i think speaking as another UNK er the medical profession do have to look very carefully and perhaps how a lot of the damage has been done er with how women perceive whether they can ask for help or not because a lot of the women here have raised been giving tranquillizers and my colleague across there has pointed out that tranquillizers are not an appropriate way of treating depression
mhm
and diagnosis is very important that if you have a medical clinical state of depression try and pull yourself out of it by your own efforts and doing alternative things is not necessarily going to be effective
and diagnosis is very important as a UNK again training our medical students we are trying to do a lot of education along that line because perhaps some of the older UNK along the way have not recognised the importance of this
well i went to a UNK once looking for a self help group cos i didn't want tablets or anything i just wanted somebody i could talk to
mhm
but what i found when i went was i had to go through the UNK to find this group cos it wasn't available
my doctor didn't know anything about it
so having gone there i got counselling which i found was very useful to me
more useful than all the UNK and so forth like them
so once you found it
aha
it was helpful
yes
up there
yes
now when i took post UNK depression i asked my health visitor you know where do you go
and she sent me to a mother and UNK group i mean she didn't tell me about any self help groups it's mother and UNK she just said take you and the baby and go to mother and UNK and that'll be it
and that's all the help i got from my g p
beside you
i found that erm we run par a self help group as well for ladies with post UNK depression
mhm
and i found for me personally and a lot of other mothers that it started in pregnancy
now i don't know if anybody's had the experience but they're only interested in your UNK child they're not interested in how you feel at that time
i mean you think you give birth and you're forgotten i mean your health visitor visits your baby and then you've got the baby blues and we are trying to do something to get them to help and warn people about when they are pregnant it can happen because it does start then not after you've had the baby it builds up and them UNK it hits you
yes
i think mental illness isn't taken seriously enough
i think that er there's a problem first of all you've identified that women experience er depression and i think that's not taken very seriously by policy makers and people in power na namely men
i think women get depressed but men suffer from stress which is somehow more respectable it's more macho it's associated
with work and
aha
you know there are all sorts of means of dealing with stress
mhm
which are not always open to women
but it's more pu you know it's almost de UNK mo amongst certain types of executive to be suffering from stress
and i suspect it's the same kind of actual physical complaint that women who complained of being depressed have
yes
women have a lot different stress than men
men
mm
go out nine to five to work they are stressed nine till five women especially women with children have it twenty
mhm
four hours a day they don't have a nine to five job they're on call twenty four hours a day and that's a lot more stressful
mhm
i think that men tend to rely more on a UNK such as alcohol i don't if it UNK
mm
the problem more but it tends to be men that cope in that way and women aren't seen to cope as well maybe they just don't use things like alcohol
mhm
as much as the men
well i'm UNK involved in UNK which is a christian run telephone UNK erm we off also offer free counselling and they find that er there's more men will actually pick up the telephone cos they're not seen erm whereas more women will actually come in for face to face counselling
i think it's a stigma that a lot of men feel they can't show that they're depressed or they've got a problem so they'll pick up a UNK a phone
yes
well as the speaker before last mentioned men are in fact diagnosed twice as often as women are suffering from UNK
i think men tend to act out their depression more than women
yes
i'd just like to raise a point that erm most men are UNK er mo most of the UNK are men and that a lot of the diagnosis i feel come from a very sort of UNK view erm you know a lot of have sort of brought up the alternative sort of er medicine and er self help groups and to me having been through UNK which is a huge machine that is very difficult to get out that er to me that's the only future and there's millions of pounds going into UNK and we're reviewing it now with community care plans which i don't think anybody is actually clear about but er you know the millions that are put into UNK i'd like to see more sort of counselling er become available or more money given to sort of er mental health associations
mhm
following from what was said there we know that there's that there's a limited pot for mental health because that's the way it's going to be we've been told that so there's a real big job for women
mhm
to look at er a p r job about changing the way those resources are used so that they're used in the way that's been talked away er talked about tonight which is way that clearly many wo many women want to see them being used
and women have to got to get out there and ensure that the people who do plan the way that these services are operated and managed an all the things UNK that women have a real say in that
which women
the women who are the professionals in the field or being
no
the women who will use the services women who have used the services in the past and women who will use them in the future and that's all of us
now say more about that practically because i mean if you're depressed you may feel too depressed to go to a professional you may have great difficulty getting there for whatever reason because you're ashamed as someone mentioned you're embarrassed you don't want to admit you can't cope which is a syndrome once you get there how do you UNK up the courage to say well actually what your offering me isn't good enough i've heard on television there is something better and i want it
gosh
there'll be other people here who i'm sure who have done it
but it's up to organisations like the ones we work for to respond to that and to not be doing the planning on behalf of other people
yes
i think we're still talking here about depression and how to go and
mm
find a cure erm perhaps we should try and think about why we get depressed in the first place i know there's lot of people who co here have had problems
i think it's important to find space for ourselves which sometimes we just don't do
you know find things to do to occupy ourselves in other ways
you mean cope
mm
well no not cope but to
to enable us to cope we have find space for ourselves do something purely for ourselves rather than always be thinking about our children thinking about the home thinking about the family we're as important and i think that's what people must realize to begin with
yes
i suffer more from a feeling of guilt perhaps than men do
i think it's part of a vicious circle that sometimes it's guilt which leads to depression and then women feel guilty about being depressed and that's why they take what is on offer to them
i think there's a great UNK of UNK amongst women that they're trying to be all
aha
things to all people all the time
research has shown recently that erm a life event such as you described can UNK depression in someone who's self esteem is low and i think this is where we women are more vulnerable
although we've advanced a great deal in the last fifty years we still have a way to go and our self esteem is lower than men
i want to turn this right round because a couple of people have mentioned guilt and er i suspect that one of the reasons that women are a bit worried about talking about depression or campaigning for changes in policy or more funding or whatever is that for a long time women have been thought of as the UNK sex more emotional more nervous by a male establishment i'm talking about past centuries isn't there a case for saying there's actually we have a right to be depressed i mean obviously it's normal ninety three of you get depressed from time to time the majority of you don't think you UNK if it is if it's normal to be depressed shouldn't the services to cope with depression if we need outside help be there and there's no shame in it
i mean you've got the right to go to the dentist the right to go to the doctor
yes
i think what would be helpful for all of us is to think of our er mental health rather than mental illness
mhm
and er you know it's part of a spectrum and if we're all as aware of er mental health as we are with physical health now and if that was carried out in public education campaigns and in schools i think you're right we would have this right to mental illness as part of a overall mental health
ray
erm it is part of the e education curriculum and design the development of inter personal UNK motor and UNK skills apparently
so if the experts e actually gave me galloping UNK because on one
hand i thought UNK and in the other hand will we make as UNK bigger mess of this as they did in multi UNK teaching methods in a UNK approach to learning
what are the experts view on this
how are they going to manage to implement this without making the situation any worse
you'll blind us with science if we go into that right now
yes
erm i think one of the important bits is th the issue of why is
part of it why people get depressed
and i think it's a great deal of it is to do with failed expectations
whose
and people get depressed like when they're dealing with UNK that's an event in a person's life and causes short term dis short term very intense distress but that's different from the way we're constructed through the media and all sorts of ways to be super mothers super wives super UNK and a super this that and the next thing which none of use can meet all these demands at one go
but because the media hold out these expectations as the norm and people can't meet them all they then feel failures
aha
and that is also why going back to a point earlier on why i think erm counselling and alternative medicine and so on is UNK it would be such a rock to the social order to actually acknowledge that people are in distress because it's the social order that's causing that distress
it's the media again
but it's UNK
and the UNK society
but
i just wanted to bring up some of the underlying reasons for depression and one of the large things that society is having to address just now is child sexual abuse
mhm
which er in my profession as well i come up against all the time and i think that we're not really UNK that is very often a cause for men and women
mhm
er of future mental health problems
beside you
yes
i wonder really the only rational UNK response to the world at the moment isn't to be depressed i mean everyone looks around UNK in africa and war and jus and UNK
mm mhm
all around us
mhm
as well as more domestic problems within scotland of unemployment and so on i mean really depression should be regarded as a normal response
mm
and what women are experiencing half the time is perfectly rational
yes
i don't actually believe that depression is normal i believe that we can overcome depression and i think there is some creative things that we can do out of a depression people can become stronger they can tap into their resources inside with support and help so i can believe it's a positive experience
mhm
i think that it's important to recognize that to have a depressed mood is not to have a depressed illness
mhm
we all can get depressed if we're talking about a mood state that's not an illness
depression as an illness is not normal any more than having an UNK
mm
or a UNK is normal and i think again that stops people for asking for help because the they're not sure whether it's a depressed mood or an illness
if it's an illness it's a stigma
i think it's also part that you know you're walking along the street and you bump into somebody and they'll say well how you doing today
say oh i'm fine
you never say i'm depressed and they're never really listening for you to actually say how you really are
our society goes round all the time expecting everybody to be fine to be happy to be UNK you know
you're not allowed just in your day to day life to say to somebody unless you know them really well it's the UNK today
well i'm afraid we're out of time there
there is help if you need it out there and i hope you may have heard something helpful tonight and er if you feel inclined to change things i think everybody here would encourage you
UNK
four legs good
two legs bad
unless you're a chicken or to put it UNK animals have rights too
but exactly what rights do they have
and does supporting animal rights justify violence
the animal rights lobby is a UNK one by various means some legal some not some specific some violent
UNK seek to convince the UNK that animals deserve a better deal
which animals
and what's the better deal
let's find out
and let's start with a basic question here in this nation of animal UNK do you think animals deserve a better deal
some animals
all animals
any animals
do they deserve a better deal
button one for yes and button two for no
this is a descriptive vote because this hundred er women are not a representative cross section of the whole of scotland they're invited to come from various places and ninety six of them think that animals deserve a better deal
when you said yes to that which animals did you mean
and what were you talking about
yes
i think a lot of people see the stray dogs problem as a big problem certainly if people have decided to UNK of pets they have a responsibility to look after them and not throw them out on the streets
okay so
and i think problems like that are due to human UNK
so those animals do have a raw deal
okay that's one area
who else said yes and why
up yes
i think animals that are used for human entertainment definitely deserve a better deal for example large wi wild animals that are used in circuses we haven't got the right as people to say that they're here for our entertainment
what would that better deal be in that case
the better deal would be not being transported up and down the country and not being made to perform tricks that are un unnatural to their own behaviour patterns
aha
aha
any other views
yes
i think that er concern should also spread to animals that are UNK pleasure as well i e the UNK foxes UNK i mean there's quite a considerable list that's all done for entertainment
mhm
now the better deal there presumably would involve
not chasing them at all
not hunting them at all
no
i mean
okay
let them live their lives in peace without the harassment of chasing them with dogs and supporters and what have you
okay
any others that yes
i don't think animals should be ta used to be tested for UNK
mhm
UNK or UNK
mhm
different things like that
what about medical research
well there again yes with reservations because if it comes to the fact that if it's going to save human lives yes
yes and you get all the animals who are UNK on and you sa there's not a week that comes out and you don't an a report saying oh well this causes cancer in rats or and you imagine the amount the huge amounts of the sub whatever substance it is that had been given to rats to cause the cancer and there's no knowing that the amount that's gonna be given to rats causing cancer will give cancer to humans
i mean i it's just absolutely ridiculous
i'm a trustee for the beauty without cruelty charity
aha
and we would like to see an end to all experiments on animals for UNK household product purposes
hasn't that campaign been going for
oh many years
a long time
yes
and we're making progress now
how
there are already many alternatives to the research carried out on animals which has been going on for a long time
erm for example you can grow human skin in a in a cell culture and use that as a as a testing er medium
mhm
instead of a live animal
we can it can use erm a si similar substance for eye tests erm to test to replace the UNK eye test
mhm
which again has been used for a long time on animals
these tests are very misleading
they don't protect bu su er the public they protect the people who are actually manufacturing the products
now do you think that the campaign th the th the campaigns against the use in UNK testing had anything to do with the changes that were brought in or do you think advances and responsible er science would have would have made those changes anyway
i think inevitably th the changes would have come because the alternatives are better
yep
they are less misleading
ah but i think the campaign the public campaign and the pressure that's been put on companies have definitely made quite a quite a difference
yes
while i agree that there is absolutely no justification for testing for UNK purposes at all
absolutely
yes
none
i think we would have advanced to the stage we are at had we not used animals in the earlier stages for medical research
we're UNK all the time and i think there may came a time we won't use animals at all for medical research but at up till now we needed to use animals for medical research
i think you've got to be realistic about this whole issue that er obviously seeing the poor UNK little UNK suffering for UNK
mhm
yes
i agree that is wrong
but if a test on a UNK would save my child's life i'm afraid i'd go for the test on the UNK
okay
yes
erm i think that one of the erm UNK in using animals for any kind of testing is that it sort of UNK in some way using alternatives
and i think that you know people who they may be trained when they're a studying to
mhm
use animals and then go onto to work using animals and erm you know if maybe alternative techniques were introduced at an earlier stage maybe in their training they'd be more likely to them on board
but it's almost like it's the established pattern to use animals to test
mhm
all sorts of things and it's gonna take quite a big UNK to get out of that
mhm
yes
i agree with what that lady's just said
what i find horrible is that there are so many organisations or places all over great britain they're all doing the same sort of tests
can't we UNK our knowledge so that not so many tests are having to be done on all these animals
yes
yes
erm being with the s p c a i have seen a lot of very sad pictures of animals but one of the UNK photographs i saw quite recently was two UNK well they're UNK we are
yep
part of that family too and they were in a lab awaiting UNK and they were in UNK side by side and they'd stretched their arms out and were holding hands almost as though to give each other comfort
mhm
UNK feel pain
they feel happiness sadness and they also have a sense of humour
under the nineteen eighty six act
mm
they have stated that all use of animals must be justified and it very carefully UNK by the home office as well as locally
i mean it's UNK etcetera
yeah
yep
are always present in research establishments to ensure the well being of the animals and very often there is actually no pain involved in the research
how do you know that
well i was told by somebody who's involved in animal
right
research
right
but er frequently the animals are used for the research and there's no pain involved at that time and they are killed UNK before the research actually takes place
but do we find it acceptable that animals should be used however UNK the event
well i would rather use an animal any time that my own child
up there
er UNK is one country that has banned the use of animals for research and i think we ought to be going along these lines that if animals have rights we ought not to be using them for UNK
mhm
and if we were to ban the process th erm we would devise other means for research would we would find alternatives
there
th there'll quickly move it somewhere where we can do it
it's quite
alright they move it out of UNK but if we can't have it here we'll have it in pakistan or somewhere where they want the money
so it won't make any difference in that
yes
respect
i do not think that research has gone as fast as it should
mhm
and it's going to be a long time before it's going to be possible so therefore we still have to use animals i see no way round it
mhm
and i know that they're using cultures and things but i still think that we are a long way from not using animals
up there
erm can i can i move this conversation on to the
yes
th the UNK side
mhm
erm we've covered the fact that animal models don't always reflect the human situation but if we're going to understand control and UNK disease in animals this sort of work must go on
could i go back to something the lady here
yes
said about the animal procedures act of nineteen eighty six erm i know she's been told about the animals are killed UNK and that they suffer very little pain where there's any pain at all but in fact this act erm which is governed by a committee only erm issues guidelines as to what might happen
no matter how serious an UNK there might be of that act they are not subject to any sort of criminal offence
sh shall we try and see what the er what the general feeling on this is
do you think that er the use of animals in research is ever justified
er button one for yes and button two for no
research there being either on behalf of animals themselves or on behalf of er of humans
is research on er the use of animals in research ever justified
and this particular hundred are creeping in with their votes but have decided seventy fo seventy seven of them say yes all be it th by far the majority and twenty three say no
could anyone say what the consequences would be if they weren't available for use in er in the development of human er UNK and treatment
well i wouldn't be here because a horse was used for a toxin to provide the anti toxin for diphtheria whe in my days when i was younger there was no toxins as such UNK as such and so therefore the horses were used for research to provide the anti toxins
so do you think people who would like to ban the use of animals in research are in are in cloud UNK land do you
yes
would any of you twenty three like to defend your position
yes
erm i'm just not sure why any person would think that they have more right to life than animals do
i mean what gives you more right to life than an animal does
anyone wa
just because we have a so called UNK nation that we live in that UNK the world that UNK animals that UNK the environment we're living in
you know where's our right to life come from
i think you can far too UNK about it
erm humans are more important than animals you cannot gi UNK an animal life with human life
we are the intelligent order
being intelligent we hope we won't be cruel to animals but you can't say that we are animals are just as important as humans
mhm
wha why do you think we are more intelligent than animals
well for a start
you know because we can have television
we could
UNK
no
we can reason with each other animals don't reason with
but
other
we have conversations animals don't have conversations
we are we are living in a world we are living in a world where constantly there's violence does that happen in the animal world
yes of course it does
of course it does
of course it does
to the same extent
they're horrible
animals are terribly cruel to each other
n no well
yes
i can't accept that
surely if intelligence is the answer you know what about mentally handicapped children
they're not intelligent does that mean they're just the same as animals
if intelligence is the criteria then an awful lot of us in this room would be used as test animals
mhm
we have a choice if we want to be involved in research
mhm
whereas animals don't
they have no
mhm
choice they have no say
mhm
there yes
how do you know that erm animals don't reason
like how do you know what goes on like with UNK with UNK with all sorts of species of animals like we don't know well we're so dense we can only see things like this
we don't know what goes on there we've got no right to interfere with their lives
yes
i think i think we're UNK one erm
mhm
great power that the individual has instead of being ing UNK about erm our views on animals in research we could quite simply exercise our power not to buy the products to ask questions of our
mm
of our doctors what kind of drug it is
what research goes behind it
do to exercise our individual intelligence to examine the facts on no on the basis of our own conscience individually to make a decision and we can all do that
we can buy a different type of product
and there are many
mhm
companies now erm which quite obviously UNK that fact on the UNK of UNK for instance they do not test on animals
so you're saying the consumer pressure could change things
mhm
it it's every effective measure
mm
of stopping erm a certain product it simply will go out of production
i would disagree that er humans aren't used in experiments because i think that we're all being used at various
points in our lives for experiments medical or otherwise
mhm
and erm a lot of the UNK that are passed er have been passed to a certain degree and then th the we become the animal
are you speaking as a as an experienced UNK pig yourself
well i'm a UNK erm
yes
so to a certain extent th the human that was introduced in the last few
mhm
years has is an experiment
how do you feel about that
i don't mind being used as a UNK pig because i feel that it'll help people in the future
up there
i believe that we have been given the right to have UNK over animals
the point i would like to put over is i've listened to one or two erm radio programmes and television programmes about this and i personally would like to have more evidence of what actually happens to the animals
i don't think us er public people really realize what is going on and i think then they would maybe stand up and be
mm
and be counted but i think we've tended to stand back and just say well we know it's going on but what is actually being done to these
mhm
animals
yes
yes we that lady over said there were guidelines there were people that go in and inspect but there are not enough it is a known fact that there are not enough people to go and inspect all the establishments where animal erm UNK are taking place and i love animals and alright yes yo you can do ex some experiments on animals but let's not be cruel
that lady up there said that we have experiments i'm sure human experiments you know experiments sorry on human people
mm
but on human beings but we're not put through the state that animals are
we
mm
don't have great lumps made to grown on us we don't go through she severe pain
and which company was it that says to do something about pain you first have to create it
mm
ah i mean that's terrible
i was responsible for UNK into the so called cruelty free products for beauty without cruelty and it was a real can of UNK
i was
yep
i was sorry i got involved in it at one point
erm UNK companies are very UNK
it's what they don't tell you that's important
erm there is a big problem at the moment with UNK labelling for example erm just exactly what does cruelty free mean
what does against animal testing mean
these are the kind of things that are actually on UNK products
mm
it could mean erm against animal testing but i go along with it anyway
it could mean erm cruelty free er erm who de defines in that case what cruelty is
er not tested on animals might mean by me by but by someone else
and it all sells products
and beauty without cruelty has been involved recently in having er trying to put forward an e c erm directive on th er the labelling of UNK but it's very difficult
and mainly because of those kind of problems
yeah
yep
what do you mean by erm not tested on animals
the finished product
the UNK
ingredients are tested for other reasons too not necessarily just for the UNK and UNK trade
i think that one of the outstanding erm criticisms that i would make of the whole programme in research with animals is the fact that only two licences have been UNK i think you said
mhm
on now i think it's a bit like factory inspectors and i talk from experience on this er th o i me everything gets cleaned up before the inspectors
mhm
arrive
if you report something you always get the same reply nothing wrong when we went round
mm
i'd like to move with th er i think tha wi given wi though we haven't got all that much time can we move onto another area that was brought up at the beginning of the programme which was erm the use of animals in recreation and er lisa particularly mentioned hunting now she thinks hunting should be banned do you
do you think hunting animals should be banned
various animals that UNK in this country foxes in some places UNK are UNK er in some places
well
there's an interesting result
seventy nine of you think yes hunting should be banned
for the minority twenty one say no
would any of those twenty one feel brave enough to say why they said no
yes
well i so should er be unhappy to see the red UNK a an abolished scenario
but erm i think they could instead have an electric fox if there's such a thing
or a drag and there's no need to interfere with the fox at all
okay
yes
they say that UNK for er human pleasure er i mean personally i've only been to one hunt and i don't see what all the UNK about because the UNK is only a UNK it's the hounds that are hunting the fox and it is to keep the foxes down
what's better than UNK shooting poisoning
mm
what's more UNK
so you think UNK fair enough
from my point of view yeah
yes
beside you
yes i would have to i'd have to disagree with er my colleague here
erm i it's not the shooting is most certainly as long as it's with a qualified UNK
mm
it's most
mhm
definitely less cruel than hunting because the animal is chased and er what it's heart is doing while it's being chased and it's really is the UNK quite horrendous to me
and actually hunting doesn't kill all that many foxes a hunt probably erm kills one an at a meet if they're lucky
but hunting does maintain jobs and countryside people often say
would anyone like
mm
to talk to that
yes
well coming from a rural community
erm hunting and shooting and fishing are very important to the
yeah
economy of the community and to have UNK creeping in and trying to dictate to what has been the foundation of the of their economy for many years is almost ridiculous
mhm
down there
i think the idea of taking a fox and having it ripped apart UNK by our society is a bad message to pass onto our children
when children nowadays are becoming more responsible to our society and they see us as one world we have a responsibility to protect ourselves and our world and that includes the animals in it
the seventy nine of you who voted for UNK hunting a are you all UNK do you not understand th the fabric of er of the country
do you have an alternative to offer that would er that would sustain that fabric
yes
i live in the country i live in the heart of the country right next to a sheep farm and there's no co no message at all from the farmer that foxes are a UNK it's a UNK put about by the hunt
fox hunting was started two hundred three hundred years ago by the UNK because there wasn't enough UNK because the fo the UNK were getting UNK by the same pi the same people it was started as an entertainment it's an entertainment now
and now the hunt are turning round and they're lying about what they're doing they're saying it's UNK control they're saying we do it it's quick it's a sharp nip in the back of the neck
it's not
the hunt encourages foxes into their land they actually build artificial UNK we saw one of saturday when we were out UNK the ar they encourage foxes onto the land so they can hunt them
a hunt is no good without foxes
they don't want foxes
alright
to be UNK at any way they encourage them
so you actually go out and do something about
yes
your er your feelings
wha what do you do as a UNK
we actually i'm actually er in the scottish action against blood sports
aha
and we do many things we write to UNK we write to councils trying to get them banned off the land and we've been very successful
we've actually helped stop the oldest hunt in scotland in li UNK in UNK which ended last year
we were very successful then and we've now progressed
we go out every single saturday UNK if we can and we try and stop the stop the fo hounds killing the foxes
so
UNK
so you're proud of having stopped the oldest hunt in scotland
very
right
i'd like to disagree with that
ah
i'm an ex master's wife from UNK in UNK hunt and we had to stop because erm the country was disappearing underneath us
we had a new
mm
town built in our country with two motorways and the towns have all expanded to great extent and that was why we had to give up it was nothing to do with our friends the UNK
it was creeping UNK then it wasn't
creeping UNK
so wha
yes
what do you do now with the what do the old the old UNK people do
well we've we just have to er UNK and bear it
there is nowhere else to go for us
yes
i would like to ask the UNK how they can justify the fact that they ill treat hounds and horses
now i
personally have had a horse actually had things thrown at it by UNK
i feel this is cruelty to horses
yes
that's just absolutely rubbish
i mean we don't
well you
can't you can't
like er you can't say that she might have something thrown at her horse cos maybe you weren't there and maybe
generally speaking
mm
erm i mean people who spend their entire saturday doing something that they i mean i don't enjoy going out every saturday
i mean i'd like to do the things that my hobbies but i go out there because i care and i see that i feel that it's necessary to actually stop these people UNK an animal for fun and if i'm that concerned about animals i'm not gonna UNK to hurt a horse or the hounds
i mean i ride myself i have dogs myself i mean it's just another excuse from the hunting UNK turn it round blame the cruelty on the UNK when really there wouldn't be any UNK if there weren't people to kill foxes purely for fun
do you want to come back on that
yes
erm we ha we have had horses and hounds and damaged but apart from that i would ask the speaker who i what
mm
or who is the UNK
after all the mouse has a cat so what is the UNK
do you know much about fox UNK
yes
mm
have you ever looked into
i'm willing i'm willing to listen to you
well the i think these people who concern themselves very much about UNK the UNK and don't of fox hunting if they were to spend a little more time about looking into the research of how foxes actually live
three hundred thousand foxes are killed annually in this country either through hunting which only UNK to a small two point percent shooting UNK all of which happen during the hunting season as well
so i mean these foxes are still widespread and UNK they can sustain seventy percent losses so what human intervention are you doing
i mean ha how can you say that killing fifteen thousand foxes a year is helping to control foxes
up there
i hunt regularly
mhm
because i breed UNK i also am a farmer so i wear two hats but i've actually seen foxes sit down we move the hounds move in si sit down and scratch in the middle of a field and then they think ah
right we're off
but in fact from a farmer's point of view they are a su a nuisance we have a man who co who supposedly raises pheasants he UNK them he also trapped my dog and this is him ah justified his justification was there were too many foxes
erm
and so therefore we don't particularly pretend that they are
mm
that hunting justifies the end of killing foxes but it does preserve country life
we're going to have to close UNK because it's been very interesting and er a very UNK ninety six people think animals should have a better deal seventy seven think that the use of animals in research is justified at ti from time to time and well over seventy
except
think that hunting should be banned
and my final question to you just out of UNK is are you ve a UNK
button one for yes button two for no
i could of said do you eat animals but i decided that would be UNK to those of you who
are UNK
so in this very animal loving assembly i think er you would agree er only twenty one are UNK and seventy nine people love animals but they also enjoy UNK on them from time to time
wo would er any of you animal UNK like to say something about that position
yes
yes i would
as an s p c a representative
and also as a farmer if i
mhm
might say i'm a beef farmer erm i enjoy my beef very much my philosophy is that erm if we're going to use animals we're going to eat the their time here should be as UNK they should have as UNK treatment as possible and they should be free from fear UNK and pain and when the time comes for them to go they should know as little about it as possible
yes but they never do
you might say that about the human animal really mightn't you
yes
thank you all very much for a UNK and interesting discussion
thank you for joining us
goodbye
thank you very much
let's have a look at this finger
gentlemen can we have a bit of quiet please
UNK neil colin
what did you do to that finger lisa
i UNK it in the car door
UNK it in the car door
sorry about that
i'm doing a mr
right
don't worry
where did you UNK it
here
across there
gentlemen
this may hurt a little bit
right
ladies and gentlemen
er just quietly while i'm checking UNK finger
what's happened lisa look if i press those two fingers can you see they go white
yes
that one goes red and that one stays white much longer
the circulation to that finger is poor and i think there's something UNK with the circulation
also i know you had it UNK up but the skin there has gone white and i honestly think that ought to be x UNK
to be perfectly UNK with you i would suggest that erm that wants doing fairly urgently
it wants checking over
can i just feel if you lift your hand would you please
it er it's not that bad
it doesn't hurt
yeah it's not that i'm worried about
would you have a feel kelly
mm
can you tell whether you think that UNK than the rest
yeah
yes i think so
your circulation to that is poor and that wants looking at quite urgently
seriously
erm is anybody at home
no
i think you ought to get that x UNK
right
ladies and gentlemen
sir why have you got that on your er
right er let me explain briefly what's going on
mr 's daughter i think it's his daughter er is working for the british national corpus and they are looking at the how words are used in ordinary everyday situations
and what they've done is they've asked various volunteers UNK call them what you will to be er recorded while they are carrying their out their normal duties
so
i might have known
it would you be you UNK
is it on
it is on yes
when do you switch if off
whe wh when you get a bit angry
let me just very briefly read you one or two of the things it says
we are asking a large cross section of people and organizations around the country to help by allowing us to record their conversations
meetings UNK and so on both in private homes and on company premises
these recordings will then be UNK onto computer and built into a database which will contain several million words
why
sir how UNK the tape
forty five minutes
and the aim is that the conversations are going to be anonymous and they are trying to compile a dictionary of words that people actually use rather than a dictionary for people who do UNK
oh
sir will you erm wh if you change the tape will you tell us
well i've er turned the tape over after side one which was my first lesson and i'm now doing side two which is this lesson and the idea is to look at the s way in which language is used
it is very interesting the way two different groups react to the same situation
now the other group realizing that of course this is serious research project were of course
wh
quite sensible
on the other hand there are people like neil and UNK who are obviously trying to make names for themselves
right
er ladies and gentlemen
sir er can you pick up from away with that
yes
thank you
my teaching point starting off today
thank you
is starting off from UNK fingers
eh
eh
why what did she do
she trapped them in a car door
there you go sir
now there's a serious point from starting from there because
there are three main components of your blood
white cells
yep
next one
red blood cells
red cells
red cells
no they don't absorb carbon dioxide
alright then
it's the UNK that does this which is your last one
alright
so your three components
your major part of your blood is the UNK which carries the carbon dioxide away the red cells carry the oxygen and the white cells fight disease
and the red cells are far more numerous than the white cells
what erm bit of revision for the UNK what is special about the er red cells
why are they different from all other cells
no nucleus
no nucleus right
the red cells contain which element
UNK
well UNK is
UNK is the red colouring compound that carries the oxygen and gives the red cells their colour
what element has to be present in UNK
iron
iron
right
that is why somebody who is sort of iron is UNK
shortage of iron makes people UNK get tired very easily the reason being that there is not enough oxygen being carried round the blood
that's why somebody who's UNK and somebody who's got blood loss suffer very similar symptoms
in both cases although for quite different reasons there's not enough oxygen being carried round body
now iron is the crucial element there and it gives it this red UNK
when you suffer UNK you what you're doing is UNK the UNK in the er skin
so the UNK are the very fine tubes that carry the blood around the body
and for the UNK again if er if you look at the UNK in the body there is no cell in the body requiring a blood supply that is more than one UNK of a UNK away from a UNK
so your UNK are all over the place
now if you damage yourself by whatever way and the classic one that we see at school is if you get UNK in the eye in rugby somebody UNK you in the UNK or something similar you then get a swelling caused by what
what's happening
fluid
fluid yes
the blood is actually UNK out of the UNK into the surrounding UNK and you get several effects
so let us say er well let's take an example you've just been er hit in the eye by a hockey ball hit by our friend jonathan
a sort of typical everyday school accident
or you've been er UNK on the elbow by jonathan with a hockey stick or something similar
or UNK in the face by natalie
mm
well apparently UNK has it that the doctor at the hospital who dealt with these last cases was saying words to the effect that er jonathan just put jonathan in a situation and he'd keep the hospital in business for UNK
so let us say you've been hit in the eye accidentally by a hockey ball
very soon afterwards because of that blood UNK into the UNK what is that wound that injury going to do
UNK sir
UNK
it's going to UNK
because of the blood coming out UNK out under pressure into the surrounding area
what colour is it going to be
red
pardon
blue
red
right
so a black eye starts off red and it starts off red because of the blood UNK into the skin
if you feel it what is it going to feel
sir
sore
well apart from feeling sore
it's going to hurt right cos of nerve damage
if you actually feel its temperature
warm
it's going to be warm
the reason it's warm is because of all that warm blood that's UNK into it
so when you first get a UNK injury those are the sorts of things that happen
the chemistry comes in as to what happens later on
now the red blood cells and so on have UNK out into the surrounding UNK
they are then the fluid eventually absorbed and the swelling starts to decrease
what colours does it then start to turn
yellow
er green
right
blue black purple green
UNK orange
yellow
and you get a real spectrum of colour changes
and the reason for those is the iron in the blood is being UNK by various substances in the body it's being broken down into a form in which the body can UNK that iron and during the process you go through all these colour changes because of the different forms of iron oxide being produced
so when you get a UNK that's a nice yellow colour UNK green you know it's a very old UNK
when we're doing first aid incidents erm the standard thing we're doing for adults when they're doing a first aid exam is we'll give present them with a casualty with perhaps a cut hand or something like that and they'll actually have a black eye
and quite a lot of the adults will try and treat a black eye
now when i say a black eye i mean one that actually looks blue black and is quite UNK
what's the point about that black eye
it's old
it's an old injury yes
if it's gone black it's a least a couple of days old
so chemistry in action
when you start turning funny colours
tha that's because the iron is er being broken down in the body
now
taking the chemistry a little bit further there are two sorts
thank you very much
there are two sorts of conditions in the body
right
what does what is jane UNK into in a big way
and don't answer that one i want the honest legal answer
fit erm fitness things
fitness things
called what
several ways to
come on
UNK
UNK right
right
this is actually tying this up with an exam question i was looking through some past papers to try and spot things we may not have covered in detail
UNK
the whole point about UNK is that your exercise is done with plenty of
oxygen right
so the key thing with UNK is lots and lots of oxygen
that means that the food in the body is burnt up totally and effectively
what fuel does our body actually use at the muscle level
what fuel does our body actually use at the muscle level
produced by our UNK from the food that we eat
right you're on the right lines
it's sugar
er you mentioned UNK in fact the one that is actually produced
UNK
UNK
if you are very ill to save your liver having to do any conversion work to convert UNK into UNK you're actually given UNK and UNK solution because your muscles can use the UNK erm UNK without any further conversion
so when you're very ill you get UNK and UNK
the salt is to make up for any salt that you lose
so UNK look at burning that oxygen with the sugar effectively and completely
a UNK will actually work in different way altogether
anaerobic
anaerobic
good
now
anaerobic UNK
yep we'll come along to anaerobic UNK later
anaerobic er is without enough oxygen
now a UNK beforehand will actually be on the blocks and will take in a lot of oxygen to try and UNK as much oxygen into their blood as possible so that when that gun goes off they will aim to have all of their red cells where possible carrying oxygen
during that ten second or less dash for the line they will actually be using up oxygen faster than their bodies can take it in
that's why UNK when they cross the line very often collapse many of them because they've used up their oxygen so much so that there's not got enough and their brain switches off UNK and they collapse
till they faint effectively
and they use anaerobic conditions
they don't have enough oxygen because you just can't breathe fast enough to use up that oxygen in that tremendous burst of power
that's why UNK can't keep it up
UNK
i'm going to wish i hadn't said that
anaerobic conditions m er mean that the sugar the UNK is burnt with the oxygen and actually forms UNK acid
now UNK acid
now UNK acid
yeah UNK acid
is poisonous
is poisonous in one sense
gives you stitch
what yes
neil say it again
gives you stitch and UNK
yes gives you stitch and UNK
yes
UNK
that's why when you've been running hard you've got the stitch or whatever that's caused a UNK of UNK acid in the er muscles what you then do is your muscles say enough
you end up er collapsed taking deep UNK and what that is trying to do is that the deep UNK are circulating oxygen into the body the oxygen is then able to break down the UNK acid into other substances which are less harmful
sir on that after you've had food does more UNK more often than when you've had nothing to eat
right
good question
if you take food is absorbed in a form which your body cannot directly use
so you don't get bacon and eggs er floating round your UNK
so for that to happen for that food to be converted into a form that your body can use it's got to be broken down
broken down in your liver and your liver has to do work
yes
the liver to do that work has to have a very good supply of oxygen
if it's breaking down lots of food a really heavy meal then it's actually maybe making such a big demand on the oxygen level in your UNK that your oxygen level in your UNK drops and there's not enough to go round the muscles to make to break up any UNK acid that's being formed
because your heart isn't being given the UNK that says hey i'm exercising i need to pump more blood round the body because i'm doing exercise
the UNK just quietly working away churning this food into blood UNK using up quite a high level of oxygen and the rest of the body is suffering
that's why UNK considered bad for you
taking it a stage further we've got a situation where we have two types of bacteria
two types of UNK
we have UNK bacteria which need plenty of oxygen and anaerobic bacteria which do not like oxygen
and somebody mentioned earlier i suspect it was colin over at the back or one of those
about anaerobic UNK
and at the sewage treatment works and this again is on the syllabus folks so you need to bear it in mind the sewage works they make use of both sorts of bacteria
in the early stages of the sewage works when they're dealing with the liquid they use UNK bacteria
so they warm up the water sometimes they either blow warm air through or at stoke UNK they whip up the erm sewage with fans which beat air into the water and the UNK bacteria digest some of the harmful substances in the sewage
the UNK is then separated off and that is heated in tanks away from oxygen where anaerobic bacteria break the UNK down into an UNK substance and produce UNK gas
the UNK gas is then used as a fuel round the rest of the power s er in the power station to provide electricity for the rest of the sewage works
so you have two sides to this
UNK anaerobic bacteria
now anaerobic bacteria include things like erm tetanus and another one which is lovely is gas UNK
let's have a look at tetanus first of all
where do you find tetanus bacteria living
hopefully not in you
hopefully not in you
yes i'd agree with that
in the dirt
in the ground
yeah
that's right
soil
particularly in soil in areas where there've been cows and things in the past
and if you think of the country as a whole er you'll find tetanus in most areas of the country
for example here is an old farm
it's an old what
well if you look at it this was called top valley farm because it was the highest valley coming out of the city
the farm that was here we've got the name old farm road because of the farm
when this school first opened the estate over there hadn't been built yet and the farm buildings where still there when the school first opened
the what estate
the estate
the what estate
the estate where you've got and er and all those names
just down there UNK
right gentlemen
now then
if you scratch yourself and you get soil into it
for example there was a dear old lady who was UNK her roses UNK herself on a rose and er a little bit later died quite UNK of tetanus
the only thing she'd done is make a small scratch with a rose UNK and was unfortunate enough to get a piece of contaminated soil
sir when did it stopped being compulsory for you to have a tetanus UNK
it's not actually compulsory now
er you
but they like sort of push you to have one don't they
they do indeed
and the reasons i'll come onto in a moment
cos i'll er thought i'd explain to you what happens with tetanus
the reasons they push it on you is that young people particularly do activities that are liable to get infection
like for example you get UNK of skin ripped off by er people's football boots and you get soil underneath the flap of skin and obviously you've got ripe conditions for tetanus infection to get in
as an adult adults such as myself haven't been through the procedure as a young person where your immune UNK been challenged by the vaccine so that you've developed tetanus antibodies
you will have been protected hopefully from birth or shortly after birth by the tetanus vaccine which will have caused you to produce antibodies against it
and because of that i believe they recommend when you're stop your school UNK you have a top up every ten years
now in my case i have got buried away in the depths of here somewhere my tetanus vaccine card
if i can fi here it is
the doctor who last saw this said it's somewhat of a museum piece
as you can see it's just er mm even with its sort of
plastic cover to try and keep it nice it's looking a little bit er worse for wear
the reason is that in fact i acquired this on the thirteenth of august nineteen seventy two
i wasn't even born then
that's right
so that is twenty one years old
not only that it says the accident department in nottingham general hospital
exactly
erm so that shows what a long time ago it was
and it says you have been given one injection of tetanus vaccine absorbed and another of tetanus UNK
these will protect you for a short time against tetanus
now you lot have all have the tetanus vaccine
you haven't had the tetanus UNK
and you're about to say hopefully what is the difference
the difference is that your body takes a long time to react to the tetanus UNK sorry to the tetanus vaccine to make antibodies against it
during the time that your body is trying to make the antibodies against the infection that infection may well spread so rapidly through your body that you become seriously ill indeed your life may be threatened
to protect people who haven't have your course of UNK what they do is they inject the tetanus vaccine into a horse
the horse makes antibodies
they then draw off some of the UNK blood remove the UNK containing the antibodies return the blood to the horse and these horses are used for producing the tetanus erm antibodies
so what you get is an injection of the vaccine like you have and a UNK of the horse UNK
and the horse UNK er allows the tetanus antibodies from the horse to fight any infection you have got
how come they use the horse sir
why a horse
because a horse has got plenty of blood and doesn't miss a bit of blood UNK off and then returned
right
also a big animal like a horse produces lots and lots of antibodies
now the problem is this human beings are not horses
and when you've had your tetanus
when you've had your tetanus antibodies from the horse UNK you then normally develop an UNK to the horse UNK
if you then get it a second time you will then possibly have an allergic reaction to the horse UNK
now you don't get tetanus cards to carry because you've not had the horse UNK
i have to carry my tetanus card so that if i was er injured and unconscious and not being able to say that i've had the horse UNK the doctor thinking oh look he's got lots of soil in that cut er give him a quick injection of the horse UNK that could actually be fatal
now UNK tetanus
tetanus is a anaerobic
thank you very mu
thank you very much for telling me
right
as i was saying the er
tetanus the old name is UNK
and it's an anaerobic condition that gets into the nervous system and causes nerve UNK in such a way that you get acute UNK
what happens is this that your you know you've got two sets of muscles
your muscles normally works in pairs
there's one muscle that pulls your arm that way and another that pulls it back again
i think the proper word is and UNK will correct me if i'm wrong UNK muscles
yeah that's right
one works one way one works UNK
now in UNK
what happens is both muscles contract together fully
so you've got one muscle trying to pull your arm that way another muscle trying to pull your arm that way and your muscles become rigid and locked
there h have been cases where the person's back muscles have pulled up so tight that their they've formed an arch
their head has been in t touch with the bed their UNK but the whole body's been UNK like a bow with the UNK of these muscles
does this happen in your jaw or
no it's all over your body
but it's called UNK because er one of the stages is that your jaw actually locks solid
is there any like a cure or have you got to
yes there is
death
mm
well that's what i was going to come to
there are now only two places in the country that actually deal with tetanus poisoning
one is oxford and the other is in leeds
er
sir what do they do in scotland then
you're flown down in helicopter to leeds
is that how common it is sir
yeah but if you're in your arch how
how common is it
yeah but it doesn't come on quickly UNK
oh
it's quite a slow disease
and that lies in the problem because it's so rare now doctors have a great difficulty in UNK it
right neil the reason is at one stage there was er centres all over the country that could treat it
it has become so rare thanks to UNK that there's only two n places needed i to cover the whole country scotland included
how do you treat it
and the answer is thank you
when you have an operation these days that's lasting anything more than just er a couple of minutes or so they will insert down your UNK an UNK which is a tube that goes down into your UNK to seal into the UNK so if you UNK for example no UNK can down round that tube
it comes out of your mouth and instead of a mask over your face your this tube UNK directly to the UNK and the anaesthetic machine
in order that you don't fight this UNK and also that you don't start UNK when they start carving you up they inject you with a chemical er a muscle UNK that stops your muscles working
now the only muscle that doesn't stop working
heart
is your heart because that's a special sort of muscle
so you are completely and totally paralysed
you cannot literally move a muscle
the only muscle in your body that's still working is your heart
and you are left in this condition during the operation then at the end of the operation they give you a second injection that UNK the first one that paralysed you
any side effects
no but i'll come onto some effects that it did have in a moment
now
if you've got tetanus to stop you breaking your back with these muscle UNK so that they can nurse you adequately they inject you with this stuff and you are paralysed until the tetanus has been fought off
they will give you the UNK they will give you the UNK and they will keep you breathing
cos what normally happens is with tetanus that the reason it kills you is that you stop breathing because your muscles that work your lungs the UNK the UNK muscles between the UNK those UNK up and you just stop breathing
so if they can keep you breathing and get your body to produce the necessary antibodies then they can cure you
but it may take three months so you are three months possibly on a UNK
what will happen is at regular intervals they'll take you off the UNK inject you with the er UNK to the UNK and see if your muscles lock up
if they do another injection tube back down and back on the life support machine
now bear in mind that you may be up anything up to three months in a condition where you're completely and totally unable to move a muscle for yourself
that's
UNK
that's why it's specialized nursing because the nurses have to do everything for you
the UNK will come round and they come round regularly and exercise your muscles
to try and stop them wasting away
which ones do they
legs and arms particularly
oh
but there's another one
now just imagine you are imagine being paralysed by this drug and yet being fully awake
you can't do move your eyes er so your eyes are actually taped closed to stop anything going in them
just imagine lying
can you see
there continuously
well the answer is you'd go UNK mad
so what they normally do is they also give you by continuous UNK drip they f have to feed you by this tube
and they also give you erm a suitable UNK erm so you go into what's called t UNK sleep
so you're not really conscious but you're not really unconscious
and you don't care what's happening to you
and you'll spend three months of your life like that
now then UNK was asking were there any side effects
let's have a look
there is a certain asian UNK who used to work at the city hospital maternity unit
i say used to because he's been struck off the medical register
what's he done to get that
the UNK simple
when you have a general anaesthetic for a UNK section or a general anaesthetic in general you are first of all given a pre UNK
now the pre medication is a drug based on UNK which has erm i'm not really anti something or other and er i can't pronounce the words concerned
but it h er has certain effects which basically cause muscle relaxation small amount of muscle relaxation UNK up the UNK in your throat
cos obviously if you having an operation they've got this tube down your throat and your mouth starts filling up with UNK they've got to suck it out
so this drug makes you very dry also makes you UNK the idea being that you're basically not going to worry about what's happening to you
pain
okay
you're then taken down into the operating theatre and the first injection you are given is usually something on the lines of erm er special k UNK or the most common one is
UNK sodium because it's the cheapest
this is an injection of general anaesthetic into the vein back of the hand or the ar arm which puts you to sleep very quickly
once you are asleep they then inject the muscle UNK put an UNK t UNK into your throat connect you up to the anaesthetic machine and get the life support machine breathing for you
the UNK
so you are therefore paralysed and hopefully because of the anaesthetic you've been given in the form of gas things like er UNK er UNK come in
mr
right
possible r o a cross UNK we'd like to keep that as it is but we can change that
looks reasonable
right
oh by the way mr
ah
i've done that
you've done yours
right
sir to do summat to do like she was paralysed but she could still feel the pain
that's the one
yeah
and so this poor woman who was supposed to be asleep and the problem is that er it's very difficult to decide whether somebody's actually unconscious or not if they can't move
now normally if you're not unconscious and they start cutting up open you're going to scream
yeah
but if you're paralysed you
exactly
now this poor woman the UNK ah
sister
poor woman
yes
erm i've got a girl sitting down in the foyer
she is she was just running and she's done something to something there
she's not in pain sitting in the foyer so what i've said is you'll look at her at break time
can you
cos i'm i would say she's pulled something but more than that
right
i'm trying to sort out the e year eight sex education with UNK at the moment
oh well er
yes
we're actually talking about erm er muscle er UNK
oh right
used in general UNK er UNK
right
and i was telling them about that indian or asian doctor at the city hospital in the maternity unit
which one's that
oh the one er who didn't give them enough anaesthetic so they woke up
oh right
yes they woke up and they're carving them and cutting away but couldn't say anything
that's right
yes
brilliant yes
she got quite a lot of money
mm
five hundred thousand wasn't it
yes
was it a UNK section
it was
yes that's right
i can't imagine
anyway she's sitting there
but she's okay while she's sitting still
right
i'll have a look at her
okay
thanks right
right
as i was saying
so this poor woman is er UNK which is when they put the tube down the throat and connect you up to the life support machine and then she's supposed to be being maintained in her unconscious state with UNK in other words they give her er gas and air to breathe to keep her unconscious
unfortunately this UNK wasn't very good and he didn't give her enough
so she woke up
now bear in mind she er normally for an operation they normally tape your eyes closed put a pad over your eyes as well just in case they drop something on your face by mistake during the operation
so she's completely and totally paralysed but she's paralysed and can feel pain
so she suddenly feels what's like something like a red hot knife being put into her stomach
it wasn't a red hot knife it's just simply that the surgeon had taken this knife started to UNK her UNK open and the heat part of the heat was the actual blood that was coming out of this wound
UNK
and then of course they've got this UNK iron type thing called the UNK device that seals up the blood vessels and this is being UNK into her
and all the time this is going on she is completely and totally aware of everything that's going on
now when they reverse the erm UNK and take the tube out the first thing she does quite UNK is UNK and then proceeds to tell the doctors exactly what's happened to her
now the doctors don't believe her
until she starts to tell them word for word what they said during the operation
and the next thing she does on recovery is file a criminal n erm a sorry civil negligence suit against the UNK
now two things
number one is erm if er this is unlikely to happen today
for example a member of staff in the school who teaches not a million miles from here had a hernia operation
and it was done at the UNK hospital where the UNK there not only gave this gentlemen a general anaesthetic but also a UNK anaesthetic as well
that's when you inject a chemical in the UNK to UNK the nerves below that site
so we're working on the principal that even if the person does wake up in the operation they're s not going to sue you cos they can't feel anything in the area you're operating in
sir
no
the other side of that is that i was listening to medicine now on radio four and they've got a device where they you actually have er an UNK put into your ear and it UNK continuously
now the idea is that er they put a couple of UNK and monitor your UNK
they put you to sleep and this UNK continues
as soon as you start
and as soon as you er go to sleep your brain level drops
so your r er reaction to these UNK drops
as you start to recover your UNK activity rises
so this device couple of UNK on the head this device in the ear UNK away UNK and they monitor the UNK s UNK it all up UNK a button saying awake UNK the person with the
UNK sodium where they can assess the effect because they haven't paralysed the person yet when the person stops responding and is asleep they press the button for UNK and then the machine logs the differences between the brain activity between the two
then if the patient starts to wake up this device sounds an alarm saying that the brain activity is increasing and that is UNK with the person UNK up so the UNK knows that he's got to put a bit more anaesthetic into the person
so hopefully that's going to stop this sort of thing happening in the future
but er one of the major problems is that UNK are trying to use less and less anaesthetic all the time
can anybody suggest why
less side effects sir
yeah
fewer side effects that's right
er
what's your chances of UNK up then in an operation
very small UNK
it's quite rare which is why it made so much publicity
but the erm chances of dying in an operation are one in one thousand eight hundred
eh
chances of dying in an operation are one in one thousand eight hundred
can you die of your pain
er would be possible
now before neil starts UNK and worrying about that bear in mind that is spread over the whole spectrum of operations including things like heart UNK and the like and also for example an elderly person who's just been smashed up by er UNK g t e
and who's going in for emergency surgery and whose chances of coming out are virtually nil anyway
so if you are a n relatively fit normal person your chances of survival are excellent
are these the chances of surviving er a hernia operation or
for the average hernia operation which is done remember as cold surgery not as an emergency the chances of dying under the anaesthetic are UNK small
how small
put it this way you're probably at more risk of dying crossing the road
and er one of the reasons they've reduced the levels of anaesthetic is because the more they reduce the levels of anaesthetic the lower your chances of dying during the UNK
right
any questions about that
yeah what you got under your
you've got
i don't know
your wedding is the UNK day of your life no
well what is it then
getting married is something that most scottish women do at least once in their lives and most scottish men which means that most of us have planned a wedding and that's what we're talking about tonight weddings
where you have them who comes what you wear what you do what it costs and what you think about it later
now if like me you've yet to attempt this big production number you could pick up a few tips here after all we've a number of professionals in this hundred UNK cake makers UNK and video makers UNK ministers but above all we have a lot ex UNK here and let's start off by finding how many we have
have you been a bride
button one for yes and button two for no
and in this hundred we have sixty nine er ex UNK thirty one still to make the leap
now wo er erm i can't ask you whether it was the UNK day of your life because only sixty nine of you would know
we well was it
it's the only day really in a women's life where everybody at her and she's made to feel like the most special person on this earth so i'd highly recommend it
was that your experience
yes it was yeah
you're the only person there wearing the ball UNK you're the only person there getting their photograph taken a hundred times over
so you're made to feel the most special person on the earth and i think that makes it worth it for a lot of them
did you like it so much you you'd do you would do it again
possibly not no
but it worked
i mean for you that big day cos i mean it is it's a it's a nerve UNK occasion isn't it
yeah it's the build up to it as well there's a lot of excitement i mean most people it takes about six months to build up to the big day and then finally it's there and it all happens and i think that makes it a lot exciting for a lot of women
now was that the experience of the of the other sixty eight of you ex wives
yes
i think a lot of people get carried away with the occasion and it's actually supposed to be a very UNK day and you know that's what it was for me
so it was everything you hoped it would be
yes
but i think people do get carried away with traditions and the occasion and this grand affair and really it could be a very small low key affair but it's meant to be a very UNK special day for two people
yes
behind you
i think erm i it seems very sad if we can single out one day to be the most important in our lives
mm
and it's a very special thing if you're going to join forces with another person and good luck to you but i think erm it seems that there maybe down forever after that if it's the most important day
er have you been a bride
yes i have
i've actually been a bride twice actually
aha
erm and very enjoyable days they were but erm i think if i were to plan a big party or an anniversary or something like that and i'd hope those would be jolly enjoyable days too
mhm
yes
i would like to get married all over again to the same person i might add but
so that i could actually enjoy it more this time because it's in so much of a UNK when you get married the first time that you're caught up with it and you don't really see what happens i would like to get married all over again
what did you do
