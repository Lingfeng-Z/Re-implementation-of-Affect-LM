well i was actually married in england because i'm e i'm english but one of guys erm for instance he wore a UNK and he showed all the english what he wore under the UNK
and i missed it
that so i don't know what a man UNK under his UNK
i oh i can't believe that
well i haven't been married but i have did recently graduate and that was a very important day for me
yeah
and personally i'd much rather have er people looking at me for what i achieved er rather than just looking pretty on a day i think that's more important to me
UNK you're a UNK
yes
now er supposing weddings disappeared would that affect your business
weddings are a very important part and a part that er we all enjoy but erm we i wouldn't say it was the major part of a UNK business there's quite a few other aspects
as a UNK you're dealing with most important days in UNK lives very often new babies weddings funerals erm but no i wouldn't say if weddings disappeared we'd all be you know in a terrible mess as a professionals but it's a very important part and an enjoyable part
UNK what about you
it's the same for us really it's not the main part of the business
well you better say what your business is
in cake decorating and associated things people have cakes for all occasions and erm wedding UNK only one of them
but erm again it's good fun kind of a good laugh with the wedding cake at least with a wedding cake you're spending money and you're getting fed and everybody's getting a bit of it
and do you do a er do as far as the cake goes i mean er is there a variety in er in the option
oh certainly
yes
i mean you we have made you know black wedding cakes for people that feel something like that we've even made divorce cakes so you don't have to get married to have one
what what's a divorce cake look like
mm
we had a bo a broken heart
a broken heart aha
with sort of a trail of red blood coming out the middle
oh
UNK if weddings disappeared a large part of your business wou would go wouldn't it
again i think like the rest erm
mhm
we evolved from the general fashion side which is still as important to us but the reason that we did probably UNK in the wedding side is because of th the need for us it wasn't us who pushed it from our end more and more UNK came to us so therefore we grew
mm
sort of
my wedding wasn't an ordinary wedding i was married on top of UNK seat and erm
you were married on top of UNK seat
yes at UNK on christmas eve four years ago and it was important for us to do exactly what we wanted because erm it was a second wedding for both of us and it was also erm we wanted to have something that represented sort of the aspirations of love and so UNK erm and on the top of a hill did that for us
and if you can find a minister that's willing to go wherever you want to go
in scotland you can do almost anything
aren't you a minister yourself
yes
so have you have you performed any un UNK weddings
yes erm well i i've not done a wedding in a church actually yet but then i've only done three weddings and but the most interesting one was in a UNK in UNK and erm that was quite exciting because the couple really thought about the service and they had selected that sight because it meant something to them and involved the whole community and UNK and it was great
mm
do you mind if i ask you about your own wedding o on the top of UNK seat on christmas eve four
mhm
well christmas eve was it
yes christmas eve well
did you have many guests at UNK
well we had about sixty erm people that UNK up to the top of the hill including erm one who didn't know there was a wedding he was a runner and then he
and he had UNK the top of UNK seat and was astonished to see a crowd there
what do you wear to a mountain top wedding in the middle of winter
well you wear an UNK and a UNK skirt and walking shoes
is that the most unusual wedding we have in this hundred tonight
i mean has e ye yes it seems so yes
no ones no ones gonna do anything UNK than that
you touched on church weddings now lots and lots of people do get married in church although many of them aren't er aren't necessarily church UNK now UNK can i can i pick on you
you UNK yo as a church of scotland minister
aha
you perform weddings
UNK
if people aren't church UNK do you will you still give them a church wedding
yes
why
cos not all ministers will they
well i think it gives them a link with the church erm and they don't just come in and say oh yes turn up on saturday and you'll get married there's some meeting before that
mhm
so that we don't all meet as strangers on the day
we found that a lot of young couples that because you don't go to church on a regular basis but erm to go along with their parents' wishes too rather than going through a big church wedding in a church they go to a hotel and they have the erm wedding ceremony and the reception all in the hotel and are married by a minister
and that
so there had to be
yes
a minister will go out to a ho hotel
yeah
have you done that UNK
have you ever
yeah i have
erm i don't like it er not for particularly any religious reason but for the fact that the church is purpose built for weddings and a lot of hotels aren't so you get the girl with the ball UNK spent hundreds on it and she's squeezed up sometimes and nobody can see her
but erm i prefer to marry in the church
angela
we were married at home and one of the reasons why is because we bought a very old house about three years ago and on the top floor it has a large room which used to be the UNK and we did a little research and we found that the last wedding that we know of in the house took place in seventeen fifty eight when apparently it was very common in scotland to get married at home it was more UNK to go to church
mm
we did some more research and we found out that in return for doing this you had to pay the minister a fine so we found a minister who was very excited by the idea of UNK us in a seventeen century house and in fact on the morning of the wedding he was more worried about what he was wearing than what i was
and erm it wa at the reception afterwards we actually paid him the fine er a contribution to a fund his church had for a painting they wanted to buy
they pay the minister a fine
yes
but it's not convention of course to pay the minister anything is it
i mean church of scotland ministers don't get paid
no
er it's different in other churches i think
some i think some people sometimes give a gift i've never i don't think i've had a gift
mhm
i'd been a few weeks ago i'd been to a wedding and it was the most boring
ceremony i ever been in all my life
i get married about eleven years ago it was four of us me and my the groom and two witnesses
it was a special day but every day of my life it's a special so it's nothing i would not do it again you know just to
but er i think most of the time the wedding in here is much more geared for how the bride look like and photographer it is all the time for four hours how you stand it's nothing normal UNK nothing natural nothing
mhm
nothing happy you ju just to stand there you can't laugh properly and you can't do this and you can't do this it's worse
so you think people are forced into conventional UNK because they fe
it was awful
how often do we really feel that the bride and groom are the people who make the choice
mm
is it not the parents
mm
who are inclined to impose their choice on the bride and groom in a lot of cases
is was that your experience
not me personally but i have known a few people who've wanted perhaps a very quiet wedding just in a UNK office and finished up with a large church wedding
mm
you talk about UNK magazines or any of the other magazines that are there it's all set out it's all UNK up and i think a lot of people feel they ha really have to get married in that way
UNK
i was just going to say that being a photographer we find that more and more people come with their mothers instead of the UNK whenever they're going to get married and it is all the time the mother has a big say in it you know instead of the couple
well now there must be some mothers here who er
any mothers who've married off their daughters in this UNK way saying you must have this dress
you must allow
no
to spend seven thousand pounds on you
yes
expectations just went too far
for instance i mean er my boyfriend excuse me i've been er living with him for years and i have a child
now i was at a wedding a little while back and all they were asking me was are you gonna be the next one
are you gonna be the next one
it's like i've already been asked and i've refused and i want to know why is it people put so much pressure on you to get married
for instance in the hospital they were calling me mrs because er the stigma er is so much and i mean er i even get called a single parent and i'm not
i have a very stable relationship and also with my child and i know that it would be very difficult for us to split up but i don't see why a bit of paper or a lovely ball UNK or a nice cake will make it any better for me at all
you're not
no
i just
but what about the child
th er well for instance er the child has took his name i mean er you know
but why can he take his name when he's your child and you haven't different names
it doesn't matter because i love him so much
what about the child though
well why should i have a pretty dress and a cake when it's the love that's there and not a piece of paper or a special day
up there
er i have a great sympathy for that lady
i think i will be a very UNK mother and having two daughters of my own i am UNK by the cost that this is going to erm
involve
ah if you're to believe the press that it costs about seven thousand pounds for a wedding an average cost for a wedding
mhm
i would far rather say if i had the seven thousand pounds say to both my daughters there you are UNK there's the seven thousand pounds you decide how much of that you want for your wedding what is left over you keep and it would be interesting to find out how much they then spent on their UNK and on their cake and the wedding cars etcetera
i would just to say i think women are such victims of the fashion industry and i think there's a lot more UNK surrounding th the bride than there is surrounding the groom and er i think erm you know th a lot more thought needs to go into the whole thing there's so much pressure on young people particularly girls and there's sa so much UNK around the whole thing erm and there's a lot of alternatives to marriage you know and this is discounted as th the woman over there said about being referred to as mrs particularly when you're over a certain age if you're not married
have you had a wedding
no
no
i've managed to avoid it
mm
i think it depends very much on the age of the people getting married
mhm
young people very commonly are UNK by their mothers and the thing is the politics of the family and showing themselves to their friends but more and more we're dealing with people
now you're a UNK
i'm a UNK
yep
probably my age and even a bit older thirty forty getting married sometimes a second time and they say this is our party
mm
and they are not influenced i don't think by a large amount of UNK and fashion
and there as someone else said erm earlier organizing their party the day of their life which happens to be also their wedding day and those sort of parties are far more fun to work at than the far more UNK family affairs that do happen for younger people
with regards about the lady that you've the relationship a stable relationship not being married another lady pointed out but what about the child
maybe get married and maybe not work out then divorce so what happens to the child then
mm
i don't think it's any different
i think we've said quite a bit about erm previously about the UNK of a wedding if
mm
it's a special day to you know getting married on the top of UNK seat or whatever but what about for the majority of people who have a church wedding and the UNK there that just goes UNK
this whole thing of the bride being well often not but UNK down the aisle and being transferred from being her father's property to being her husband's property
and that being taken by taking his name
you know there's a lot of UNK that really has been lost people don't think about in the wedding service but is underlying you know until fa fairly recently a lot of people promised to obey erm look at prince andrew and that when he got married you know erm the UNK of york actually promised to obey him
that was her choice presumably
and what does that say for what does say for women erm and for the status of women in this country
well in her case presumably she wanted to say she would obey him and subsequently perhaps she has and he's very happy with that but that's a fairly cynical view isn't it the UNK a kind of UNK who's had
in lace in lace
i mean doesn't that
but that there is a lot of a UNK there that people don't seem to look at
mm
UNK you know because it's the nice ceremony and because it's a do
yes
er i vividly remember my wedding day and the bit i remember most is actually waiting to go into church with my father and i remember being particularly moved at that time thinking that was the end of one era and about to become part of another and i didn't feel that i was being owned somebody and about to be owned by anyone else in the slightest
mm
i think when you talk about UNK of a wedding in actual fact what does a wedding say
it says very little about the UNK of life
if people are going to prepare to spend the rest of their lives together they should be discussing much more important things than concepts like forever they should be discussing what happens if it's splits up
which it UNK now is quite often going to do
but surely sitting down working out the UNK of it working out sensible practical things is a much more sensible way of proving you love somebody and that you're genuine about it
but you're not sensible when you're in love
you're not sensible when you're in love
well maybe you should be sensible
maybe that's why so many children are products of broken
homes now
when you're go into a marriage
mhm
go into a wedding you go in believing that it is forever that's it
that's right
you take your UNK you commit yourself
but it usual but nowadays it quite often
but that's why so many babies
isn't forever and people don't think often enough
that's statistics i mean there's
well maybe statistics are
but if you have a wedding day you are going in there saying i'm going to live with this person for the rest of my life
oh
yeah
and you firmly believe that at the time
up there
yeah
er i would like to know how much of the thing about the bridal magazines and the whole idea of a wedding is portrayed and the media has an influence on a young girl wanting to get married rather than the actual you know th you know how much sh she knows the person or loves the person maybe it's the whole image of the wedding that takes over you know erm rather than the UNK
well moira were you over influenced by the media wanting to have that
no
big day
i lived with my husband for er three and a half years and i knew him for a good number of years before then so we made a joint decision after that period of time that we were wanted to commit ourselves
mm
and we looked on it more as a party and a family gathering and showing everybody else that we were now committed and we're going to spend the rest of our lives together
well there's been some UNK about the UNK of weddings there's also some UNK about the reality of making that UNK forever er which i personally have sympathy with cos i don't see how you can say you're going to do anything forever but i suppose if you've made a UNK you've got to stick with it
is it possible to have a wedding ceremony that er that UNK those rather difficult bits
i mean UNK are you allowed to have a wedding ceremony tha which says erm i'll love you for as long as i can possibly manage
i've heard erm people saying i think it was in america erm as long as you both shall love instead of as long as you both shall live
yes
if you get married in a UNK office which i did you don't say an in england you don't say anything other than that you take this chap to be your husband and you interpret that to be as you wish
so that's entirely up to the pair of you
i think that these UNK ideas perhaps come with the old language of the church and if you're going to do that well then all UNK to you and er presumably you mean it if you've gone there
there are people who come from different cultures amongst this hundred who might want to say something about erm wedding UNK
i got married twenty three years ago in china well we just invite er invited er our friends and er former school mates to ma to my home and we didn't make any UNK er we just gave a UNK to the friends and er in china people now can get married in many ways and er some UNK have come to china to get married in a traditional chinese way and they have to er carry their bride in a UNK chair
and their bride has to wear er all in red and er the UNK er groom has to wear a long costume with a red big flowers in front i aha and then they get married and there's erm band the chinese traditional band with UNK and UNK blowing all the time and er all the guests have a very nice time
and in china usually erm wedding is an important event in the family and an when i got married i think my parents in law wo erm felt erm more excited than my husband and i
well that's tha i mean tha that's a pretty interesting description of er of a different kind of wedding which is another one er another
well
optional variation that you might
well i got married in
want to choose
yes
bu i meet a erm a different oh UNK in UNK but i got married in england with my though we make this i'd say this man to be my wife forever but when i got home back home in UNK you know we did it in a different way
we have er my parents sat down with a the group of the family there
mm
you know there's no UNK there but all we do is join hands together share blessings to both of us and no UNK we never make any UNK but they made a blessing for us
the marriage will be successful and this one it is
there
well i'd i come from UNK and i get married in here and i said the UNK but i didn't understand at that time i wasn't speaking english so
oh
oh
oh yeah
that's one to remember i didn't understand what i was saying
yes
but in UNK we don't have UNK they have like kind of contract and if the if they broke the contract it's the bride and UNK the groom have to pay that amount of money for the bride even if it was her fault
it happens in my country when you break the marriage i mean in my town when you break th the marriage this sort of money will be paid wi then
whe when you're to make
mm
a er but want to want to do a wedding you pay a certain er amount of money then when you break the wedding you refund the money to your husband
yes this is this is this er who's picking up UNK point which is that you get all the UNK arrangements er done but i mean it doesn't mean you can't have the ritual be it dressed with you know er a long
but
red dress with
my complaint is that mostly
UNK for the groom or
it's the UNK and circumstance and the UNK lace and everybody being really happy and i know people think about it but it's not seen as that it's seen as a family society thing it's not two people sitting
mm
down and saying right we're gonna buy a house we're gonna have kids have we thought about how many kids we're gonna have
have we thought about whether we want to have kids at all
maybe those are the questions we should asking rather than you know do you take this man for your husband
mhm
when you come from a big family as i do erm yo you can have any size of wedding as long as the right people are there anybody gets excluded it's er to be horrendous
mm
starts with you know i haven't been invited why i'm and if you've got a big family you really have to do it properly and it it's gonna cost
well a variety of views and i think the only UNK i can make about weddings is that you can't UNK about weddings some people think they're wonderful some people are sceptical people have done their own er variations on weddings
i haven't really asked you very many questions so i'll ask you a question which sets us up for a programme we might do in the next series having discussed the wedding next the UNK
here's the question
is a UNK a good way to start a marriage
button one for yes and button two for no
you don't have to have had one to be able to comment on this
and seventy seven people say yes and twenty three people say no and aren't you UNK to know why they voted that way
you'll have to watch the next series
from us here UNK
so you've been UNK raped and UNK the question is were you asking for it and what are you going to do about it now
crime they say doesn't pay well you may have your own views on that but certainly across the UNK of variety of criminal activity we might agree that crime almost always hurt someone more or less we have a system designed to cope with the effects of crime and to UNK future criminals but it doesn't seem to be making crime a thing of the past so how good are we at dealing with crime tonight's hundred women have a broad range of experience as victims law women UNK police and others we'll be hearing their views on the system and how it might be changed and asking why are we all so UNK by UNK crime from cell block h to UNK
lots to cover so lets start and let starts with er having it done to you would you say that you've ever been a victim of crime button one for yes button two for no have you been a victim of crime
er now this is interesting because this is not a representative cross section of er of women in scotland but its an average gathering together not chosen for any reason other than some are interested er some come from er no particular background but sixty two of this hundred have said yes they have been a victim of crime those of you had said yes what experiences have you had that made you say yes
er i've been UNK and UNK er i was UNK two months ago my house was UNK all my jewellery every thing taken simply because i had left my windows open slightly now i've got to sleep at night with all my windows closed and i don't get a good nights sleep apart from feeling UNK any way and er the UNK er i trusted people and now i can't trust any body and that leaves you feeling very UNK
right who else said yes
right i was subject to a an assault that was quite frightening erm in that i was working in a shop on my own and er someone came into the shop and locked the door behind me and tried er to pull me down towards the back of the shop and er apart from being very frightened i find it difficult to accept that i was just an innocent victim i kept making excuses that this person who did it to me didn't mean to frighten me he only couldn't communicate that he said it eventually when i managed to fight him off he said i just wanted to give you a kiss and er i find it very difficult and i had to be forced to go to the police erm to tell them about this because i thought you know its just a misunderstanding and but it was UNK
mm
it really was UNK
so robbery assault who else what yes
very minor on the scale of things but i've had a car stolen erm great inconvenience can't believe its going to happen to you didn't do any thing to have caused this locked up and took all the precautions and yet it still happened and some one some where out there has my car
when was that
mm nine weeks ago
so your still yeah
so i'm still struggling with four children and no car
yeah
and i'm not happy about it really
what else up there
can i just comment on the lady saying a minor crime i don't think any crime is minor when it happens to you
mm
if your the victim its major it has UNK her life maybe not to dramatically but she has been greatly UNK by not having a car
mm
so the term a minor crime i don't think is a very good one to be using
mm yes
i was actually mugged on holiday er then years ago and i was held up with a gun and it was the most horrendous feeling
where was that
in UNK and er some young chaps had saw me lying on the beach and er they UNK my bag and they stuck a gun in my face and freeze lady you don't do any thing you just let them take what they want and its a horrible feeling when your there we were there for three weeks and it just totally UNK the holiday but the UNK of it don't just stop once you got on the plane home it was very frightening
well your talking about it now and with a degree of emotion do you still feel it
oh it was feel it was so UNK you just you regard every one with suspicion after that
mm
i actually feel there was a time i used to think it wouldn't happen to me because if i was in that situation i would do this i would do the next thing and when it did actually happen to me it took me ages to get over
mm
the trauma because your so UNK and
what was what was the it can i ask that happened
mm
i mean if you don't want to say its alright
no i don't particularly want to say
yeah
but you you've you build up the strength in yourself and believe that your in vulnerable and then to find out that you are vulnerable it really scary
yeah i think that's a very good point that the fact that you've lost control whether its of your own personal safety
yeah
or your or your property or the people you care for yes
i was actually UNK at er in the library and what i thought of i would of done was completely different to what i actually did erm i thought i would of been quite calm about it but in fact i ran out the library and i ran straight back to my flat erm i was at that point i think about twenty one
mm
and i'd just finished training as a nurse and i thought i was really cool and calm and i would of reported it but i didn't
you didn't
no
why was that
i think i was about twenty one several years ago now
oh i see
well its interesting that you've remembered it i mean do you wish you had reported it
yes
yeah
and its lasted the memory of it and i do wish i had reported it or at least gone to the library staff
there
i am a victim support UNK and why is it that criminals get all the help you know when they don't give help to the victims of crime
is that your feeling that criminals get more help than victims
well they get lawyers and all the supports
what's the general view on that
to because we've got the legal aid system but i mean my son was also a repeated UNK in his car and what shocked me was the police they said to me you shouldn't have a pretty car any way he had a brand new x r three
you shouldn't have a pretty car i mean that is nonsense
mm yes
so he's got an old UNK now you know they don't break into it
as a police officer any woman who do decide to report a crime to us they are offered quite a lot of advise
mm
we refer victims onto victim support groups if its a case of rape then their passed on to the rape UNK and also
UNK we will be with er a victim all the way through the enquiry and if at the end of that enquiry they will also be given details of the criminal UNK compensation board
in your experience is there er a distinct failure on the part of people i don't know whether you'd say men or women to report a lot of crime i mean i don't i don't know whether you can assess what proportion of UNK aren't reported
i think there's always a fear to come forward and bring the details of a crime out into the open
mm
er it can be a very UNK experience for a woman but i think part of the mental experience would be coming forward to the police and they had dealt with now in a far more caring and understanding manner that can actually help in a process of getting over it eventually
yeah now your saying that is that in your time working with the police that the previously people weren't dealt with such sympathy
well i would say that there has been a lot of changes since the new home office guide lines were issued in nineteen eighty five
yeah
before hand there were the same designated police officer of the same specialized UNK things have changed and they have changed for the better
i wonder if that's everyone's experience would any one agree or disagree with that
UNK i think i might ask you erm i think your involved with the changed project is that right
yeah
so you what does what does that do exactly
well we actually take men who have been convicted of offences involving domestic violence
mm
and put them through an educational programme as a UNK of a probation order
i think what were dealing within a programme like this is very much the tip of the UNK
mm
because i think women have traditionally been very reluctant both to report domestic violence and hearing UNK of what women are saying here in terms of women looking into their own UNK to why it is happening rather than er having it labelled as a crime and i think one of the main thrust of the project the women involved in is to raise the profile of domestic violence into being a criminal act
i think if your in a relationship with the person that UNK the crime against you as victims of domestic violence
then there's a tendency to look for the reason you were assaulted within yourself
mm
i think its very significant here we are and lots of people have admitted to being a victim of crime but statistics show that twenty five per cent of women will be assaulted within a relationship and yet no women here has said that and that's probably because the women who have been so assaulted feels somehow it is their own fault its somehow UNK
possibly also they might not want to go on national television
and say that which i would UNK with entirely i mean you know why bring it on yourself yes
erm i work for in edinburgh and erm er all too often er we see er female relations er of male offenders er this lady struck a UNK er especially when it comes to serious crime
mm
where women examine themselves erm if its the mother or the granny er did i bring him up wrongly erm the girl friends or wife's er is it something that i didn't understand and at the same time it er really changes their lives
mm
er to visit UNK year after year after year er with children to UNK er all over the country
mm
and erm i just think that women are so strong and another thing that i find er that is very important is perhaps there's women here we should look at why there's only one female prison in scotland and about fourteen male lot and including young offenders institutions and er i mean what is it we are as agenda er just less UNK minded more controlled more clever what you know we should be teaching men
but it is the case that twenty two per cent of crimes are committed by women erm and i think that the situation with women committing crime is quite complex and complicated one erm that really needs quite er a great detail of discussion and one of the points i was going to make was this question of feeling guilty
mm
erm when we are victims of crime and personally i think that there are two main reasons for that one reason certainly is that when women erm are victims of crime that there is of a sexual nature or domestic violence part of the way that we have been brought up and part of the way that those crimes have been portrayed is to UNK them as our fault
yeah
er and some of the solutions that are offered to reduce those crimes involve women restricting their movements and their UNK but i think one of the other reasons why generally people who are victims of crime be they men or women feel guilty is because one of the implicit elements in tradition crime prevention strategies is for us to reduce the opportunity for crime
mm
not to leave our UNK er in the car not to leave the windows open and so on and i think that really UNK the issue of why people commit criminal acts
you were just saying you know that we should just walk in the streets and things like but i would just not walk out in the streets at night i've got to be in the car with the doors locked and i just wouldn't walk out in the streets at night not because any thing has happened to me but its just through what i've heard i'm just terrified
so your willing to restrict your movement
yes i am i am afraid aha
socially and UNK women are brought up to care for relationships to care for people they want to do it well where it goes wrong they tend to blame themselves but equally we have UNK members of the UNK who in the past have commented in some of the cases of severe UNK on women the kind of er quote that you were making
mm
she asked for she shouldn't of been walking along the street at twelve o'clock and when we have those attitudes at the top of our legal and UNK system its no wonder women blame themselves and indeed maybe blamed
well perhaps but women get very angry as well but nothing seems to change i mean what the heck do you do about it when some UNK er gentleman and it almost invariably must be a gentleman since their by far the huge proportion of er UNK and UNK comes out with that kind of comment about er a woman's victim reputation or behaviour as he sees it i mean what is what is the answer there
if every one who was offended wrote a letter that would be a start
so once again its your responsibility to complain about the ill that has been done to you yes
i think your treated completely differently if your assaulted in the street than you are if your assaulted in your home
mm
i was treated UNK by the police when i was assaulted in the home
er when you say you were treated UNK what do you mean
over a number of years i was subjected to domestic violence erm the last time i left i didn't report it right away morally it was my son i didn't want to drag him through the court but when i did i was told no your too late you will just be seen as a woman UNK your trying to get revenge and that's it no i'm not taking a statement
so what's your general feeling at the end of that particular experience
UNK
and er and presumably your attitude to the police is not a sympathetic one
no
is that is that general
as far as domestic violence is concerned yes
yeah i worked with a voluntary group for a while and i remember helping one lady go through she was raped and go through the courts and all her past life was brought up i mean i was so upset for her and yet the fact that he had actually raped twice before wasn't brought up but her past life was brought up and the man actually got off in the end because she just could not cope with being on the stand and dealing with it all and it was just so terrible that the UNK
mm
the differences should be male and female like this was so terrible
so your describing a system which you feel double UNK someone who is who's
i think it can do i mean it was a long time ago and i'm
yeah
told that it has changed but at that time and i know my feeling was left that if i was raped i wouldn't never go to the police
well a number of things have come up so let's just take a couple of votes as er from hearing from a few people and of which people haven't managed to speak so first of all er people talked about fear being larger than the incidence of assault are you afraid to go out in the dark button one for yes and button two for no do you find that your afraid to go out in the dark and then this hundred and that's a very i mean that's a very significant figure fifty seven out of this hundred women say yes that their afraid to go out in the dark from time to time i mean that is not as it should be let me ask you are you ever afraid in your own home button one for yes and button two for no and that two is a very worrying figure twenty nine of this hundred say yes their afraid in their home let me ask you this have you trained in self defence button one for yes and button two for no i mean its something that comes up from time to time and i don't know what your view and whether or not its a good idea well twelve of the hundred here have er eighty eight say no of those twelve would you recommend it did it make you feel better yes
at the time it did but i think i've forgotten every thing i learned
yeah i er thought about self defence but i keep thinking about things like that's fine but if someone has a knife or a gun the one might of self defence that i have been trained on or taught in can possibly help and i can't really see it as being very helpful because
mm
very seldom is er one to one situation where the UNK does not have a gun or a weapon of some description so i don't see it as being very helpful
do you think in this country that's the case people have a weapon now certainly if they
i think so
were doing this programme in the united states that'll be but then of course you living in the states you'll probably all have guns
i mean i don't i wonder do any of you have a gun let me ask you that
do you do you have a gun button one for yes and button two for no well i'm not going to ask you to identify yourselves the three of you
who have well in fact i must ask you this would you would you like to have a gun button one for yes button two for no i'll tell you my own view on this after you've voted and nine of you say yes you would what would any body liked to say why they'd like to have a gun yes
well i erm i was i was UNK about a year ago and i'm am ex er i'm a retired criminal lawyer and but i felt that if i lived in the states and trained in the states and i carried a gun then and i felt very vulnerable in not having a gun because he i was in my own home and he UNK me with a knife
mm
you er it had happened because i had been i had a lot of training and a lot of UNK and thing i was able to talked to him and i talked to him for an hour and a half er i was curious for one thing to find out why he was he was breaking into people's houses so that the fact that he was doing it for to get money for drugs
mm
and i told him i wasn't stupid enough to keep money in the house as an ex er as an ex lawyer and erm where er it so happened as i say that i talked to he didn't take any thing in fact at the end he apologise for having chosen the wrong house and he
went to put the he went away again but i did mention to the police who i might say were very helpful were ninety per cent of UNK don't get cleared up so of course it wasn't important and i never expected it would be but i did mention to the police at the time that i would like an future occasion because i've been trying to use guns in america er to have a gun in the house but they er but they wouldn't erm agree to it at all
mm
i asked if i could have a fire arm she said oh no they
mm
but i think that we'll get into that stage in britain
do you
but erm er at a stage that they are in and been for a long time in the states as we will have to er get armed well i'm sorry to say this but it seems like it
well no its your view although ninety one of the women here said no and er if i had a vote i'd probably say no because i'm absolutely convinced i would use it if i had it
and er and well one can be UNK at times and the that could lead
to other things we've kind of UNK of the one of the subjects that we were er we did get onto which was how the police and the courts er handle er well victims and indeed criminals i wonder if i might UNK erm both those groups into one question its a very broad question but i wonder if you think by and large the police do a good job erm button one for yes and button two for no erm and the majority here say yes seventy people say yes the police do a good job and since we've talked about the courts do you think the courts do a good job by and large we've been talking specifically about erm some of the more UNK erm statements that have come from the bench particularly in with reference to crimes erm that have treated against women well now seventy nine say no so the police comes UNK up but the courts are way down now not surprisingly there aren't many representatives from the courts er amongst this hundred
because er there weren't all that many er available what do you think of twenty one of you said yes of the twenty one who said yes are you surprised that the great majority of this hundred women are so UNK by the courts system who said yes and would you like to defend your answer yes
er i must declare an interest because i am a court lawyer but i think that a lot of people say no because of the media UNK presentation you only hear bad stories they don't hear the good stories about the attempts to make the courts more efficient and i think that on the whole and with the circumstances that the courts have to deal with they do a very good job
so its my fault again
the media any yes up there
you've got to mention in scotland the one thing that we've got to be proud of is the children's panel system because
mm
we its one of the only countries in the world where children can go and in a non judged mental way a panel can work out what the best thing is to do with them its unique
we've hardly managed to touch on prisons at all or though although i know that we have amongst us hundred people who er who are responsible for and er and have dedicated much time to working in prisons and i don't know whether there is sufficient people here qualified to comment or not whether the prisons do a good job so i'll ask some one who's bound to be a slightly partial UNK there's only one women's prison as some one said earlier now your an ex governor now is that right
i'm a governor at present er working in prison service headquarters in edinburgh but i previously worked in UNK erm i think it depends on what you mean by do by prisons do a good job i think that's a terribly vague and wide ranging question
well i well that's why i'm not putting it to the vote
i think in terms of our first duty to protect the public by keeping offenders locked up UNK yes by and large we do a good job and that by keeping good order in prisons we do a good job generally speaking incidence are very few and far between after the mid eighties things have settled down considerably
in terms of offering prisoners a range of opportunities to address their UNK behaviour and to take up erm an interest or activity which will channel them into other activities i think at the moment we do less of a good job than we will two years down the line i think the emphasis now is very much on opportunity and responsibility
mm
encouraging offenders to except responsibility for what they have done but also to take the opportunity to do something positive about that and in that were delivering a service to the public and to the offender so i think things are improving
that we should keep a watching brief
yes
would any one like to comment on that
jackie
i've just spent six months in UNK and i mean its UNK i mean cos your locked up in a cell from eight o'clock at night till six o'clock in the morning and your not got any toilet facilities you've got to use a UNK if you want to go to the toilet and it is UNK i mean there's people in there well i was a first offender the first time i was in but i mean there's people in there seventeen year old that haven't a clue about life in general and it is UNK for them
so the claims that are made for the good of prison does your not your not impressed by well we have to give right of reply to UNK as you work at UNK
i would say that if a person is locked up from that time at night there's circumstances their perhaps observation for their own safety erm any body else that can be trusted at night UNK are not locked in they have the facilities to go to the toilet during the night i mean this person that's just said must of obviously been ob observation or was locked up for a reason
were getting into an area which i think is a whole different programme and before this programme started i might tell you we were having a little er discussion amongst ourselves whether or not er UNK were good for animals and i suppose there is a discussion about whether prisons are inevitably going to be UNK because of because of what er what a prison represents which is a UNK of freedom but we don't have time in this programme so that's another one for next year can i ask you we've touched a lot of basis and it must be frustrating that we can't pursue er to the end some of the things we've er we've picked on but can i ask you a couple of final questions as far as you know have you committed a crime button one for yes and button two for no as far as you know i mean we haven't got time to go into what they might be so your perfectly free to be very honest and honestly UNK that three people aren't quite UNK oh yes there they are
well there are fifty one law UNK citizens and there are forty nine potential UNK if only they had been
found out my final question tonight is do you enjoy crime fiction and that includes television after all the station that this programme goes out on wins a lot of revenue for making a very popular er detective UNK thing called UNK i don't know whether you watch that or what you read but seventy eight of you enjoy crime fiction now there's an interesting paradox that we will discuss why you can discuss at home we'll discuss it now good night
they will need teachers' and if you can bear that one in mind
erm i've got an information pack here which i'll hand out at the end of the session and it's got sort of four fairly erm useful leaflets in it
one's a general superannuation
er there's one that talks about age inherited benefits
and one that talks about pensions and other dependants and then there's a leaflet erm which gives you certain facts about re employment after retirement
if you'd like to take those away with you will actually erm reinforce some of the things that i'm going to say during the next hour
so as far as the actual topics i'm going to cover are concerned erm can everybody see
turn the lights off shall we
erm talking about the various types of pension that are available under the teachers' scheme
erm a little bit about contributions and additional contributions and the actual benefits that are available and
could i ask that we take any questions at the end of session
so the actual types of pension and the applications of them
er there's normal age retirement premature retirement and premature retirement with redundancy two or three really you know can go together
and then there is the UNK pension
as far as the normal age retirement goes
erm this is available to teachers and UNK erm at the age of sixty
because you can remain in service until the age of sixty five if you so choose erm and draw your pension you do actually have to apply for normal age retirement
er because if you don't actually make out formal applications you know come your retirement nothing will happen
it's not actually automatic because you can stay in for those extra up to five years if you so choose
erm the actual there's a pension and a lump sum payable and this is based on your total amount of UNK service
that's really service on which teaching service on which you have paid contributions
it also includes erm UNK service which is service other than teaching that you may have transferred into the scheme
so things like erm service from another superannuation scheme or if somebody's been paying you know extra contributions to actually boost your pension lump sum that is actually UNK service
but it all counts at the end of the day in calculating your pension and lump sum
erm so to actually make application for the pension you need to apply to the education personnel group erm and you'll need a an application form fourteen a pen
once you actually receive a copy of this it's in two parts
the first part you need to complete part a and this has got your personal details bank details it asks about your family details for family benefits and it asks if you are in receipt of any other oth other pensions
erm asks for an indication of whether you are likely to be taking up teaching service after retirement
and having completed that you send it back to the personnel group at county hall
we will then complete part b which gives the teachers pensions agency details of your actual service and salary since the last annual return
that's an exercise that we complete each year actually updating the teachers pensions agency of your particular service details
so we complete that information er tell them when you are actually finishing teaching er i e the last day you'll actually be your last day of actual teaching and the last day to which salary will be paid
and we then return that to the teachers pensions agency in UNK
as far as these forms are concerned erm it it's best to complete them about four months before your actual retirement date
er in the summer term particularly at the end of the summer term those UNK thirty first of august because as you can appreciate they are sort of UNK applications at the end of the academic year
so you know the sooner it can be sort of processed the sooner they can actually get working on it
the d e s actually calculate your pension they UNK payments by the UNK office and er notify you of your actual benefits that are due
usually about two to three weeks before the actual time and date
that's normal age retirement
er premature retirement
this is available to people age fifty or over with the er necessary amount of qualifying service which is generally two years
erm and it's available to those people whose employment UNK in the interest of the functions
again there's a pension and a lump sum payable and there is also the possibility of enhancement
the enhancement is entirely UNK
if erm if there is enhancement payable erm that part of the pension will ultimately be paid by county council by the county council
so it will be quite separate from the amounts of money that you are receiving from the erm UNK office
applications for premature retirement erm they're dealt with slightly differently in the sense that once an UNK actually approved you will be issued with this with this form or a similar form to this one
so if somebody is offered premature retirement and they accept the offer that UNK automatically sent to you don't actually need to apply
and that's really because it's erm you know it's for people under the age of sixty
the redundancy erm if somebody leaves under redundancy situation then there is an additional payment of redundancy payment payable
erm again for those people have to be ov over fifty years of age and we operate in the maximum enhancement er provision
which can be up to ten years providing that doesn't take your service over forty years at the age of sixty or over what you would have UNK had you remained in service until the age of sixty five
ten years enhancement in redundancy cases
erm and the difference between premature retirement and redundancy basically is you do receive this additional one off redundancy payment
that's a tax free payment
in erm these are available to teachers who are under the age of sixty whose erm
to the extent that they can no longer satisfactorily perform their duties
erm if anybody is actually interested in could i actually refer you to somebody in the personnel group erm lynne
lynne can actually give you know more detailed information on UNK allowances
basically you do see enhancement in these cases
erm it's an automatic enhancement and it depends on your actual length of service and you know when you actually apply for the for the UNK allowance
so it does vary generally speaking it tends to be six and two third years
and again there is a lump sum and er an annual pension payable
but they are for teachers under the age of sixty
any questions at that point
you said that er the redundancy payment was non taxable which i'm delighted to hear
er what about the lump sum do we pay tax on that
no the lump sum is also tax free
if you're wanting to take er early retirement and erm you're wanting enhancement say you retire at fifty nine and you want some enhancement can you ask for enhancement sort of up to sixty five or has it only got to be up to sixty
up to sixty
sixty
anything else erm contributions and additional contributions
you actually contribute six percent of your salary and you know that's the sort of basic contribution
er the pay eight point nought five percent so that's a total contribution of fourteen point o five percent to the er scheme
the index linking of teachers' pensions is actually that's actually met by the government and not the teachers' superannuation fund
you can there are various ways of actually increasing erm your pension by paying additional contributions
erm you know if you are short on service or you actually want to top up erm your total pension for service at the end of the day
and there are basically three ways of doing it
erm there's a
there are additional contributions with the UNK and you could if you if you wanted you could also pay free standing a b cs through erm a company of your own choosing
in total you cannot actually pay more than fifteen percent of salary to erm these well to contributions so in effect you you're already paying six percent as your basic contribution so the maximum you could pay on any of these schemes is a further nine percent
erm but you know they are the actual inland revenue
as far as years are concerned erm it's actually a scheme which allows you to gaps in your career
it's quite a costly scheme because you're actually paying both the employer's and the UNK contributions
erm but if somebody has had a gap for whatever reason it is often the only method of actually covering it if you want to do something that involves the teachers' superannuation scheme
and the cost of what you're actually buying back the service you're buying back is basically governed by your age and your salary and the amount of time you want to buy back
and there are various methods of actually erm paying these contributions
by monthly UNK or by lump sums
erm anybody who's interested erm if you'd like to ask for a leaflet UNK at the end of the session because the main thing is that you do have to take advantage of this while you are still employed in UNK service
erm so you have to do something now before you actually retire
having bought back the service then erm that is what i referred to earlier as UNK service
you to buy back however many years you buy back will count in your pension and lump sum calculation at the end of the day
something that's not actually mention there is withdrawn contributions
if i can just briefly mention them
erm
first of june nineteen seventy three can actually be UNK providing you are still in service
erm and the amount that you UNK is the amount that you UNK er plus compound interest at three percent per annum so it's actually a much cheaper method covering that service
but it's only available if your contributions were withdrawn before the first of june nineteen seventy three
has anybody actually taken advantage of that
yeah i mean what you actually well you'll find that what you UNK erm you know that the benefits you receive in your pension lump sum will far UNK the cost of UNK those contributions
so if anybody you know did that and hasn't yet UNK them i would strongly advise you to do that
but it's only available for contributions that were withdrawn before the first of june nineteen seventy three and you know if you didn't meet that particular date then the only other way of covering gaps is which is far more expensive
erm it actually talks in this fourteen a pen makes reference to the fact that the approximate cost of one year to buy it back it would add twenty under a years arrangement
twenty percent of your current salary
additional voluntary contributions with UNK erm since about nineteen eighty eight the UNK erm entered into a scheme with the teachers pensions agency er whereby you can actually er pay additional contributions to the UNK
they invest them in various ways and at the end of the day you can use that erm policy to actually top up your pension or provide for increased family benefits and because it's a the administration costs er costs are sort of less than you get with erm you know sort of taking out a policy with an individual company on a one off basis
so it's erm the UNK are actually made from you know through the county council payroll er each month
and you receive an annual statement erm and at the end of ea end of period or when you a are actually retiring then you will be contacted and you'll receive you know sort of guidance on how to that money
circumstances at the time
the third option of paying extra contributions is free standing a b cs
erm you know that's taking out er a private policy
a policy with the sort of company of your own choosing
erm which er the teachers pensions agency or the county council will have no involvement in at all
entirely up to yourself to actually make provision to erm increase you know your own pension
if anybody does want further information on a b cs erm in the booklet in the information pack the your pension booklet it's actually handled through the UNK the office in reading but there is the address is given in booklet
any questions about
yes i have got one
w with regard to the a b c erm conflicting advice from two sources
erm the UNK of it is that the money from the a b c er i you're not allowed to go over your forty UNK of your pension with it
now i is that right or wrong
it's probably right but it doesn't actually count in that calculation it's something quite separate
you know the money that you're paying in a b cs isn't classed at the end of the day as erm UNK service
it's a separate facility
yeah
so
but the money coming in from that a b c erm it was somebody from grimsby who got into terrible trouble not problems really with the t p a
erm having made these contributions erm he got a note to the effect from the t p a that erm some of the money that he paid in to the a b c had to be UNK to him as a lump sum because the money coming from that sum would have taken his pension over the forty UNK
and the t p a for some reason weren't very happy about this so they re actually returned a lump sum to him
yes
so he paid the a b c went early as a result of ill health er but got a lump sum back cos he wasn't allowed to go across this
now from the UNK erm an entirely different picture
you know you're allowed to go up to nine percent as you say and you just pay as many years as you like
mm
i mean we don't actually get that involved apart from the fact that we did originally have a leaflet
i know actually only UNK they are leading a campaign round schools i believe erm you know trying to get more teachers interested in a b cs
erm but i mean we do have erm a session with them and really all the information we gave was very sort of basic understanding
i think that one would probably need to be clarified directly with them
okay yeah thank you very much
may i say sandra i think this is probably an inland revenue ruling
yeah
because when the when all these schemes are set up they're only by agreement with the inland revenue and the forty eight year element will be one of the essential
yeah
points of agreement
and although they're the a b cs are with a separate body you're still working within your scheme
right
so you're i'm i feel sure that it is so
that you're limited to forty UNK
or if you're with another body that's agreed er seventy five er UNK or whatever
yeah
then you would be limited to that
you've actually got somebody form the inland revenue haven't you
yes
during the next three days
right
well i am here yes but er not an expert
no i think it is the basic part of he agreement setting up the original superannuation scheme
that all UNK all er payments would be limited to forty UNK
although i've never i've not met this element before it's rather interesting
i was not aware that they were
they needed to refund a b cs
er i think my wife would like to take advantage of er buying back the service of the earliest before nineteen seventy three
right
to whom would you apply
she would need to contact the teachers pensions agency
right
in UNK
and
yeah how
the address is the back of
can you make erm a b c contributions for past years
well i suppose you could erm i suspect it would be cheaper than but it wouldn't actually increase your pension per se at the end of the day because it's as i said it's a separate you know it's a separate sort of erm income to your pension lump sum
yeah
but i mean if you had a gap you i suppose you could probably compare the difference between and a b cs
haven't got any but i understand there are tax advantages
well yeah the tax is erm deducted at source if you like you know before
this is as opposed to a lump sum
yeah
yes
because if you pay
i think you'd really have to you'd probably need to look at the booklet and then speak to erm one of the UNK people about you know the amount of time you were considering paying contributions and the probably just weigh up the benefits of each scheme
right
the tax advantage is that if it's a b cs by deduction you get tax relief if it's by lump sum you don't
anything else erm the actual pension benefits that are payable
as i said earlier the pension is based on your total amount of UNK service and that's teaching service on which you paid contributions
so erm if you haven't opted out of the scheme er full time service part time service if a teacher had elected to the part time scheme and a supply teacher if a teacher had elected to the part time scheme
erm and any other service UNK service that counts in that calculation
er for example erm any service that has been transferred in from another scheme
you know if you were previously in the civil service or some other private scheme which is UNK into the teachers' scheme
that all counts at the end of the day in your pension and lump sum calculation
er normally as i said earlier payable at the age of sixty erm and the benefits are based on average salary which is the best three hundred and sixty five days out of the last ten ninety five so it's the best year out of the last three years salary
for the average salary
erm time of your actual service and all of your service is UNK over you know over your career
so if you do have some breaks erm subsequent service is added on to that
so at the end of the day you'll get a total amount of er years and days times the average salary and that divided by eighty
in your lump sum you've normally er three times the pension
where it will differ is if anybody has any service before the thirtieth of september nineteen fifty six for that part of the lump sum the calculation is based on erm is based on a sorry oh one thirtieth of each year
sorry about that
erm whereas under this post thirty nine sixty six service is based on three UNK of each year
so it does make a slight difference to the erm the lump sum
but generally speaking it's three times the pension
the lump sum is a tax free payment
the erm pension is taxable as earned income
any UNK that you've had erm for sickness full or half pay actually count in full for in these calculations as do erm any maternity leave absence you know providing you were actually receiving pay that's half pay or more then those UNK count as if they haven't actually occurred
that's just an illustration
erm thirty three years and a hundred and fifty days service
you know are worked through and in that particular case all the service is actually september ninety fifty six
and you actually find the lump sum is times the annual pension
the pensions are actually paid monthly and the payment date actually UNK with the day of the month in which you're actually born
and the lump sum will be paid immediately after you finish teaching
so for example if you finish on the thirty first of august on the first of september the lump sum should be paid into your account
and the same would actually apply to the erm redundancy payment
when the pension starts
when the pension starts
when does it start
i heard you mention the day you were
yeah that's when it's actually paid
the actual payment date
so i mean if you were to finish on the thirty first of august then on the first of september
but if you for example you're born on the sixteenth of the month then that's generally when it would be paid on the sixteenth
the actual monthly pension the lump sum would be paid on the first of september
the enhancement from the does that
no in the case of a premature retirement where there is enhancement erm that's actually payable on the last banking day of the month so that will tend to be anything from the twenty eighth to the thirty first
so that's always at the end of the month
you may obviously you're going to have two payments coming in but you may well find that you know they're no longer on the same sort of day
so the lump that you take the UNK the part of the enhancement that is the lump sum
yes
that will from the authority the part that the authority pay when is that when will that be paid in
you've said that the erm
pension
t p a will pay the large part on the first of september got that
now when will the part that the authority pay for the lump sum come in will that be at the end of august or the beginning of UNK or the end of september
it should be at the beginning of september
right
so it should come at the same
it should be
time as the other one
yes
right
but the pension itself
at the end of the month
the authorities part will come at the end of the month and the t p s will come on the your birthday
that's right
birthday date
yeah
yeah got you
thank you
erm about income tax are they all taxed at source or do we have to do that separately
i think they're actually taxed at source
but
the payments sorry i wasn't i was just thinking
right
yes they're dealt with same way there's hardly any break between payment of salaries and onto superannuation
there's usually a change of paying departments not always but you'll find no break apart from er the UNK of income
entirely as you mentioned it's regarded as earned income
so it's taxed at source
at yes in
the same way as salary
as your salary is
yes
thank you
yes
can i ask erm the authority bit of early retirement what happens if erm the county is UNK under local er government reorganization which is a distinct possibility
do the other authorities pick up that automatically
i don't know what would happen
the answer must be that somebody will pay
well presumably
it's called the unitary authority the new one would be and i think suggestion is that the city would go separate as opposed to the county
the pensions are index linked erm to take account of cost of living
increases are applied erm in april each year
UNK for such increases if somebody takes premature retirement and they're actually below the age of fifty five the increases don't apply until you UNK you fifty fifth birthday
at that point your pension will be brought up to date and you would see an increase then and annually thereafter
erm in cases of UNK pensions erm ill health UNK i mentioned previously the increases apply there from the very start so irrespective of the age in UNK case the erm the increase does apply
well your redundancy payment is a one off
pension
it depends what you would get if your under the age of fifty five yes
yeah
redundancy payments
yeah the UNK frozen for five years and then catches up
if you if you
under the age of fifty five
yeah
erm can i move on to family benefits now a word about family benefits
er the teachers' superannuation scheme the payment of erm UNK and children's pensions
erm and there are basically a short term pension is available
long term pensions for UNK and children
there are also UNK pensions
and erm a payment which is known as the death grant
so if a teacher actually dies in service you know whilst you are still employed in service er first of all actually be a death grant payable
erm there are various calculations for this but it's going to actually be at least one year's average salary
there would also be a short term pension payable er and this would be paid for three months at the rate of your pension or pay at the time of death
and that's paid erm to your spouse to you know to keep things sort of flowing if you like while the long term pension is sorted out
so at least there's income coming in for three months at the rate of your salary
thereafter long term pensions they are payable erm at whatever rate you provided for
so if all your service counted benefits the long term pension would actually be half your pension
for the married men all service from the first of april nineteen seventy two counts erm for family benefits
before that you had the option of paying additional contributions to cover previous service so you will no doubt know if you actually took up that option
if you did then the chances are that all your service will count for family benefits
er for the married women erm only service for the sixth of april nineteen eighty eight counts
so when that provision was introduced you too had the option of paying additional contributions to cover previous service
erm obviously if you didn't then the UNK pension will be quite a bit less cos we're only talking about from nineteen eighty eight
erm children's pensions they would be half the UNK or UNK pension and they're payable for dependant children up to the age of seventeen and for children who are in full time erm higher education and for one child the payment would be actually half the UNK or the UNK pension
if there were two or more children then you would actually receive erm twice that amount so you'd receive half the pension
so if you like the that pension plus the UNK or UNK would UNK to your pension
UNK pensions it's possible for er single people to actually nominate a financially dependant close relative to receive erm pension benefits in the event of your death
you do actually have to make these nominations whilst you're employed in UNK service
erm and that nomination would subsequently lapse should you marry or erm on the death marriage or UNK of the person that you actually nominated
if anybody actually erm would wish to pursue this one you actually need a leaflet eight six one pen
perhaps like to mention it at the end of the session and i can arrange to get one of those sent to you
but you do have to make this nomination whilst you are employed in UNK service
and again the person that you nominate does have to be financially dependant on you
i'm i don't know precisely
it's quite a quite a while
quite a few years
am i right for any of these er nominations you have to set aside part of the pension you would normally receive so that you actually receive a lower pension because you are making this provision
erm i think that's possibly a term called allocation
where you can actually allocate part of your pension and to your spouse up to up to a third actually
yeah
erm to increase their benefits
mm
erm so that is possible it actually does mention on the fourteen pen it does erm where you can surrender part of your pension to provide a pension for your spouse or dependant after death
so you can allocate up to a third
the thing is having done that erm if circumstances change you couldn't actually you can no longer access that amount
also am i right the person in the provision has to be
yes it does it's if anybody's interested in that provision the allocation provision you do need to er to write to the teachers' pensions agency
explaining that you know you either want further information on it or you would like to erm you know take that one up
the same provision applies i mean if you allocated s so much of your pension and that person died then there's no way you can actually access that amount that you've allocated
it's once you've allocated it it's erm you know it's actually gone from your from your calculation
so it's a risk you have to calculate
yeah i suppose it is
erm i know one of the erm one of UNK colleagues UNK say that it's erm it's i suppose it depends on your individual circumstances
i suppose you've got to weigh up UNK of various
any further questions there about er the benefits if you were actually to you know if you were to die whilst employed in UNK service
the family benefits that would be payable when a pensioner dies very much UNK erm those that would be payable if you were to die whilst employed in UNK service
there would be a short term pension normally paid for three months
this time it would be at the rate of your pension
as opposed to your actual UNK pay
erm the long term pension again would be at half your pension at best
erm the same provision applies to the children's pension
half the rate of the UNK pension for one child and it would UNK to that amount if there were two or more children
the same provision is extended to UNK pensions
as far as the death grant goes erm for a pensioner that would only be payable erm if somebody actually died within year of leaving UNK service due to ill health and they were not in receipt of an UNK pension
so if you're knocked down by a bus that doesn't count
if you had an accident and you died as a result
i mean it's got to be some illness i suppose that
so apart from the death grant erm the other the short term and long term pensions tend to mirror erm you know what would be payable should you actually die in service
you said children would receive it if they were still in full time education higher education
h higher education
did you say higher
mm
so
well in full time education yes
so even though they could be sort of twenty five
yes i mean we had a case recently i think the son was twenty four all these UNK students
would that apply if they'd been independent but gone back into it
that's what my son's doing
yeah
i'll check that one out for you actually i don't know
i suspect it would
mm
right
you know if they were if they were in erm in full time education at the time
it would depend on was claiming the grant and or whether he was claiming the grant in his own right
if he was claiming a grant in his own right he would be classed as independent
if he was claiming a grant in yours i did i claimed when i went back to college my twenties i actually claimed a grant but my father claimed income tax relief claimed under him
but if you claim it in your own right you'll be classed as independent no longer dependant on you therefore you he isn't your dependant any longer
that i'll check i'll check that one out
mm
yeah
can i make it quite crystal clear to my own mind long term pension benefits it doesn't come automatically it only comes if you surrender part of your own pension thus making provision for
it isn't in addition to the pension you're getting you have to be willing to give up part of your own pension in advance
i think that's what i understand as allocation
mm
UNK pension is when you nominate a dependant person to receive benefits in the event of your death
but
which is quite separate to allocation
so you don't have to surrender part of your pension with in mind
UNK pension no
no you're entitled to that you know that's the if you have actually nominated somebody and that nomination has been accepted by the teachers' pensions agency
but you wouldn't be able to nominate your wife as a dependant
they would automatically say forget it
erm it's a they talk here about UNK a parent a brother or sister or a UNK step parents
unless the benefits would actually automatically pass to your parents
erm any further questions on family benefits
presumably if spouse has died
can i move on now to re employment
er re employment after retirement and the effects on your pension
increasingly people are retiring earlier and you know asking about returning to work
erm as far as how much you can actually earn without affecting your pension those queries are dealt with specifically by the UNK office in crawley
erm and the de the details for the p g o are given in this re employment leaflet which is in the information pack
erm but they deal with the how much you can earn without affecting your pension
the teachers' pensions agency in UNK actually determine what type of work affects erm your pension
your re employment earnings
so if you become re employed after retirement in a post which is outside of the education service the civil service local government erm private industry self employment that work will have no effect on your teacher's pension
also if you do any full or part time UNK in university that will not affect your re employment earnings
but a former UNK for example nottingham trent university any work there would affect your pension
so full or part time work in university excluding the former UNK have no effect on your pension
the reason for that i understand is that erm the sort of former universities it's something to do with the superannuation scheme quite separate so it's all sort of based on their superannuation schemes
erm as far as teaching employment goes full or part time teaching supply teaching in erm a local authority school or in independent schools which participate in a teachers superannuation scheme will actually have an effect on your pension
now as far as actually calculating what effect the re employment earnings will have on your pension er basically your pension and your UNK earnings cannot exceed your salary reference
and the salary reference is the highest salary rate you've actually received during the last three years
it UNK slightly from the average salary which is which is the best year out of the last three
the salary reference is actually the highest salary rate
erm and that's the rate that the UNK office use to determine erm you know how your pension will be affected
that salary reference is actually index linked each year so that your earnings can you know can rise without erm being affected
as far as part time work goes and supply work because erm that work is sort of quite UNK i suppose it can be i mean some people do a regular amount some do bits here and there
erm they work on er quarterly earnings
so within a pension quarter the same ruling applies in that your pension and your re employment earnings cannot exceed a quarter of your salary reference
and they measure the quarters from your birthday from one quarter to the you know the day in the next quarter
so if you like the first quarter will UNK it'll be pro UNK that's going to be less because it's only part of
erm what you need to do if you are re employed er you need to let the UNK office know and there is a form in the this leaflet asking you various questions
for example you know where you're going to be working and what the rate of salary is
how much you know you're expecting to do part time full time etcetera
erm and we find in the office that we get lots of forms coming in from the UNK general asking us to confirm that mister x is employed you know on a on a part time basis
erm now we advise you to fill that in once you do return to work because at least then they can let you know if you are going to exceed the limit
you know if you didn't fill it in they would act actually catch up with you at some stage and you may erm if you had exceeded the limit be erm you know you may be issued with a demand for a cheque for x for x number of pounds for UNK of pension
so i would advise you to you know complete that form at the outset really just for your for your own sake
if you'd like to know specifically how much you personally can earn without affecting your pension i would also suggest that you actually write to the UNK office will work out the amounts erm you know the figure that you've got based on your particular circumstances
in cases of ill health re employment after ill health retirement erm you cannot return to work until you have been UNK cleared
you know be UNK fit to return
er the same sort of UNK provisions apply
the only difference is that erm if you return to work in a part time capacity and it amounts to half time or more then you will subsequently be asked to UNK a medical examination
and if it's determined that you are to return to work then your pension would actually will cease
so i think that's you know that's an important fact for anybody who is taking ill health retirement
but erm you know they do sort of keep a close eye on what they're working unless of course they are hoping to erm for their health to improve and to be able to return to full time teaching ultimately
but you know they really need to watch how much part time work they are doing because it could mean that their pension will be suspended if they did work too much
generally speaking i think you can up to about half time without having any effect on your re employment earnings
er the other thing is if anybody's taking premature retirement you should also notify the UNK the county treasury at county hall because re employment earnings can have an effect have an effect on the erm enhancement that you receive
but the superannuation section at UNK would actually work that one out
erm again i wouldn't have thought that you know odd days here and there would have any effect but if it's going to more long term and the you know the amount increases then it could have an effect on your premature retirement compensation
any questions then
what happens on the you may not be employed
erm the teachers' pensions UNK currently reviewing erm the work that can affect pensions
and i've had some conflicting information recently because not very long ago they did say that any part time UNK paid UNK in a college would have no effect on pension
but it did seem somewhat of a UNK actually but they ac are actually now re examining that one er and i think erm i mean they've since said that it does affect you know it would be counted as work
as would sort of consultancy work undertaken on a consultancy basis
at the moment the advice they will give you is that erm you're okay but they are reviewing the regulations and once they actually er reach a decision then that work will be
but generally speaking the criteria they tended to use was if it was work that would normally be UNK under the teachers' scheme then that was work that would affect re employment earnings
but part time UNK paid UNK for example isn't eligible work under the teachers' superannuation scheme although they are bringing that one into the work that can affect
so they are really UNK up
anything else on re employment
question about if you get employment outside education although has no effect whatsoever on
no
on so in and you don't even need to notify the UNK general or you don't have to notify anybody employment outside the teaching area altogether
i think it does suggest in here that erm you should notify the UNK office even if you think that it is not
even if you're right outside if you're industry or whatever
yes
thank you
and why are we telling them this if it's not eligible for consideration as a possible way of UNK us of an cash
i don't i mean probably it's just to be to the safe side
mm
it's that that's simply the advice the advice that's given by the teachers' pensions agency
you know either way to actually just let the p g o know
mm ah
but definitely to let them know if it if it is sort of teaching
mm
teaching
i think there's one advantage in letting the UNK know because he UNK tax at source whereas your second employer may not and it may be to your advantage to be paying tax
ah
in a UNK p a y e
otherwise you'll have a lump sum later on
i see thank you or gets paid in cash
mm
they catch up with you one way or another
sooner or later yeah
could that affect your income
yeah i would advise you to contact the er notify the superannuation section yes of any re employment if you've taken premature retirement
yeah how much effect it does have i don't know because where but i think it's really basis you know it's better to be safe than sorry
okay
right that's it can i wish you all a long and happy healthy retirement
not the best of subjects to inject a little bit of humour but we did find er UNK of it nevertheless
anyway shall we show our appreciation
right
over to you
oh sorry
do you want to put that on the full screen
right so here we've got er the criteria surrounding p l c
i'm gonna start in reverse order
i ain't gonna start with the strengths we're starting with the threats basically to that s er
basically it's in the news at the moment and it's er very UNK to the criteria surrounding the company at the moment
so reading down there number one threat the shareholders
and most of you are probably aware that last year the company tried to UNK on their p l c p l c status and buy out existing shareholders erm and the UNK surrounding that erm the price that they were trying to UNK the shares from the existing shareholders er caused a lot of UNK er surrounding that scenario
so the actual shareholders themselves i think there's about forty one thousand of them in total are quite a big threat to basically the management of the company at the moment with regards to the direction of the company and the actual opportunities er for the future expansion and development of products and various market UNK etcetera
sorry
oh terribly sorry
i didn't think we'd started
i won't repeat it
can you can you say that again
right d developing the angle on the shareholders is the non executive directors
erm within the last two or three months i think they've appointed three or four non executive directors
erm the main difference between a non executive director and a director basically is that the directors are added to by the shareholders and are re elected at the annual general meetings
these people are basically independent to the company but they are appointed basically by the directors of the company in a capacity and basically er another safeguard or a check on the actual management what you would call management er UNK of the company
and it was one of the UNK criticisms that came out of the er i think it was one of the annual general meetings non executive directors in there to UNK er basically as another control against mister himself i suppose really at the end of the day
that's what they're trying to aim at
moving down there market barriers
er and that basically erm UNK the fact that there's er a lot more er competition basically coming from eastern europe
it's not just er a case of er north america UNK the computer scene there erm er UNK and trade barriers and what have you erm in various non e non e c countries which i UNK quite a UNK block for future and expansion in various developing countries
especially the pan eastern europe er pan eastern pacific area
which is quite a fast developing and growing area at the moment
overseas competition basically there again is i mean er erm okay i mean i b m i mean they're UNK day by day and companies like i c l and what have you
and basically it's the actual thrust of overseas competition basically
not necessarily eastern europe but also from the pacific UNK again there
so we're looking on global terms here erm basically and also within the e c so basically to get market UNK
you can't just sort of think about north america get it in isolation you gotta look basically as e er euro p l c market place
the economic climate obviously the present economic climate in the u k e c and the world is not UNK exactly er UNK in any shape or form with regards to the development or growth or even stability
erm so basically it's not just er a threat to the actual market in general it's an even more acute threat to individual places within that market
as er competition becomes even more fierce and er competitive and yeah well the threat of threat to the weaknesses which are connected to some of the threats actually
right okay we'll work form the top down actually
alan there quite a big weakness within the company
erm by the city in the city institutions of london he's seen as quite a UNK character but they don't quite see eye to eye on the issues of the company
public relations well as i've already outlined there the actual UNK surrounding the proposed er share UNK there was a public relations nightmare form beginning to end
and also with regards to product development and actual er image of the company there the relations side is quite weak
financial performance that is basically the financial strength or weakness of at the present
obviously it's losing market share price competition UNK right down to the bottom line left right and centre
it's actual product range is very UNK
erm basically leading down there the products and corporate strategy there they're having difficulty identifying what their product range
who their individual UNK competitors are within those product lines
so they haven't actually gotta formed a corporate strategy on the actual UNK product development
financial individual erm competition within each market UNK
opportunities
right here we go yeah number one opportunity satellite t v
and that UNK that is not necessarily just based within the u k
it's the thing that's er keeping them going in various aspects but obviously definitely on the european scale there er satellite television is an area which i would be very surprised if they did not er develop a hell of a lot more
infrastructure that's related to the actual infrastructure of the er UNK electronics and computer software market within the u k as a rule
erm basically as a new market opportunities come he's gotta develop er and adapt to those any new opportunities that do arise
be it new products new competition and new markets that do arise
and i mean the actual the u k market those in those areas is quite developed and has got quite a reputation but obviously it has got to be able to develop and adapt accordingly over time
market UNK yeah
erm basically it's er like the collapse of i b m makes a the total world market things like that
and that's gonna create opportunities but also er the possibilities of joint UNK be it on a u k europe or the world basis er joint UNK will i mean a lot more cooperation between er th the large players with regards to product development what have you
UNK rather than competing against each other to develop basically their products have gotta be ab able to work with each others machines
sort of exchange technology research and development
and that basically that amounts to UNK of products
so basically i b m p cs and things like this like that
we can actually er use various actual computer equipment er open systems er recently new development as well which basically a lot of companies have been UNK their share resources to develop this area
er the market we're looking at there the pan pacific UNK there especially showing a market at the moment
till the end of the decade er i think it's number one d er developing market so that's the place that you want to get into
the last they have actually got some strengths
erm number one strength alan erm although he doesn't see to eye t eye to eye with er a lot of the city institutions and a lot of the shareholders erm he does know his business erm and he has quite a strong character very UNK and
so he's er in quite a strong position with regards to the actual corporate UNK and strategy of the company there which is
the management staff good quality staff very high highly technical expertise etcetera so they've got staff there
non executive directors that is a strength erm it's also a threat but it is also a strength but basically it's acting as a sort of UNK to control or actually guide the actual management right down from board level right down the company there
research and development
well i'm only gonna a month ago they did actually er officially announce the launch of a product there it's the pen writing pad personal organizer there
so basically it's like a little computer there and it reads your handwriting basically on your little UNK there
like a UNK er UNK
two hundred and ninety nine plus vat is the retail value
erm which is points up a weakness there on the public relations side there i mean going back to their post share UNK they said that they'd got no new products in the pipeline no research and development really sort of throwing anything up in the near future
two or three months after that he's got a new product out they're trying to keep it slightly quiet and saying that it's not a world UNK and sort of er go back to their more in innovative
but there again that's the shareholders er don't see you know like to get a bit more er information and good public relations for the company
and as a general outline it's a strength of the company u k p l c the actual computer market within the u k has worldwide reputation for its quality technical expertise and it has already got a good er holding in various companies all around the world
a being on a UNK base and the actual software associated with that as well
erm thank you any questions
could you leave it on the er
UNK there
right yeah
thank you
right anybody like to make any comments on that
it was quite long
pardon
it was quite long
quite long quite long yes but i
don't worry about the length the content at the moment
thought gone into that isn't there
yeah
er one observation i would like to make is that you actually got certain items appearing in er more than one place
erm that tends to be unusual but in this particular case it is very relevant
and the fact that you've got alan there in the strengths and weaknesses is without alan may struggle significantly because it's his management style his vision which drives a company on
but the weaknesses is that er he because he's a p l c then he's got to erm UNK to the system to the er the city and therefore erm that is always going to be seen as a problem for him as am individual
he's gone part of the way along the r road by doing what you've just been describing non executive directors but erm it could be a weakness if he's seen as a er erm a business man and UNK as opposed to somebody who fits in with the style that the UNK always looking for
yeah
any other comments
alright well let's leave that one for the moment
erm thank you very much brian and the team well done
next group
now i'm sorry i haven't brought an UNK
you haven't you're gonna draw right okay
no oh just
did you want a pen then to write on the board or not
erm
there's a pen there
there's lots of them
there's lots of them okay well
erm it's entirely up to you if you want to write up you can
there's a pen i think in the white box behind you
but if you want to talk straight that's okay
yeah right okay i'll talk unless anyone wants me to erm put them on the
right
board
we've chosen er british rail for our slot as opposed to UNK
and i'll go through some strengths that we feel they have and the UNK obviously is one of the er major strengths
intercity gives them a very good image if your journey was on time but it's definitely there as a positive thing
erm straight into the city centres of most major cities so you er if you travel by train you're there in the centre if that's where you want to be
erm with the UNK we feel that it's a very clean and green way of travel
erm bulk movement of materials and the national network it has
we opportunities are privatization but we've also said that is a threat
er specialist trains would be an opportunity we felt and the history of er trains to emphasize that
the communication that they now have with UNK
franchises and train UNK we think are opportunities but still possibly underneath the er umbrella of british rail
weaknesses UNK of working UNK
the image erm particularly on the time keeping of trains
UNK rolling stock particularly in the UNK
UNK on certain trains
poor safety record
erm UNK erm vulnerable infrastructure and poor customer relations
the catering we feel could do with erm er improvement
i know they've had several attempts at that but we still don't think they've got it right
and we think er in some cases it's very expensive
and not happy about the structure of pricing for travel whether you have a single or return or s erm a UNK they er they don't seem to make sense in many cases
erm the weakness is er government requirements often UNK
er threats again as i said privatization lack of funds road UNK safety erm again bad
open profits making lines will survive we feel that's a threat
and er because of that then the price is out of the range for a lot of people to travel by train
and coaches long distance travel are coming in so that again is a threat to the erm using british rail
and the economic climate which we think is obviously a weakness
and those are what we've thought out for british rail
thank you very much
thank you
any questions on that any comments
yes i don't agree with the poor safety record in my view and i think it's supported by fact that rail is the UNK way to travel anywhere any time
erm this is quoted UNK enough by air travel that without question rail is the UNK way to travel and in fact to me that's a strength not a weakness
m my view of that was that's the one i'd a question mark against
yeah
cos i don't think it's the problem of a erm a safety record i think it's the perceived
right
safety record
yeah
it's the perceived safety record yeah
because in fact the statistics show it to be very good indeed
yeah
erm and it's a bit like UNK i mean they they've got their own system now for evaluating how good they are at time keeping and i think the erm the figure they try and hit is about ninety five percent isn't it of trains arriving on time
i think it's the image that so many trains are late
yes it's the image that yeah
well that's the problem
that's the problem
again if you think about how many people actually provide their goods on time to their customers ninety five percent of the time or provide the goods and provide them on time that record is their record is very good
it's the perceived
but gordon haven't
yeah
british rail shifted the goal posts on time
yes
right
because they couldn't meet c couldn't meet what they were previously doing they have altered it in such a way as to make it easy to achieve
they've just added time on to all the journeys
yes
but they've been doing that since er last century
yeah but you gotta remember these are that these are being posed on basically
they'd be setting their own goals targets and what have you
yeah
and they're having these x UNK to finance er capital investment cos they're not a private company
i mean the UNK about actually UNK trains has taken several years to develop erm and you just have to look at the moment now and he doesn't know if he's UNK or swimming basically
er a complete dead loss about which way to go and turn basically
yeah
erm you go back onto the performance guidelines that have been basically imposed citizens charter really at the end of the day
well yeah i mean
but a lot of i mean i mean there's no sort of set up and strategy for rail as a sort of within an integrated transport policy phone call from er john UNK who er tories in transport
there's no sort of like ten year corporate strategy for british rail
you were gonna make a point there
well i was gonna come back on this record of safety
i mean one of the points we made there was that the infrastructure is vulnerable
i mean just because it might be safer to travel on the train doesn't from the fact that the incidence of where people gain access to the rails and there are near UNK either to the drivers or the people on level UNK or everything else
they're all added in just because they don't have an accident doesn't might go for making it the UNK infrastructure perhaps
so safety is a thing which is can't just be said oh it's safer to go by train than it is to cross the road
it's getting worse
it depends if you're in the right place at the wrong time or the wrong place at the right time
i mean y you take a situation of stuff getting dropped from bridges UNK in front of trains
you know quite apart from the fact that you get a situation where somebody sets fire to the infrastructure and it closes down the whole of the east coast main line like it did two days ago
it's vulnerable
but nevertheless its er its safety record is still a damn site better than the roads
what did you say about the cost
yes well the thing is that the erm we feel
what it's the structure for the a for the average person
if you're if you're say a family with small children yes you can get all sorts of con concessions
if you're a student you can get concessions
if you're an old age pensioner you can get concessions but for the average person who isn't one of those no chance
well the situation is also that it's confusing in terms of apex UNK er you can't travel on these trains at certain times you've got to plan your journey three months ahead if you want to get the maximum savings and all the rest of it
you know i it's
yeah you wanna have subsidies yo that you get on foreign rails you know you get
well that that's one of the arguments for remaining under government funding
next to nothing can't you over in some countries
so it's confusing or UNK
yes it is yes that's right it is
yeah
yes i mean we can understand that if you're gonna get a cheaper ticket you'll have to book well ahead and obviously they've got to try and ease the UNK on some trains
there's one other point
the sa the same applies for pricing virtually to anything else if you're going to take the maximum advantage of flying by air you either have to book it well in advance through a package or whatever or whatever or else you'd have to go along and sit in a bucket shop hoping that somebody's gonna
yeah that's right
turn up with an empty seat
it's not as not as simple as that though
i mean if you walk into the station on a day wanting to get on a train there are still several different fares you can pay
is different from the cost per mile down south on tickets as well
there's no standard thing
over the UNK market cos they've got a UNK market
why does it cost me ten pounds fifty return from UNK but if i take a single to UNK to UNK from york it costs me ten quid
yeah that's right
i mean UNK and there's different prices if you go from cardiff to bristol it'll cost you x amount if you go bristol to cardiff it costs you something different
they wanna get their act straight
so it's the over complexity of pricing
yes
yeah
i had er a return ticket from york to UNK and i was fortunate enough to get a lift back so i went into the station to ask if i could get a refund on the other half of the return and they said sure you owe us four pounds
because the price of a single was almost the same as the price of the return but to get a refund you have to pay an administration charge which when you add it all up comes to me UNK them four pounds
and then they tried to take and i said well thank you very much i won't have a refund after all
and they tried to take the bloody ticket off me
oh i'm surprised they didn't charge you for the cost of a single journey
right okay any more points
erm another strength i think erm and this is once again point of view but it literally is er is the track itself track access
you y if you set out on a train under normal circumstances you're confident that you're going to arrive in london at
at some point soon
as my daughter did on sunday in two and a half hours
and er on the other hand you can get in your car and you can get down to suddenly find they've got the road up or e g as we did coming down to york today there's driving his er surface UNK down the road and er you're stuck in a traffic jam for a wee while er
it can still happen on the train
now you're guaranteed you're stuck on electric all you need is one fault at northallerton two days ago and you close the east coast main line completely
it's more it's more
everybody who was on those trains
it's more unlikely
yes but on the trains you're stuck
now in the car you can say oh sod this i'll back UNK and double drive this way down there and you skip it
when you go and buy your ticket and you're setting off on that day
mm
erm you're warned in advance of any delays aren't you
wonderful last easter weekend back from glasgow we were warned there was gonna be delays and we were fortunate we were one of the groups who came back fairly early
there were other people who started back at midday from glasgow and got to york at midnight to find all the UNK had been closed and things like that
when it happens with a train it's one hundred percent you're absolutely stuck with the thing
you know if you've ever been stuck in this you know you've got an appointment somewhere you know the UNK incredible
the sa the same thing can happen with air travel
blooming airport overnight
or else you can be on the way back from europe and suddenly find oh i'm sorry that UNK not leaving tonight mister would you mind going and spending the night in the holiday hotel in so and so and so and so
ah you spent the night in a holiday inn great on a train you're stuck on the train
it doesn't make
the same thing could happen if you walked out of here this afternoon there could be a bomb s threat between a and b wherever you're going and you can't even get round
a bomb threat on a train than i would in an aeroplane robert
okay i think we'll as i thought we could actually start the discussion
well who's gonna who's gonna be using the erm
erm right er can we make a start ladies and gentlemen
erm good day er my name is philip er i am the quality controller for the proposed water company
er and i'd like to introduce you briefly to the company
erm as the result of a board of directors decision taken on er march twenty second nineteen ninety three it was proposed that a new public liability holding company named the water company be formed er from the UNK er UNK of assets currently surplus to requirements of the founding company namely
er the york based company will be a wholly owned subsidiary of limited
er trading is er expected to commence within the with the naming of the company at an opening ceremony at the registered office headquarters in york
the ceremony to be held on the twenty fourth of april nineteen ninety three
er it is proposed that the water company er be formed with the express intention of UNK eight point five percent of the united kingdom bottled water market
er this being gradually achieved over a three year UNK expansion period
erm in year one growth is expected to be within a targeted range up to two and a half percent
in year two er up to six percent and in year three eight percent of the united kingdom bottled water market
the founding company is being use surplus existing production manufacturing sales distribution and transportation UNK in the united kingdom currently operated by limited
er to that end now er i would like to hand you over to progressively to my colleagues
er and the first gentleman i'd like to call on er is mister anthony who is our marketing director to give us a market overview and assessment of the product opportunity
okay
thank you very much
right now good afternoon ladies and gentlemen
and as my colleague has already stated we're a new company and we aim to UNK eight percent of the er u k bottled water market
erm the way we've er determined this is through research by a market intelligence unit er which has been UNK by retail market intelligence and UNK er as the basis of our research and our calculations
er we've used this to analyze the consumer preferences and purchasing questions indicated erm through this research
and they indicate there that there are excellent opportunities opening up in the united kingdom bottled water market across the full range of available products commonly UNK and specifically identified friendly product ranges
the total available market consists of thirty percent of the total population of the united kingdom
but this market is expanding at a rate of at least five percent and predictions and calculations show that this is far in e in excess of this base rate
the two ranges the firstly still water and secondly bottled s sorry the two ranges are firstly still water and secondly UNK water
both ranges will be produced using both high quality yorkshire UNK water and good quality UNK practical using the york er using a good quality UNK practical co containers using the own brand label
it is our aim to exploit this growing market the full range of resources and materials and systems that are available er as previously mentioned by my colleague
erm our marketing has been targeted on a geographical basis er on three main areas
the london region yorkshire and in scotland
again erm all of this information erm provided er backs up our er our plan further market research based upon information has UNK our target area UNK by UNK and UNK economic group age and sex
where these key indicators illustrate the most favourable conditions er we are going to base our main advertising campaign and i'll now hand you over to my colleague
er thank you tony for that most UNK insight into the bottled water market
erm and i should now like to introduce er thomas director of public relations who will talk us through 's product UNK and competition followed by a detailed review of where our product fits into the market and it's u s p
i wanna right the products erm the product UNK and opportunities erm
the main competitors are UNK water with te twenty four percent of the market UNK spring with six percent UNK soft drinks own label er twenty eight percent nestle four percent er coca cola UNK four percent UNK fifteen percent
and there are forty other companies erm which have eighteen percent of the market
er okay other com competitors we've we see are er all companies which sell mineral water
erm to include ourselves
erm people like UNK people like coca cola
now these are huge companies with vast volume of sales in the UNK er drinks market
now we see ourselves entering into this market not immediately but in the not too distant future
er our intention would be to direct our advertising towards the natural fresh qualities of the product and the powerful lobby of the UNK
however the UNK water is not our first priority
at a later stage erm in our program we would also be looking at larger containers of erm of water er something like well in our third year erm five litre UNK
now another very another and very important er competitor is the water boards
erm and they have problems with er the quality of water and the sa standards not re reaching the sort of specifications er the pu public not trusting the er product and consequently looking for alternatives
er seasonal UNK erm the UNK of recent years particularly in the UNK have made supplies of good drinking water less than secure
erm and er that's where erm records show us that er wa bottled water is
erm as it happens this is the area where a spring of mineral water here for er for us to exploit
erm UNK erm er this is a particular UNK problem for many people who don't like UNK to water
erm and spring water produced within the regulations of the e c would be pure of any UNK
our market we see our market as being national
would give us their backing and channels of distribution er we shall be in correct in direct competition with our competitors in the a areas which we consider to be most profitable
we shall place our advertising where it will be most cost effective
and we shall continue to update our sales strategy as we see the market develop
our product our product is first class yorkshire spring water obtained from the springs rising from the UNK bottled in yorkshire to comply with erm u k national mineral water regulations e c directive
er we shall be producing it in three hundred and thirty c bottles to meet the demand for UNK drinks and a small bottle for trade market
will be produced in both still and UNK excuse me as per bottle
we shall be producing in UNK and for s er for machine UNK and supermarket shelves
in litre bottles er both still and s UNK for use in bars and in and in a house where there's regular use
in two in two litre containers still only in this case to cater for those people generally er generally needing a larger supply available in the home in UNK etcetera
all these will be UNK priced erm alongside market leaders in price for quality
whilst we recommend a retail price for all sizes as with all similar product on the market it will be up to the vendor to adjust for the prices the margins that they require
our unique proposition is bottled in blue glass erm the unique proposition er bottled in blue glass to UNK reflect the clean cut image which is different to our competitors
and also using the distribution of deliveries to the door daily we can also use the sales staff to as assist us in distribution
okay right
pretty encouraging view of approach to the bottled water market and to the anticipated stance UNK
er i hope that now that anne who is our very capable financial director will UNK us with a breakdown of costs and an insight into targets with attendant indicators of relative volumes
right erm i'm not sure actually whether you're going to be able to see this because
erm my initial talk is on the actual breakdown of the costing for this exercise
erm i've broken down the costing into each of the sizes we will produce the thirty three UNK the one litre and the two litre sizes
i've also broken the smaller ones down into the cost for the still and the UNK water
erm the actual percentage of the ingredients used over the first year erm is about five percent for water twenty three point six percent for the bottle i'll explain that later that's quite high the cap is four percent one percent for the UNK erm one percent for the case two point seven percent for labour four percent for transport a general overhead would be about seventeen point one percent
erm we've made a provision for interest payable on the loan on the assumption that we may have to borrow money on an UNK basis
and we've made er that's erm accounts for about one point six percent of the total cost
for the advertising which is the biggest erm amount we have to spend on is actually forty percent
the UNK actually larger than other products are currently spent on their advertising but w we feel that with the launch of a new product and trying to catch eight and a half percent of the mar market over erm three years that we do need to spend heavily in the department so like i say that's forty percent
but that's only in the first year in the second year erm the percentage will reduce quite rapidly and we're only spending half the second and third years
erm back to the bottles
now we had quite a problem trying to obtain erm a bottle size the two litre size at a reasonable price when we set out on this er thing
so it's costing us approximately twenty pence for each bottle and that's very high that's a very high quality bottle
we've just been in discussions with the manufacturers and we actually but we're hoping to get a discount on that in the near future so we're hoping the cost of that will come down
the contribution erm made by each of these products after we've used an average sales price erm is seven and a half pence roughly for the smallest size erm about eighteen pence average for the one litre size and eleven twelve percent twelve pence sorry for the large size
erm the large size is really a relatively it it's a smaller percentage of the market so we've had to price it as far down as we can that's why our contribution for the large size is not as large as the erm the overhead the sorry the capital costs erm will be a total of two hundred and ninety thousand which is two hundred for factory UNK eighty thousand for plant and ten UNK ten thousand for the UNK
erm the pricing of the product
we priced it at a UNK price a UNK price and a con the price of a consumer
erm the small bottles will be b er be between thirty two and thirty five pence to the consumer
the market average is about thirty one pence but we feel that we can cos we're UNK producing such a high quality product that we can raise the price above that
for the one litre size the average price is about sixty seven pence
whereas the market size is it varies considerably
we've found that own UNK are from thirty five pence up to the top quality UNK are something like eighty five pence and we feel we've hit the market in the middle there
so we're quite happy with that price
erm the two litre size now like i say once again we're having erm problems with getting erm an economical er cost for the bottle of this so our price is actually slightly higher than the other market price
once again the market price erm for this size is from fifty three pence for own brand sizes up to about eighty pence for up sorry eighty two pence for erm the top quality products
unfortunately we're gonna have to market ours at about eighty two pence but we feel this is quite reasonable considering that the vast the biggest sales of this two litre size would be from the milk UNK and would delivered to the door
so we feel that's quite reasonable
and the market the market size really for in year one is two and a half percent which is fourteen and a half million litres of water
year two is six percent which is thirty four point eight million litres of water
year three eight and a half percent of the market which is forty nine point three million litres of w water
erm we feel quite confident that we can reach these targets
erm and that's the product analysis erm from my part of the team
thank you
thank you anne for that very detailed and realistic view of the potential available to the company er i'd now like to call on tom again er to give us a highlighted UNK of the advertising and UNK campaign water intend to pursue
right our UNK advertising and commercial campaign
er to reach our target objectives we ha we need a very strong sell to the trade
including a large and sustained advertising campaign
now initially er starting er starting may er for suppliers to be the adverts for from the beginning of the summer holidays and then looking forward to the christmas trade
right well first of all the first thing we can probably do is UNK to the trade introducing product and incentives
and it would be something along these lines
this is the front of the UNK which would go to the trade
and followed by er the message inside
okay which says er UNK introducing our new product range of spring water available from may the first ready for the summer trade
and then it goes into the details of erm the various sizes which we have
in three hundred and thirty c bottles er the still will be in gold top and the UNK in silver
and as for your customer a mark of quality UNK
in UNK for the machine vendors and those with who prefer this in er this environment friendly pack er package
in litre bottles to cater for everyday use in the house the restaurant the pub the club
in two litre bottles for the heavier users of fresh spring water
trade incentives one case free for every ten purchased in the in introductory period which we've UNK as four weeks
and fifty pence per case UNK for orders during er introductory period as well
we shall be delighted to receive your order by telephone or when our representative visits you
there will be heavy t v post and press advertising UNK in june
there will also be the opportunity for your customers to save bottle tops for or pu or purchase heavily discounted quality goods
okay
we at the at the UNK erm the initial opening as well we've we would er offer an invitation to the press and the media to attend our launch meeting er from this we would hopefully get some advertising in as much as apply to erm and er hope t to get x amount of the market
that generally works
we shall have a four work sell in to the trade via representatives er they will have funds available to purchase shelf UNK in supermarkets cash and carries if necessary
we re we require a hundred percent distribution in all of our direct customers by the end of week four
all major UNK to be visited by week one
major UNK being cash and carries erm supermarkets UNK etcetera
in the medium term advertising in trade magazines to cater for information of the launch getting to the indirect trade
that's the people that we don't call on erm with our representatives
we would we would like to build distribution in the in this market with the use of specialized agency teams
er we're aware of the costs and the effort er and that effort may have to er be delayed
erm in the long term that is er six weeks onwards er we would go into t v press posters and UNK in the store
right
er advertising as i said t v poster sites and press and point of sale
and we will see er our advertising al in all the media er going along these lines
so that would be for example poster sites and that for example would be er point of sale
a show card if you like
and if you notice what we're trying to do is with our er illustration here er is to reflect the UNK if you like of the yorkshire hills and yorkshire UNK and we have a logo of our own which appears in the corner of the screen
and can i also add that follows on with the pictures if you like on the UNK on the label in the bottle
we're also considering and will do our leaflet drops erm giving money off value er value perceived er gifts
and what i mean by that is for example er a pan like that we can buy for a quid which happens to be a
er with a perceived value of something like ten or twelve pounds but er that can be self financing with the profit on the bottles that the bottle tops that we ask for
for example if we make say for example five pence on the bottle and we or for cap er one of these for twenty bottle tops that's a quid which is paid for
so that's self financing
erm in store we're thinking in terms of purchased shelf UNK
if they if the er store is not gonna us enough UNK then we will be prepared to purchase them
just a note for you
er t v costs are thirty seconds of on all channels costs approximately two hundred and ten thousand pounds
to make the film would cost you something like a hundred and twenty thousand pounds
er if you want to go local erm say on towns it would cost you perhaps forty three thousand pounds for thirty seconds
however spots can be purchased for seven seconds and a pro UNK charge is made
er full page newspaper in UNK national UNK is UNK about erm twenty thousand
although the telegraph costs twenty seven thousand pounds for a full page and twenty thousand
as i said er trade incentive incentives fifty pence per for every ten purchased introductory or er order only
erm advertising ex expenditure will be heavy and varied and will change as our three year er plan UNK
our needs of the UNK campaign are perceived
we er we intend to break into profit in year three when we should have UNK our expenditure
right the UNK the image we're seeing is UNK and health
erm have agreed that we can take over two of their sponsored events er which is golf and tennis and it would be something like erm golf promotion
now you might that will get us on t v and it is also self financing as well in as much as you set up the promotion the t v companies but it off you
so it doesn't cost you anything in
and both these events are in keeping with the image we're seeking and as i said self financing
pe the fees are paid by the t v companies to cover this event
our advertising budget two and a half percent of the market the first year
we're gonna make a loss of one million one hundred and seventy seven thousand with an advertising spend of two and a half million
erm the second year six percent
we will in actual fact make a profit in the second year erm although that's gonna be against the fi first year loss
and the third year eight UNK eight and a half percent of the market we should in fact of two million two er thirty hundred and thirty four erm thousand pounds
er note we're flexible in our advertising budgets against make a profit in year three
erm i personally feel although some members of me team don't agree er with the with the heavy a advertising expenditure we've got we can probably do better than two and a half the first year certainly erm and maybe ten percent of the market in the end of the at the end of the day
right
advertising where it goes
these are preliminary er first year er two by thirty second spots half a million quid but that's national
erm a thousand poster sites at say five hundred pounds per site would cost half a million
and national UNK five UNK would cost you about four hundred thousand pounds
leaves about one point million pounds one point one million pounds to cover UNK introductory incentive leaflets buying shelf space added value goods money off incentives point of purchase
but the budget will be continually UNK er and adjusted to er suit the situation that we're in at that stage
er thanks tom that was really quite dynamic and UNK and i think you'll all agree
er now some more practical and down to earth aspects er michael director of development will run through the critical path analysis for the new factory extension
ah yes i thought that would er take you by surprise i noticed the sharp UNK of breath there erm but even now we're thinking in terms of expansion
thank you very much philip
my brief was to do a c p a for the factory extension
erm and also decide the UNK draw up the network decide the critical path and decide what action could be taken to reduce the overall project by three days
on the c p a on the c p a of the factory extension what we've done we have ordered the UNK which is taking a UNK of seven days
so the UNK will arrive on site
we will continue to from two three we will continue to dig the foundations in the mean time we hope the concrete the concrete will be arriving on site to complete those UNK
at the same time it is my belief that while we were do doing the UNK we can also the concrete to fall in line where we will erm put the main floor in
erm during the course of the UNK and UNK taking place bricks have been ordered to come in where the walls are being built together with the UNK
you'll see a dotted line coming off on er ordering the bricks it comes in here er to er the roof structure
now at the same time as ordering the bricks i'm taking on myself to order the tiles for the roof at the same time
thank you michael for that exciting view of the forthcoming plans for the expansion to cope with this new UNK market
erm now it's my spot er and it's a quality promise
we at water undertake to supply each and every UNK customer with a product that is clear cool and healthy to drink free from UNK and UNK
it will be maintained within the requirements of w s d eighty UNK seven eight and all new UNK directives
UNK being spelt m a double f UNK
erm er by continuous process control so that we can say this is water
erm now for the moment we've all been waiting for er what this means in terms of er profit loss and cash flow and anne will once again UNK us
i do realize out of time this so erm i'd like to just g erm go through the profit loss for one year quite quickly
erm as you can see the sales in the first two are expected to be four point nine almost five million pounds
erm the cost of sales is two and a half million pounds which gives us a gross profit of almost two and a half million pounds
you'll notice on the overhead cost the big cost is the advertising which is two and a half million pounds and that unfortunately takes us into a net loss at the end of the year of one point almost two million pounds
erm i've now set out the budget details for the three years
erm i've also erm put down the side of year one the actual percent of the cost for each of them
as you can see once again the advertising is a problem in year one which takes up forty percent of our actual cost of the total product
in year two this actually drops down to twelve point six percent and in year three down to nine five percent
erm year one once again we said we'll make a loss of one point almost two million
in year two we're expecting to make a profit of one point five million
you'll also notice that we put a provision in there of half a million for expansion of packing cos we believe that we may need this erm with the production of the o you for the carry on
thanks anne that sounds wonderful
erm so it's okay mike to you to summarize er all of this for us
fine okay thanks philip
well erm in complete summary i'd just like to go through three points again
a the product
the product is a very pure natural water from an underground spring with a clean taste high in calcium and low in UNK
it has UNK two UNK two years of UNK tests and is produced in two forms a UNK and a still version
the competitive edge
water is committed to the development of effective competition and has been UNK in many changes
competition in the british market for water today is a reality with some forty plus UNK competing for a share in this growth area
we believe that the quality of our product together with doorstep deliveries our unique selling proposition is highly valued by our customers
these arrangements are part of a wide ranging package of service s standards drawn up under the campaign banner of a commitment to customers
which marks the latest development in the company's long standing programme of customer care
we further believe that in carrying out these arrangements we enhance the company's reputation its quality of product flexibility and responsibility within the market place together with its personal service and image
future development
the company has always had a substantial research and development program and it will continue to develop s its businesses within the u k and take advantage of any appropriate profitable opportunities to extend operations
expansion by way of export to the e c is envisaged within the next twelve months
market research has shown us that people are far more health conscious and far more sensible about what they drink
if you don't want an UNK drink mineral water is an acceptable alternative
young people especially just take it for granted and order it automatically
so move over UNK you've got a new yorkshire rival
at that point i just want to stand up again because i think i've put very little into this altogether because i wasn't here
i'd just like to thank the fellow colleagues of my team for the effort and i regard er a very worthwhile and UNK performance
thank you one and all
right okay now who's got some questions
ah right well who wants to fire first then
go on mike you had your hand up first didn't you
right erm the thing that UNK me actually is this advertising budget so could you can you tell us erm what the timing of this advertising is in terms of yeah can you turn that over please
range er of information that you're gonna put out to that person so that he can bring in o other customers to your arms
i mean you know a lot of people don't have the orange UNK and the eggs and everything else that do cos they milk delivered day
how are they going to be able to join your network of doorstep deliveries
well i mean the most of them will obviously go to the cash and er to the er supermarkets and pick it up
but they're going to be cut out from the two litre bottle range er if they've got a bad back or these sort of situations
oh yeah right well i mean we could leave that to our representatives if you like erm to erm to cater for those UNK erm in the same way as the UNK
you know we'll always be and continually be looking for a er fresh UNK erm to sell our product
that's a great benefit of doing it sort of erm nationally
the intention was that we should set out to count the big sales first
we want the turnover we want the input and then er having succeeded hopefully by year three when we've er as we've maintained making a profit we will then look at some of the marginal sales as we would call them to er some of the smaller people
that obviously UNK er a great deal more overhead in terms of distribution
most of the market seems concentrated in the er initially in the two litre area for er to the centre of our sales would be in that area
and er over a period UNK into er different markets
do you not see any problems with the UNK using the name
oh we we've already spoken to the archbishop
do you have to pay any fee for using the name
yes we've er spoken to the council as well and we've er received all the authorities which are necessary from the york council and er everybody is happy on that
ah we know somebody up there
when you the title you're talking about UNK water a link between the two
yes well the reason for that was the erm the name is to do with the way we UNK market the product
er we're targeting three particular areas
we're targeting the area around london the area in yorkshire obviously and in scotland because the er UNK and economic roots provide er the right kind of market for our product
and er is a very well known er place indeed and we feel that people throughout the country indeed throughout the world can identify with
and it will also aid the tourist industry in york by providing people with a focus to using the material we have here they can identify with it and it may increase the er the trade er in york
you say that you know your main one of your main targets is the london area
do you see any problems trying to push a yorkshire product in the london area
well there are a lot of people from york UNK in london
and the marketing shown that people who buy this product are mainly the young women in UNK and UNK economic groups a and b and er a lot of er women like to be like yorkshire women
that kind of
also like to point out that UNK spring is erm a national product
the UNK springs are seen as natural but to me the UNK a rather UNK image
they've not got a fresh spring image
oh well that's you
er in addition to which er the problems that UNK had erm er i've forgotten exactly how long it is ago now but probably er two or three years ago er when they had er UNK through
have you got a UNK at all
pardon
have you got a UNK
we don't particularly need one i don't think
spring water from the UNK that's a good
the t v adverts thirty seconds is a long time
yeah right
ah yeah but i think you er misunderstood what we were saying
thirty seconds is to produce a film that's a long time we did talk about seven second slots as well
yes
which we can flash on
so you'll be using
oh yeah i mean we're only talking about a couple of initially er large erm thirty second spots if you like
they're too expensive you know for the sort of profit we're going to go into too much of that
the intention of the film is to sort of er create er the UNK to this product
in other words er pictures of er springs emerging from er UNK er UNK etcetera they're just to give you the UNK
to which tom says the essential punch will come from the er seven second advert
mm
bearing in mind that there's something like forty companies chasing about eighteen percent of this market do you honestly feel that your advertising revenue is going to go down as quickly as feel if you want to try and keep ahead of the pack and keep up with the leaders
well the there are only really three main competitors so are people in the market
and er we intend to er UNK er on our and indeed er makers of UNK spring water their market share is reducing and we intend to UNK that portion
aren't they
we did also point out er the advertising budget would be reviewed
er if we go in front of the of our objectives then we're on there's obviously more money to spend
is quite high bearing in mind the fact the national average
how are you doing are you
you're gonna you're saying you've got a problem with the cost of the bottles these are the blue ones
no these are the large ones
the large ones
the two litre size because of course the two litre is not well it it's erm we just had problems with erm finding somebody who would give us a er good quality bottle
the small bottles are glass though
are they UNK or UNK
well actually most people have most people want them for UNK
cos that's where that one came from
say sort of environmentally friendly and
yes we envisaged that bottle it has a certain sort of UNK about it so we expected that er a lot of sales for that eventually would go through the on trade and er obviously if it's on trade then er the thing is automatically re UNK and UNK
well there is a problem with recycling blue glass because of the colour
well not recycling bringing it back into the thing washing it and UNK
it may not help the advertising use blue but green
well there actually is a s spring water bottle actually producing already so
we actually think that blue bottle will stand out when there's no other
as long as it's not next to er UNK
can i just ask a couple of questions before we UNK before lunch
first of all can i talk about the erm how you're going to UNK your advertising campaign
because you're talking about a national launch er with a national campaign er developing one image
er with one t v commercial and yet you've said that your initial thrust will be erm in three areas
first of all london second yorkshire and third scotland
how you attack those markets can be different in the sense that in er london the UNK of erm er mineral water into the target market is very high and therefore it's already an accepted practice
whereas in yorkshire the UNK and usage is very low perhaps the lowest in the country erm where there is still very much a heritage of well what's wrong with what's in UNK tap lad
erm and so the approach has to be quite different
and scotland where there is a very strong national heritage and how are you going to push yorkshire water into an area where there is a high heritage of water
can you do that with one advertising campaign or do you plan
well initially we we're going to we're going to go nationally but very quickly we're gonna see where erm our strengths and weaknesses are erm and we know already where the erm the large market is and once we've had a couple of t v spots to make it known nationally erm in the end of course we're gonna have to erm probably concentrate on those areas which erm er UNK give us the best return
not only which er erm one of the big strategies of ours is using er and we think we can get into a considerable number of homes with leaflet drops etcetera erm er by using that er arrow
okay
well one of our key er marketing er tools is the markets we're actually aiming for and i er agree with you we are going to UNK and it is an on ongoing campaign but er our s the er UNK based on the UNK group er of the population and the differential er of UNK is going to be fairly minimal because those will be very similar people throughout the entire country
erm so i take i understand your point we are aware of it and we think our campaign will take er those factors into account
and diversification will er occur somewhere
okay
i think we all talked about flexibility and you know that's what it's all about really
what consumer research have you done to er enable you to charge a premium price for your water
is it of a higher quality and accepted by consumers
well the er water quality is e UNK high and
technically you said that already but what about er sort of consumer appreciation
well the er consumer appreciation outlined er again that's divided into two areas and it's based on the UNK groups and the purchasing patterns of the members of the public
right
and er there are two distinct markets
one for bottled water and er the large
no i'm not i'm not interested in the UNK groups what i'm saying is what research have you done to confirm that the
well we have done research
actual taste of the water is right for your target market
well we have done research by UNK tests inside
right
er supermarkets etcetera er from time to time
erm and those people who have been asked the specific question would you pay a premium price for this water as against that which you're drinking said yes
fine thank you
and the last question i want to raise with you is that erm how do you feel about your initial problem on pricing
you're talking about er three thirty UNK going out at a premium price erm your one litre at an economy price and your two litre back at a premium price
do you think that variation in pricing strategy will be er contrary to what you're trying to do in terms of your image projection for the brand
it could be
it could be
right how do you er plan to address that issue
in effect although the water is the same product it's there is a slight difference in the marketing of each one of them
right
the small bottle once again is the UNK of the bottle and we've found that to be very attractive and people are were very willing to pay a premium price for something like that cos as thomas said people are buying those bottles to keep them erm initially
so we feel that we can actually get away with a premium price on that
the biggest market is the one litre size
that's a vast erm that takes up a vast erm proportion of the market
it's also the highest proportion of our UNK erm production for these reasons and of course it has the greatest return pocket in that
so we really need to keep that into a price competitive with other erm er competitors
erm the two litre size is we i the vast majority of the market there is going to be on the doorstep and we feel that we could get away with a premium price because of that
but i understand your concerns that it may affect the erm
chairman and chairman
colleagues
that's original at any rate
erm there are several strains in current use produced by different manufacturers of b c g used for the treatment of erm UNK by which i mean t a p t a p t one and in UNK disease in the bladder
little is known of the relative UNK and UNK of different strains
therefore in ninety eighty eight the m r c UNK bladder cancer sub group of the UNK cancer working party set up a study to compare what at that time were the UNK strains in use in this country
er they were the evans strain previously UNK and the UNK strain made in paris
and the study was not er designed to include er in UNK disease so we're dealing entirely with p t a and p t one UNK tumours
there were three objectives in this study first of all to measure the response of a marker tumour to the two strains of b c g
secondly to measure the incidence of UNK disease erm while patients were under maintenance therapy with b g c over a two year period
we decided at that time to follow UNK erm UNK which er had the lowest recurrence rate then reported
and thirdly to compare adverse events erm er noted with the two strains of b g c
this paper refers to the objectives one and three and the incidence of UNK disease will be the subject of a later report
all the patients who were entered into this study were patients with multiple p t a p t one erm n x m UNK tumours then i must stress that they were problem patients
these were patients who either had previously or were being considered for erm UNK or even for UNK they were not the patients who may have had one or two UNK noted at check cystoscopy
there were the usual exclusion criteria for any erm trial of UNK disease
before entry into the study each patient had a cystoscopy and at that time the number and position of tumours within the bladder were noted the largest tumour was measured in two UNK and was UNK into muscle one tumour was selected as a reference tumour and left in UNK and all the rest of the tumours were UNK
the patient was then UNK to receive either a course of evans or UNK b g c
the dose was selected to be comparable er each strain was comparable to the other in terms of dose b g c was UNK for one hour and then the patient er UNK er weekly UNK for six weeks
three months after entry into the study another cystoscopy was performed again the number of tumours was counted and all tumours were UNK if tumours indeed were seen
if the erm marker tumour was present it was measured in two UNK and was UNK
if the marker tumour was not seen then the site of the marker tumour was UNK
all UNK material both from the first cystoscopy and the second cystoscopy was sent both to the local UNK and then representative sections sent to the reference UNK
both groups of patients those receiving UNK and receiving the er erm evans b g c were comparable in terms of sex and age the category and the grade of the tumour the number of tumours the size of the largest tumour the UNK of disease and the size of the marker tumour left in the bladder
i will not bore you with going through a lot of slides showing those UNK but in a short paper erm you must take my word for it that the two groups were comparable
ninety nine patients were entered into this study two were UNK one because of previous UNK and one because no marker tumour was left in the bladder
that left fifty one to receive evans b g c and forty six UNK
three patients all who happened to be in the UNK group were subsequently UNK
one was lost to follow up before the three month cystoscopy one died of UNK failure before their three month cystoscopy and one important patient developed UNK obstruction and UNK a UNK two months after entry into the study
the UNK of the removed bladder showed widespread UNK bladder tumour not only across the base of the bladder UNK both UNK but also at other sites in the bladder as well
i put it to you that it is unlikely that such widespread UNK tumour arose from one small marker UNK and the surgeon concerned that this was a UNK error initially
now what were the results at the three month cystoscopy
this slide shows erm the findings
they you can see that the patients can be considered in four groups those in the top line which in which the marker tumour was absent and no other tumours were seen in the bladder
the next line the marker tumour was absent but other tumours were seen in the bladder
there were no examples in line three of patients in which the marker tumour was still present but no other tumours were seen
but there were a substantial number of patients in which the marker tumour was present and other tumours were also present
those results would suggest that the other tumours were in fact new tumours rather than persistent tumours which had been missed at the first cystoscopy
although it er the numbers are small it appears from that as if the response of the marker tumour to UNK b g c might be better than to evans but i can assure that there is no statistical difference in those values
admittedly if we had entered five times as many patients there might have been a significant difference but it might have gone either way and we have not been able to show any improvement in response erm to either the UNK relative to the evans or vice versa
now what of the adverse events
adverse events were noted a at each installation of b g c and at the time of the first cystoscopy and were scored for UNK and the highest score was then re recorded and appears on this erm UNK which relates to frequency as a UNK
each of the next few slides has the same format
you will see that there is a very similar distribution of the UNK of symptoms of the UNK of frequency in the two groups and that is the case for all the symptoms which were recorded
for UNK for UNK slightly more possibly in the i in the UNK group but nothing that reaches statistical significance
fever and UNK joint pains and UNK
at the three month cystoscopy in addition to erm recording the actual tumours in the bladder the UNK response was also recorded and UNK a score
er o er UNK a description of mild moderate or severe and the degree of UNK response was virtually identical in the two groups
in the slide in which i showed the overall results it appears that about half the patients the erm marker tumour had been UNK and in quite a lot of patients there were tumours present
and i must stress that these were all problem patients and if tumours were present they were recorded as so on that previous slide but they were often present in greatly reduced numbers
this shows that in well over eighty percent there were fewer tumours at the three month cystoscopy than there were before the b g c was UNK
so the conclusions from this m r c study are as follows
first of all that the marker tumour is UNK by a six week course of b g c in just over fifty percent of patients and that the number of tumours is reduced in at least eight five percent
that in this relatively small study there was no significant difference in the UNK or the UNK of those two strains of b g c
and thirdly that it erm demonstrates the UNK of the marker tumour principle in testing the UNK of agents used in p t a p t one disease
thank you
thank you
and the UNK now open to discussion
would you like to come to microphone one please
er if you do go to UNK three which is the one at the back it's rather difficult to see you with the UNK in my face
if you could wave the programme we're more likely to see you
microphone one first
er from UNK
so we can read that and just put the UNK on the table
right
if you'd like to tell me how many how many sixths you think there would be in a whole one
erm
how many fourths would there be in a whole one
erm
how many how many halves
halves erm two
right two so is you shared it out between two people you get a half one UNK one over two
if you shared it out between three people how many so they all got the same how many would they get
can you show me how much they'd get
yes
if you shared it out between three
mm
should i put it together first and then
that's it
three
so which piece if there were just three of us you and me and the dog
sharing out a pizza how big a piece would we get
a third
a third
so share it out between three you get a third
if you share it out between four people how much would we get each
a quarter
good a quarter
share it out between six people
a sixth
a sixth good
share it out between ten people
a twelfth
how about
mm
ah okay share it out between twelve people
a twelfth
have a guess share it out between ten people
a tenth
that's it
share it out between twenty people
a twentieth
good er share it out between five hundred people
or between a hundred people
a hundredth
a hundredth
share it out between a thousand people
a UNK
that's it
so you've got it haven't you know that's all it means
all a third means is that's what you get if you share one between three so they all get the same
er what does a sixth mean
that there are six people there are six of us could have a maybe
between six people and they're gonna get the same that's all a sixth means
and which one of those is a sixth
that's it okay
what does a twelfth mean
erm that if there was twelve people they'd all get the same piece each
that's it that's all there is to fractions
and which one's a twelfth
that one
well i think you're doing very well on the fractions
okay we'll leave that for a minute and we'll have a look so you can forget all about it right then i'll ask you later when you've forgotten okay
let's have a look at erm what you did with the numbers then
i've done i've done the ten one
okay
erm now do you know any of these
you know five add five don't you
yeah
erm i'll turn that over erm right and i'll say a number and you tell me what number you'd have to add to it to make it up to ten
erm seven
erm four
oh seven and two seven and three
seven add three good
erm nine add
oh nine erm one
good
one add
nothing
one add what would
oh zero
one add what would make ten
oh one add nine
that's it one add nine
we'd write a one and a zero
yes
but we'd have to add another if we only had one penny we'd have to add another nine to get ten p
you're doing well on these
eight add
eight add two
good erm let's think of a hard one six add
six add four
good
four add
four add eight
six add four
six add four makes ten
so four add six
good
four add six makes ten
erm you did eight didn't you what was that
eight add
eight add three er eight add two
good eight add two
so two add what would make ten
two add eight
good
so have a look at the ones you've done here right
five add five
five
nine add one
let's see you know five add five don't you
yeah
nine add one you know that one that's not hard
so if someone says one add
nine
you could work that one out
so you only have to learn half of these you don't have to learn all of them cos you can always switch it round
if you just what you were doing what you worked out isn't it
so eight add two eight nine ten
it's just eight add two
so what would two add eight
two add eight
what would that come to
ten
yeah
erm seven eight nine ten
nine ten
three
do you think i'll tell you not to count on your fingers
well it's better if you can do it in your head it means okay you're a bit UNK cos you can do it in your head
but if you can't do it in your head what you going to do
you've got to use your fingers haven't you or get some pennies out and count them
or write it down and put little dots and count up the dots or something it's a erm a lot of the who tells you not to count on your fingers
me headmaster or sometimes me teacher
mm sometimes the teacher but more the headmaster
yeah
mm
don't like getting into disputes into arguments with schools but in our lessons i don't mind if you count on your fingers
after a while you get when you first start the first time you ever ride a two UNK and you have someone holding it or you have some UNK on till you know what you're doing
and then when you're okay when you've been riding round a bit you take them off
and you're ooh UNK you say to the other kids ooh you don't need UNK
but when you first started when you're not quite sure what's happening you can't be expected to be perfect the first time you have a go at something can you
so use your fingers write down bits and more and more you'll be able to start doing it in your head then
erm i reckon you could probably so if you keep practising these
you can practise them on our fingers
so if i say seven add you could go eight nine ten three
three
yeah and after a while you won't need to do that
you'll know them then and you won't need to use your fingers but while you're learning i don't see why you know why you can't use them do you
and if they say you can't at school well alright close you eyes and count pretend there are some fingers there like that
that's good
that's very good numbers that add up to twelve okay
erm that's really good again you'd only have to learn up to six add six wouldn't you
yeah
cos five add seven add five would come to twelve
now
twenty four
add up to twenty four okay and right okay
and there's thirty six there
so you had a lot of practice adding there
now what i want you to do i want to just have a look at it now and i want you to play with it over the holiday on your own
have you got you your pennies
yeah i'll go and get them
okay let's have a look at those
okay so
right cor
gracious they're a weight aren't they
they really are a weight
okay you've got a fortune in here
what have we got can you sort out ooh just the pennies
yeah
okay how many have we got there roughly
erm two three four five six seven six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
okay stop at twelve for a minute
and keep those that's it keep those pennies separate
now let's put some of these back
seven eight nine ten
just sort out another set of twelve
eleven
okay
stand these up
another set of you just sort out another set of twelve pennies then we'll
twelve
okay
yeah
twelve six seven eight nine ten eleven
okay that's lovely
six seven eight nine ten eleven
so how many have you got altogether
could you do it without counting them
you've got two sets of twelve
how much would that come to
two times twelve
could you do it by adding up on paper
erm
it was twelve add twelve wasn't it
oh yeah
two ti two times twelve is that the same as two add twelve
yeah
yeah
two sets of twelve so we could say two times it or we could add twelve to twelve
which would be easier do you think
erm me UNK be much quicker
if you knew your twelve times or your two times up to twelve that would be quicker but if you don't
i've done the answer
oh brilliant now how did you do it
mm used me two times table
you used your two times table good
so you had you had twelve pennies in one pile and twelve in another and you're doing twelve add twelve now you could have done counted the whole lot couldn't you
one two three four
that's take ages
or you could take a bit of a short cut say well we've already got twelve there thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen and so on
but that's a quicker way
that's really all we're doing we're just sort of counting how many would we have if we have twelve add twelve
now if i'd said how about if you had erm sixty add sixty do you think you could do that
sixty er
have a have a go at that it's sixty add sixty
now is it easier if you write you them one under the other do you think
yeah
yeah most people find it a lot easier if you write them one underneath the other one
right good yeah that's correct
a hundred and twenty
now that's much easier to do it on paper than if i say well the only way to find is let's get sixty pennies out you count sixty i'll count another sixty then we'll see how many we've got
so it's just a quick way of doing counting really
a quick way of doing adding
when we do adding up if we add two numbers together we'll always get another number
yeah
you've been doing quite a bit with things that add up to ten haven't you and you've been doing things like seven add three comes to ten and three add seven can you read my figures
yeah
three add seven makes ten
it always gives you another number another counting number that you could use for counting your pennies
now these counting numbers they're okay aren't they you know where you are with those no problem
so adding is okay when we add that's no problem
now what about when we take away
it goes a bit weird so we'll leave that for a while let's have a look at erm what happens when we're doing times
what happens when we're doing times now you did two sets of twelve didn't you
yeah
and you did that with your two times table so because times means the same as sets of or lots of
it doesn't make any difference whether you say two times twelve
two lots of twelve two sets of twelve two piles of twelve does it it's all the same
so times multiplication is the fancy word for it but times is good enough
that'll always give you another counting number wouldn't it because it's the same as adding really
say there we are you can add twelve add twelve or you can do two times
twelve
two times twelve
okay sixty add sixty or you could do
sixty you could do six times six two sixes
you could do two times sixty
that's it two times sixty
if you had erm eight add eight add eight add eight
eight
how can you do it
erm
using your tables
three times eight
three times eight or eight times three doesn't matter which way you do it it'd come to the same thing
three times UNK better that's the right way to do it
so really when you're doing times when you're doing your tables you're just doing adding aren't you
adding lots of different l lots of things that are the same
so times is okay
three times four or four times three they just give us counting numbers again
nice numbers that are easy to work with we can count out the pennies count on our fingers let you
okay you can sort those out but when we get to take UNK it goes a little bit odd doesn't it
so let's see you've got just check and see if you've got ten in that pile
yeah
okay so if i do ten take away seven what do you think that will come to
ten take away seven is three
good now how did you get it
erm
how did you work it out
cos you did that in your head you didn't use your fingers or anything how did you do it
er i u used like i did with the adds and
alright
and then and then i s and then in me head i did erm seven take away ten and then i worked it out and it turned out to be three
i had i had eight nine ten left in me head to make three
mm good so if you know what adds up to make ten
ten
if you know seven add three make ten then you can work it out just in your head
ten take away seven makes three
okay so we can do things like that and we get counting numbers and we're quite happy with those
so it works sometimes take away but sometimes you get things like ooh let's see er i'm making a mess of this you can write it out nicely
seven
take away
take away ten
ten
so i'll say there we are you've got seven pennies there now take ten away
you can't
you can't you can't and that's what people thought for thousands of years lots of years
they thought you can't do it
but we have these have you come across negative numbers
directed numbers
on the number line
erm yeah
yeah what did you think of them
a bit confusing
they can be very confusing if you don't know what it's about
let's say i owed you erm ten p
and i said oh well there we are take it if i gave you a pound
yeah
and said take that ten p out of that how much change would you give me
erm ten pence out of a pound ninety pence
good you're very quick on money
now if i said you know that ten p i owe you well there you are take it out of that seven pence
and keep the change
how much more would you want
erm three pence
three pence
so we call it minus three
we call it minus three i still owe you
three pence
still owe you three
okay if you try to take you've still got three to come
mm
that means
erm we'll look at that then we'll look at the UNK we'll have a look at the number line and we'll look at temperatures
have you done do you remember looking at those
do you ever watch the weather forecast and it says especially last or a few months ago say it'll be minus three tonight
er no
no well it's nought zero that's the temperature where water UNK
and if it's about four it's up here the normal four
so it'd go went down one it'd go to three went down again it'd go to two
went down another one what would it go to
one
and then if it went down another one
zero
and if it goes down another one
erm
it's gone below zero
you just say it's gone to minus one
minus one
and then if it went down another one
minus two
and another one
minus three
aha you've got it
okay that's all that's all these minus numbers are about
negative numbers directed numbers all sorts of funny names for them and people get very confused about them but we'll sort those out we'll have a look at the number line which is a good way of doing it
so take UNK sometimes they work and sometimes they give you a nice counting number and sometimes they give you this thing
ooh what's this
really it means we can't do it so we'll we make it up we've made up these funny numbers so that it'll always work
cos we don't we don't like to say in maths we don't like to say we can't do it
and the same happens with sharing sometimes doesn't it erm how many have you got there let's see
seven
right there's twelve i'd like you to share that out between three people please
three people
twelve shared out between
three people
okay we'll leave these out like that so we can see how many we're getting
that's it that's very good okay
and how many would they get each
four pence each
they'd get four each
twelve anything it could be twelve
mm
twelve cups of tea
right twelve shared out between they'll get four each
now how about this one then
okay there's three let's pretend they're pizzas say three pizzas share that out between twelve people
er twelve people
mm
most people say you can't do it you can't do that can you go on
hey with twelve people and only three pi
you'd have to cut it into twelfths
yes go on
you cut it into twelfths and then you erm
good so if we cut the first into twelfth what how many pieces would they get out of that's be twelve pieces altogether okay
and they'd get one of those each wouldn't they
yeah
and then what would we do with so that's the first pizza that's dealt with and they got a piece like that out of the first one
what would they do out of the second pizza
erm
what would we do with that
cut it into another twelve
cut it into twelfths again
give them another piece
there they are with another twelfth for you
another twelfth
and the same for the last one brilliant
so they'd finish up with three pieces like that
three twelfths and we know what three twelfths looks like
three UNK be one two three
two three
would be
er a fourth
a fourth a quarter
so they're going to finish u they should finish up with a quarter so again this sharing sometimes it works okay and we just get a normal counting number
say well that's okay
and sometimes we go ooh no we've got fractions
that doesn't matter
that's interesting isn't it
twelve shared out between three you get four
three shared out between twelve you get a fourth
three between twelve you get a quarter
or a quarter as you say
how about this one how about twelve shared out between four how many would they get each
twelve shared out er
try those share those twelve out between four people
mm one two three you get three pence each
you get three pence each
cos when we shared it out between three it was like if you just stand up and have a look along there
okay
mm
there you are well you stand there that's a person standing there
yeah
and the dog can stand there and then that's there's the three people and they get four each
but if you look at it from this way four people standing there they'll get three each
so twelve shared out between four they get three
three
right how about four shared out between twelve people
how would you do that
four shared out between
what will that come to
that's not going to be as easy as the last one
how would you do it then
er use them as pizzas maybe
yeah brilliant and what would you do with the first one
erm cut it into twelve
cut it into twelve so they get one twelfth from the first one
carry on you tell me what
another twelve another twelve from the
yeah
second one
and another twelfth for the third one and another twelfth from the fourth
so how many twelfths would they get altogether
erm four erm
four they'd get four twelfths
well that was three wasn't it
yeah
and another one that's four and that would make how many how many twelfths in that
erm three
one two three
two three four
four
four
four twelfths
so four well that's interesting isn't it
look four shared out between twelve
between twelve
you get four twelfths
four twelfths
that's just another way of writing it
that's just the same thing it's not really answer you just say four shared out between twelve
and the same here three shared out between twelve it came to three over twelve didn't it
yeah
and that was the way you did it first
your idea cut it into twelfths
brilliant and that came to the same as one quarter
and four twelfths came to the same as
one third
one third
so twelve shared out between three no problem there we get four
three shared out between UNK it comes to
between twelve comes to a quarter
one fourth a quarter
that was four that's one fourth
mm
four shared out between twelve
between twelve
sorry twelve shared between four
between four is three
but
twelve divided by
four
four divided by twelve
that's it four shared out between twelve people
twelve comes to one third
one over three
that was four and that's one over four
this was three and that's one over three
mm
how about this one
what would six shared out between two people give you
shared out erm
how many twos make six
mm
two UNK would make six
three
two threes are six so what we'll do is we'll say let's say how would you make six
you'd make it with two lots of three
three
like that two lots of three
so six shared out between two we've shared it between two people they'd get three each
so the UNK a bit like doing the times only the other way round isn't it like doing it backwards
that's the answer now what was the question
yeah so sh six shared out between two is
three
three
have a guess at two shared out between six
just have a guess at it
two shared out
from what was happening here
we did twelve shared out between four was three
four shared out between twelve was one over three
have a guess
two
er two shared out between six people
here we are there's your two pi two pizzas now share that out between the six of us
cut it into twelfths
yeah we could use twelfths we could use we definitely use no that'd be good
right that'll work very well
erm let's say you and erm and who's the other girl
natalie and
and
UNK
and natalie
and joanne
joanne okay well let's say you and joanne and UNK
you could share that one
and i'll share the other pizza with your mum and is that your auntie so
yeah
with your mum and your auntie
okay so how many will you get when you share that with UNK and natalie and you
mm
how many people are there
three
three
yeah
so you're gonna get one shared out between three which is
three is
you just you just write it like that one over three
a third a third
so it comes to a third
let's see if we can do it a different way
now you suggested you had a very good idea you said we could cut it up into twelfths
okay cut the first one up into twelve twelfths
okay now there are six of us how many twelfths will we get there are twelve of them
twelve twelfths out of that out of that first pizza
mm
we didn't really need to cut it up into so many small pieces i would work but we'd get two of these each cos we've got twelve little pieces now and there are only six of us to share it out so we'd say oh well have er we'll have two pieces each two twelfths
that'd be er a sixth
good
that'd be a sixth
okay so we could do that in the first place we could say one pizza there well we've got two pizzas but we'll let's just concentrate on one share it between six people
we'll we get sixths
we'll all get one sixth that's dealt with one pizza what about the next pizza
erm cut it up again
exactly same with that cut it into sixths
so we get another sixth
so how many sixths would we have altogether
erm
as there are two pizzas
two
two sixths oh well there's one sixth for you let's find the other one
that's how much that would be your share if we shared six pizzas between two of us and it's going to be the same as i said when i said well you share with your mum and natalie
because two sixths is the same as
erm fo a quarter third
a third
that one's the quarter it's the one with the corner on
okay it's a half of a half
it takes two of those to make a half
and there's the third same as two sixths
so it doesn't matter whether we look at it as whether you'd get a third or whether you say you'd get two sixths well it doesn't matter cos it's the same size it's just it's cut into two pieces or the way you wanted to do it which was a good way with the first pizza
cut it into twelfths
into twelfths
and how many would you get you'd get two twelfths
two twelfths
right you'd get two twelfths out of the second pizza as well there's another two twelfths so you'd have four twelfths all together
so it doesn't matter which way you do it whether you get four twelfths two sixths or one third they're all the same they all comes to the same thing
so four twelfths two sixths one s one third
if you share two between three of you which is what we've just done right
yeah
let's just write down here i think what we've got hey
what did we do
we shared out share out two between six
two shared out between six is so that's one of the answers that we got
two sixths
you did it by twelfths and we got four twelfths and the other answer we got was one third
so if we sort of put in here one third what does it mean
well it means just one shared out between three of you doesn't it
what does four twelfths mean
means shared out between four of us
the people always go under the table okay
shared it between twelve of us
that's right and how many did we share out
it goes on top of the table
a quarter four
four when they're on top of the table it's just a number four okay
so that was four shared out between
twelve
twelve of us
so it doesn't these are all the same all comes to the same amount doesn't it
you get the same piece of pizza whether it's two shared out between six four shared out between twelve or one shared out between three or twenty four shared out between a lot of people
we could maybe work it out
so we've had a look at some of the numbers now haven't we and some of the things you can do with them
adding up that's no problem you never get any UNK do we all get another we always get sometimes it's hard but we always finish up with another counting number
times sets of and lots of that's the sam it's like counting in threes or counting in let's add another three add another three add another three
okay or add another six
so it's a bit like counting and we keep getting the same counting numbers that we're happy with
take away what happened there
well sometimes it works
when doesn't it work
when do we get these funny numbers
when erm you have a lower number
very good very mathematical
yes yeah when the first number is smaller than the second one
when you try and take away more than you've got
if i say there you are there's two p take five p out of that
can't do that
it's when you tend to say first thing you say is can't do that then you think oh well we get the we have to do it just playing silly game we get these funny numbers
it's just a game so that we can so that they can't say there caught you out
you have to say you can't do that i'll make up a new game to play
so they make up this game with negative numbers but it works very well it's very useful
erm we need things like that for windows and building bridges and things like that
sharing sometimes no problem
when do we get the problems with the sharing when does it go into fractions
erm when you have a lower number
right very good yes
when the number that we're sharing out when that's less than the number of people
and there's another there's a really awkward one
do you want to go for it yes let's try it
a really awkward one you can get in sharing
let's say if we had erm six shared out between four okay
one two three four five
six
six
okay share it out between four mm
how many are we going to get
well let's do it
right give them one each to start with and then you've got two left over
mm put them in your pocket
what are we going to do
it's awkward isn't it
yeah
well let's say there was joanne and natalie sitting there and you and me say
that's one for joanne one for natalie one for kerry now what would you do with the two that you've got left over
er
what could you do
if we were sitting together here and joanne and n natalie were sitting over there and we've got these two pennies
we could maybe if we have joanne UNK natalie me you
mhm
no we've just got the four of us
just got the four of us
erm
how about forgot about one of the pennies for a minute this one if we shared that out between two of us
how if you get one each and then you get a half share in that
mm
so how much would you get out of this bit
what fraction would you get out of this if it was shared between two of us
a twelfth
just between the two of us
erm a sixth
so it's one pizza
your mum brings the pizzas in she brings six pizzas in right great big ones
and she said oh i thought there was supposed to be six of you here today some didn't turn up
okay so we've got six pizzas only four of us
so she goes round right there's a whole for you and one for one for you one for you and she says and you won't want any more will you
and everyone says ooh yes lovely pizza this yes
oh so she's got to share it out UNK
so she could say how could she do it how would you do it
erm
if you were the mum and you brought these pizzas in and there was four people sitting there when you've got six pizzas and they all want the same size
now we've done one each and we've got two now to share out between
erm
these four people
cut it into
cut it into what size pieces would we cut it into
a twelfth
yeah we could cut it into twelfths but there are only two people so they're gonna finish up with lots of little bits aren't they if we cut it
yeah
into twelfths
what do you
could cut it into er
what could we cut it into
oh half
right good so we could just cut it into a half
we could say well there's our it's a half for you and a half for you and we cut the other one and they get a half each
if we if they weren't as quick as you are like that working that out what you could try is say well i've given them one each there's the four people one two three four right you've all got a whole one so you can start eating that while i sort out how i'm gonna share this out
now this is the fifth pizza now how am i gonna share it out
oh well there are four of them there so why not give them all and i'll cut this pizza into
erm quarters
into quarters exactly cut it into four
so there they are while you're eating that another quarter each
and what shall we do with the last pizza so that
erm cut it into half again and
cut it into
erm quarters
quarters again yeah and give them another quarter out of this so they get they've got a whole one each and then we've got two left over
now out of that two we'll say well share it out between the four of you take a quarter each
out of this one take a quarter each so how many quarters would they get
erm two quarters
two quarters
there's two pizzas shared out between four so they're going to get
two quarters
i think you're doing very well on this by the we're getting through an awful lot here it's usually even with very much older children they take a lot longer to get this
so sharing out two six shared out between four what you'd normally write if you can't do fractions you'd say once remainder two wouldn't you
mm
you'd say once and two left over
you say well what are we going to do with those two left over
well hide them
but now we want them all shared out so instead of saying one remainder two we writ it like this now
six divided by four is one and two left over we won't get two whole pizzas each we'll get
mm
two quarters two quarters
and what does two quarters come to
a whole
one quarter
a half
is a half okay
which is what you said earlier when you were working them out you said oh so they get one and a half each
one and a half
now those i think and quite a lot of other people do are probably the most awkward ones
they're not hard once you understand what you're doing how you get it because you're sharing out but they're probably the most awkward when you've got mixed whole numbers counting numbers and fractions all in together
erm then they get a bit awkward
so what i'd like you to do when you get some get a cardboard UNK
yeah
okay when you get those cut out you can just play with them just get used to the sizes and the shapes and erm make sure that you ask someone
the erm
right so if someone holds up this piece and you hold up this piece to your mum and you say what sort of fraction is this
she says i don't know
you'll have to wait and ask john when he comes
well let's work it out
how could you work out
erm
now this is this is the answer really what was the question
this is what we finished up with
now what were we doing to finish up with a piece like that
we had a pizza and we were going to share it out between how many people
erm three
three so good you should find that three pieces just like that the same size as that would all just fit together to make a whole
right so that must be
a quarter oh a third
a third
nearly you were going right all the way along there
right so that must be a third okay and someone holds this up and says what's that
a sixth
good
and just check it to make sure
go all the way round and make sure you need six like that
how did we get this piece
what were we doing to get that
erm got the corner
mhm
it's a fourth a quarter
that's it it's a quarter
we were sharing it out between four so we got we always say a quarter i think i think it's a good idea the way the americans say a fourth cos you can it ties it up with the four shared out between four people
and you could do the same for the
a twelfth
take you all day going all round with a twelfth wouldn't it
there's a slightly quicker way
you're happy with the sixth aren't you
there's a sixth
that was shared out between six people
if there were twice as many people
you'd get
just go on
two out of the s
UNK have to get two pieces out of every sixth you'd have to cut that down the middle
so you'd just you'd just put the sixth if you know that there's two twelfth you just like that and then the twelve and then you could count round like that
right you could you can count round any way you like and the quickest way the easiest way that you're sure works that's the best for you
is to work out how many sixths how many twelfths are in sixth
right
and come round
right now i want you to do a bit of adding up okay
erm what would a third add a sixth make
a third add a sixth put three add six down and then maybe
one third just write down one third add one sixth
one third add one sixth
now i'll tell you the tell you the trick of what goes on here
you can't when you've got the numbers just like this it doesn't seem to work out so we've got to go back to find out what it means
erm well you could change them both into
sixths
into sixths very good
how many sixths there
two
and how many here
one
so right so that's brilliant so underneath that third how many sixths is it
two
two
so you could just write two sixths instead of that and it's the same
it doesn't matter whether it's one pizza shared out between three of us or as we tried earlier two shared out between six of us
you still finish up with the same amount
one third two sixths four twelfths all the same thing
add one sixth okay
so just copy that one down underneath
er two sixths add one sixth is going to come to how many sixths would you have
three
three sixths okay so
you can just put your add in there as well
that's it
equals three sixths
and three sixths makes
a half
okay
you could put there equals a half
three shared out between six we'd get a half
we could put ourselves in three lots of two and your mum came in with the three pizzas we'd get one between us so we get a half
those two get one between none for people UNK through the door though
okay
i think we're getting very well
what about a very awkward take away then if you're doing so well how about this there we are
a third take away a quarter
quarter
er
let's see what it does come to
what do you think it comes to
erm comes to a twelfth
yep very good it comes to a twelfth
now we've got to make that's what really happens that's real
this is just playing games with the numbers to see if we can get the right answer
so how are we going to get the right answer
well any suggestion if you'd like to write it down one third take away a quarter
mm any ideas
erm see how many quarters we've got there
mm have any quarters i mean you'd get one and a bit
anything else we could try to see what're in a third
how many twelfths
that sounds like a brilliant idea
okay and how many twelfths
er
instead of finding out how many twelfths in a third we could find out how many twelfths in two sixths couldn't we that'd be a bit easier
four
four okay so underneath the one third you can write four twelfths
just pick up my top
okay
right mind you don't stand on it
where's it gone
where's it one
UNK carpets are hard aren't they to find things in
oh well i won't move in case i UNK on
oh you've got it
it was by the door
right and how many twelfths in the quarter
erm one two three
so it's four twelfths
a third and third three twelfths and a fourth
that's it so it's four twelfths take away three twelfths
three twelfths equals
how many twelfths would you have left if you started off with four twelfths then you took away three twelfths
er one
one twelfth left
and that's what we got with this
so that idea of yours change them all into twelfths it's a brilliant one
that's the way we do fractions that's the way you do adding up fractions or taking away fractions you change them to the same
okay
changed if that's one third it's four twelfths one two three four
three four
how about this one
one th you try this one on your own
one third take away one twelfth
one third one third take away
take away one twelfth
one twelfth
er so you take away twelve
well what are you going to do with that one third what are you going to change that into
erm twelfths so that'd be four twelve twelfths
four twelfths good
that's fours twelfths and
hang on hang on you've just written a quarter you said four twelfths
oh
okay four twelfths take away
take away one twelfth
take away one twelfth okay just write that down that you've got to take away the one twelfth
one twelfth erm
one twelfth
right so four twelfths and then you take away one twelfth
there's the four twelfths take away one twelfth
how many twelfths do we have left
we had four took away one twelfth
three
three twelfths left
equals three twelfths
and three twelfths is the same as
a quarter
a quarter
so we can say that many that equals a quarter
right now have you done cancelling fractions
no
no
cancelling fractions is when somebody ha gives you somebody says erm you say how much pizza did you get three twelfths three twelfths make it a bit more simple oh well it's just the same as three twelfths is
same as a quarter
a quarter
okay if they said they got four twelfths
same as a third
same as a third exactly
if they said they got six twelfths
same as a half
very good okay try this one
a hard one nine twelfths
twelfths same as a whole
twelve twelfths would make a whole wouldn't it
now nine twelfths
twelfths
what would six twelfths be
six er erm UNK a half and a sixth
a half a half good and then you'd have but we started off with nine twelfths so we'd have three other twelfths and three twelfths is the same as
a quarter
okay so nine twelfths would be enough to make a half out of the six twelfths
two sixths
make a half we'd make a half out of the six twelfths and then we'd have three left over make a quarter so it'd be a half add a quarter that's what nine twelfths would come to
there's the half it'd be the same as a half add a quarter
what does a half add a quarter come to
erm
well we usually change them into the same thing don't we if we're going to add them
so if we change them all into quarters how many quarters would there be in a half
two
two
two quarters add one quarter how many quarters altogether
so three
three quarters three quarters
okay i think you're doing very well on the fractions actually how do you feel
do you think you know what they're about don't you
yes
you're getting the hang of it
now you need quite a bit of practice
you're understanding them now very well erm if you don't practise them a bit well this is what happens
you next time you come to do it you'll be doing you'll remember nearly as much as we're doing today but perhaps some odd little bits you'll think ooh now how did we do that i can't quite work out
cos we've done a lot haven't we
we've done a lot today
so some odd bits you might think i'm not quite sure how you work that out
not quite sure how you do that
so you might have to try and a try and find out again
play with the fractions
last night mister does those fractions
okay now some people you mention fractions and they scream and run and ah no hate fractions
and it's cos they don't understand them but you're understanding them i think very well now so you're going to like them
you get someone with a sharp knife
yeah
to cut that out
mm
and then you can have your own fractions and you can just play with them and erm i'll give you some sums to do with your own fractions
now we we'll have done some of them there and i don't want you to look there okay i want you to just try it
i've got another book in me in me room
quite a big book that i could use for doing me homework
with fractions okay if you like to get that and i'll right
do you take sugar in our coffee
er no sugar no milk
no sugar no milk
okay just the coffee that's lovely she's just gone to get a book for some homework
she's just UNK up to get a book for some homework
aha right okay that's lovely
now you haven't got any UNK with you have you
no
the work that you're doing at school
no because when you when you are back at school erm
we bought a sheet home fractions on
did you could you could you find it fairly quickly do you think
yeah
okay great
i'll write some of these out for you
er there
aha let's have a look
mhm
right so you don't know you're not too sure about centimetres and millimetres hey
no
we'll look at that some time
do you know how to multiply by ten normally
yeah but i got a bit stuck on that one
mm it's a decimal thirty six point nine
how about this one
fifty nine divided by ten
how many would you have left over
oh lovely thanks very much
okay
erm
how much how much would you have left over here
ten er
are you any good with money
i think you are
sixty pence sixty pence divided by ten how many tens
it's divided by ten
how many ten ps could you get out of sixty pence
six
that was quick it's the same yeah
now if you only had fifty nine pence
fifty nine pence
how many ten ps could you get out of it
er five and then nine
and nine left over
okay so that one's five remainder nine isn't it you can change that one later
okay
what decimal fraction of the circle is UNK
UNK
erm one two three four five six erm four
from six UNK how many what are these pieces
how many pieces to go all the way round
one two three four five six seven
three four five six seven eight nine ten
right so they're tenths
so this was so they had a pizza sort of shared it out between ten people
okay so it's not just six that's UNK it's six tenths six out of ten okay
so that UNK be six over ten
and that's a decimal fraction okay
and we'll have to change that to we'll write it as six over ten then we'll write it as point six
we'll have a look at decimals because you need to need to know what you're doing with decimals but decimals are fractions and until you i mean i think you're very happy with fractions now you're probably ready to go on to decimals
erm we are i think do you
we'll sort them out cos they're just they're easy really
they're erm they're just fractions where the bottom is always tens or hundreds or something like that so they're easier than some of the other fractions
so we'll have a look at those
now which of these fractions three tenths point five a quarter point two
well you can't which is the largest
erm
i think you need to know that nought point five is five tenth five out of ten which is a half
so that's quite a big one so we don't bother about any of these the ones that have got tenths or decimals in we'll have a look at that
the difference between okay
now are you supposed to be doing all of these
no this UNK from ages ago i found it in me desk when i was UNK it and er i asked me teacher if it
mhm
was any good and she went if you want to take it home and
mm okay cos i see i'd like to know whether you're supposed to be doing decimals and things at the moment
it doesn't matter if we do it a little bit before you do it at school because when you do it you'll understand then and you can get a lot from it you can ask
i think we're doing decimals in schools at the moment
you are okay
well we'll have a look at that then
erm now this is this is very tricky these are erm mm aren't they
hey some of these john's got forty pence and paul's got two fifths of it
hey and a cyclists speed she bought a book for one seventy five she gets seven fives
to the rest of the rest of the
how would she do that then
how much would seven five come to
seven five ps
seven five ps
let's have a look at number five if she did something like this how much has she got to start to give
one seventy five
one seventy five
okay
now she's going to give five ps
seven five ps
you've got a lot of really useful money here haven't you so you can you can work these out
two three four five six seven
four five six seven
right seven five ps how much will that come to
erm ten twenty thirty five
thirty five okay
thirty five so we better take thirty five off cos she's already got thirty five hasn't she
mm
and how much would she have left if you took thirty five pence away
away from one pound seventy five
how much would she have
er
you can just do it like a normal take away
it's thirty five
from
take away
forget about the pound thi seventy five take away the thirty five
seventy five take away thirty five
so she'd have one pound forty left so that's in five ps
in five ps thirty five
so you got one forty left how many tens would she need to make one forty
one forty erm
one pound forty
fourteen
good yeah fourteen great
very good okay that's good
so that's how to do that one we could have a look at that
mm a week later than christmas day do you know about angles making right angles
mm
no
you maybe you've done it but have forgotten
that's a right angle when it's like a like the corner of a square
a right angle ninety degrees
and have you done area and UNK
how long is it all the way round something
erm
no possibly not doesn't matter
i'm not too sure
now we'll concentrate on some see with maths you have to do things in certain are we supposed to be doing maths today are we supposed to be doing english
i'm not too sure
well we'll UNK best to concentrate on the just on the fractions
erm
but you said you were gonna bring me some erm these special tables
did i ooh well i haven't i'm sorry to say
erm right er now definitely by the time i see you next time if not before erm i'll get them okay
if i've got to print them off from my computer and the UNK er not exactly in bits but it's just taken apart a bit at the moment so i need to put it back together again and print them off
so i'll do that very soon
now let's sort you out some fractions
so before adding or taking away fractions okay
before adding or taking away we get the number on the bottom to be the same right
and how do we do that
it's easy enough saying it isn't it
okay erm i'm just trying to think what i'm doing later
i'll get those fractions those multiplication tables printed out and get you a copy in the next few days okay
the UNK the same on both fractions
how d how do we make sure that the number on the bottom is the same
erm
how did we do it when we doing some of these back here
for example when we had erm when you were doing these tricky things
like a third take away a quarter how did you do it
three you put the fractions
okay so you change the fractions you change the one third and you change the one quarter into what
twelfths
into twelfths in this case you change them into twelfths to see how many twelfths it would be
and erm with these you changed them both into sixths didn't you could have changed them both into twelfths and it would have work but then we'll get an answer that needs we would have got sixth twelfths well it still comes to a half
but it's just a bit more awkward to work out what six twelfths is maybe
so i'll give you some here to do
some of them will be the same ones that we've already done so don't look at the don't look at these just try them on your own try and remember how you did them
and if you get stuck go back and have a look how you did them here
so i'm going to do erm a half add a third okay and a third add a quarter and a half take away a third okay and i'll give you another one to do how about this one
i'll leave you to sort out you're own way of doing this
two thirds add a quarter
okay
i haven't told you how to d i've told you how to change one third we've looked at that haven't we and we and we've worked out sort of how many twelfths would be in it and things like that
i'll leave you to work out on your own
don't worry if you can't do it if you can't any of these any of these exercises that i give you by the way it's not like homework it's just for you to play with them to get the do them at your own pace
so that you feel happy with it so that you oh yeah now i understand what he's talking about
now i can do it myself
that's the idea cos when it's the exam i can't come in and do it for you or show you how to do it
you'll be doing it on your own so that's what i want you to do to get so you can do it on your own
try those erm and with the with the coins what i'd like you to do now is not find out all the things that add up to twelve
find out what numbers times what other numbers would make twelve
so can you g tell me any numbers that you could any two numbers you could multiply together to make twelve
er erm eleven and one
those are adding
oh
okay good yeah they are that's good that would add together to make twelve but how about some number times another number
one times twelve
good okay so twelve we could have one times twelve right
five times two
well let's see
let's get twelve coins this is the easy way to do it i think
one two three one two three four five six seven eight nine ten how many more do we need
er
i want twelve i've got ten there
how many more do i need
three
another i've got ten
two
eleven
twelve
twelve okay so it needs another two
so there we are we've got one lot of twelve or we might be able to have two lots of what see what you can make with it for two lots
two lots of mm
two lots of five
six
okay so we could make one lot of twelve we could make two lots of six
see if you could make three lots of something
three lots of four
aha
three lot of four
okay and could you make four lots of something
you've already you're doing very good
four lots of three
four lots of three i haven't got time to write that down that was very quick
good four lots of three and could you make five lots of anything
erm
no
no
you could make five lots of two but you'd two left over so it wouldn't go UNK okay
so you can't do five lots okay that was you that was trying five that didn't work so try six what will happen there
er
so you're going you got okay now we've got six lots of
twos
two okay six lots of two
six times two
and then you could have twelve lots of
one
twelve lots of one
right so i think that you've done twelve right just now showed me how to do it
i want you to do the same for twenty four and you won't get it all on one line there'll be a lot of them and then try it for thirty six and when you're really happy with twenty four when you're happy with twelve and you can write all those out quite happily without looking at this try twenty four see if you know see if UNK go UNK go and UNK and everything else
and then try it with thirty six
and then i don't particularly want you to start yet but if you do get time or if you're just interested and you don't want to stop and you want to keep going try it with sixty
sixty pennies put them out
make sure you don't put them straight on the table though
UNK fine cos you can slide them about or a UNK like this
now of what we've been doing today with fractions was there any of it that you're not quite sure of and you think but could you just tell me about that bit again
er
how do you feel about it you feel fairly happy with it
yeah
we've done a lot today you know we've done a lot of things about fractions and a lot of things about adding UNK times sharing quite a lot
so if you don't remember all of it
don't worry and always ask me if there's something that we did last time and i start ta
i start talking about it as though you know
and you're if you think ooh i'm not quite sure what he means by that
always ask me never just let it go and think oh well perhaps i'll understand it later
cos you've probably found that already with maths haven't you that once there's a little bit you don't understand they start putting more and more on that you need to know that little bit for and you don't know it and you're getting more and more lost and then it gets a bit late then
it was only it was only that erm you know erm when you said the sixty pen pence it was the one that was the only one that i seemed to get stuck on
okay well i'm not too bothered about adding those up
adding up to ten fine adding up to twelve that's good that's useful adding up to sixty one don't bother doing that again better concentrating on these
seeing what UNK multiply together to make twenty four thirty six and sixty
okay the don't look at these just try them
yeah
so it's just coming up to five to that's okay
erm now would you like to write something for me
yeah if you can write erm don't think of it as homework you might like to writ it in book or something
when i've when i've gone if you just write about what you think about the lessons
whether it's a good idea me coming here what are the good things what are the bad things
what are the things that you'd like it if it was a bit different you'd like it better if it was a bit more of this and not so much of something else in it okay
mm
erm and i'll have a look at that and see how your how your UNK doing
okay
okay is that alright
oh hi
so and don't forget to put the good things and what are the very good things
the things that could be better and the things you'd like more or less of
i think there could be more of
erm what thin would you like to do more fractions more counting or you think whatever it is that you'd like to do more of or is there anything you think we do too much of and we don't you don't want to do as much
oh dear
those
now what did you think about this lesson was it a bit boring at some time or you think oh or did it go too quickly no
you'd like to spend a bit more time doing things and not do so much in one go
er it went alright really
okay
if you think we're doing too much you can sort of say ooh hang on
because i want to do as much as we can during the holiday so that when you go back you you're up there with the rest of them okay
erm if i try and do too much you might see you might be forgetting as much as you learn mightn't you and that's why it's important for you to do these do these exercises
okay erm if you want to call your mum i'll just
yeah
show her what you're doing there so that
okay
she'll know as well
or you can show her okay
hi
hi i'll just show you what er well UNK show you she knows what er what we're what you're going to do over the next day or so don't you
yeah
we're just playing with twelve pennies and she's making patterns out of them to make multiplication tables
mhm
really
so she's trying to find out well the ones these are all one that kerry suggested
okay you could have one set one set of twelve
okay that's how you could make up twelve coins one set of twelve
and then what's the next thing you tried
you tried putting them in two sets of how many
so she tries that and what does that make
erm two sets of six
okay and then carry on okay so now you've made three sets of
sets of four
three sets of four okay and you can just turn that round and look at it that way now
you've got four sets of three
four sets of
okay and you made six sets of
twelve
six sets of two
right didn't you
erm
so that's it just go along the bottom one two three four five six okay and then you won't move those and what can you do there
that's it six sets of two
and you tried five didn't you
yeah
tried sets of five but it nearly but you two left over so that's no good
mm
it doesn't go exactly into twelve
so five won't go
but we can find all the things that'll go into twelve
well UNK going to do the same thing for twenty four
and then when she's really happy with twelve and with twenty four she's going to try thirty six all the different sets of one times another to make thirty six
mhm
and sixty is a bit much i think but if she you know if you want to go on and you're really happy you can do anything you like with these thirty six and twenty four no problem there then go on and try sixty
you'll need a as i said put er put some paper on the or some newspaper won't scratch it
oh she'll be in the kitchen yeah
okay kitchen UNK ideal for sorting your money out on
so try that and the fractions
be best cut out with a sharp knife that something like a UNK knife
yeah
rather than UNK
but just cut it out and then she'll just use the back and she'll play about with some helping to get some answers to these fractions
mhm
and then just generally play with it say oh i wonder what would happen if you put two thirds together how many twelfths would that be or what about if you had a third and you wanted to take a quarter away if you cut a quarter off it
what would you have left
a twelfth
brilliant yes really good
she's really coming on well
mm
with the fractions
you like them don't you cos you're understanding them now
it's all about understanding if you understand something you can like it
yeah
but if you don't understand it and you're lost you just get to hate it you think oh no i can't stand that
so it's getting but you're coming along very well aren't you
