i didn't bring the erm multiplication table that i promised either so i was late and i didn't bring that
i'll go and stand in the corner i think for being naughty
but erm i'll get that to you in the next couple of days or so
now what did we say about the next lesson
we wanted to g get one or two in during the holiday really i think
mm
what you see the idea is to get kerry getting as much benefit from school as possible so you're not having to pay me
no
to do the lessons that kerry is understanding it so she can
once she's c more or less caught up doesn't have to exactly catch up just have some idea of the basic stuff that they're talking about
yeah
and then you can just when the teacher says that you know what questions to ask at least
if you don't if you're just lost you feel daft don't you
so you don't ask and you get sort of so that you understand less and less and eventually you think oh i don't feel like going to school today it's fractions again
yeah so just to get you so you understand about fractions you know what's going on and you can ask intelligent questions and your UNK think oh she knows what she's talking about
she doesn't know how to do it but she knows what to ask and how to get there
so erm where are we bank holiday monday next week i think you probably got enough to play with tuesday
at the introduction stage
anyway can i welcome you on behalf of the notts county council to the nottinghamshire pre retirement
you'll see my name's on here bernard
and there's always the UNK about these course we're all addressed on christian name terms all speakers prefer it that way and of course we like to address you christian name terms when we know you
and when i saw bob 's name on there i thought well i know one face at least
almost on the point of saying well i there was one friendly face
but that is asking the impression that all the others are UNK which isn't
nevertheless it was nice to know that there's someone
er right so as i say it's a UNK approach and on christian name terms and with that in mind would you UNK one of these and just stick your name on so that at least if you don't know then at some stage during the course you stand a good chance of getting to know each other because again the essence of this course is UNK and talking
as you know as teachers this is the way that information
right i shan't er be able to remember all your names but er nevertheless if you know each other then er you may have wondered what the nottinghamshire pre retirement council is well we are a charity
started off giving er sort of talks at er no charge at all to who couldn't afford it and have now expanded into giving talks on a commercial basis to various companies
er usually spend a lot a lot of time in the north of the county talking to power stations and people like that industrial rather than commercial or educational but er there we are
er we're financed by grants from various authorities and by payments of course from the bodies who ask us to put on these talks
and er over the years we've built up a reputation i know is a genuine one say that because i know that you're going to appreciate this course and i use the term very particularly you will enjoy it
again one of the essential elements picking up information is that if you enjoy you will then learn more
i find it so
right some of our speakers are UNK i i've been retired quite a number of years as you'll have noticed i give the talk on income tax and i'm a retired tax inspector
and so we bring er a special sort of er expertise i suppose to the talks but also the experience of retirement which we think is really good by someone who has already retired enjoying retirement to be able come to talk to people
we often meet people who are in their forties and fifties on er early retirement and little bit difficult to get over the message they don't they don't see it as retirement and yet surprisingly very few of the people who got redundancy at forty and forty five and fifty seem to be bothered about taking up other work at all that
obviously you'll say the size of their pensions and lump sums
that doesn't seem to be so at some stages it is a little difficult getting it over as a as a retired person talking to someone who is facing redundancy about retirement
particularly when some of our speakers talk about er getting the state retirement pension at sixty five talking to i'm only forty five
so there is this mixture of er of the older element and the younger element which we've got to sort of marry during this course
so if you feel at some stage that er this isn't for me then one of the things that we regularly hear is i wish i'd done this course ten years ago
so in see things that you can do in future let me know
particularly with the with the finance er s speaker
right where are we up to
but all our speakers are chosen by the pre retirement council and by your employers by the way who over a period of time have selected the oh well we don't want him again or that firm again
so they've all we've all been UNK over a number of years
so we've all speakers chosen for their integrity and confidence
the aim of the course is to provide advice and information but as i said at the beginning to get you talking about it
because only then can you learn things
i often say UNK that you make a comment to somebody and you find you're talking to the world export on expert on whatever it is
it is surprising how often your questions are answered by a casual comment from somebody
you've been bothered by something for ages and just happen to mention it somebody as you're walking by oh yes
and this i find is one of the helpful things and when you get together not during the actual talking the actual session but er
i mentioned the age related thing about the difficulty of talking about
excuse me could you speak up just a little bit
yes er
thank you
any problems like that don't hesitate just join in and jumping ahead on the question of questions all our speakers like you to ask them as they occur to you
so don't feel that you should wait until the end although we do leave a little bit at the end just for questions and you may have noticed that there's either a tea break or a meal break after each talk
which if you've got anything personal particularly on income tax for example the you UNK the speaker during the tea or coffee break
and they don't mind at all
so don't hesitate
right one of the things that er we try to pass on is that you'll pick up a lot of information which may not be relevant to you but may be relevant to members of your family or friends
but pass it on
now i mentioned some of the things on income tax where i know it doesn't er apply to the people in the group but may well do to relatives of them
but don't hesitate tell people about it
pass on your information
well the as you'll have noticed the course is designed around a series of talks but they are by no means lectures
there is very much a joining in element participation is welcome by all the speakers
feel free to question intelligent participation that er brings out as you well know the best in all
and we try to show that retirement can be a UNK and fulfilling i find it so anyway so i can sell things in that er sense having an experience rather a young person talking to older people how er fulfilling it UNK is in retirement
well i know it is and er i hope it comes over in a genuine way
but er in effect we're trying to show you how fulfilling and UNK er you can make retirement
UNK in a financial sense i think you'll find once you've heard
some of the subjects are a bit heavier than others
this is the fault of er behind the fact er we have to ask speakers when they can come to give their talk
and they have to fit it into their diary
sometimes we get a particularly heavy day though er i apologize for that in advance but er don't lose your concentration you'll certainly miss something
we've got a folder for each of you
please help yourself it contains quite a lot of er information leaflets and whatnot
and some of our speakers will bring their own leaflets er make UNK by all means but you may find that er you'll get er good handouts from some of the speakers not every not all of them
i don't know whether the er our er legal speaker will bring any er information but er this is the sort of thing that some of the er solicitors bring UNK pre retirement course legal aspects of retirement and if er if we you don't get a handout like this from er mister i've not met mister before
this is available if anyone wants to look at it during the course
i'll keep it out of his way whilst he's talking or he'll think hello there's a competitor in the wings
i think you've got a green folder with a questionnaire in it haven't you
if you'll complete that during the course towards the ends of the course when you've
ah well i've got a little note that questionnaires should be in green folder
well i've got a supply of questionnaires so er i'm sorry if you so i'll come in
this is the pre retirement course
pre retirement yes
thank you
yes
hello are you the gentleman with car trouble
i am thank you
no longer i hope
anyway welcome
i was just saying that during the course of today i hope you'll complete a questionnaire
feel free to be er UNK or critical as you wish
bear in mind of course that er most of speakers are volunteers so
you mean you want us to be kind to them
not really i just say that because one er person who completed a questionnaire was quite er was quite nasty in their comments and er it isn't really appropriate when people are volunteers
it's different if you're paid to come here to give a talk and you put up a poor show but if you've volunteered then er i think er you know you really ought to have a different approach to
but criticize by all means
i thought i ought to tell you that
right and also comments and suggestions although we've been in the business for a number of years er comments and suggestions are always er welcomed and considered very carefully
right i've mentioned questions you'll notice that we've got money and retirement mister john from now most of you may have seen the name in various erm very good speaker john you'll a you'll appreciate can't really say enjoy his talk because he really goes on and gives you a lot of information you'll appreciate it rather than enjoy it
but i need to say something about the investment advisors because they're in a slightly different er they come here in a slightly different capacity to other speakers
and the UNK all these UNK speakers will be talking in a very way about finance
they're not giving the talk aimed at telling you how best to invest your money
it's merely the UNK and UNK of investment
how best to but during that talk and this is where we need to concentrate he'll be dropping UNK of information
and why i mention that is that the purpose of these people coming they are commercial they are coming here on a commercial basis
er there won't be any hard sell quite clear about this
you will not know that he is really er here in a commercial way
this is deliberate because he's come here on that basis
he will talk to you generally about investment advice and during the break you'll be able to talk to him you'll be able to ask questions
him out by all means on any investment but this is the difference at the end of his talk he will be hoping that you will complete an application form for them to advise you individually
which will be a form of contract between you and them
you don't have to do
but i would advise you to do so
because at one of our talks er before the financial advisor spoken to a chap that happened to be sitting near him when i moved out of this desk and he got rather a UNK large investment and yet m and he was quite happy with his investment yet much to my UNK he completed this application form for the investment advisor to advise him on his investment
i said i wouldn't have you would have bothered
well he says he'll tell me what he suggests and if it agrees with what i've got i'm a happy man aren't i
if it doesn't i can consider changing
but he said i probably won't taking any notice of it at all
so there are two things er you will john will hope you will a apply to the his firm to advise you individually
you needn't do so you needn't complete it at all there's no hard sell
you can then complete it and then he will make an appointment with you to come to your house and he'll spend quite a lot of time they really do UNK your personal circumstances
any dependants what your investment policies are what your need for money will be over the short term and the long term
because they are required by law to give you the best investment advice and unless they find out your personal details they can't do that
and if they fail to find all your information and recommend something and then you say well er UNK son or parents and i need that money then he's at fault and you can then er take them to court for failing to give you best advice
so they really do go to town in finding out your personal existing investments
and then they will he will send you a written report on how best you should invest your money
lump sums or existing investments
and at that stage you can say no thank you and our advice is take the report and then go to another investment advisor and they will do precisely the same
and you can compare the two and still say no thank you
and at that point it is absolutely free the service is completely hello
come in
retirement course
pre retirement yes
we've been in the building for hours actually
ah
we're talking about the financial speaker and the way they and i i'm afraid i sh we shan't have time to go back and er tell you what i'm saying but er i hope you can pick it up
so you've got the you've got the three things the financial speaker is really coming here in a commercial way but with no hard sell in the hope that you will become er one of their clients for individual investment advice but you needn't do so
if you do and they complete a report and give you their best advice you can still say no thank you i'm going to put it in the building society
if you then say yes i think that's very good i'll do as you say you do not repeat no give them your money or let them handle your money
they will say invest in whatever it is say global investment no it won't be because that's tied to the halifax building society but just say global investments as a name
if they say er we think you should put all your money into global investments then you send your cheque to global investments
you never send your money through any of these investment advisors
if you do go to a second investment advisor and john may well advise to do so
they sometimes do say go somewhere else before you take our advice
erm and they say will you please let me have your cheque for investment
walk out
because you should never deal with these people in a cash basis
it's only an advisory basis
and john will make this crystal clear
so really you're you can't lose they come they give you the best advice they give it in a written form
hello
hello i'm sorry i'm late
that's alright
and then if it's up to you to take it or leave it
and you'll say well there must be a catch in it somewhere they obviously aren't doing it for free
and they're not of course because what happens is if you follow their advice and put ten pounds into global investment for example then global investments will at that stage will pay them
if you don't they won't have any commission at all
so up to that point and if none of you take advantage of their offer then they won't be paid at all
and you might say well i'll not take their advice i'll invest it directly with global and you'll find that cos UNK keep it for themselves
so if you it's a no win situation in that sense
but the point i'm making is that up to the end of giving you advice it is perfectly free there is no charge on you whatsoever
so i hope i've not complicated that i always find it's helpful to say this about this speaker this because no other speaker no speaker is here with a
any questions on the
i certainly advise you to keep asking questions throughout because as i say although they're speaking in a very general way the often slip up and give you a particular that you can take advantage and if you lead them on then the more information is available to you
do are you aware of the difference between erm an advisor who is tied and one who is perfectly free
you do find advisors are tied i mentioned global investments they're tied to the halifax building society
so that if our speaker for example had been john from the halifax building society he would only be talking about global investments
and i've no criticism of global investments they may well be the best for you
but it's such a limited range whereas the and other bodies that come on these courses have got the whole the whole investment field so er you do get the advantages there
and all those er independent advisors are members of UNK i'm sure john will mention it
financial investment managers etcetera
is it also true to say that their guess is often no better than your own
i wouldn't dispute that at all they are really guessing except that er they are more likely to be right
so often in the financial press you see shares
yes
and the various advisors are saying buy
if one of them is saying mm sell that one
you think well
who is right
who is right
i think they're probably making educated UNK aren't they whereas we're making UNK in the dark
UNK anyway is the independent advisor and the other one's are members of UNK
but i'm sure john will go into a lot of detail i only needed to mention
now onto the solicitor one er although he is er he is in the commercial world he's not here under in the same way as john from
and legal speaker tends to talk only about wills making wills
er i don't know how many of you made wills but er draw him out on other things if you've got any problems i mean we had quite an interesting session at one of the power station talks on a er tenant er UNK agreement that a chap had been bothered about for some years
a member of the group had been bothered hadn't been given the right advice for some years
so er it does tend to be as i say solely about wills well draw it out if you've got anything else you may not have
legal er situation at all then you know just ask questions here you get free legal advice which can't be bad
you've got an hour's free legal advice
okay
i think that's all i need say by this time the next our next speaker is usually arriving so to sort of develop and not that there's a real need for it nor am i capable of doing so
but what we do find helpful at this stage is to consider the pluses and UNK getting you to contribute what you think are the pluses and UNK or retirement and then during the conclusion stage we sort of look at these again and wonder whether we've changed our view we hop you will because obviously this is the purpose of the of these talks
so i wonder if er i'll make a note of them i wonder if someone will start me off on a list of what you think are the pluses and UNK of retirement
then as i say we'll discuss it towards the end
if we get the time
anybody like to start what are the UNK of retirement or a minus of retirement as you would see it
be poorer we'll be poorer
poorer
not necessarily so but er generally poorer
i er i nearly fell through the floor a little while ago i was british gas people and one of them living with this lady and i want to give her half of my lump sum how can i do to avoid er to effect her income tax or inheritance tax thinking in terms of the inheritance tax limit of a hundred and fifty thousand i said well would you mind telling me about how much it will be
oh yes he says a hundred and eighty thousand
and that was a half of his lump sum
so it really is astonishing
the way some people are top brass of british gas but er it really is astonishing so when you say that we shall all we shall poorer generally so and yet er
that's very much a by the way just to make you feel a little bit
okay poorer but we hope that er after the er 's talk that er that there's a real hope
anything else
stepping out of the system
yes
which has a sort of i'll compare it them with er some of the things that have been
UNK leading on from that the day by day constant contact with a lot of people
this is one that always comes up lot's of working relations
i just noticed i was reading one of these er incidentally i mentioned about british gas er this is the one that they give all their
you know they do but anyway the point i was making was that they call it distant UNK
yeah right
distant UNK a novel way of putting it but er there we are
that feeling of average
i don't know whether that's supposed to be a plus or a minus
well said that man
okay now anything on the UNK apart from this suggestion that could be both
what about any pluses
i agree with you but erm but it can be UNK can't if you if you're working with people who are a little bit er over the top or UNK people
well one of the obvious pluses is that i'll have a chance to do what i want to do when i want to do it
for the first time five years of ed
yeah true
whether it's a plus or a minus it could be a loss of responsibility
although i enjoy responsibility
yeah
that could be a minus depending
minus
could be a plus but it could be
if you're the person who can ride with responsibility it is a loss
but if you're the one who's struggling
making decisions and that sort of thing miss
you would miss yeah
so one of the one of the suggestions would be then that er you should try to get a similar sort of relationship in retirement
in a voluntary way a voluntary capacity working i mean in this sense in my there is a sense of responsibility and i find that good and challenging which is perhaps one of the reasons why i like doing these courses because you er a certain amount of stress and responsibility is
it's when it goes beyond the point of
but yes i think that would be plus or a minus depending on your on your point of view
right any more
i will yeah
i hadn't but yes thank you
any really positive ones
well we've had one do what i like is
a real positive one
you can do your hobbies better
yeah more time for hobbies
a better quality of hobby
instead of doing loads of things
yeah
better yeah
quality
right
cheaper holidays
totally absolutely completely ready you guilty
and not feel guilty
exactly
not met that before yeah good one
cheaper holidays
yes very good very good yeah
more importantly off season holidays when there are no children around
we've got a got a minute or two some friends of ours were saying the other day they've booked a holiday at er very near the UNK spanish border on the south do you know it
it's rough
now this is what i was saying about UNK sitting next to the world expert in
because these friends
it's the wrong end of the UNK
they booked a six week holiday coming back on the first week on boxing day they've got free car hire for the whole six weeks not the insurance
they're getting transport free from man from home at erm to manchester airport
for four hundred and ninety five pounds and we said straight away well what's the catch
well except if people are interested yes you know like
by the sea packs of UNK dogs drifting up and down
ah
oh
so really they the benefit of this to those of you is that this end of UNK is like that is it
it's the eastern end of UNK like that
that bit
you said
yeah
that's what i'm talking about
it's just where you go up into spain
erm river
and you go from UNK up the river and into spain don't you
know we got lost with the time zone there because UNK is an hour
i mean UNK people lovely food
so we've learnt something already
well i better not tell them because it will completely spoil their holiday but erm it's h it's interesting because we've been mentioning it to other people i'm sure they've never
anyway cheaper holidays yes but er not at
right
er
okay
so we will wait for andrew to come up with his amendments and therefore we may as well go through the rest of the agenda
and slot andrew's in when he comes in
so
please
can we roll that back as well then
cos er
roll what back
ah
got
you don't need to roll it back
saved by the bell
have you got a spare agenda
didn't you get one jim
you'd better get a couple UNK
here you are
i'll get a couple
right
we've done an exercise on s on comparing er bridge and works projects and er a few q s individual projects erm against er a c skills or i r c
mhm
skills cs
erm
thanks
just to sort of flag up jobs which were over a hundred thousand pounds and that had finished or are well on their way this year
erm it's an exercise that you've been asking for
morning
yeah
morning
morning
this isn't what was holding
no
no
no
no
oh
this is s
no
this is the thing ken done for us
right
erm
right
well
would you like to take us through in summary then UNK
what i my remit to ken was to go through with duncan er projects which were over a hundred thousand pounds
er that had gone to the q s for documentation or
mhm
that we'd completed the erm er the site work on
and to extract from the dopacs function codes anything which wasn't within the scale of b
mm
i e er railway liaison er evaluation of multiple options
the sort of things that we cover in the er code of practice for charging to clients which are outside this
so add in the quantity surveying element
and if the job was only at say er tender let stage to only take seventy percent of the fee
mhm
in accordance with the a c e er method
and then to calculate the scale b based on the erm tender total or the actual totals with the class d reinforced concrete or structural UNK element added to it
added on it
yeah
or for the q s jobs just to compare straight i c s scale fee
and then to compare our design fees with the scaled fees
indicate erm tt what the percentage was because we've always been sitting round this table UNK ourselves on the back saying that er
h er how well cost effective
how cost effective we are
now
it's obviously th there are gonna be jobs in here that are UNK up as UNK which aren't or which have got very good reasons for
mhm
er and i'll be the first to recognize that and this was just a sort of the ball park UNK that you were looking for
and it was quite worrying really when you look down here
yeah
just how many of er are in the right hand
are negative
column
how many negative ones there are
bearing in mind that these represent the majority of the large jobs that we've actually had on hand
i've taken out jobs that er like er st UNK roof which is erm a total of a large amount of money for UNK but really it's not a proper job
wi there's no bes jobs in here because erm we
haven't got the mechanism for looking at the bes er scale in the timescale we were looking at
mm
erm
is th no supervision involved
there's no site super there's no resident engineering involved and no
mm
workshop supervisors involved
right
there's no railway liaison there's no prices
mm
they would al they would a
they would always come at ti on a time basis anyhow all those operations
these are
that's correct
yes
we we've UNK
scaled fee scaled
yeah
fee costs against the equivalent cost of our design
that's right
right
accepting your qualifications UNK that erm there may well be good reasons for these there is there is a very strong message there isn't there
i mean i've just worked out there's there are twenty eight jobs there of which er we've only really made a profit on eight
that's on the face
yeah
of it
this is only a sample though isn't it
well
it's it we took about fifty or so jobs that were over a hundred thousand pounds and then we knocked off erm the bes jobs and jobs which were outside party jobs where we hadn't actually done the design work
erm we were just doing watching brief and that sort of thing
er a and basically this is
mm
this is a sort of the sample that we were left with
er i'm not s erm er it doesn't include jobs that we've done the design work on and sent to the areas for building
erm which
even if they're over a hundred thousand
well
w we the mechanism of finding out the jobs
you see i
could i just hold it there
what
there's something
what are we trying to gain from this
we're trying to gain a feel as to whether we are being cost effective
yes
or not in our design
mm
right
and what i don't wanna do is to get involved in looking at all these and saying oh
bloody hell
you know we l lost money on that but an and trying to find excuses for that
the th the UNK is that we've looked at twenty eight jobs and out of those twenty eight jobs if we have been working on scale fees it would appear that we would have lost money on twenty of them
in other
b but
words two thirds of them
yeah
that must give us a message
cou could i ask before we go too deep into the issue that if we are gonna use this er make proper use of it that we have some time to analyze the
to analyze it
figures
oh
yeah
because
i mean i spoke to ken before he started doing this exercise and i'm worried
yeah
that although we've taken supervisors out of it plus supervision
mhm
they won't have taken the r es out
oh
we have taken the r es out
okay
well let us have a look at the figures if we could
be because we can make some sense
agreed
after we've looked at the figures
yes
are these done on final
but at the moment we're UNK in
costs
agreed
stab in the dark at the moment
or estimated costs
these are done on UNK totals or actual costs
ah
i would suspect that yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yes
yeah
in other words what you would have got
no
what
you would have got paid
no
no
lawrence was making the point that if
wh
there's a hundred thousand pounds worth of claims th then there are more fees that we would be entitled to
what
er
should be on final
sorry
th the other thing is
yeah
as well is there's a big debate as to erm whether you do get paid on tender figures or whether you actually get paid on the estimated cost
certainly the way the documents are laid out it's supposed to be estimated cost
yeah
not the actual tender figures
what the
UNK
a c e documents
no way
you get paid on final costs
well
it depends which clause
you look at
no
no doubt about it
well
no
y you're
talking about the way that the department of transport have dealt with
yes
british rail over the last thirty years
mm
well
y need to look
you need to look at the document
department of transport jobs we do
you need to look at the document
the agreements are based on the final cost of the work
ah
the agreement the agreement
now terry's quoting
is the
a c e UNK
terms of engagement
terms of engagement
engagement
now
now
that might be different
which uses estimated cost
right
i think terry's suggestion
erm
is the best one that we now have this data
and rather than
make good use of it
leap in without looking at the detail of it i think now the function heads namely you
yeah
roger terry and david er need to take this away have a look at it and at the next meeting we either then draw some conclusions and again what i'm looking for
recommendations isn't it
are lessons learned
i mean it may be that ken has not drawn these up in the right way
on the other hand it may be that we are not cost effective
and if we're not then so be it
at least we'll be able to address that
er could i just ask the advice of the UNK expertise here
i've only got one item on the list which is the UNK bank slip
yes
cos that
er now the bulk of the cost was in the s survey work
is that normally a legitimate part of
yes
scaled fees
er the actual design work was relatively slight
yes
the survey work would be part of the project
yes
cos
it comes in your first twenty percent but for survey would be UNK into a survey
mm
up to four
so the survey would be UNK as se er twenty percent of the fees
yeah
i it
but that's only for
yeah
i it
that's all you'd get
be very careful that y you don't actually have to use the split that roger's using
no
no
bu but yes
it that wouldn't be outside the scale fee
the survey is part of i if someone commissioned a consulting engineer to do a project then he would be expected to do the survey the scheme design and the detail design and the on site er management type of element for the hundred percent of the scaled fee
okay
it's only if but
but
after you'd done the survey you were asked to multiple options you
mm
would get paid for those multiple options probably on a time basis until
mm
somebody UNK in on one and then you would be back on your scaled fee for the
the only
problem the only problem that actually when you're looking at this is if in fact part of the feasibility involves you doing a survey
mhm
then it wouldn't be involved in the scaled fee
it would be on a time basis
so it depends when it occurs
oh
yeah
mm
yeah
i mean
i think the only one to look at feasibility to start with you can actually get away charging all the survey to the time basis
to the feasibility
to feasibility stage
in which case you c want
and then keep your fingers crossed that you're gonna get the
the next
the development of the
yeah
of the options
so it just depends
do each of you have a copy of this of the a c terms of engagement
it was only me got a proper
right
ca UNK
can you get copies of the a c terms of engagement for each of the function heads and myself
yeah
can i raise a point on this
there's i take it you're in a position to total these up with each other
cos you know to look at the bottom line of total design fees against what they would have been if we'd gone in fixed price
mm
yes
yeah
well
that's if we'd gone in on fixed price on scaled fee
on scaled fees
and of course and we would have been UNK ourselves on the back saying we could go in under
well
under scaled fees with UNK
what i what i what i would say is something i found in bes has happened while i've been here much less now than earlier on is engineers UNK peter to pay paul
mm
and well i know i know on some of my schemes that can have a very dramatic effect
you can in other words you can hide jobs which are badly UNK
we don't want to do that
that i
no
indeed
we've always said that we wouldn't do that
a and certainly the way that we are set up at the moment there is no need for us to do that
no
i that's not what i'm saying trevor
i know i know we shouldn't
right
but what i'm saying is if it happens
well
once it yeah
once it happens we our credibility with our customers goes out the window doesn't it
but if we do that all we do is we UNK ourselves
exactly
because what we what we want to know is those jobs where we have done well because we can learn the UNK lessons from them
those jobs where we've done badly because we can learn why they went badly and make sure that they don't happen again
aye the many of the reasons for these being over are nothing to do with the efficiency of the design office they're due to the efficiency of the s
of the client
or lack of it of our clients with the stop go attitude
it's on
it's off
it's on
it's off
roll it back
roll it forward
rush it
i wasn't looking at the negative
i was looking at er an extremely large positive
yeah
and wondering how we can do a job for two thousand four hundred and fifty when according to the experts in the field it was gonna cost fourteen and a half thousand pounds
which one was that
near the bottom
the one at UNK hill
the UNK
oh
yeah
hill pits
that's the pits we did
yeah
i'm very suspicious of these tender UNK i think these are the original tender figures and not what final costs were
UNK possibly roger that i i'm sure you're UNK i'm sure you're right roger
which
i'm sure you're right but
that will come out in your detailed look at it won't it
but even so we would like to think that erm that we can do the design work surely for the original tender figures er and hope that our erm our drawings and er specifications are such that erm and our site investigations are such that we shouldn't have major claims appearing on our jobs
i know that that's
in an ideal world
very true
anyway i'm delighted to see we've at last got round to this
you might remember i've been pressing for this for about eighteen bloody months
to have a scaled fees figure
roger UNK given it you a lot quicker if you'd given me a list of jobs to work on
yeah
it's
but anyway
well
i wanted to on the report you know so always had it with easy reference but
right
good
okay
mm
excellent
thank you for that trevor
are now going to look at these figures and come back to the next meeting er with some comments with regards to their projects
and trevor will provide us all with copies of the terms of engagement
the a c terms of engagement
good
when can we expect this as a standard feature on the database
we can expect it as a standard feature from the database once we've built the systems that hold the costs for the estimated costs for value of the work
mm
so that we then have got something to compare against something to calculate the fee on
because er in the past people haven't filled in the value of the erm of the work element in the databases
and i don't criticize them for that because the fields that were in the databases in the past didn't d er w were sort of total cost of the
mm
job and y you weren't really knowing whether it included or excluded the a cs anyway and that sort of thing
tried to put them at our at the cost of our of the work for quite a while
yeah
but not any rate m
does it include q s fees
yeah
oh yes
yes
y
absolutely
yes
it in it includes
it ought to
the q s fees
certainly
it shouldn't do really
anyway
why
we can discuss that
mm
well
look
q s fees are part of the seventy percent of the scaled fees
of course they are
mm
they're not extra
they're part of the hundred percent
they're not
of the scaled fees
they are
it depends if you go in house or you go outside
well we always go in house
well
that's our fault
no
ah
dave wouldn't you like to be sat here
no
no
dave knows what i'm talking about
no
i think he's making a valid point
well
only one
going outside
look s seriously the point the point i'm making is that for most jobs of an average sort of size what happens under a c e scale fees as i understand it if i'm wrong i'm i stand corrected
but what in re in practical terms if the consultant can do all the UNK in house with a very limited resource
and sometimes that means sending a drawing out getting a contractor to price for it rather than him doing it er using standard books and goodness knows else like UNK
he'll come up with an estimated erm an estimated price and er and do most of the q s ing in house
but if it's a UNK job and he has to go out to someone like
mm
or somebody else that m money is extra
look
sorry
that's what it says in the document
roger
let's not
we needn't debate it here
you're gonna get copies of terms of
the terms of engagement and i
ah
it's still not clear i mean we're
no
mike and
that's right
terry and i talked round this subject for
some while
for some while
yeah
again
let's focus on
yeah
right
what our objective is
our objective is to see whether we would have made money on those or not
isn't it
yeah
mm
and to establish i mean i think that as a g
ca
group of twenty eight jobs if what we really need to know is overall
mm
because there will be jobs where we lose money
but overall on those twenty eight jobs would we have done well
would we have done badly
or would we have done okay
of course the bigger the job the less excuse
there is for er not doing well
it depends on the circumstances associated with the job
as trevor said in his opening remarks
can
please look at
can i just make these four brief points
one a er scaled fees are based on tender figures but c d g ps relate to actual final costs of project
so that that's roger's erm er roger's point
scaled fees are based on a very rough breakdown of the project into structural design and other works
so
i it th the detail of the class the content might be just a an UNK
er there are many cases where it was difficult to tie up the appointment contract with the physical works contract
some of the major differences could be due to this
and er an in depth study would involve speaking to the relevant project engineers obviously
i agree with that
so i it is just a sore thumb exercise it it's er
yeah
erm
to plug up the
it is
the immediate reaction is one of disappointment but let's get behind the figures first
right
nineteen ninety two ninety two ninety three annual report progress
kim and i
met a chap called darren from and explained our design of this year to put an annual report together which would be based on er a folder which UNK could take individual a four
er sheets
erm so that we could actually produce about two hundred annual reports if we wanted but we
mm
could use the same report cover by printing a s perhaps a thousand of those
and have those erm f for specific projects and reports and things like that could go out in er i in the future
er we showed him one or two examples of similar sorts of presentations that we'd had from other railway and outside organizations er explained what we'd done in the past said that we were looking to get something more up market and more erm professional which was why we were looking to er seek er quotes from er g graphics UNK linked in with printers
and we talked to him about the intercity erm presentation requirements and sent him away to think about it
he came back er ten days later er and produced a couple of er mock ups
erm
this was a sort of a suggestion of the of the layout
mm
based on er the type of stuff that we had last year
er if i can pass that round
er he he'd just taken some photographs out of last year's er annual report and put a heading up and stuck some text on it
we had indicated when we asked him to quote that we would want one sheet like that to represent what each office was able to produce
mm
and then we'd asked him
yeah
about the folder and erm er suggested that he considered the intercity silver similar to the report cover
er a and he UNK this up a little bit and perhaps i think he's gone a bit over the top on it
norman will quite like the er bit that p way stuck on it
oh
that's always there norman
it doesn't matter what we put into these erm
quotes kevin and mick stood waiting on the platform
and that was an alternative that he came up with for the erm er for the front cover
what was the bottom UNK
i can't
three thousand nine hundred
yeah
we were looking about four thousand pounds for s for a thousand copies of the
i think that's quite nice actually
yeah
how do i look
ah
ah
it's just the it's just the UNK the
the two white squares and
yeah
ah
yeah
it's different isn't it
yeah
UNK
six pound
ha
that's UNK
UNK
mm
we don't need it in latin that's only added expense
at least at least nobody's gonna
disagree with her
erm
yeah
the f the four the four thousand pound quote was for
i don't like that one
no
was for a thousand erm
no
a thousand folders machine UNK and two hundred
retail men
copies of
seven individual sheets to go in
that's based on the same number of colour photographs that we had in last year's annual report
right
which i think was about
what sort of difference is there if we if we put more pictures in or
oh
the pictures are where the money is it's
right
that
erm well
i think really what we want to do is to decide whether or not we are using the annual report as a list of jobs that we did last year
or whether we're using it as a UNK reminding our customers of how good we are and what our improved facilities
mm
that we can offer are
and then we've gotta decide whether we keep it simple erm or whether we put loads of text in
cos my feeling is t they only look at the pictures
yeah
sure they do
a and they're only prepared to read one or two paragraphs of text
mhm
i quite like the way that they've used the intercity UNK for the
mm
text here because it does make it that little bit more interesting and people are likely to think oh
it's not black and white
i'll read it
or i i'll start to read it
mm
then what's in there
i mean at least you've got a chance that they're gonna stay with you and er a and read the odd paragraph
right
there are a number things i think we need to debate
number one is how much are we prepared to spend
yes
and the three thousand nine hundred doesn't seem out of this world as far as i'm concerned
no
no
no
it
erm i mean up are we prepared to go up to five thousand
or
seven
or
what did we spend last year
erm
how much copies is that then
in simple terms
well
i if we talk about holding
thousand
about two
well
no
we're talking about a thousand covers cos the actual extra cost of print once you start printing it the run on cost is UNK
erm
we're having a few extra of these if you want to send something else out
it cost five hundred and forty five to print two hundred of those and cost eight hundred and fifty pounds to print
a thousand
a thousand
now jim wanted to have some of those to send out future UNK
mm
on specific technical erm
yeah
that's what i thought we'd agreed
mm
hadn't we
yes
good idea
we're gonna have a four sheets
yeah
with a single oh that's right with a single project on and we just
ah
no
no
no
no
well
i need to clear this
because i've got totally confused on the last briefing and i thought
what
we were doing two things
we were producing an annual report
mm
which had probably one sheet of everybody's in with a couple of small photographs
maybe double sided
a description
yeah
yeah
yeah
the talk
and it didn't list jobs
why not
it said this is what we're capable of doing
correct
yes
and then we're having another thing with the same sort of brochure as a UNK type thing in loose leaf format
in which there'd be a picture and a description with a few words
right
well
every time we do one
that's that that's fine
it yeah
every time we do one of those if we have it printed on glossy paper to this sort of style you're looking at sort of erm
couple of
th the principle of having a large number to spare
t two or three hundred pounds
seems to me to be good
oh
yes
yes
yes
yeah
yeah
that's what i was meaning
er ca can i UNK a little bit UNK i wo and then come back
because i there are a couple of things that are relevant
we've got we've got the financial commentary now er an and the annual report to go out
and that needs to go into that UNK that needs to go into something like this to go out
or does it
well
the question i the question in my mind is this
how is a presentation such as that gonna be received by our clients
in the present financial climate
i think we'd get away with it
but i put it on the table because it is a risk
yeah
well
we all thought the UNK one was over the top didn't we
even when
we did
we weren't in such a financial state we're in now
yeah
and that was cos maybe it was too thick
and also
and too
it was too much of an ego trip for certain personalities as well
well yeah
so i think si number of pages
yes
you know if you do something that's twenty pages they'll think bloody hell
if you do something that's only six pages
mm
yeah
that's alright
number of pages involved
mm
agreed
yes
i mean ah
my instruction was
oh
erm
our estimates were based on one sheet per function
plus a double sided sheet
yeah
yeah
a double sided a four sheet with
that's fine
with two or three colour photographs
that's what
yes
i don't think anybody would say that's over the top
right
we'll go for it
we'll go for it
plus a couple of pages of
that's decided
general policy
yes
written by hugh
that's right
yes
the sort of introduction
yeah
didn't we do well
i mean last year
about the year
if you remember we kept the annual report bit the financial bit just down to one side
two four six
we could probably get it down to a quarter of a side if
yeah
and we don't need to put anything in about our scales of fees and that sort of thing
that's a separate issue
oh
that's right
yes
right
so
we'll go for it and we'll and we'll risk it
now then
the next thing is er on the agenda we've got the or i thought we had
in the any other business i'm gonna raise the question of us doing work for irish railways
oh
that's this afternoon
sorry
now we've been approached by irish railway with regard they've got something like thirty million pounds from the to upgrade line from dublin to belfast
and they've hopefully they're gonna come and see us to seek our advice on the design techniques that we've used on east coast main line and the construction techniques with particular regard to bridges
but i also felt that we have something to offer in terms of works bes
station design
and p way
so they're gonna come and see us
now
if we had this up and running the sort of thing that we would do is put together a package
yeah
and hand it over
so
yes
i'm very supportive
if you are
yes
definitely
in terms of having that
i'm sure a lot of it it'll not take as long to sort it out because we've broken
we broke the back of it a lot on the work that we did for UNK
mm
erm it's really only a case of each function UNK through the information that they've pulled together from the annual report
erm i mean i i've got from i think i've certainly got roger's and UNK erm stuff for
mm
you know er for the annual report
which is actually a
you've got my text but not pictures
right
which is actually a
you know it's in the form that we've done them in the past
right
er obviously we will need to decide on UNK that down to highlight one or two of the larger jobs and
mhm
and erm a and build up a little bit of er text on just how good we are and what we can produce and how well equipped we are
both in e in equipment and in er
but we've still two i still see we've got two documents though
mm
the annual report and the loose leaf thing that
yeah
the leaf
we will hand over
hand that to
to irish railways
now if we do the annual report properly pages from the annual report can progressively be incorporated into this loose leaf and others taken out and
mm
right
we're talk
you know
this loose leaf
so you've only got one bit
you're setting up and UNK the setting that's the expensive bit not the running off isn't it
no
that that's correct roger
the what we're talking about though forgetting the run on costs which really we can discount because they are UNK
we're talking about something in the region of four thousand pounds to do the loose leaf brochure and seven sheets
what do we want to spend on top of that on printing an annual report
and who are we gonna send it to if anybody
i mean we used to do the annual report because the r c e had to provide something to the general manager
correct
and it was never anything
but any
other than text was it
you
any business produces an annual report
mm
mm
but they
they have to produce an annual report for
for their shareholders
their shareholders
that's right
no
it's not for their
no
customers
that's a s th that's a different sort of annual report
it is
that's a financial
yeah
s financial accountant statement for the year
yes i mean it would include most of that
now we've never done anything other than very s briefly UNK
mm
the end of year results
so you know
what are we trying achieve
what are we trying to do
yeah
saying do we need an annual report
if we
that's right
mm
put all our energy into our loose leaf
we have an annual report for er this end of year financial commentary
there will be nothing to stop us taking that erm binding it up sending it to peter a and chris if we wanted
yeah
a and call it a day
er
it's about as interesting as a financial report from anybody
it's a UNK document
that's right
way even less interesting than
really what has it got to do with our clients
that's right
absolutely
really all you need i mean this is a marketing medium we're trying to
shh
yeah
mm
cos as far as annual reports are concerned you just want a statement from hugh and a rough idea of how we've performed financially
mm
there's no detail
could i could i say this
that's right
yes
the there's an interesting way involved in my mind when i started writing this in this changed format from last year
and th and what i did is all roger's got so far is about one sheet of a four typed up or something like
trevor
that
trevor
sorry
erm which basically says what the main issues throughout the year were
problems with staff
mhm
erm certain types of design we concentrated on
possibly something about clients
i can't quite remember what all that's in it now
erm and then i thought now what i can't do is i can't do what we did last year a and really put a photograph and a des and a description of it
and that's why then in my mind i thought yes
well
it we'll put those in this loose leaf format where we can UNK whip out all the bes ones etcetera if we don't want them
right
and just send our own thing off erm separately
so
it seems to me that there's some UNK
that if we want an internal report we don't have to include photographs
if we wanted an internal report er to go to a few selected clients that report would mainly be text
cos
mm
it's telling people including the staff what the main issues were and how we fought through them
so that the only one
that's right
you actually need to be t send outside UNK or to clients is the one which has the loose leaf format showing here's a UNK project
picture at the top short description
yeah
at the bottom
so
i mean that that's another alternative is that we don't bother with pictures
mhm
we put we put i m i mean we don't actually bind the report up in the er how we would do professionally
it depends how we want to tackle it
c can i
you just slide that into a loose leaf
yeah
great
thanks a lot terry
that's cleared my mind a bit
erm i still feel as a business we need for our own purposes an internal report
mm
are we agreed on that
yeah
yes
i think
that's fine because
we don't need that to go out to clients
we select
yeah
what issues
what i would like to think and i would like to keep that UNK because if we don't it's just gonna drift and
right
and i mean i often refer back to the annual reports
what i would like to think is that we put together an annual report for our own purposes and that goes out to a very limited distribution as trevor was suggesting
right we could bind that ourselves
we could bind that ourselves
plus our own staff
you see there were complaints
yes
last year that there weren't enough and that a lot didn't get one and they were all disappointed
we could bind that ourselves at next to no cost
you know
and we bind it in th n in the way that we
normal
bind up our normal
reports
c e d g reports
mm
right
right
so that's what w are we agreed we'll do that
yeah
i'm surprised at that UNK cos we've
mm
still got some left
ah
right
lots of them
yeah
well
not lots i mean we've probably
got about twenty or so
i mean it's surprising how
how often they get used through the year
and we use them
by people who come are coming for interviews
that's right
or people
mm
who want to er
well
yeah
they're very useful
that's it
i'll have some of them and i'll find out how many
but that's
right
but that's the annual report that we bind up
for our own purposes and
right
the only people
help
are
mind doing that
john peter and our own staff
i think it's important that our own staff see our financial
oh
yeah
figures
yeah
yeah
mm
i think the interesting yeah
and i think those charts are very interesting about where the client base is
yeah
for each individual office
good
that's very good
the problem with that is of course that
go on
if you're wanting to produce two hundred of those i mean if we colour photocopy and you're talking about forty five pence each
we don't have to colour photocopy them just s
try it in black and white and see what it comes out like
yeah
but they're
awful in black and white
i've not seen them
how UNK
how much does it cost for a printer to w to whip off two hundred then
year before last
a lot
well
that's th that's where the money comes
colour is
very expensive
i mean that's the same as a colour photograph
yeah
but what's the
i mean the only other thing we could do would be to
downstairs
that's forty five pence
forty five p
forty five pence a sheet
mm
the only other thing we could do would be to put would be to make colour UNK and then team brief them
on the overhead UNK
no
no
people want to be able to take it away and study it
if it's in brief it's up
mm
and it's gone and you're
well you can put in on the wall afterwards
it'll save money
yeah
you s you see
can't
two hundred of our staff won't be interested in that
do
right
do they want individual copies
could we not just put
no
i don't think they do
could we not just circulate them
the pie one is the interesting one as terry said
yes
so people know where our work is coming from
can't that pie one be done so it would erm
oh
yes
we can do it we can do it in
do black and white
we can do it in black and white roger
yes
i mean you can get the different UNK
and what not
that come
that's erm
out in black and white
yes
yes
that's enough
i think that would come out in black and white
that's enough
you can see where the arrows are
ah
a
most people
okay
we'll try and plot it then produce
say twenty odd of them and circulate them
yeah
or you could have a visual mounted display on the boards outside for
no
people just wouldn't
they keep coming down
i think if we produce twe say twenty odd and we circulated them through the sections
those people who were interested would read them
right
and those who wouldn't weren't interested
for twenty odd you might as well run through the printer trevor
true
mm
let the printer do it
oh yes
yeah
we'd just set it going and just
let them
there's no point in
no
paying
no
forty five pence a copy when you've got a printer there
jus just set it going and go and have your dinner
yeah
yeah
yeah
yes
it's just you know
and certainly we're not trying to impress we're trying to get information over aren't we
yes
that's right
so there's no need to go to great expense of printed what have you
that's right
it's UNK where the money needs to be spent
it is
yes
correct
which is why the other package which wants doing in
mm
this format with
that's right
single sheets
so
how many copies of the annual report
i mean every one of us should have a copy
are we talking about this
yeah
financial the whole of this financial commentary plus
plus a commentary from each function head
plus a commentary from each function head
right
yeah
three copies for bes
shall we send one to the people who are going to scarborough conference
yeah
probably
yes
so we're talking about twenty
twenty four
twenty five say
twenty five copies
mm
right
when you send the erm the text through for your erm annual reports ca can you let me know where it is on the network
mm
if you just tell me which directory it is and what file name it is then we put it all together and erm get at it
i'm slightly confused now
we're gonna do an annual report and i i've no problem with that
and doing the write up
but what about the write up for the
right
glossy
other
yes
well
we're gonna have to UNK on that aren't
yeah
we
cos we're gonna have to decide on a style and then
i mean what i'll do is i'll come and sit down with each of you and we'll
i've got one drafted out already
great
it's very UNK it's about it's one picture about
mm
half an a four and then it has something like no more than six or eight lines
it says who the client is what the approximate value of the job was who the contractor was and the main issues
that's about jobs you're talking individual projects
mm
mm yes
right
that's what you were talking about
i thought we were
no
we're not
i'm
ah
i'm talking i'm talking about
oh
right
well
let's get straight what we are talking about then
well
no
jim's talking about what's going on
that double sided
on that double sided
oh
sorry
right
cos i've finished with
annual report haven't we
yeah
now
wi with the other the other exercise is a marketing exercise isn't it
mm
and basically again can we just talk about what we're trying to achieve
my understanding is what we're trying to achieve is to have a double sided a four sheet which is intended to demonstrate to our clients what good lads we are and what good work we do for each in each function
mm
and that's it basically isn't it
no
UNK terry's going on one stage
no
further with the project which is
i didn't think we were doing that because that
becomes very difficult then
and i can see why jim possibly is confused now because i'm confused
no he's not
as well
oh you're not confused
right
there's only one person confused round here terry
but we but we but we will have
to me
no
to me i thought we were doing individual projects which we'd be able to be update in a loose leaf format
yeah
as new pro as old projects went we threw the old one away and we put a new leaf loose leaf sheet in
and i'm ha
but that means if you only actually fi it to do it professionally you want enough room to do one project on one side of one sheet
no
that wasn't about it wasn't about projects
the marketing exercise for me wasn't about projects
you might wish to put a project in to make a point
fine
but
it was about numbers of staff
it was about
it was it was about for example
yeah
this is
this is UNK
expertise
staff UNK
this is what bes can do and have you heard the latest about fire security
are you aware that your lighting might not be appropriate for your v d us
you know marketing in other
mhm
words getting in at a particular point on a particular subject
right
we do need to discuss it further then don't we
we do
yeah
can i suggest that we talk about the four thousand pound job as a sort of practice profile if we like
yeah
or f for
want of a better name at this stage
a and the annual report is the financial summary plus the text that you would normally have provided
yeah
for previous
years ago about successes and failures and problems and
yeah
er al and future aspirations
yeah
now that's good because it does it gives us a record which we can refer
yes
back to and
mm
and see how we've gone over the year
and that will be circulated to internal erm
staff
we're gonna need more than twenty five cos we're also gonna to send it off to one or two major er certainly peter and people like that i think
yeah
and that we publish ourselves
that's right
yes
yes
yes
well
aim for fifty
we'll have enough for fifty won't we
don't
like to hit the clients do you
no
no
we don't want it to hit the clients
otherwise they're gonna be getting two
no
different horses
no
we don't
it's in it's internal
internal
it's internal
we look at that
the annual report
we
we agreed to twenty five didn't we
now
yeah
if you think that's too few
i don't think it needs to go to anybody other than peter really
do you
i think it's peter
it's peter
and john
i think twenty five is too few really
thirty
well
i for you
and we can always print a few more up terry there's no
to you my boy
we're doing it ourselves yeah
i need seven
seven
seven i need
three
seven
one
three
six
one
nine
erm nine
four
shall we go for fifty
as terry says
let's go for fifty
okay
right
let's get back to the
right
i'm printing that
yeah
let's get back to this
this other document
this we're all agreed that it's a marketing exercise and what we're trying to do is to get across to our clients what we have to offer to them
yes
and how are we gonna do that
we're gonna use this one or two sheets of a four
yeah
jim's got a fairly clear idea of what he wants to do for bes
er
i think terry just wants to expand on it
don't you
i mean y you want what jim wants but you want another one
that's right
and i'm happy to general background like i've got so many staff
some are professionally qualified some are technically qualified
we're experts in surveying work
we've got auto UNK that general sort of build up
yes
erm but then i think we need er i was hoping we were going that step further
yes
in producing
yes
individual project sheets
ah
but every project sheet that we produce you're looking at two or three hundred pounds for each sheet
that that's the only UNK
and if jim's got some new form of UNK that he wants to er sell to the customers or whatever th then
mm
we will produce those for that purpose
you see if you're selling in a magazine or on television or anywhere you don't talk about what you've done other than to if you like UNK the point
what y you're selling something different to them aren't you
mm
if some new technology
comes on line for bes then i can scare clients into having t to give us work like under the health and safety legislation
then that's what i want to do
that's what i want to use it for
why are you looking at york
but surely
and not somewhere else
yeah
absolutely
but sure but surely there is also a lot to be said for i mean you don't go and buy a v w golf g t i just because somebody says they make one and wouldn't it be good to have one
you go there because you've seen somebody else has got one
and how good the quality is
the what
so you're looking at
the car
the car
so you're actually looking at the quality of the product that this particular
mm
erm department is offering you
that's why that you can't get i appreciate exactly what jim's saying
yes
we can do this and nobody else can
that's great
but you've also gotta say and by the way this is one we did earlier
oh
that's what i mean
you use those as examples
yeah
to back up the main point you're making which is
i mean that's not a
w
sorry
the sort of thing that i would be if i were in running your function terry would be to say look at this package that we've developed for p t e stations
that's right
yeah
and here are some examples of what we've done
yeah
we can give you the following
that's right
standard timber platforms
standard platforms
yes
your
exactly
standard
yeah
and have a sheet on that
absolutely
with estimated costs of the an and an exact
costs
and how cost effective it is
how
yeah
speedy it is to
i'm only talking about having something like four sheets for the in total
i appreciate your point about cost but i'm
four or six sheets at any one time
yeah
forming part of
yeah
but the i
can i make just a suggestion
the idea was to launch this wasn't it
under you know some sort of little bit of UNK if you like saying
yeah
th this is the first of many UNK
yes
right
that you'll receive from the various functions
now
okay
i would like sort of have mine headed building engineering services update
yeah
so that the client can see that you're keeping it up to date
well
i think that i'm happy to do that
but the only query that UNK put in my mind is the fact that he's saying that the cost is gonna be UNK
no
no
no
no
what i was saying was
don't
very careful what you say it because it's very expensive
what i'm saying terry is
it is
if we've given ourselves a budget of four thousand pounds and we've ear
no
that's
and we've earmarked that at the moment
no
and we're going to print
mhm
an annual report internally at virtually no cost
mm
let's decide if we're going to produce a glossy sheet for each job or a glossy sheet for each erm future update
or package
yes
to custom whatever
then we've got to decide how much we're prepared to spend on that an and when we're gonna spend it
that's all
right
a and there is a real cost a proper cost not just a erm an internal cost for preparing these
but you're not talking about every job are you
no
no
no
prestigious jobs
mm
right
which might not be at year end for example
i'm supportive of what trevor says
if we do a special works job or a special bridges job that we feel we've done particularly well then we can produce for that job
the loose sheet
the sheet
yeah
and i think it'll be wonderful
and on a major project like that it might be sensible to bill that sort of thing into the fees at the at the outset
indeed
because the client's gonna get the UNK of it
so we might as well er
get paid for it
get paid for it
yeah
yeah
i mean a classic is
then it costs you to say
knot UNK
is a definite there
yeah
we're gonna do one on that
but at we're gonna also add on the sort of general description amount we give structural advice on any sort of project
that
like leeds city station
great
waiting UNK
if you chose UNK
bradford foster square
the sensible thing would be
mm
to have a combined one
for me for the c e d g to have a combined bes works
there may be some
presentation
that can be combined
there may be some that can be combined to save money
that's right
i mean UNK is perfect
oh
yeah
an and i mean what are we trying to say
we're trying to say we can provide you
a package
with a comprehensive package
mm
yeah
and lose money at the same time
and they don't need to know that
not necessarily
it was a laugh
it was an exercise
but these this is a
not
yeah
right
right
lie it down
i'm happy with that
i take it that we're not that that's gonna be the second phase then
mm
we get this bit out first
well
and then we come back with this second phase
well
yes
but i possibly the point i mean
we can't afford it to look to drag on too long
we need to set a timescale on it
ri w with terry and jim and
the first ones
and a and agree them and say yeah
that's ex that is exactly what
that's right
we want
and then terry and er sorry roger and norman and erm david
can
now
work from that
what it would be interesting to would be to using the
what do you mean
using the
mm
cross rail tender type of document would be to have a standard three or four sheets that were relative to the whole group
i know you know you have a specific bes one when it goes
mm
out
gotta be
a group one
er in case you didn't know
that's right
yeah
this is who we are
yeah
yeah
the key items
absolutely
a sorry
th
sorry trevor
the skills and facilities that we
yeah
that we have
i e the c v type of stuff
and you'd want one to tell them about
UNK
for example
yes
that we've got x machines and systems UNK
you know you didn't know before but now we have we have if you like
we know can do anything on UNK for you
UNK
i mean they didn't know that do they
UNK
mm
p g d c b d
and then there are subjects like that which are non project specific but which are
that's right
yes
important
yeah
exactly
so
this is useful
erm so what are our main messages in this document
to help
comprehensive service is surely number one
right
the fact we can offer
yeah
comprehensive engineering service
expertise
comprehensive service
high quality finished product
look at these photos
experience of working in r er a railway environment and UNK
disruption to the
a wide rang a wide range of clients
safety
safety
s
we must tell them something about our staff as well
yeah
that was e i thought that was in expertise
mhm
but perhaps that's not quite
yeah
UNK
yeah
er UNK of staff
i'm gonna have to pop out for a moment
that's a point
that's enough to start isn't it
mm
yeah
too
yeah
long UNK
excuse me for a moment
well yeah
and you want well i mean each a four sheet needs to be on a particular subject
mm
doesn't it
i mean you know some people will be particularly interested to read about what we're doing with UNK
well the same message
one side
yeah
you know
up to date with UNK
UNK
think of him he's a world expert on UNK everything
UNK
oh UNK
i thought you were gonna
say
it's like this set of golf clubs he wants
you know that he buys because everybody else does
no
the ones i've got very hot
mm
his golf cl he he's i thought he was
taking
a whole hour off
did you hear that norman
yes
jim too
we wer we weren't gonna mention that
ah
no
no
only at one hole
only at one hole
mm
tt
yeah
yeah
normally we'd be talking about him but because the tape UNK on
yeah
switch it o switch it in on again now
let's hope you know er UNK doesn't listen to that bit
that's all is it
right
thank you
UNK
right
first of june we talked about didn't we to get
yes
we did
yeah
right
that's for this
that's for this yes
not for the annual report
no
no
no
who's in the initiative
goodness me
yeah
well jim and i are to start with to get the er
track
are we
are we gonna
mm
w can we
firm up on UNK design
do you want us to go to other graphics firms for alternative quotes
alternative designs
i mean at the end of the day it becomes subjective like choosing wallpaper
mm
it looks
i think what they've produced is pretty good
i would say that to we should give you a bit of freedom in terms of price therefore i think we should er allow you to spend up to say five thousand pounds
right
erm it doesn't er a from what i know of the UNK one five thousand pounds seems very fair
yes
they paid a lot more
than
mm
return them
yeah
it is quite out of
it is five
date now
it is five percent of our expenditure budget for this year of course
for our you know
mm
sorry
it's five UNK less lighting improvement UNK
mm
but you work on you work on the principle that you'll only get that back and more
if you don't the whole thing
yes
is a waste of time
is a waste of time isn't it
yes
yes i agree
mm
i agree
any UNK gotta cover itself
yeah
mm
is it part of the intercity UNK that the silver swallow has to go to right hand up to
mm
the
er
a wire which is
it has to be a certain size it has be flying
yeah
at a certain speed
cos that's important
that swallow while it's not
we haven't discussed that in great detail
by the way
yeah
but we will make sure it's in the right place
the slight UNK the slight UNK is it says intercity
well
yeah
we've had this argument before
well UNK sorry
a and if it says intercity it then it then it really ought to be UNK or the
that's corporate
you can have the
no
that's corporate
you can have the
yeah
that corporate standards would apply there
look
whether we like it
or not
you can have the choice you
we are
can have
we are owned by intercity
and that is what we're selling at the moment
okay
not for long though
well for two years
but we're that's the most prestigious subsidiary of british rail that's what
it is indeed
we're selling
right
okay
i wouldn't like to have the british railways
i'd go along with that
mm
but don't tell them
or UNK distribution
so i suppose you're fairly happy with your
fif fifteen point nine
i'll tell you what i'd rather be intercity than central services in terms of the market we've got
no problem
have you seen the civil engineer of UNK distribution
no
oh yes
john
ah no
no
no
he's
i can't
i just couldn't believe it
yeah
oh god
right
ah
very good
so you've got five thousand pounds
i mean whether
right
he takes his friend to work i don't know
UNK going to be turning in his grave
yeah
five thousand pounds to spend
i'm lost
an and we're gonna get it out by the first of june
you know that
do you remember
right
really
mm
out by the first of june
that's our target date
right
good
trevor and jim are gonna produce the first
how
the first sheets er and in the meantime i mean i'm hoping that roger and norman and dave are at least putting something together
mm
so that when the first sheets are produced it's just a matter of saying oh yeah i'll edit this now in that sort of format
i mean if you could you know what we're looking for now
we're looking for about two big paragraphs or so plus some photographs to go onto one of these
so if you could UNK or select from the text that you've already prepared for the annual report something that will go in there that says why your functions are
brilliant
the best thing on b r for that particular discipline
then er it it's only gonna be a case then of knocking it into the same style for all
mm
seven sheets
great
if we say fifty
percent
good
no more than fifty percent photos in those two sides
yeah
yeah
you can have the
the
the general
a
have a two or three photographs
up to three photographs
er two on one side one on the other one
well you said one a four sheet now you're saying it's double sided
oh it's certainly double sided
double sided glossy
that's
mm
two
no
it's one double sided
it's the one double sided
it's an a four
sheet doubled sided
mm
up to three colour photographs per function
yeah
but
and i and i would also say that if
for example roger felt that he couldn't get all of the message that he wanted on there that we would consider two
selling him some space from your space david
mm
oh but why
colour photos
alright
if terry does
i'm happy with that
not bes though
i know that's gonna push the cost up
no
i'm easy
yeah
if you all i don't want us to do is to start drifting into the second exercise as part of this first exercise which sounds very much
alright
you're starting to talk projects rather than
yeah
i
er rather than function
i just i just feel at this stage
i just don't wanna UNK people so much that
alright
we that we don't get any value out of it
i mean maybe if roger came up and said well i want five then clearly we would say come off it roger
let's have a look
but i'd rather i'd rather he presented us with five that we could then reduce to two
yeah
than
mm
than have to UNK himself to one and there's just no m content there
are you with me
yeah
yeah
because then we could make a conscious decision as a management team as to whether we were gonna increase the price to five thousand five hundred or six thousand
yeah
and get so much more value out of it
and then of course there needs to be a budget for the rest of the year doesn't there
yes there
does
yes
for presenting projects
good
right
next item
project safety training for project engineers
now then
this has come about as a result of well no
it had been on the agenda before
and if you remember in the past we agreed that we would send either one or two people on the project management safety courses that were being run by UNK
or had been organized by UNK
and somebody was gonna go and review the relevance to this organization so that we could determine what we did about it
mm
and our feeling if my memory serves me right was that we felt that our site safety courses were adequate and gave
correct
a reasonable training
right
so that was
plus all our other courses
yes
that's right
we thought we had enough expertise with our in house training without having to go on a separate one thousand five hundred pounds project management course
right
since then jim who manages the project engineer course has spoken to trevor and also since then we've had er contact from regional railways our major client who have actually said that they require us to have this expertise
with regard to
leeds north west
no
projects which they will select
over to trevor
jim is coming to see me on the fourth of may
is that tuesday
yes
mm
erm and hugh has changed his diary so that erm he can see jim as well
and it would be helpful i know it's short notice but if erm those of you from the erm tt er design function groups who will interface with the project engineers i e bridge works bes and p way if you could also attend it i if it would be possible
i mean we're only talking about half an hour or so er at some time around about eleven o'clock on tuesday morning
jim's very convincing about the th the difference between this course and the sort of courses that erm er that we have actually run and erm automatically include in our training for our staff
i mean jim's a civil engineer himself and he knows the skills and disciplines that we work to
he points out that this safety exercise is about assessing risk where one set of circumstances might be alright within that particular discipline but when you actually put that along the side of a similar sort of marginal safe systems that are in other disciplines er th that you might end up with a conflict or highlighting some form of erm er UNK that could end up in what UNK all the codes and regulations and blue books and whatever but at the end of can do this and nobody else can
that's great
but you've also got that you notice well down the erm the expenditure on a project that you're gonna have to have to go back and change something that should have been sorted out at the start
does he give examples
yeah
but they're not very good
he does but they're not very good as far as we're concerned
he gives examples of level UNK that might be perfectly alright as erm automatic half barriers in their own right as far as er UNK constraint and as far as UNK constraint
but when you actually put them all together and recognize the traffic flows and the location of the nearby school and the shopping centre and on one or two other things that at the end of the day this perhaps is a site where tt er full barriers and c t v might be more appropriate
other cent o other jobs where
what you're doing
what you're
mm
i don't
yes
it's project engineering roger but it's actually saying that the project manager needs to be trained to ferret out certain information
the project manager
yes
yeah
i'm happy with that
and that the people that are s
that the people that are supporting the project manager also ought to be encouraged not to just to keep their UNK on and work within their own discipline and say i've nothing to worry about i work to the blue book i work to the code of practice i work to the british standard
but they ought to be encouraged to look over the fence at er
well i hope they do because you end up with the wrong bloody solution if you just go at it like that
you put the wrong bloody bridge in if you forget the implications on track or
everything else
so what they're actually saying is that here is a formal training that will make sure that everybody at the who goes on this course comes away with a measure of having achieved those skills because th the course itself is formed of two parts
two days on the health and safety at work act which we can probably do without because if we can pass the exam before we go on the course then we don't need to do those first two days
the other three days are on this erm UNK thinking risk assessment type of erm
project safety
project safety plans
mm
and
cos we're already producing those
mm
we are but we've never been formally trained in them
and jim genuinely feels oh and again that element is UNK
then at the end of the day you've actually something to say yes
this person has got these skills to carry out this
and that would sit quite well with our quality systems
true
so it depends on at what level we decide to train this down to
mm
from the client
we'd certainly be s
sorry
we don't s we don't see the a vast number of our staff being trained in this way
at fifteen hundred pounds a time
from the client's point of view regional railways were quite UNK that erm if we didn't do it then they would find somebody who was prepared to
provide that service
what about
so
my arguments
one of my arguments for doing it
come off it
pull the other one
one of my arguments for
hang on
doing it roger is that we sit here and we say to our clients ah but you really ought to be coming to us because we're railway experts
yeah
you shouldn't go to other consultants because they're not as good as us
they don't have the special skills and training that you need to carry out working within the railway environment
and then once some specialist railway training comes along we're arguing that we don't need it
right
no
we're only arguing
can i
we don't need it because w we we're confused a as to how this suddenly gets
mm
er UNK on us from another department
er and b that surely a lot of it is covered in our training already
that we're not saying
yeah
you know we shouldn't be training
railway safety we're wondering
you actually
how this UNK with everything else that we've been doing
yes
well we'll not we'll not know that until we've actually sent somebody on it which is what we what
well could i just something
we agreed to do something like six months ago
because you can't get the course
well i've spoken to keith and kim from b tec about some of this and er things are not as clear cut as people are perhaps making out
right
i can understand some of the UNK it would give us by our undertaking
mm
this course
but it's a hell of a lot of money
it is
and are talking about i think more than just a few people erm therefore the s
it's non it's non fee earning work
there's a loss of the work whilst they go on the course fifteen thousand
that's
quid and
mm
at the moment the only source it's come from is directed projects
correct
yes
it's not come from anywhere else it's not a group standard
yeah
directed and
the only the only thing is terry that the directed
projects has done a bloody good selling exercise because he's convinced these people
that everybody should do it
well remember though but the problem is with project managers didn't have any
training at all
training
yeah
true
that's where you started from
can i just say that i
i've not quite finished trevor
the other thing is under the UNK regulations the responsibility for arranging the right quality of staff in terms of providing resources in terms of time and finance lies with the client
therefore if regional railways wants us to do it i think we have there is some merit in us going back to them and saying yes we'll do it
if it's leeds north west project we'll charge it to that project
no
well i'm sorry but that is what
the UNK regulations say
that's like employing a UNK and then going down to UNK and buying his tools for him
i think that's absolutely ridiculous
hear
no
but i'm sorry but the UNK regulations lay the health and safety plans and risk assessment out in exactly that format
the client can't li s stand back and say it's all up to you to do it
there's a
acceptable
there's a lovely paragraph in UNK er covering note to the submission for leeds north west
and this UNK is something to the effect that your here is the erm tt the estimate of our work and we're seeking authority
if other safety er implications or safety requirements er UNK on this project then these will be funded by me
correct
and that's regulations say
they must fund
right
them
can i can i just focus your mind on two things gents
if you w u unfortunately we didn't look at the financial commentary as the first item
if we had done you would see that s still something like forty five percent of our work is for regional railways
oh aye
you would see that something like thirty percent of our work is at leeds north west UNK
from the meeting that m that trevor and i had with keith the other day erm keith is actually working in support of us to try and m maintain us working for them in the future
against great UNK
mm
the point i'm gon i'm coming to is this that we have with regard to regional railways work forty five percent of our workload which i see is at
extreme risk
now there's no way i'm gonna talk to tha he they are our major client
it's extremely risky that we could lose all of that work over the next four months
in my humble opinion if we can find a formula round this table for satisfying them and that's i mean that's who we're trying to satisfy
they're the ones who are saying look
these courses are on o on the go
we want your people to be trained in them
there's no way i'm gonna turn round to them and say get UNK
i want to retain that work
for us to retain that work we are gonna have to bend over backwards to do what regional railways want
so i think what we should
be doing us at the management team here is saying look we know we're gonna have UNK we want to please the client
how do we please the client
and do we do it within the financial
how do you recover your money
constraints that we have
well how do you recover
your money
can we just
well
look at the money for a moment because if you look when we come to look at the financial commentary we will be going down the erm er what we spent our training budget on
mm
last year
a and perhaps instead of employing mr last year er as we did last year to do management development this year we could have er safety development as being
mm
the focus for our training
we spent a lot of money on UNK training last year because
it was necessary
we will be s spending more money on UNK
s say s
training and more money
certainly
on UNK training
but why is it fifteen hundred pounds
quite
erm
and how do we know intercity aren't gonna come along and demand a different course
roger th that that's
one of the reasons
yeah
for me meeting with jim was to say yes that's fine but if at the end of the day we have to train down to a certain level within our group there's no way can we afford five man days of lost fees and fifteen hundred pounds
mm
how could we get it down
could we have it in york
could we have it non residential
could we have it
we've got so many people could you come up here and do
mm
a three day training course
and we will sort out the health and safety elements with in house training and we'll run the erm er the UNK ourselves type of thing
and all those sort of things are available to us if we want to develop it
but what we've got to decide first is whether we're gonna do it and if so at what level
if we were gonna say right this only is gonna apply to UNK projects tt and therefore it would be appropriate for the project coordinator to be the person to sit down at the start of the job when he's agreeing the remit with the client when he's developing the erm tt er who's doing what within the functions
if it's appropriate for him to sit down there with the project manager then we haven't got a problem
because we will only have erm less than a dozen project UNK at
no
it's not it's not on that level
the project quality plan is produced by the project engineer looking after the job and that is not the project coordinator
it's a much lower level
er i might also say on open access which is something that i was at a meeting for yesterday in london
is that you must give in our tender documents we must tell the contractor what he has to allow for in his price
and that will be attending p t s training courses and at and having UNK
cos that allows him to the cost
and that fits
mm
quite well within
mm
UNK regulations
now in some respects what i think should happen is we should yeah we should not be negative about going on the course but in terms of the financial implications i'm very worried about that and i think there is a erm there is some need for the client to say that if he wants us to go on this course we're happy to go on it but that he should look seriously at financing and he plus it should have been in the tender document
in thi in a normal UNK situation if the client
yeah
turns round to you half way through the job and says by the way you must do this
it's a v o situation
mm
now
yeah
right
i i'm not trying to be a i'm not trying to be UNK i'm just trying to get
no
no
the responsibility where it
terry
i
UNK as a shared one it's not just ours
i don't dispute anything
that say there but what i would suggest is that if we do this if we actually train up pay for a number of our staff to be trained we have a unique selling point
yeah
i couldn't agree more
and it
down our vision aims doesn't it
it does indeed
it gives it gives it gives us a strength
well i
over i mean let us let us let us
why have we changed our minds though
we said we said at the start of this that we did enough training
i don't think we do
well how does this fit in to c stage
well how do you know
how do you know
we the i r s e
how does
it fit into that
this
is what UNK me
did
can i can i give you a scenario
say it would start ju just re UNK
mm
we did say at the discussion that we did a four and a half day or a five day construction site safety
yeah
course
we train our people in c s
well that's construction safety isn't it
that's nothing
to do with whether
yeah
or not w we should be having a bridge or a
i'm sorry because
or a er a level crossing
or a s a erm a
but trevor i thought the consensus at the start
mm
of this discussion was the fact that we had and it was certainly was the last time we talked about it because that's why we only sent one person on it
to find out to find out
well we haven't sent anybody yet as far as i know
i thought it was steve been on it
no
oh right
well i thought we had decided that unless there was any added benefit to it we weren't actually gonna attend
there was no point in sending your staff
yeah but we're talking round this
we are
can i UNK can i ask if
but we're doing project safety now and it's working
the four the four people at this end of the table would be UNK five people at this end of the table would be available
to talk to jim
to talk to jim on monday er
by all means
on tuesday
yeah
yeah
by all means
well i'm not here but i'll
if he's in
fourteenth
you see i can i just
i
mm
agree with that
i would like as many of the front line people as possible
to meet with jim so that we can a the objective of which will be for jim to tell us what the content of his course is so we can assess where whether there are gaps in our training
two to see whether we can knock down the price and whether we can get him to come up here in the same way as doctor does and do it that way to reduce the costs
erm and i think that's basically it isn't it
that's it
er and i'm sure that
h he's quite happy to do that second item
erm he does say in the course that residential is better because i it does tend to be a very intensive erm course
you're working up till midnight on a couple of days
they're not good courses
if we make it
non residential
the money that we save on the residential bit we could perhaps say right then we'll do that bit in four days
we'll do a UNK health and safety ourselves
er and we'll run the other bit non residential over four days
mm
perhaps finishing at six
but
o'clock or whatever
right
so roger jim terry UNK norman and UNK meet jim on
well i'm not here
so i'll have to send down
so you're saying it's tuesday afternoon
fourteenth
what time is it
at four
no
it's at four
fourteenth
it's at four
no
the fourth
oh
the fourth
at what time
a about eleven o'clock
he's coming
in my office
he's coming
here
yes
yes
he's coming from
edinburgh
hugh and i have got a meeting at ten which will be clear by eleven
erm
h he's got a he's coming down from edinburgh and he wants to call in and see me about something and i don't know what because i've only spoken to his secretary
but i think that if we can grab him just for half and hour
great
and let him er e explain
you see gents what we've got to be aware of is if glasgow and birmingham for example
buy into this and we don't
and they will
i think so
well birmingham certainly will cos it's the sort of thing they like doing
where does that leave us
because
i be under
work
be under no UNK gentlemen that er keith is under a lot of pressure to put his work to birmingham and glasgow and not to york
mm
but we know why they're
not gonna do it don't they
it doesn't make financial sense
yeah
but i mean keith is actually sticking his neck out on our behalf
mm
yes
i'm aware of that
and as i said the work is at risk and don't kid yourself it ain't
no
because it is
yeah
ah
but peter
peter
mm
and
yeah
and erm richard are determined that the work will be done in house by regional railways
mm
mm
if that happens we've got to market intercity a lot harder than they are and take and take the work
off birmingham that they're doing that they shouldn't be doing
cos they're still doing a hell of a lot of our
yes
work
yeah
we we've
the subject
yeah
the point i was making was that we need every
we don't want to
unique selling point we can
to be able to convince c er our clients that they should come to us rather than somebody else
and if you actually remove a unique selling point and hand it over to one of your competitors
that to me is not good business
no
and for the future i it is useful to have qualified staff so that whether they be technically qualified
it's essential
it
UNK
yeah
qualified
safety
i can
qualified
i can believe they won't UNK our
i can't believe
our site safety er
cos i can't see that
they'll have the expertise that we have in our site construction safety courses
and i'm sure they'll have a different expertise
another example you see
sorry trevor
i've just chap one of my chaps has just come back off a three days confined spaces responsible person course
yeah
so it's
i mean i've UNK him and there is a heck of a lot more to confined spaces
yeah
than he ever thought
yes
and
mm
indeed he now is a tremendous asset to us
yes
and yet and yet
aha so is he
legally
good enough for the whole group
well he is that's why we
we don't need everybody to go on that
we've got
and steve
granville and steve
we've got three
mm
we agreed that
you should have somebody
in your office
mm
i think roger
but actually the first part of it
is just the same as the confined space
very rare
authorized
very rare if roger goes in
any of us to go into confined spaces
no
UNK people go
not there
yeah
wait a minute you see that's the problem
yeah
yeah
the chap that i sent he thought he knew what a confined space was
he came back and he said nearly everywhere we work we're working in confined spaces
yeah
places where we never
thought were confined spaces
i should have my office bigger
but you're still working on it aren't you
yeah
yeah
i'm working on it
all you need is an accident
yeah
and then the law would tell you where you're going wrong
and that's the problem with safety isn't it
yeah
yeah
the traffic lights syndrome
yeah
and the more qualified you are on safety the more prepared you are
i think
the only thing to bear in mind is that we a little bit careful w with the changing environment we're working in that it with it only being pushed forward by direct projects if nobody else wants it we could be wasting some of our money
i
yeah
terry the way this came about is that one of our clients is saying he wants us to do it
yeah
that was how
it's come about
i mean we have the
well ju but at the moment just for leeds north west as far as i'm aware
no
no
he said for any project
no
in the future
any project
b but the fact the pro the safety strategy for leeds north west is not yet written is rather UNK
mm
for the UNK you know
mm
okay
tt right
not issued anyway
so we'll see jim and then we will decide on a strategy for
presume we should also write to peter and ask him if he's got any spare safety money to er
well our o our is three stage UNK
yeah
process
we see jim we decide amongst ourselves whether we have the need and i think i mean i believe we do anyhow
er we evaluate the need and how many people want to go on it we evaluate what it's gonna cost and then we see if we can get money through the safety budget that director safety holds
yes
and then away we go
right
mm
good
reasonable
mm
c d g scarborough conference update
trevor again
we've fixed the dates for erm scarborough er as we'd previously er talked about
it's er
you've forgotten haven't you
nineteenth twentieth twenty first of
correct
yeah
nineteenth twentieth
er we've fixed the hotel and UNK got a
n no i haven't
ah
well i forgot the name of it er the UNK st nicholas
nicholas
nicholas
st nicholas
st nicholas it's got a
massive
it's
swimming pool has it
it's got a nice little swimming pool although evidently it looks really nice on the photograph because it looks like a big UNK one
it's actually
three foot square
it's actually a UNK
clever
and the UNK just sort of chopped it up along the along the
er hypotenuse which i think is a bit UNK really
no
no
no
i sent rachel to scarborough to er
to look at all the accommodation to make sure of th that it was er suitable
wish you were here
yes
it's four poster beds
it's been on wish you were here
it's er
there's a UNK as well
we've booked
we should have UNK should have bought
accommodation will be erm
no
single or double rooms booked single UNK occupancy in double rooms
er all the
but mr
UNK
so it should keep him in order
erm the there is an UNK to the hotel so some of us will be sleeping in the UNK but taking all our meals in the and it's just round the corner
mm
so there's really no problem there no
it is
er and we will be
we will be having dinner there on the wednesday evening before we go on the UNK
good
er and then full day erm
good
a full day programme on the thursday and working up until erm mid afternoon on the friday
er and jane has sent us in some proposals which erm she's s since modified and is now working on and she's calling in to see us for half a day in the near future to
just to firm up on final
just to on various bits and pieces
mm
what we do need to know is er who is coming from each function
yo you know the numbers that were allocated to you last time
c can we just r UNK
what
on those cos i
alright
no
i i've got them written down
i'll let you have them
if you would
yeah
thank you
er we do need to know w we did i did actually a ask lawrence who is one of the two management staff reps whether or not he was available cos i know lawrence as i as er a local councillor has a fairly busy diary
erm we suggested lawrence rather than tony because he's younger and
got a future with us
aye
tony did express an interest in going last time so we felt that
mm
lawrence perhaps is younger and more
that's fine
er so i invited lawrence but he was concerned about his workload and felt that because of the staffing within the bridge office it might not be convenient
mm
for roger to release him
so i said that i would raise that a and er
what's he working on UNK
oh he's off work and you see he has all the time off for councils and you know it isn't as if he's there UNK
and er you know
right
more time off
mm
up to you roger
well i'd prefer him not to go but
right
you know it is di
mm
it's a very difficult decision to take you know
i can go bill can go but he can't
erm
i would like i would like a sta
we're talking two managers aren't we
i would like a staff rep to be there and i think it should be a management staff rep
i mean we debated this at the last meeting didn't we
yes
and we concluded that it was a bloody good idea
mm
erm and out of the two i mean there's no doubt in my mind that lawrence should be the one to go
tony is as trevor said is has got aspirations
to leave if the voluntary UNK comes up again and the whole purpose of the exercise is to look to our future
i think it's one of the most important things that we're gonna do this year
and you know the objective for us is to see where we're going to be able to encourage our staff to realize that as a that we have a future
er w which in turn is intended to minimize the loss of staff over the next two years
er a and for one guy to attend for two days the guy might go off for two days
er if we could find a way of getting him there i think it would be worthwhile
that's my opinion
anybody disagree
it's not us who'll have to sit in front
of the er client and explain why things are
i understand that
back on er o on a project
yeah
well that's where we've got to UNK isn't it
UNK knows best
i agree with what you say erm it's just unfortunate that it's lawrence
erm we're you know having enough trouble
mm
with his council work and everything and erm whether
how many people have you got in the council in your office
at least two
dave
dave and lawrence at the moment that's all but others with aspirations
but david's only part time anyway isn't he
what at work
oh at work
i mean
the council
a at work he he's
why
get fifty percent of dave now we only used to get like twenty five before
yeah
but you only pay him fifty percent of his salary
that's right
yeah
cos i mean get a good deal
with
yeah
mm
you know we don't get a good deal with dave because we're paying hundred percent overheads on the seat he's sitting
yes
in and that sort of thing
i'll see what we can do
erm
i'll tell you what r i mean roger i'll leave it entirely with you
if you can't afford it so be it
it was a good it was a good thought and i mean i personally
we'll see if there are ways round it
see
yeah
it by UNK away
yeah
with
i mean if you can't
that's another option isn't it
if he if you would
yeah
be prepared to erm
to work on a sa on a saturday say
yes
yeah
right
i'll see what we can do about that
okay
erm right
so that looks as though it's going well
i was
are you gonna get an agenda out for it trevor before
oh yes
yes
erm
good
well i'm not but UNK jane will be giving us erm
got two UNK
a package
to sort of set out what we're gonna do and er
how we're gonna achieve it
bloody hell
i just don't see them as being
yeah
i think it's
we would spending quite a lot of money
with her and er she's doing a lot of preparation work
i mean w
yeah
yeah
if that's what people think it's about then we haven't got across haven't we
no
erm
yes
how do we get across to the staff the purpose of this exercise
cos the purpose of the exercise is for us to see how far we've come but the most important purpose of the exercise is to determine where we wanna go
i need to receive a staff
well
release er a press release w before we go
w
the press release th the letter i sent to erm chris
yeah
or to peter to pass on to chris didn't that sum it up
yes it did
reasonably well
i thought
distributed
can we
can we team brief
team brief
i know we
i know we team briefed last time round but su
did we
that we were gonna have this
told
have you got my letter
but i
yes
but what worries me my friend is that erm
i have been talking to one or two members of s staff at a fairly low level over the last week
and they haven't the UNK idea what we're doing
so the team
briefing was certainly UNK
have a look and see if that sums it up
i can't believe it
no
seriously
the staff don't know what we're up to
er a and the
although we couldn't tell them that we're trying to achieve because we haven't we haven't discussed
right
that yet
we know we're looking
mm
at how we're to go forward in the future an and improve the service
mm
to the client
it was a UNK mine was a simple team brief i don't know
mm
i spoke to two people from two different organizations
two people who are planning to leave our organization and the purpose of talking to them was to say oh what's the problem
why are you wanting to leave
er and in both cases it was er a feeling of UNK and that they felt they would be more secure going to a different part of the organization
great i'm
and quite honestly the parts of the organization they were going to i don't perceive as being any more secure
there's no more security anywhere at the moment is there
i mean there's none
no
so
er
the whole purpose of our exercise was to give the staff a better feeling of security
mm
and a and if you like an UNK that they've got a future with us
so that we could keep the bloody team together over the next few years
it's gonna be even more difficult another three or four posts i believe are now appointed with UNK that will create vacancies
alan 's gone
was a project manager
right
so i i'm gonna suggest that we re team brief it this time round
what with that letter or something similar
som yeah
we can use that
as the basis for it
mm
these people can't say then w what our that they don't know what our intentions are
no
that's right
what we're aiming to achieve and
yeah
how we're gonna do it
yeah
good
what might be useful UNK is jane put together this proposal
yeah
an and inside that proposal were objectives
erm
which yes
and if we get a UNK i've changed our
yes but she's yeah
you UNK on
that's right on her on the copy of that
on that copy
yeah
we haven't had time to look at that either have we
no
no
obviously don't a bit naughty if you've agreed objectives and we haven't seen them
copies still got
pardon
if you want to use the original if you'd
oh i've
feel happier
i've still got it
yes
but bef before we start issuing that we ought to get the members of this group here to agree what the objectives are
if we're gonna accept those
mm
right
before the conference
er
i thought we did that last time
i thought we'd done that because that was the remit that we agreed at this table round this table
i'll tell you what they are anyway
and then we actually put those to jane hugh jim myself
and she went away and produced that document after we'd given her the brief
they they're summarized here and what i'll do is we'll get UNK off these before team brief
to recognize the successes achieved by the group over the last two to three years
to understand the future we face in terms of who our customers will be suppliers and competitors
to agree what the overall aspirations of the group are what is our current vision and values for future
to identify current and potential customers explore their needs and expectations now and in the future
to agree key business developments
where do we need to improve our competitive edge
what would be our business strategy our project development and market development
er for us to identify current problems and improvement opportunities so that we can deliver our product and services
and the one that i added in was to identify the options available to the group regarding future ownership
er to work on the key issues which are common to all options for the future er such that th we can put ourselves in the best position to secure future business success
i think those are broad enough headings such that
to cover anything
none of us are likely to fall out about it
the whole idea of this is to go in there with an UNK with a with a clean UNK and see what we're
what comes out
producing
but erm o one of the things that i asked jane to look at was we want it's quite an expensive operation is this just in our salaries and the loss of fees from us from twenty four people
we don't get
and
any fees usually
no
but
so that's not too bad
okay
ou well our salaries then
yes
certainly that's a lot of brass
and what i wanted was a means of identifying whether we'd achieved any anything over the two days
and that was one of the prime things that i asked
that's gonna be tricky
jane to do
just to say look
mm
how do we measure i whether the two days have been successful
and er she's working on that
so it had to have a structure
so shall i get copies of that
mm
and we can team
yeah
brief that
not now
this afternoon
right
right
anyway i think we've covered that fairly UNK
meeting with regional railways future services and UNK reports
right
erm david trevor and i met keith roy and
mark
mark a couple of days ago
who are the other two people
UNK a contractor
contract
and UNK the planning
regional railways
contracts clerk or something isn't he
yeah
he yeah
he's what
duncan is
was
yeah
was
yeah
mm
yeah
okay
the meeting was at their request and what they wanted to do was discuss with us how we should report er financial data to them in the future
mm
because they are not only us but all a s u s that are working for regional railways
they did make the point that we're better than most of their er
mm
so we're a bit
suppliers
ahead in fact we're ahead of them
and they are they are very grateful for the service that we provide which comes about because of our use of dopacs and the quality systems that we're introducing
and it will they made it quite clear that we are way ahead particularly of people like the s and t
mm
but also of the other UNK
now then
what came out of it was erm a number of things
we've talked about the project safety training that was one thing that came out of it
but the main thing that came out of it is that they need from us er the client reports
and they're not getting them at the moment
now they want from us a prediction of the fee expenditure that they will incur on a period by period basis and we're not sure how we can provide that
and UNK gon
does anybody else want a UNK
yes please
might as well
anyway can we after they wanted a few predictions
what was the next thing they also want
they want a spread of expenditure for the contract works so what we agreed with them is that we will UNK start sending them client reports and i've asked them if they will report back to us whether the client reports are in the form they want them
because we feel that the client UNK some within the management team feel that the client reports as we are proposing to issue them are heavy
in other words there's too much information in them
so they've agreed to cooperate with us in er putting together a client report or UNK client reports which have a minimum of information but the information that they require
not the information that we think they require
an and i'd like that team briefing as well
cos it's quite disappointing that we actually er agreed that we'd start issuing client reports about two months and as far as i'm aware nobody started issuing them
leeds north UNK
gonna have to wait for the erm
no
that's done
that's all done
a apart from chris and bill i've sat down with all the m s fours an and been through the changes to the appointment contract and how they now erm form the basis of the er interim client report
th the interim client report is ready i mean you could use it today
erm if that's what people
er if you like when i go through it with chris and bill i'll you know invite you in and we'll
you say
well so in other words you haven't done the bridge office
that's right
yeah
because they weren't available when
yeah
when i did everybody else and erm i
oh yeah
i'd like to be in on that
yeah
er but the report er the database has now been UNK in accordance with the paper i've put to you
yeah
the appointment contracts and variations have been changed in accordance with the paper i've put to you
the sort of UNK railway example is now up and running
the interim client report which i showed as again as an example which i provided you a copy with is now available
so effectively you've had that information all you've actually got to do is to make sure that the text within the general notes of the
mm
database is relevant and then on all open projects your clerks can produce these reports for your project UNK to sign off
the only problem is that the first time you do it for each project if it's a ne if it's a an old project then we are going to have to put something in the field which UNK the total remit for the whole of the group to date
er a and that's a one off exercise
i think we should let old projects run the run the course frankly
well you can't do that with bridge projects jim
y you can in
well no
no
your office but you can't do it
we'll put in large ones but i mean i've got a you know
no
no
no
no
a hundred projects that will disappear in three months
that's right
a and we just let those disappear and UNK
yeah
yes
i i'm not for a minute suggesting that er th that for the small projects that we do that
but most of roger's projects
w would need tha that remit
a and really the remit is nothing other than something like undertake erm er survey work design detailed drawings or the UNK or repairs to blah including pre imposed contract work
end of story
unless we vary and it i we just need to put that in
a and i can get er ken and my clerks to ferret through the old contracts and all the variations that we've had to date and come up with a suggested erm latest remit for the project coordinator to approve
if that's what it wants
i mean er that's a service i'm quite happy to offer
erm so really you tell me which jobs you're gonna send reports out on a and erm that you would like that particular field sorting out and i will get ken and amanda and kerry to er t to get something in there so that when you pull it off erm you're happy with it or we can then edit it
it then g sets the thing right for the next variation as well cos you use that variation er use that er latest remit within the subsequent variations to the appointment contract
i've just looked through my notes o of the meeting
they wanted from us an assurance that we would continue to provide the level of service that we have done in the past
because they were concerned about UNK they'd heard of staff UNK within the c e d g
perhaps we should be a bit more careful about UNK about losing staff to regional railways and
other people
er a and just get on and bite the bullet and do something about it
and get on and that's right
and get work done
but they're UNK them
ridiculous it's their department that's
taking them all
yes
but if we don't
but terry they're the client
there's a fact of life isn't it
the client
well you didn't have to yeah
but we didn't have to what i mean the point is that we didn't have to tell have to tell them they already knew
they knew that ian had taken er or was about to take some and they knew that er
yeah
but you've got you haven't got a problem with
that old brian 's gone
but i as i understand it you haven't got a problem with workload
in UNK i from what i understand is that you've got a problem with shortage of workload
yeah
well i can't stop their perception of the fact that the staff that are disappearing out of the office come from the p t section
yeah
but
you can't stop it but you can influence it
i mean if our if we're going around UNK that a
but we're not
shortage of staff but that was their perception terry
their perception was that we had a desperate shortage of staff
yeah
and we weren't gonna provide them with the level of service that
they got the
they got the feeling that we were on the ropes and i mean if
even if we are we should we should be managing that internally
no
no
what i w what we've done is we've assured them that we will provide the level of service that they've had previously and if need be
we will buy staff in
yeah
agency staff or whatever
yeah
to continue to provide them with that service
yeah
okay
yeah
aye actually you do need
that's an assurance that we've given them
yes
a actually that UNK though hasn't come from us so the comment about UNK was wrong
i'm not bothered about where it comes from
no
but it wasn't but you see it's the fact that ian 's gone
r bob 's gone
brian 's gone
robert 's gone
all within the past about eighteen months and they were all from p t fro from regional railways p t type jobs
tha that's what's happened
fine
they've picked up their own UNK
don't take it UNK
mm
the positive message is that
yeah
we've given them assurance that we will provide the level of service
good
and we need to do it
mm
the second thing is that erm with regard to future pro projects regional railways have UNK that we will only get work through competitive tender
no
regional railways north east investment have UNK that we will only get work
yeah
on competitive tender
okay
i understood it was regional railways
it was those
headquarters who'd UNK that we would only get work by
yeah
i can't see
it's
i
i
right
okay
i i'll check that
can you
with richard then and see
yeah
whether or not we're gonna be in the same situation on erm
on maintenance jobs
yeah
i see this as a positive element because here for once the client's gonna have to sit down and produce a specification
put down remit
and a remit
right
i don't think they've realized
and then we will go into bat on a fixed price and we'll charge him that whatever
and if there's a variation order we will issue a variation order
and we will become
variation
we will become more professional
correct
on those jobs
and it will cost him more money UNK
er that
doesn't matter i it will
be a good exercise for us t to take advantage over this er
i've warned them
yeah
i what i would say cos we will be competing against birmingham and glasgow
right
we retain the work that we've already got with them
okay
and th then we've got a lot of work at the moment which we'll retain
the future projects we're gonna have to obtain UNK
so we're te we're team briefing that as well
yes
yes
are we team briefing it north east or the whole of regional railways
let's say that we have been we've been
stick with north east
advised by the new works manager of regional railways north east that work from him
mm
will be
w will be o only obtained via competitive
we'll have to compete for
tender
now the relevant point about briefing this is a you've mentioned glasgow and birmingham that i already knew about that we're tendering against
but there is was some UNK that it would go UNK as well
right
right
i can't comment on that terry that is not something
well
that UNK
right
okay
but he certainly didn't suggest that
no
a and that's gonna cause him all sorts of admin type er
specification problems
yes
well specification and training i mean what's he gonna do about getting people
p t s
on the track
that that's not my understanding
i don't think that's
at the moment
no
okay
now i think as a management team we need to think about what our strategy our tactics are gonna be with regard to this
erm because if we look at our experiences with UNK if you d w what do we do
do we go in low
no
and then and then try and get money on the
if i was tender if
go in
but
no
but if our fee bids that have been going in so far are there or thereabouts and having monitored reports for quite a while UNK and yes some are under and some are a bit over but in general they're not th they're not that far out
then we've gotta we've gotta continue to tender on that same UNK
we can't buy every job
but a w a word
a word of er caution
here is it's er
a bad scene that it's only gonna be on certain jobs
if i can just quote our experience er on this erm
we i was able to compare our costs for design at UNK just er in the just er south of rug rugby
mhm
birmingham quoted six thousand
we actually did the job for just under five
er that wasn't er on competition though th that was er an intercity job which birmingham said they could do it for that figure
mm
where we've been doing comparable work on er the kings cross project we wer we told by the old project team that we were very much cheaper than birmingham
and better but that was another story
when we actually went to competitive tender which was for a route improvement down near leicester they UNK us
the w we put in what we thought was a completely fair er quotation for what we were doing
bearing in mind we have the more difficult travelling but they UNK us
and my suspicion is they put in a UNK low bid on that particular job
erm we also lost out on permanent way standard drawings against the glasgow office who were desperate for work
mm
they put in th er a cheap price
they got the entire work
they ran out of money and they've had to be UNK since to get the job finished
s so they were
that's why it's precisely
they were
thank you for that
but on that UNK th the leicester job that you l erm
the line
yeah
you'd adopted the same philosophy of pricing that
you ha because you suddenly realized you were
price sensibly
in competitive tender you didn't change your philosophy
yeah
i think you've got to price sensibly
i did not
er w we UNK out the
job how we were going to do it our normal procedure
yeah
yeah
mm
the only thing i didn't have control of w were the rates we're charging
i mean
mm
purely UNK i
mm
could have t have knocked about twenty percent off my rates and still got them even
which incidentally would have been enough to get the job
yeah
er
yeah
but erm beware
it it's a bad scene when it's i if it's universal if they if they're put in bids eventually they'll bankrupt themselves
but when it's selective
and they've got a whole market to go
mm
back on erm
they're in a
my experience is they put in artificially low bids
be because they're owned by regional railways and re i if they lose money regional railways will
but why aren't intercity asking birmingham to tender against us for intercity jobs
don't even think about it
l let it
yeah
we don't want to work hard
th that i've thought about very seriously but terry think about this
what proportion of their work is intercity
compared with what proportion of our work is regional railways
tt i wouldn't know
anyway that looks like the only tribute problem for this financial year isn't it
because next financial
mm
year if we're still within b r we certainly won't
be part of erm
intercity
intercity or regional railways
that's right
so birmingham won't be part of regional railways
i mean we'll be back to the scenario that we were fighting for three years ago
that's right
mm
so that we can perhaps get
well perhaps
some method of
mm
cooperation within
mm
the other
aye
yeah
i
the last thing we want to do is to start UNK on the s a us
fighting them on the
because
mm
we'll
ee
just do what the what the industry outside has done and UNK down into producing lower and lower quality of services
yeah
yeah
hear
and not
yeah
serving anybody
well i've not
we did make we did make this point to keith actually very clearly
yeah
that we w that we are concerned that what will happen is that everybody will start putting silly low
prices in and t a and one of two things will happen
either th the quality of service will go down or he will have all the hassle of er not knowing not knowing what his design
sorting out what he shouldn't be sorting out
costs are gonna be
well i just thi
because he'll be getting UNK with claims all the time
yeah
yeah
so they're difficult times
i think our strategy should be that we UNK our prices down to the absolute minimum that we think we can do the work for take a little bit more off that and hope to get some money back on variations
because if you don't get a job you don't even have the chance of doing the work
mm
i don't mm i i'm not too happy with that
yeah
well
philosophy
well
well i'm not happy with it
th that
but i just think it's a matter of
i'll go along with that UNK er hugh provided that we
forty five percent of our work is taking a bit off when we don't money gonna make any
money
perhaps i it'll encourage us to look for a shorter route through to the solution
but th the problem is all the UNK are g gonna reduce the quality of service we give to the client
like at the moment if there's anything goes wrong with possessions it really ought to be the project manager sorting it out
yes
exactly
quite
but we don't do that
we sort that out for him
well
well
perhaps we shouldn't
it shouldn't
yeah
yeah but that
perhaps that'll fall
right
to
right
but you see the point i'm getting at
it's the same with UNK as well
if there's a problem with UNK we do it and we
for him we also
mm
look after all his safety issues
the problem is if it it's alright to out price and then reducing your service but that soon switches the client off
yes it does
i'll go along
but terry one
a and that's just as dangerous
once he's
as UNK it
once he starts to
isn't it
if he starts getting go on
once he starts to specify in a contract document what we are pricing for then we've got an immediate okay we've done this for you and this is
yeah
we've done this on a
time rate and it's extra
but the UNK are bad
but please pay us
the UNK are bad
no because
it would be
because a all consultants are gonna do that
the UNK are bad
who sorted out the problems with all the possessions and supervision for leeds north west
yeah
me and roger
not the bloody project manager
terry the UNK are wrong
all the way round
yeah
whatever we do it is
a risky situation
well i
yeah
yeah
let us
i'm happy to UNK the job down hugh but i'm not happy
to start taking money off
no
there's a big difference between us and consultants isn't there
because if you
yeah
yeah
were outside and you were running jobs really tight UNK
yeah
would go out of the window staff would be working what hours whatever hours were necessary to
get it inside
the job
yeah
not only that staff
be silly expense claims and all this
staff salaries staff salaries wou let's be fair
outside
go out the window
staff salaries have gone down over the last eighteen months
too
i was speaking to a lad who left my office
to go to a consultant
and he's been there now about three years and they're just surviving and he's says i'm earning roughly what i was here but i'm working literally twice the hours
and he says and if i don't i don't have a job
that's the reality of the situation
correct
and i think we've
he has to get the job done for a price
we've got to be very careful we're not tying our hands behind our backs
no
we can't play that game
yes we can
b but terry let us look at the
oh yes we can
other thing
if we don't
we haven't decided that
if we don't work on the strategy that i've been suggesting
putting it on the table if you don't do that i can guarantee that bill is gonna play silly buggers
that i am certain of and bill is gonna put in silly prices
but it won't do any good though will it
but it won't do us any good either cos we won't have any work to do
it depends who gets in first doesn't it
really
what do you mean
what
mm
what do you mean by get in first
well in first
is getting the bloody job
well no
if we have a if we have a
there's no w what are you
let's
done in that way to
yeah
start with and let him
but you've already said forty five percent of our business
is with
is with regional railways if we're
i know
gonna take forty five percent of our business at less than the cost to do the job that don't make good business sense
no
no
no
what we're saying is that we're gonna have we we're gonna put a bid in
put a bid in at a certain price
and then we're gonna we're gonna work down
we're gonna w
to that price
or
or recover it
or recover it
or recover it
by identifying gaps in their documentation in the same way as
but then you get back to what terry said about bloody york
you'll really switch off him
you know
they look for everything
yeah
right
erm
roger
yeah
you don't get the work
you don't get the work but then you
but what do you want
no
but you
you don't need to work for anything do you
want the hassle of getting the money
no
or do you
no
i think that
o or that i would want the hassle and not get the work
i think i think what we ought to do is we ought to point out
these problems at a
oh we've covered that
we've covered that
we've pointed that out to keith
it's i mean what you've gotta be is realistic
UNK
a and realize that k keith it's not UNK decision
it's not in UNK
if keith had the decision to make he would continue working with us
there's no doubt about it
it's outside of keith i think it's outside of david
and i believe it's with richard
yeah
well
going to miss us a great opportunity to learn how to do it right
it's a great opportunity
yeah
it is
it's an opportunity we're gonna have now which in two years time
yeah
but don't
we will not have
can we just put it
because
absolutely
put it in perspective though
but don't knock any money off
all i say is if we're gonna UNK it down let's UNK it down before we start the job and put in the price it will cost
right
can i can i can i can i re
including knocking off photographs if they say they're gonna want photographs
right
correct
so they don't get them
so they don't get them
don't the cost
no
you see what this i'll tell you what this says
the staff costs it's the staff costs you've got to control
yes
if the staff can't to
do it at within the cost outside
mm
then staff simply work for nothing
it's as simple as that
they have to work for nothing to get the job done
yeah
mm
that's a reality and i don't see why this office should not consider the fact that they may have to get involved in that
we may very well
well
have to do that
but until he shows national agreements to them you'll never get that agreed will
well some of them
are not national agreements
what erm makes you think
they are and you can't
bill
people work overtime and they get paid for it
by what he's done so far in
full stop
more payment
yeah
right
bill has
standard conditions
bill has worked very hard to preserve UNK position
mm
in terms of i mean bill was the one who drafted up the
th the rules of er distribution of work between
mhm
organizations
it was his idea
he got it written er if you remember the rules of the game are that all regional railways work will go to a regional railways office and they will decide if it goes out
if it goes out
yeah
yeah
UNK for intercity erm UNK i've played a very low profile game on this
and if you like ignored those because we had more to lose
yeah
but that's the only reason why
if i'd been in bill's position i or if we'd had been in bill's position we'd have done the same as well
and said bloody hell
glasgow are doing all this intercity work
if they were
we should be doing that
so erm t they're fighting to survive we're fighting to survive
and they're not gonna they're not gonna behave as er real gentlemen roger
i can promise you
they're gon gonna be interested in that
oh n no
work
you can commit suicide as well if you're daft can't you
yeah
erm
j just to put it in perspective
you know
erm hugh said that er it doesn't apply to jobs that we've already got
and
at the moment we've got ninety five percent of jobs that keith knows about
a b we've got that's right
mm
keith doesn't know many jobs that we don't
that's
know about a and therefore it's only things that start to creep in this year
so th the chances are we might only be looking
on investment jobs a at a handful of projects that we might need to start UNK
mm
tendering them
and jim's point about you know UNK using this as an opportunity to er s
er spot on
t to get it is just right because i in twelve months time we might have to tender for every job
and it doesn't matter whether we give him bad UNK
if that's the marketplace that we're in then we we've got two choices
right
either w we start to er
yeah
learn the street credibility that you need to er
we have no option but t to learn it
we've gotta
to survive o or y you
become UNK and we've gotta become UNK
mm
bloody quickly
or you move into UNK
o or something else
or you retire
that's right
i mean
there aren't many other
i if you can't stand the heat you get out the kitchen
and if that's what we what it is then we have to do it
but er i don't want get out the kitchen i want to keep cooking boys
y you you're i i'm mm
yeah
the problem
is what you're raising a lot more issues here the UNK is unbelievable
and we're gonna finish them at scarborough aren't we
they ain't gonna go away
the UNK is unbelievable
we are
like
we're talking round it now hugh
like you know
yes
you can take all the graduates away
i don't want any
no
mm
yeah
oh yeah
i don't
if you want if we do what i to do
i'll tell you what
it's the reality of the
it's the reality of the world you don't want any
my office
you don't want anybody
right
who's learning
roger what's your biggest problem at the moment
you know
staff
right
mm
get rid of the graduates
what's your problem tomorrow
then the year after
the year after that
the year after that
not necessarily
no
cos
get qualified staff who would actually be able
yeah
to produce
i hear what you're saying
yeah
no
if we're
gonna take serious action
that's the problem
and get to grips with the real world then th er as well as what jim said about the fact that we pay staff UNK time and we pay them overtime and
mm
and we let them allow them to do UNK
yeah
we've got to look very UNK seriously about the productivity of the work that's UNK out
and many of our jobs
yeah
are UNK out poorly and take extra time
yeah
because we take on t very junior staff t os and we have a
hear
commitment to sending them to college so we lose one day a week for a start
yeah
erm we have the graduates who we're training up and they're not very good and drop us in the UNK sometimes
and they've got a vast learning queue
we don't UNK people who are graduates and say you work in the works office or the bridge office
we say well pick up a bit of experience here
and a bit of experience
there
yes
and that costs us money
problem
quite right
yeah i mean
i was amazed when i wrote to you and suggested that er we didn't need thirteen weeks in bridge assessment perhaps
perhaps less than that
you came back and said you wanted them to have thirteen weeks
thirteen weeks when we're paying their bloody salaries and
they're earning nothing for us and really
consultant wouldn't bother with that
a consultant wouldn't send them
certainly wouldn't
on an area for
six months and pay their salary
he wouldn't send them
yeah and to be fair
it's this trying to have our foot in every camp and trying
we're actually paying we're actually having to pay overtime
yeah
mm
when they're doing site supervision work on areas
the problem is we don't know what type of animal we are
no
that's the problem
yeah
at the moment
we're a UNK
change again in april
we are
an absolute
to be fair if we if we were on our own we i would agree with you we would not be doing that
no
we couldn't afford to
no
we couldn't
you can UNK jobs providing staff are r a you know all pulling hundred and twenty five
percent of the time
mm
but you can't if they're not
we're UNK again
you've gotta you've gotta be UNK
am i am i not right in saying
that's right
that all new graduates
no
no
you're bloody not
all the graduates go on our books
we get a consideration from the business unit for some of the graduates that they have selected for us
so you're gonna put other people on the th that have not been brought through
through
central selection we will end up having to
yeah
yeah
to pay their
or we just get UNK you're charging
that if you've got a an h q graduate if you call him that on a job he's still charged that job
mm
oh yes
i mean it's just that the
s a u profits go up a bit because you get a credit from er
that's right
yeah
but the job doesn't UNK that job doesn't benefit
b but you know we do a lot of things
no that job doesn't benefit so it if he's
we do a lot of things don't get paid
yes
still
you keep sending me comments er things like will you pass comments on this standard platform design
yes
got sod all to do with me as a s a u
fair comment
i went yesterday to tell everybody about access requirements and spent all day
and you get nothing for it
plus expenses and we get nothing for it
the only thing you do get and this is what the consultant
we build up expertise
but
no
no
you make contacts
oh yeah
yeah
you make contacts you impress people
that's right
on your expertise
and that's a market
or not
or not
or not
yeah
the op no but the opportunity is there
for you
it is
to impress people
it is
let them know what expertise you have and there's when they have a problem they come is that the one by mr
yeah
it's lovely
it's very good
mm
and roger
mm
you read that
what it says about training and graduate training and so on
yeah
he doesn't do it
no
it does UNK
th that message is entirely opposite from what you would
but you see
ah
yeah
yeah
i know but you see
we UNK
we do
mm
UNK but i think i it's important that i i'm beginning to wonder now what our real stance is
cos we've gone through a whole sort of full circle about taking a stance that's very aggressive in terms of saying if we i if we tender for something we're gonna hit the client with v os and this that and the other
and yet in the past
not really
if i'd had said i wanna i wanna claim this from client you would have said come on that's a bad marketing exercise
back off
yes
do it for free
now we
can't have both
you can't have your cake and eat it
you can't
you couldn't
but terry what you've gotta UNK
so which are we which are we going for
what you've gotta recognize well you may go for both
what you've gotta recognize is that the circumstances have changed
yeah
well i i'm aware of that
we
mm
we started off m o or part of this conversation trevor and i said keith wants to continue working with us
yeah
how do we make sure of that
right
is what we
our clients
but
the clients who deal with us like the way we work
yeah
yeah
right
but
that is because of the way we've behaved over the last two years
yeah
now circumstance
UNK that
the UNK that's right
mm
but let's take the take the
finance bit
you said w we UNK things down to a minimum price
yeah
and then if they come along and change anything we hit we hit them for the extras
not in an aggressive way
right
but i'm talking i
in a professional way
but when i spoke about safety and getting the money back from the safety training that they now want that they didn't want in the first place you said no we should do that
that's right
in house
well it
yeah
seems to me you've got you you've got er two different approaches there completely
yes
i have
one's saying we do it for free and another one's saying it is UNK
a and i
i'm not really quite sure what we're trying to a get
well
i think we need to d we need to discuss that at scarborough possibly
yeah
UNK the place for it
i mean our ob my objective is quite
yeah
straightforward and that is to stay in business
but mine's jus
it's about it's about
mine isn't just that
mine's to actually
make some sort of profit
w we we've UNK now onto
all the issues that we'll
yeah
be talking at scarborough in a non structured
way without jane's help
i honestly believe that we should back off and get on
right
with the
back off
next thing is safety training for project engineers was covered and we've discussed that previously
safety UNK of contractors was another item th that they give you a briefing of the meeting
sorry
right
beg your pardon
right
okay
they raised the question of safety UNK of contractors erm but i don't think there's anything that we need to involve ourselves
in that
we talked about
terms and conditions of engagement and as i said previously they are looking for us to provide them with UNK of expenditure of fees and UNK looking into that
just before you go over there was one point on the safety of contractors
regional railways have requested that they see copies of our UNK performance reports
ones we do internally
right
perhaps we should send them to the client on all
yeah
er all clients on all jobs
if we do them
yeah
perhaps the clients should vet them himself
i don't see how he can
again UNK regulations once again here
i know i keep UNK on it but the con
what is this UNK
the UNK regulations actually say the client must ensure that he UNK a safety conscious contractor
a and he can delegate that
responsibility t to us
gentlemen what are we
what are we in business for
we're in business to
provide the client
provide these people with a service
yeah
yeah
that's what i see i mean
he's doing that by employing us
all the
if the better service and more comprehensive service we can provide th the better chance we have of getting repeat orders
okay
but the more it costs us
and the more it costs us
yeah
and therefore the less
and meanwhile
competitive we become
not necessarily
w n no
but these
i don't think it's as simple as that terry i think
it isn't as simple as that
you're quite right
you have to you have to be able to bend and UNK as the organization
mm
move on
requires
UNK we've talked about
and that's it
good
but i thought it was a very useful meeting with er with keith
it UNK up certain erm items for concern better that we know than not know them
management procedures project coordinator
i'd like this is one i think that jim raised
there's a letter from jim
i would like with your agreement jim t to take that off the agenda and for you dennis and i to discuss that out of this meeting
yeah
i've got a time in your diary for that
good
and then if need be we'll raise it at the next meeting
right
okay
i think there's value in us talking about it quietly
yes
can i substitute one in there very briefly
sure
er it is another procedure o or set of procedures
i'm having a devil of a job with the correspondence system that the management procedures demand
being that management procedures are supposed to be best practice
mhm
i would put it on record that b e s has never managed this correspondence system in the way that the management procedures now dictate
if you look through it if my adding up is correct it requires us to keep something in the order of sixteen separate files on one project
bloody hell
it's a lot
if you look if you look through it i think you'll get
yeah
it's a lot
sixteen separate files on one project
ridiculous
mm
and quite frankly we talk about being competitive and what have you
it's a UNK
my clerk just cannot keep control of this
and the engineers are saying this is absolutely ludicrous
for the vast majority of our schemes which are very small
why can't we just have them in a loose leaf binder with UNK in and let the engineer decide how to hold documentation together
now i can tell you that UNK are b s five seven five o UNK
they have a filing system and the procedure for it which is about two pages is highly efficient and the engineers think it's the best thing since UNK bread
and i have
that i've been down to see it
mm
plus everything's in one file just divided
ours
mm
to be honest
you can never find what you want
wrong file
i asked i asked my clerk t to get me file something and he says
which one
which bit do you want
i know that's
mm
what i keep getting
i said just give me the file on it
which bit
the green folder
the red one
the pink one
yellow one
oh i said
blue one
i can't do with all this
mm
right
now i raised that because i think it is a very serious threat to our efficiency in project engineering
jim y you know the philosophy
if we can improve let's UNK let's home in on it and let's improve it
well perhaps it's worthy of discussion with dennis when we're talking about project
what project at the same meeting
UNK
yes
i support that a hundred percent
good
thanks jim
right
that was it
any other business
could i raise two items of any other business
one is the visit from the i the irish railways
certainly made a profit for intercity out of it with
we don't want to mention it on here
do we
mm
well UNK freight haven't got any facilities to fill depots
have they
no
they buy in
so why
so why shouldn't they
its batteries have fallen out UNK
its batteries
no
those are spare batteries
oh right
it's still going
what are you talking about
i've just started it again
it was finished in the middle
oh well
of the tape
well i don't care
mm
right
that is it from me
are we on to any other business
that was my they were my any other businesses
oh right
finance nice report you want there
well i thought we were going to any other business first
mm
oh
i thought we were running out of time
well
yeah
we are
why was monday cancelled
the dinner
oh
oh
because david was ill
because david is ill
oh
sorry about that
i forgot to
didn't you tell them
no
we were just told it was cancelled
i told amanda
oh miss
why
i think said she didn't know
tt
right
well you know what women are like
now you know
okay
probably
right
i've got two or three small items under any other business if
well yes
right
er delegated authorities
got UNK delegated authorities
are you happy for the whole of your group to
yes
i am indeed
open this on trust
erm
open this on trust
let it be
is this the right
can i have a copy
i is this the right way to UNK this information
yeah
why not
within the procedure
ah
well every time i send something out writes to me on bloody dopacs saying this is not the way to UNK this information
always have a
document
yes
he should
right
oh
good
anyway
we won't read through now
i don't think we need to go through it
i think if there are any
no
it doesn't ev i mean the one main item is th that shocked us all is that is only chris can approve the use of consultants in any shape or form
more fool that
excluding i now understand training
technical
consultants
i didn't think it applied to technical consultants
oh yes
is it
so if we're going to employ a consultant
yes
t er to do a check on a bridge
yes
yes
chris
it has to go to chris
yeah
absolutely
even
yeah
even though you put that on your form a and the board have signed it
but chris doesn't see the form a
no
the board do
he's the managing director of it
is he
well l that's what it says and really it should
only be erm a rubber UNK exercise
i mean i cannot believe that the guy
sorry
wants to sort of maintain that sort of level on
mm
all UNK all expenditure
anyway
so that's that one
anyway just summarize that would you
chris is the only person who can approve what
it's the use of consultants
er the use of consultants
excluding for training purposes
now what if it's re we're doing a job for regional railways
you need to
can we say to regional railways you know
ah
w we will kn with a bit of luck UNK of consultants we will get the we will make a recommendation to the to the client that these consultants are engaged on his behalf
right
and we will UNK payments to these consultants when they've done the work
but the actual letter appointing the consultant and the actual payment of the fee will be just like any other contractor
and we can do it that way
that's the sensible way to do it
so
it's only really intercity jobs that need go to chris
er yes
providing that the providing that the client's agent is
prepared to stand up
yeah
and own the job
yeah
yeah
yes
we don't have
we just treat them like a con a another contractor
right
erm i will look through that and i will see if there's anything within those delegated authorities that i can actually delegate downwards to your good UNK
would you note on the front sheet
the date
th that i have UNK the date that i received it
mm
and i have put a question er a ring and a question mark
round the fact that i hope that the auditor isn't gonna try and UNK pretend that we had that for all last year
mm
cos the
mm
auditor is due to come in actually very soon
absolutely
so i mean i i've UNK that in a very positive way so that it's er
good
thank you for that UNK
you know
yeah
right
it is my intention to have a look through that and see if i can delegate any of those down to your good UNK
right
okay
it's in that stuff they
erm
tied up in those blue books
yes
can i claim my
control
my UNK allowance please
UNK
UNK
from today we are
w better equipped to get out onto b UNK mainframe computer systems a and the problems that we've had in the past with regards to UNK ha should disappear
if it's decided any of us or all of us o or our reports are gonna use UNK can you let me know
and we will set up UNK for you as individuals
what so we're leaving it to people to decide whether they want to use it
no
no
no
no
no
no
saying
i'm saying erm if i give you all a UNK number immediately and then you never actually log in to your computers to see whether or not you've got any mail that's arrived then there's absolutely no point in doing that is there
but if you don't give them a UNK you won't encourage other people to send them mail
i quite agree
thereby UNK people to use the
but i if our clients say oh i want to send roger something so what's his UNK number
UNK it in and sends it off erm a and UNK never logs in as himself
he'll never get his mail
he'll never know th that one of his clients has sent him something
so if roger's
letters on a morning you don't know what's inside
that's right
so it's a it's a it's a point of principle
are we gonna be are we gonna use electronic mail
i think there should be focal points
yeah
yeah
yeah your clients
you see in fact
mm
er yeah this is the beauty of a fax you know whether you're there or not it gets to you
yeah
and somebody deals with it if you're not there
but UNK and you can only access it yourself
mm
i can't see
much more flexible than that
much more flexible than that
yeah
i mean the beautiful thing about UNK is y you can get a message up you can immediately copy it to three other people or thirty other people if you wish erm and you can reply to it instantly without having to you know y you just type a message in and press the button and it's gone
it's replied
it's very efficient
oh i used it
yes
it is
for years
very
yeah
very efficient system
but you've got to actually have a wish
needs to be
to use it you see
the only reason most people don't use it is cos they don't like to get on a keyboard of a computer
that's the one thing that stops them using it
it's very efficient
well i have no comment i mean i just don't UNK i don't know enough about it to even to be
right
w
able to comment on how it should be operated
would we like a teach would we like er
a teaching arranging for this meeting
i think it's absolutely
essential that
mhm
the staff are advised what this
right
facility provides them with
right
cos it's used nationally all our
okay
clients are UNK into it and we should be able to communicate with them at the press of a button
absolutely
right
let let's have let's have a
yes please
yes
at the next meeting a twenty minutes yes
client reports and things like that you know you i mean it's
oh yes
we can send them we can s we can send any file we want via UNK
we could we could send all
the UNK reports via UNK once the project coordinator has agreed that he's happy with what's on there
good
right
agreed
we'll be briefed at the next meeting
isn't it a brave new world
sorry
erm overtime
i've had er an informal erm er package through from paul er just UNK two of erm our staff on the recent erm thirteen week management overtime erm
i bet i can guess the names
guess one
have a guess
yes
yeah
oh what a hero he is
well mis
who
UNK has shoved
eric
has shoved mr into second place
in thirteen weeks UNK has earned seven thousand one hundred pounds worth of overtime
eh
how does he do
w what he do
well i mean even mr in his UNK has never quite
right
now
come on
achieved that
yeah
so what have we got to do about it
th well i it's not it's not whether or not
is it justified
i it gotta be justified because roger and terry have signed it all off
i mean i can understand that
in f in fact
i know i know what terry's problems have been over the past
yeah
but the point
ten weeks
the point that's that er paul's making is
but we need to get a grip on it
he says in the case of ian the number of occasions where ian has worked two hours on a friday morning and then he's worked friday saturday as overtime
and UNK has been paid to stay at home on friday
probably
and then he's worked friday saturday
er
oh
yeah
yeah
just say that again
UNK has what
he's been paid to stay at home on a friday
rest day
yeah
rest day
yeah
and then he's worked friday saturday as overtime
yeah
to keep within the rules
yeah
yeah
yeah
i right
he then says if there's a continuous UNK er commitment for weekend working should we apply the er extra weekend duty payment rather than excess overtime
question mark
yeah
that is a good question for ian actually
and for our for our r e set up
our proposed r e set up
i mean we shouldn't be looking at
now we should be looking forward at our new organization
yes
and we are
yeah
and tha
that's all this is
yeah
i think that's a very good idea
just a are we happy to see massive it's surprising once people are on e d p one weekend in three or whatever or equivalent their overtime a and their you know they actually
yeah
decide whether or not they really need to be on that site for fourteen hours or can they do what they need to do in four
aye but working every weekend can i w i if it is every weekend is a lot of money on e d p
is it
mhm
oh yes
i it's about
one weekend in UNK about seven percent isn't it
yeah
so if it's every weekend it'll be about twenty
every weekend it's about twenty percent
odd percent
it's a lot of money
mind you not everybody has to work every weekend do they
yeah
ian does
no he does UNK
h he won't when he's working for terry
no
it is fair to s it is fa
really
more every day
it is fair to say that in the case of er in the case of UNK erm because of the special circumstances where we didn't actually use a clerk of works ever on that job
yeah
terry i know the situation
so we UNK it but wi but we but having said that we've gone to UNK
and we've set off almost on the same rules
and my that act those forms stayed on my desk for maybe two weeks whilst i were plotting and thinking what the hell i could do about
mm
changing
but of course you can't it's after the event
the record
yeah
but
y you don't do any overtime
until somebody's signed it off and authorized it
well it's all it's all signed off and authorized
ah
but on UNK we have decided and i've told john or he's been informed that because we've got a supervisor there i don't want him starting at six in the morning
good
he'll finish at six
at night
brilliant
he's gonna work a standard day
so it does need managing you're quite right and i'm i was UNK at how many hours were on
right
right
well
th the decision you were putting to us though trevor was whether we put somebody on extra duty payment
that was just a an option that paul had suggested might
from york
avoid some of these large amounts of overtime
yeah
it's up to terry and UNK are to decide how he's got to safely man the job
well terry terry's got more
experience of this than anybody else around this table
and it'll be terry's responsibility in future
so
so really that's
wh what do you feel about e d p
is the question
i'd have to talk about wi i could talk to roger about it and see what
yeah
er the scenario is
as far as one off
terry you can't go rushing back till we've got the new
yeah
erm the new r e outside parties
set up
leg set up
and then
think about when we
but really we i mean we shouldn't be running up massive bills like this
we shouldn't
cos that sort of overtime i th this
you've gotta be
w if it's on weekends there is virtually no contribution towards the overheads at all
okay
but if
from any of that
if ian isn't
what you've also gotta
doing it somebody else will have
yeah
to
what you've also to bear in mind is
you know erm
if that's the case roger that's fine
that's right
provided that it
if it's genuine overtime i mean there is
well
erm
don't worry we go through UNK bloody time tha that time sheet was a week being gone through being checked
mm
yeah
because the UNK
right
i got a dopacs report saying he'd worked thirteen shifts out of fourteen
it turned out not be right er because he was
yeah
booking it in as book twice stage you see
and that dopacs for some reason was er
UNK that up
as a work day
right
mm
i think the only danger of looking at e d p is that if we're doing for the guys in the office then what do we do with the supervisors
yeah
our supervisors
it may be that they should be cos they are the ones that work more weekends than anybody
yeah
w
we've just highlighted two technical
staff there but what if we included supervisors
what would the picture
mm
be
ah yeah
you know our work
but
is at weekends isn't it
i agree
i don
i think the only action that comes out of that is
yeah
that terry and
needs controlling
have a look at that and
keep it within
we do control it but it is
there isn't an alternative to the supervisors
there isn't an e d p equivalent unless you start
mm
making supervisors
management staff
a different grade
management staff
that's right
okay
anyway
so i'm gonna leave it to between
shall i just throw these away then or do you want them to have a second look at or yeah i'll bin them
right
simon
that's that
i'll leave it between roger
er
and terry to sort
right
th the good housekeeping i is the only other
consultation
thing
consultation date has been picked for three weeks on tuesday
and that'll be just as powerful a tool as the scarborough conference
right
cos that's what's UNK people off
we've been mentioning this good housekeeping
yes
yes
yes
yes
what's the date
it's the tuesday we
get back from
put it in your diary down
erm scarborough
tuesday after
yes
that one's team brief in
twenty fifth of may
yeah
twenty fifth
yeah
er the document will be with the staff reps and i will circulate yourselves and your staff erm by the end of the next week
hopefully i'll get you an early copy not with the j UNK and everything but certainly with the left hand side and the right hand side of the document and the final version of the document with charts
what date was it
erm
twenty fifth of may
mid next week and then give you a day or so to look at it
and i will be sending it out by next friday
so the staff reps will have it for at least a fortnight
good
okay
the job descriptions have all finally been UNK
and as he's quality only run on perhaps another nine months or a year or whatever and then revert to the same job description as john
john
so perhaps
you would like to break that to dennis
before it becomes common knowledge on the documentation
who who's representing management at this consultation
the management staff reps
which are
no
the management
team
oh
there's er trevor and i
right
unless you wish to
no
i just
i mean most of it
wanna know what involvement there was
yeah
m most of it is just UNK what we're doing and UNK the changes in the establishment
yeah
that was brought about by er
the early retirement
th there'll be a personnel
how is it
person there to take minutes
oh yes
ho
the figures that went forward for UNK job presumably the same as last time
no
because if you remember
last time dennis had three UNK working for him and he's got the equivalent of two now
oh right
yeah
right
okay
and the quality team was an m s two and an m s one and it's now only an
and it's now yeah
m s two
fine
so there's been UNK
terry i've
good
i've already UNK i've already told dennis quietly
yeah
right
okay
and there's no problem
there's no problems as far as he's concerned
i mean i it'll be a if dennis was serious about wanting to go he'll be er he'll be able to say look i'm redundant
yeah
i'm UNK
yeah
buggers us up promotion wise in future again but
well i it was never on that
he was gonna keep the quality leg after he'd gone
no
well once he'd lost that he would have lost the
no
no
yeah
grade anyhow
like the other people lost the grade
so er that really means that i
a all being well we've sorted that
what i would like to try and get UNK agreement to if a if at all possible is that we don't do this nonsense of having to close list our staff to jobs that we know we're gonna put them into
i would like to try and sort that out on the day apart from the
that's UNK
i think there's only one post and it's in jim's office where there are too many m s twos existing for the future m s two posts that we've got on the document
apart from that scenario where those people will have to apply for their jobs and the t os across the board
mm
where roger's getting rid of more t o posts than we've actually got sitting
right
tenants in them
i think that the rest of the situation should be more or less a straight across thing and i'm gonna see if we can get paul
just slot them in
well
a and not have to posts
well we can identify the p m t posts anyway so there'll be
right
no problem there
it's the management staff
yeah
posts
we would want to put the people across into what er are actually their existing jobs
i would go along with that
er that is not as simple as you say though
no
trevor
no
i have colin as an m s three
of course y but he is an m s three
so what
and under the close listing jobs roger
he'll be at m s three
he will be at an m s three
m s three
and he will be post
he will be close listed into an m s three post
but we said ah
but there is not he cannot occupy an m s three design post with
roger
the new
he's doing it now
he's carrying he is in the post at the moment
do with outside parties
no
no
he isn't
he isn't
he is doing a job in your office as an assistant section engineer at the moment
dealing with outside party work
no
no
no
no
he's
well that's what he's doing cos that's all he can do
his job description his job description
right
his job description is the same as everybody else's
if at the
well let's not play on words
well okay then
no
no
if at the end of the day once we have gone through the UNK the good UNK keeping exercise and he has been put into an m s three post that you think he is not capable of then you've got two options
you have got to train that person which you could have been doing for years and
for years
haven't
you
now come off it
come off
i think roger's roger has we might not like it but roger may well have a point cos he doesn't ha
yeah i
he doesn't have to put colin in an m s three just because you've got a vacancy
hang on
i'm c look let me just give him the two options
the two options are one you train somebody so
that you give them additional training so they
yeah
can do the job
or two you take the
erm the managerial action which is available for you t to take him out of there and put him into a different post because he's not capable of doing
or the yes
a managerial action could be that he transfers with the outside party services
you can't cos
you can't because they haven't got another job
there isn't a job in there
there is no three in there
there is no three in there
there is no three in there
no but there you have you'll have three vacancies won't you
no
you've no m s three
as what
vacancies
i mean what you're basically saying
as what
is that i don't want him so
you've got two m s sh
so i'll hand over to
no
i'm saying he might be more
with the r e the r e
doing that job
set up
mm
the r e set up
it is a problem
you're gonna have to put ian
it's a big problem
you're gonna have to put
but i
ian in one of those two jobs
one of those three jobs aren't you
the r e set up
the r e set up
the r UNK outside
am i
party job
yeah
and then you're gonna be faced with two people at the moment erm that do the running around on the outside party
nick and steve
yeah
i think what we
but i'm not
i think the process we should go through is a
you wanna be careful there because i'm not UNK i'm not necessarily taking those
mm
the process we will go through
well that
we will slot we'll
yeah
that will
slot people in and we've we i mean i if we look at the colin situation
colin is currently UNK an m s three job within your office
and within the rules of the game we can do nothing other than
put him into that
put him into that post
now UNK what you say UNK if you consider he can't do that work then as the next phase what we're gonna have to do you and i is to see what action we can take
me with an overview of the organization to see if there is anywhere else we can put him and off the top i can't think of anywhere
erm but then we w we need to start thinking about how we get the best out of colin
cos that's what it's all about isn't it
well we've been trying to think how we could get the best out of colin for the past four bloody years
remember colin was put into that job er because he was UNK he didn't want to go into the job
erm we know where there is a very good place
absolutely
that colin could go and do a good job
send him there
and he would maybe be a damn sight happier than he will be if he stays behind
yeah
and it's still an intercity
have done
post
what did he say
spoken to him
what did he say
tt
he said they'd been through the a the er interview process and they've chosen who they want
but it's still at your if it was going to another sector i could understand that attitude but when it is being it's still within intercity i just cannot understand that is the attitude we take
terry er sorry roger if i were interviewing for posts i would appoint and you know full well i would the people that i thought were best for that job
and i would make that judgement and i would appoint it
that is precisely what kim and kevin have done
i have tried to er persuade him that colin would be good for that job
end of story as i see it
mm
and he is now our responsibility and we're gonna have to er determine what the right management action is
he's a chartered engineer
i mean he's no UNK he's er
and he will be carrying out the UNK
he will be carrying out the duties
well
not of a UNK leader roger but
of a project senior project engineer
senior project engineer
yeah
well y
which means he might have to do some design
yes
yeah
yes
and wh why not
we send him on a b s five four double o course
that's right
we can train him and
and i personally believe that i personally believe that colin has got ability if we exploit it
it's very easy to say that
yes
it is
and we have tried and tried but you cannot light the UNK
can i suggest we er
perhaps he might he better off in the works office
yeah well he comes to work
from nine till five
i suggest you turn the tape recorder off
and that's it
ca can we move on
terry
because w we're actually stuck on one person
yeah
yeah
we are
we're getting
the principle i would like to put forward is that if we are gonna place
is that trevor on behalf of you comes round and talks to each of us to make sure that what yo what you're gonna propose
yeah
fits with our feelings
splendid idea
yeah
i mean we we're gonna have to we're gonna have to be very careful
with the m s twos anyway because of these two twos down in the
mm
works office
perhaps
well yeah
no good thinking he's sending
of in fact
no
i i'm sure that the twos we're gonna have to close list
i think you will
anyway
erm
talk it through with us
okay
we can make an assumption that we're gonna get the consultation through as we've
as we've intended
and the others
yeah
if there are any changes they will be very marginal
i mean there will
right
be on grades for a start because
our jobs UNK
mm
and i'm not sure where any changes would be
well you've got some flexibility on the
well let's go through the philosophy
p and t grades but that's all
yeah
you can you can you can shadow list or whatever it's called
but that's about all
so we can make an assumption and i think we should do that before twenty fifth of may
yeah
we should go through a process o of this group of UNK in accordance with the rules and get that
yeah
UNK done so we have a UNK there that we can deal with on the twenty fifth
right
when we've got the left and right hand side of the document which UNK well on with at the moment we can pencil in very lightly the jobs
pencil yeah
that we see going straight across
we'll agree them with you and then we'll
yeah
use that as a UNK
right
i'll come round each of you and do that
okay
good
cos yours is gonna be complicated
right
any more any other businesses
because i would like deal with the erm
erm i've i have a question
is i thought we were
okay
doing erm for some unknown reason
rule reviewing
oh
that's this afternoon
not on the agenda
not on the
well i had to do that agenda when hugh wasn't here so
i'll go and get andrew and i'll just check with steve that erm
he's gonna rule review us
he is rule reviewing
good
us this afternoon
but i've already been done so
any other business
good
thanks
that was quite a useful move
the main thing is that th the financial commentary
what i would like to do with the UNK financial commentary is because it is an historic document i would like to pull out a few UNK which we can team brief
and
what about us finding out what the is like
it is
we're only doing it for and
may well be
we'll put half a mind on it
i i'm yeah
i haven't seen it
alright
haven't you seen it
until just now
passed down
yes
this morning
er bu late last night
i mean
i think we sho we could have done with some time to look at it really
unless andrew's dropped some enormous UNK i can't see that the UNK that i've picked out should be
we
all that significant
i ca sorry
i can see something in here you've got
that UNK me having spoken to andrew about it
er and that's that he's pulled out here the income generated by various departments
and for once thank goodness he's split works and bridges by taking the
yeah
supervision out which is what i asked him to do
but what i did say and he said he could do it was to divide up to compare us that he could divide up the profitability and i'm not sure that you know i in terms of
how many staff did UNK have
how many staff did i have
and what does that UNK to
in terms of income
cos that's the relevant part is how much each individual is erm
it's got a profitability on page three
page three
let me have a look
as i say i've only just started
mm
UNK through it
erm there's the profit and loss
return i don't quite UNK can somebody tell me what each UNK i mean basically i would have expected to see the money earned divided by the number of staff telling me how much
right
you're talking about contribution to the fee earning then
rather than
yes
that's been dropped
so what did
what's number three of profitability mean
number three
you've got a return on expenditure for your function of eight point nine percent
in other words tha that is
your profit
eight point nine percent and that's er that's
no
that's my contribution towards the total of the group isn't it
no
it's a return on expenditure
if your
if i've read it right
if your overall costs which are on the sheet before that terry
right
i'm with you
yeah
are one million and ninety nine pounds it costs to run your organization
divided by the staff
ah
so that is it then
alright
that's it
good
so he's got it there and then what he's done then is he's deducted the non fee earning element of the organization
pro UNK that through the
mm
functions and come up with a revised profit and loss
okay
i don't see how the supervisor can make a loss
do you
yeah
well it's UNK organization isn't it that's being
i'm non long time you know
charged off against each other 's
but all their time's UNK
that time
all their time's UNK for
no
no
no
they they'll have to take a share
well don't ask me
of the overheads
yeah
they charge to overheads if they weren't doing a job
but they don't co could be roger
yeah
but or you have the tendency
it could be
to put two people on a job when
one would have done
well yeah
it co
you know
er it could be that either we're not UNK costs on that basis or
costs on the bill like
perhaps
ah
that the er charge that we're charging the client isn't high enough
don't we
well it isn't
mm
yeah
hours
to cover the overheads in that er appointment
yeah
that's the problem
i mean that's the way i read it
so w we're not charging out for them at a high enough rate
marginally
mm
for who sorry
supervisors
the problem with work supervisors is i think we UNK before if you think about it is the fact that our plans and what have you all go forward assuming it's so many hours
it doesn't take in the fact that you're actually paying them double time for overtime
right
and one and a half times
yeah
and they're
mm
working overtime
so the more overtime you work as i've said before the less efficient we become
in terms of profitability
what's happened here
right
there was a co
UNK
UNK with the one of the formulas
thank you
tt ruins
ruins
so which UNK the
so whi which are these replacing andrew
er they're page three
page four
page three
a second
mm
rip that off there
which part of page three
mm
has been changed then
all of page
all of it
so w so completely new
oh
hang on
no it isn't
it's
oh god
ah
different
what's different
or shall i just put on the
there's only the bottom
it's only
there's only the bottom
there's only the bottom
the table
table
table at the bottom
it's just the table
so
so it's that it's only that table there
and as far as i'm concerned it doesn't make any significant difference
gone down
to my analysis
so is that there on page three
option erm sorry point three
on page three yeah
right
it's just those numbers then isn't it
it's just those numbers
yeah
so those two pages
again
erm
want replacing
i'm happy about that
yeah
yeah
yeah
and then in the
i'm not
here's an extra sheet
these are extra sheets
right
good
that one there
yeah
i know
be
i can't be dealing with all
oh good
these bloody changes
pro capita fee earning bids
yes
al 's staff
hugh 's staff
right
so there's an extra sheet three b
mm
first of all can i say it's a good report
yeah
and thank you andrew
well done
erm the next question i ask is how do we make staff aware of the content
well we discussed that early on we're gonna actually issue this as part of our annual report
and it's cos i think it's important that
mm
staff do understand er i mean i wonder how many of our staff understand how much detail we look at and have available
probably very few
yeah
and i think it's important that they should know the amount of information that is available and how i think how well we do monitor er our financial performance
cos i it is important
yeah
it's also
good
important our staff are educated in their effect on this
yes
cos i don't think well i've got to speak for b e s
i have a number of staff who just do not see that all of this is generated by them
yes cos it all comes out of dopacs without dopacs you haven't got any of this
every single thing on here comes out of that
mm
report they make on the
yeah
income side
so if they balls it up we get false
yeah
figures
if the turn around documents are wrong
yeah
but how do we get that across
well i think that has to be said
i think that ought to be said to staff
right
i mean i'm gonna suggest
when this is
that t th that w we team brief certain aspects of this today
mm
erm
yeah
and i'm gonna suggest that you take that along with you and you say look this is what you get er whenever we want it
this is the end of year report
erm the first thing i'm i would like t to draw out is that at the end of the year we made a profit of a hundred sixty thousand pounds
a hundred and ninety
where does it say that
a hundred and ninety
a hundred and ninety thousand
where does it say that
that is it was in er
it's at the bottom of page
bottom of page three it is
bottom of page t new page three
yeah
a hundred and ninety thousand pounds
thank you for that er andrew
okay
so well done lads
that's pretty good in a in a year that has been fairly tough
that's the good news
the next point i would raise and this is er by looking at item three on page one is the income split by business and profit
centre
the forty five for
regional railways
which yeah
mm
and i would like to draw out of there the fact that eighteen percent of our work is for intercity forty five percent is for regional railways
sorry jim
and sixteen percent for network south east
if you add those two up they come to about sixty one percent nearly sixty two percent
those two areas of work two thirds of our work i see as being areas of risk
because UNK are anxious to maintain or to take all the work for network
mm
south east
glasgow and birmingham are anxious to take all the work for regional railways
the way that we continue our clients the ones that we contract with are anxious to continue working with us
that is because we've given them good service over the past three years
and it's important for our staff to be aware of that and to realize that we have gotta continue to give those two clients i believe in particular the best possible service we can provide
we're going down the UNK if we don't
mm
so that was message number two
we did get some rates from glasgow didn't we
mm
yeah
yes
we got theirs were higher than ours
theirs were higher than ours
yeah
yeah
good
erm in item four i didn't understand item four
mm
this is money that we've lost
these are the balls ups
right
these are the jobs that we've transferred money or given money back
okay
yeah
i don't intend to spend any time on that at all we went through it last time
no it's just it's just an opportunity
oh
green bottom being UNK to bridge
come on
it's joint
fair enough
roger what does it matter
does it matter
as a group i mean the other thing that surprised me a bit i spoke to ken yesterday and said how did you receive
how was the fifty thousand pound credit
received for green bottom
and he said oh yes he said roger told me about that he said i didn't even know we were getting that
surprised me
he's a project coordinator
right
fine
i mean ro r roger advised the client's agent in the normal way i mean
if somebody's accepted the fifty thousand that we passed
good
back
it wou anyway thank you for that
i would
it was just that i it was almost in passing he said well yeah roger told me about that
and it wasn't just a sort of formal thing or anything that was the impression i got
i may be wrong
mm
i told him about it
yes
formally
but er mm
formally
only in UNK only verbally i haven't written to him and told him
oh
because i asked you and remember i rang you up about a week a week ago and said what which number have you
UNK
and you said you didn't know yet
that's right
but er i erm andrew sent off er through i b i s because we were
yeah
quite close to the sort of er gates coming down on us fifty thousand pounds
and i told y i said to y er before he did that i said would it cause a client a problem if we gave them back some money
right
and you said no
no
they'll be delighted
and i said would you clear that with him then and tell him that it's coming
erm a as you're the project coordinator and i'll get it into the system
right
our objective the objective of giving a fifty thousand pounds refund on green bottom was UNK
one was to erm UNK them for er errors that we feel that er we could have avoided
but the second one was to actually make it a bit of bloody exercise in marketing
erm and i think that a well i don't think it's essential that we send regional railways a letter which says that we have decided to refund this erm to assist them in er financially
yeah
this will be don't you see i'm in the process of answering a letter to regional railways on the whole finances of er leeds north western and i needed to know which number you'd actually
mm
UNK
mm
right
because there are various er numbers that i know
well UNK
UNK
and their letter if you do that will be done
for me
good
good lad
fine
no problem
erm i in actual fact the th the decision to do that UNK is an absolute UNK because i know that er ken is in real problems with fees for the UNK people
and he's gon they are UNK by something like one point one million
so any contributions from
oh we'll have it back then
any contribution from us
drop in the ocean
er is very UNK received
so it was a good move that
erm good
next thing i got on was erm
there's two on that page by the way two b is the item i mentioned about graduates isn't it
full cost of the graduate trainees
yeah
increases has increased the in expenditure
yes because previous to this year erm the r c e has been picking up a proportion of their costs
so the next message that i was going to or the next thing i was concerned about really was on page
three
yeah
item two profitability
er i think tha that we need to look at why there is such a significant difference in profitability between the bridge and p way who are making what would appear to be a reasonable amount er and the other four sections
and all i'm looking for there are the reasons for those figures being so much different from bridge and p way
and
some of it by clever accounting on the part of andrew
mm
by carrying some of the profit forward from last year to this year
yes i mean th that's a point tha that's erm put on there
if we if we put the profit carried forward er that we'd earned this year on erm the UNK signal thing
two hundred and forty nine thousand wasn't it
yes
which is another three percent isn't it
which took it
mm
up to nearly seven point nine
mm
for b e s
we can look at the
co
what i'm looking for i are two things really
one is the reasons why there's such a difference a and two is do we need to take any action
and really andrew what i want you and trevor what i want you and andrew to do is to give me answers to that
most of this i would think could be
i don't want thinks i want facts
no
oh yeah
right
i want to know what the difference is and i want to know whether we need to take action or what
yeah
okay
so if you could do that for the next meeting i'd be grateful
do you want an analysis of the of the
yeah
profit
why there's a difference
that's right
now the next thing erm on the same page was having taken away the th the non fee earning elements it actually pushed and i'm looking at your revised sheet now
yes
it pushed b e s work supervisors and p q s into a loss making situation admittedly only marginally
erm and that wants to be part of that exercise really of looking at the reasons a and telling us whether we need to take any action
well she's picked it up
five thousand loss
on a works supervisor
and
yes
it means the rates are wrong for works supervisors doesn't it
no
it means the rates are virtually right doesn't it
what we've charged what we've charged the supervisors off with is the full time c o three plus er UNK self owned transport
mm
me and er
well you got one
well the question then is do we need to be charging work supervisors
and
out a to our clients at a higher rate in future
that's what i'm saying
yes
well
because of the overtime scenario
make some money
it's a part that even
roger's been complaining to me
ah
that the supervisor rate is far too high a and that's one of the reasons
but we're losing money on it
losing money on it
yeah
how can it be too high
well we are losing we're breaking even on it
we're not
it says we're losing money there
the group as a whole
you co you could turn round and say alright they didn't have a full time c o three they had
but supervisor
right
rate is i is that salary
doesn't matter
divided by sixteen hundred times two point six
no
no
no
it's been reduced
because of you
yeah
right
i i'll buy that
one thousand pounds on what's the total expenditure
no
five thousand pounds
five thousand
five thousand pounds on five hundred
thousand
thousand
is it
one percent
b e s has more or
less broken even as well as you see
th this
yeah
but really why
i mean we should be
but i mean we all are
targeting at making a modest profit
yeah
we're targeted at making a modest
yeah
profit for the group
group
right
the modest
that's right
profit for the group is a hundred and ninety thousand pounds
which is superb
jus just about
right
right
okay
if we if we had targeted making a profit of say five hundred and sixty five thousand pounds just for instance
right
everybody would have made
a sound argument
a reasonable profit but some would have made more than others
when you're looking at an a an average profit for the group erm you
i'll tell you what it's a sound argument for the time being but it's not a sound argument if we're involved in a management buy out
aye but you've gotta
ah yes
you've gotta look at
ah y
alternatives
you gotta decide whether or not one service allows
yeah
you to provide another one or not
embarrassing in future
you've gotta look at your rates there's a lot of things you've gotta
you see if you'd UNK if you'd added the work supervisor costs into roger's cost centre there would have been no worries
you wouldn't have even noticed that they were making
th they were only just breaking even
and also the works supervisor they've added nearly twenty eight thousand pounds to the organization
they've made a contribution towards
the costs and if we hadn't got the supervisors then you would have all made a proportion
mm
less of that profit because that twenty eight thousand pounds would have had to have been
found by somebody else
i must be er
yeah but the net UNK b the net cost is five less five thousand lost not twenty eight
in
no
no
no
no
you're five out
if you took the work supervisors out
out the group all together
yes
you would be twenty eight thousand pounds less
because you still have the same
organization
you'd still have the quality manager the safety engineer
and hugh and UNK to pay
twenty one percent
and i they are making a positive contribution of twenty eight thousand pounds towards those overheads
right
gents i don't think it's worth spending that much time on that
i mean i wanted to raise that
i'm reasonably convinced
mm
well i am convinced by andrew's explanation erm i would like to say in terms of when we look at the staff costs against budget and we came in at only eleven thousand pounds less er i think that is a erm that we can congratulate our business manager on the good control that's been UNK over the past year
is that reasonable
there was a th
UNK
more luck than good
i think so because i don't know where we got
what with the amount of to ing and fro ing with agency staff and vacancies er that we've got erm
and the graduates initially were only putting in about a hundred and thirty three thousand and they came out as four and a half
right
oh well i take back what i said then
please take it back
because that is bound to be a UNK part of the business
can i
i'm not an accountant or an UNK
no
or anything like that
but by god you've got a lot of money
yeah
but bloody wish we had
but one thing that is very relevant which you've gotta think about is that we all thought operation UNK was great news didn't we
yes
it's bad news isn't it
we did
it's absolutely the worst type of business we ought to be
hear
doing
i'll buy that
because it
involves staff in overtime
yeah
which
to get the job done which we cannot recover
and it meant that jobs you'd already got planned
so that's
were thrown into chaos
yeah
anyway
but
but
think it's good business when it's
really bad news
yeah
i bad news terry but it's work
it's bad news it's bad news on a time basis
yeah
it's good news if we do it on a fixed fee and say we have had to enhance some of our rates
correct
mm
to cover certain bits and
yeah
pieces
correct
but we yeah
but it's a good marketing exercise the fact that you do it
it is and in terms of
yeah
profitability
you can turn round and say
get lost
it's destroyed the figures
no use going to york they can't
yeah but the funny thing was that if we hadn't
of done UNK you'd have been looking at figures that showed a lot more profitability
yeah
oh
yes
er
you would
no
i think
it would because the overtime
the same profit
if you're charging off er an m s two on a twenty four pound an hour
it's the supervisors that are the problem
the supervisors when they work double time
yeah
contribute something like about fifty p an hour towards the overheads
that's all
it is a positive contribution though
a and their standard their standard year the their standard year
but their expenses you
does ah ri yes
there's the expenses
there's all their expenses
but their standard year does erm make the normal
yeah
contribution
anyway
towards the overheads
it's not quite the UNK we think it
do we need
is when you're doing a UNK
you think
no
great
you know loads of work
money in but in actual fact it's going out faster than it's coming in
no i
thanks for pointing that out terry
no
i it's not
but i it's
but
well you have raised a point
and that is that
no
the over the next years
we just spent seven thousand quid on UNK that's non UNK because of UNK
te the important message that you're you've raised and it is a very important one is that over the next years i mean we will have to change the way that we charge for
yeah
that service
yeah
i mean at the moment we can't
there's no benefit to us
all we would
do is end up making a bigger profit
mm
which we would just have
do you think
to put into UNK
sorry
andrew didn't think i was right there
he's not
you
no
you sh you UNK you head when i said UNK had made a loss
no
yes
he would have earned more income on the seven thousand pounds
he would because some of it is only time and a third
no
that seven thousand was only the overtime payment
yes
he was getting paid standard time anyway and the hours going forward on dopacs
seven thousand
for site supervision would only be straightforward hours
yes
but if UNK makes his normal contribution during his thirty six and a half hour week
two point six
then if we're charging him out at roughly two point one which i think we are something like that with our discount
he's already covered his overheads
he's covered his overheads
if we pay him at time and three quarters which is the most we can pay him we're still making point six of a er on top of that
the contribution that he actually UNK is
i can't believe you're telling me the truth because that would mean if everybody worked overtime on that basis we'd all still making a profit
yes
much though
can't work
you don't make very much but you make a bit
it can't be true cos
as a percentage
have a look
it's close
it ca i mean that just can't be true
alright
right
next thing
can i raise one final point
on this
and that is i think the costs
mm
the on costs er to b e s and it's pro UNK to the others of fifty six thousand pounds for services largely at the business planning manager
i would like to know what i get for that
right
well
that's equivalent to two members of staff
i w i was coming i was coming almost to that jim
do you mind if i just
no
raise a very fundamental point
and this is i if i take it t to sheet ten which is the staff numbers statement
is this with irish
no
no
staff numbers statement erm and we look at the right hand column you will find that we have a hundred and thirty nine fee earning people and fifty eight support
which works out as a percentage that twenty nine percent of our staff the moment are support staff
i believe that is too high
so do i
some are trainees actually do maybe i've classed the fee earning staff which are on the areas actually maybe some aren't actually non fee earners
the twenty three trainees
right
can i
cos what i w i mean it's jus t i don't
oh yes
you've got the you've got all the twenty three in there a and
they'll be
three quarters of those are fee earning at any one time
right
whi
well i would like those numbers t to be adjusted
i'll tell you what i was gonna do er i was gonna point out two things
one is that twenty nine percent is too high and you've explained that isn't that is an artificial figure
and if it's an artificial figure then we should UNK the figures to
mm
to show the UNK of the situation
i was gonna compare that with the er th the numbers under your heading of actual where we have an establishment of two hundred and forty eight
right
no
cos if
yes
ah yeah
two hundred and forty eight
mhm
now twenty nine as a proportion of two hundred and forty eight works out as er somewhere around about ten percent
right
mhm
that's twenty nine percent
oh shit
sorry
fifty eight of two hundred and forty eight
if it's still it's twenty five percent isn't it
yeah
it's still high
right
there is
yes
right
that's always the case
yeah
yeah
okay
so we've come the premise
erm twenty nine percent is too high
what is the actual percentage of support compared to fee earning
that is the next question
and then the final question is what is what should our target percentage be
and then the next question is what do we UNK
how do we
what do we do about it
what services that we incur at the moment are we prepared to give up
what do we do about it
that's right
because i take it that support those non those support non fee earning staff are me and UNK er the clerical staff in p way works b e s
bridges
almost the whole of erm
the whole of my organization
of UNK organization
q
and
and q
and quality and erm
yeah
the clerical staff in the quantity surveyors
over to you jim
sorry
i just i wanted to bring that out because i do feel that twenty nine percent is too high
er an and i
no
i have noted what andrew's said about the graduates and that we are actually getting some fee earning
mm
from them
well look at look at look at that my organization bought for twenty six twenty seven staff fifty four thousand pounds
mm
now two thousand pounds per member of staff i feel that it's a very high figure
considering we're paying for personnel on top of it and all the other things like telephones and accommodation
i asked the question what am i getting for two thousand pounds a head
does that two
is that two thousand pounds s purely from business planning management
well the majority of it is
yes
i mean
or is it from your own clerical section
no
no
no
over and above the fact that he has three clerks
right
he h is to having to pick up on a per capita basis of fee earners which is how andrew has distributed these costs
mm
he's having to pick up the equivalent of
two thousand pounds per fee UNK
to enjoy
having you and UNK and
dennis
no and peter
peter and my organization
now jim's arguing
perhaps
that it's too high
that it's too high
well it's equivalent it's equivalent
i don't disagree
to two to three staff
it's almost i could take on board another two to three clerks and i could say could i do what
that overhead currently does for me
right
with an extra two to three people
now tha that's just very crude putting it
but you couldn't
you couldn't do the dopacs could you
you co you co
cos the i UNK support er
i think what is more interesting
why couldn't i do the dopacs
safety
why can't i do appointment contracts
i've argued this for long enough
yes i can
not
yes i want to or
can i make the point
yeah
gotta emphasize jim's
yeah
i don't know the answers but i'm gonna emphasize the point now
jim did say if i looked at mine and i only have just looked at it er if i've read the UNK if i've read the figures right and i
you pay a lot more than
haven't got many more staff only about
twenty four
mm
yeah
would you pay
i pay seventy seven thousand pounds
mm
which is an hell of a lot of money compared to your
gents i
lot
i think
pardon
staff
yeah
and thirty two staff when i'm paying seventy
well UNK roger
seven thousand quid
well all the same UNK aren't they
we're
yes
paying the same for it
again
can i suggest that what we need to do
about this
yeah
is we've i highlighted
a problem and i think it is a genuine problem probably the biggest problem that we have to address at the moment
erm and i
mm
i think
we should we should set a target an initial target that we wish to hi to hit
and a as a crude thing i was gonna suggest erm two course of action
one is andrew goes away now and UNK these figures t to put the graduates some of the graduates into the fee earning er column
come up with a revised percentage
that's not gonna affect the point that jim jim's talking about
it is
UNK no he's not
jim's talking about pounds
jim's talking about the fact th the salaries of the graduates don't come into that
the gr the salaries of the graduates have been shared out among the people who have earned fees from them while they've been there
individually
i made a thirty four thousand pound profit at the end of march and then trevor gave me a bill for fifty six thousand
which demolished the whole lot and more
for his services
now the
point is another point to note is i had
mm
no idea that charge was coming on board
well that's not good enough
way through
ah
the financial year
i didn't
now
well that's not good enough
wait a minute
wait a minute
that's not fair
i did UNK
we when we have when we have done i mean tha that's isn't a charge to you
you won't actually have to pay it out
all we've actually done is to say right
if we've got these overheads i mean it was always shown as another lump of money in the bottom
business and planning manager minus so much or in brackets or whatever
what we decided to do because i thought that's what you'd been pressing for was to show that as the equivalent affect of okay you think you're making these profits but you're actually enjoying services that you're not paying for
about period ten and correct me if i'm wrong andrew i was told it would be about a thousand roughly a thousand pounds per fee earning employee
it's over two thousand pounds per fee earning employee
well then andrew gave you
now what
the wrong figure
well what i'm saying is yeah and i mean we're all learning by this
if you're gonna run a business you need to know what charges are coming on board you so you can adjust your rates so you
mm
can go for
more work
but we
and this sort of thing
but we are UNK our rates and going for more work on the basis of a group
yes
and not on the basis of individual offices
right
but i think what's what
oh no
hey
may be of relevance
wait a minute
if i'm
accountable
yeah
for the performance of b e s which i am
group
yeah
rightly so
i've gotta have authority to run it
and that means i've gotta have the information upon which to run it
you could
that could be
if i've got a gap in the workload i can go and
mm
fill a gap
but i think i think what i'd like to
you know
know hugh to try to help the point
i'd like to know what the staff do in UNK organization
if that isn't a rude question
not on
this is i i'm not looking for a
you see i have some
oh why not
it's er
no
no
trevor
no
wh when we're looking at
alright then
when we're looking at cost and what have you
you know what can be done elsewhere and how we can best utilize existing staff it may well be as somebody has said that i mean we've got rachel there just to pick on one post where you're cos it's one i happen to know what's she what's she supposed to be doing
or some of what she's supposed to be doing
mm
is to be honest she's of little benefit to my organization
she UNK training
mhm
but jeremy could do that
one of my other clerks could actually do that
or we could take the work off jeremy
or yes i mean wh what
you could ac what you what you you've gotta be careful what you're
we could UNK training again
actually saying is that perhaps you don't need
well i don't know what the i don't know what the
three clerks
absolutely
in each of the design functions
yes
and two clerks is which is what
quite
norman manages with might more be the order of the day
wh what i would like to
i agree
suggest we do UNK because it is a very valid point
i've only got two supervisors
and it's one that i think is it is a priority one for addressing i think we should ask trevor er and an and andrew t to draw up if you like details of the whole of the costs of the overheads within this organization
i mean we know wha we know what UNK is a UNK is UNK
it's three hundred and twenty two thousand pounds a year
mm
er what i
yeah but what
what are we actually getting for that
right
wh what i was gonna su
fifty thousand
i seriously think hugh coming back to my point i seriously don't know what
those staff do
yeah
i
i know what some of them do
let me finish
i can't assess
i was i was gonna suggest that trevor an and andrew draw up
do you know what yours do
yes
shh
yes
trevor and andrew draw up a comprehensive list of
what the overall overhead is for this organization in terms of people
and expenses and so on
that we then analyze that report indicates what people do and we analyze if you like where we can investigate possible reductions
alternative ways of doing it
because i mean if we add all these together gents i mean i pi i UNK in on the number on the people because if you look at our budgets staff costs are something like ninety percent of our budget
mm
make up
yeah
which means that twenty nine percent isn't far off representing the overhead charge on this organization
i know
and i and i said my premise was if that's the case it's too bloody high
and my initial target then would be to say look what would we have to do to reduce that twenty nine percent to twenty percent
would it be get rid of one of roger's clerks
get rid of rachel
get rid of me
get rid of UNK
but you know what would we want to do
you have to ask the questions
to bring that down
don't you
if you don't ask the question the charges will
now that
just go up
that is what i employ a business manager to do
i mean maybe the money a lot of is it is anything to do with the not the staff costs but in actual fact the c a d equipment we've bought
no it's additional
no it's not
no
this is pure staff
it's got nothing to do with that
this is
yeah
this is purely staff costs
purely staff costs
because there's er
so c
well
i would suggest that is the action that we take
thank you for raising it but i think we should now get trevor to er draw up er a report on what the make up of the overheads on this organization is
erm what we get for the money and erm where there are possibilities for us to consider reducing that overhead
mm
and we might not like what we see
but we might on the other hand
and it might be like
and be pretty sure we're not as efficient as we sh as we should be and i'm not just talking about
i mean apart from costs
our own offices
the administration
i think the drive next year there ought to be a theme
sorry ca can we just let this
part of the cost cos we divide the charge of the into our organization on a staff number basis for admin charges typing services
mhm
we get a share of the typing services or the print unit
mhm
our organization doesn't actually use it
don't use it
yeah
so what we're doing is we then send them this why don't we pass it out to the other piece of the group
mhm
this is really their share back again
but that admin charge it would ge get charged from intercity east coast
if we weren't there the plan print room would still cost the same amount of money
it wouldn't
i see
cost us because
yeah
so effectively we're paying whilst we never use the typing pool or the plan print room we're paying a proportion of those costs on a per capita basis
that's it
and then passing those back to you
and the UNK
yes
well look
let us let us see what it is
i could manage that
mm
l let's get it UNK
let's get it on
put it on the table
yeah
the table and see what the build up of th of the ov
overall overhead on this organization is and whether there are areas that we could er th that we could change
i mean we could UNK things and charge sort of sixty or seventy percent of UNK time against the graduates and then charge that back off
it doesn't
against the people that use the graduates
but you're not reducing the overhead on the organization
no you're not you're ju you're
