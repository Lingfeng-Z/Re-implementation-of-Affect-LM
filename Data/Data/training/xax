just moving it around a and just makes it more acceptable
and that's not the object of the exercise
to jim and less acceptable
yeah
to roger and terry
i've had to turn half of one of my clerks over to fee earning work
but i did it deliberately because the

i didn't have enough work for three clerks
absolutely
i
but i don't but i can't manage

with just two
that's the problem
when you've small numbers you get into difficulties
of
er on UNK as an indicator of UNK for UNK bladder cancer presented i believe by erm and representing er colleagues from bristol er oxford and sheffield
thank you
mr chairman ladies and gentlemen good afternoon
the relationship between tumour and blood supply has been noted by UNK and indeed some UNK for centuries
in his UNK on blood inflammation and UNK published in eighteen twenty eight john hunter stated that in disease in which there is an increase in the part as in tumours the increase in vessels is UNK
now our understanding of this relationship has increased dramatically over the past few years and our knowledge of new UNK formation or UNK has also increased
and it is has been shown that UNK is in fact essential to tumour growth
tumours er greater than two millimetres in size require their own blood supply
it is also essential for UNK
now john hunter noted there was an association between the quantity of the vessels and the tumour and recently this has been er shown with micro UNK to be an important problems to indicator
tumours
now we've used this technique in UNK bladder cancer and we've UNK the micro UNK in a group of UNK and looked at the UNK and UNK
we found no res relationship between UNK and UNK but the rest of this paper will er concentrate on its role in UNK
forty five patients we looked at age UNK fifty to ninety one had the mean age of seventy three
now follow up UNK between one and fifty one months
all tumours were solid or had elements of er UNK and solid tumours and routine sections were stained with a standard UNK technique using anti c d thirty one anti UNK
now c d thirty one is an UNK cell UNK molecule and the UNK has been shown to be the most specific marker of UNK and consistently in studies has stained more vessels than other UNK
we estimated the count er by looking at each individual section at low power and collecting the three most vascular areas
then with a twenty five point UNK er the counts were made at high power
now when you look down the UNK through the UNK what one sees is twenty five UNK dots UNK your er section
if you rotate the UNK such that the maximum number of dots covers erm a stained and then you count those number of dots that's the count
and we did that in the three areas so we used the sum of three vascular counts in the analysis
now we looked at both UNK tumours and solid tumours but as this pictures demonstrates we're not y er able accurately to determine the count of UNK tumours
this is the UNK that you get it's black showing vessels
now these are all vessels and these aren't the ones that we're interested in we're interested in the small tumour UNK vessels
because we weren't able to define with any confidence areas of UNK in UNK tumours we've based the study on those tumours with solid er solid tumours or those with solid elements
this is what you see when you do er the UNK on the left is an area of low count
and i don't think if you can just see small areas of UNK this has a erm only a few vessels present within the solid tumour
but on the right an area of a high count where a great deal more of vessels are present
of our forty five patients nine had t two tumours and thirty six had t three tumours
thirty three had a solid UNK and twelve had a mixed UNK
now we performed UNK analysis looking at all the parameters shown on the left
we confirmed which was j with a bit of luck that t two tumours do significantly better than t three tumours p value of nought point nought two
we also showed that grade two do significantly better than grade three but most importantly perhaps is that we showed that patients with a vascular count that are less than twenty one do significantly better than patients with a vascular count of greater or equal to twenty one
p value of nought point nought one
we showed no significant difference between solid or mixed tumours and significant difference between tumours which had UNK picture or UNK picture on a d n a analysis
we then placed all these parameters in a multi UNK analysis
the only two that remained significant were stage and vascular count
in other words vascular count is a significant independent UNK er indicator in this group of UNK bladder UNK
look at the survival curve of the vascular count percentage of surviving up the y axis and time in months on the on the x axis
these two curves are significantly different
the top curve in yellow is for counts less than twenty one now the four year survival for this group is around forty three percent
with a UNK survival of thirty five months
compared with those counts of greater or equal to twenty one which is the white curve greater or equal to twenty one white curve which is the lower curve
and this four year survival of only twenty three percent with a UNK survival of around nine months
now to calculate the hazard ratio on these two groups those patients with counts of greater or equal to twenty one were two and half times more likely to die of their disease than those with counts of less than twenty one
in a paper that was published in nineteen eighty five journal of UNK looked at UNK factors in UNK cancer
the overall er five year survival for all UNK are around about er twenty percent er twenty eight percent
but within this group he looks specifically at solid tumours and they only have a four year survival of twenty percent
so using vascular counts we are able to define a group of patients that do significantly better
therefore this simple technique of counting vessels as an assessment of UNK does provide us with additional UNK information and is good for patients
and in summary mr chairman ladies and gentlemen we would suggest that the assessment of UNK in bladder cancer is an important and UNK er UNK indicator and has UNK implications
not only in being able to select a group where perhaps we can justify more aggressive therapy or even a group that perhaps we should just treat UNK but also in the future with the development of anti UNK therapy
thank you very much
i'd like to start the question briefly with two points firstly you had forty nine patients
no
we had forty five
forty five
y you must have had many more than forty five
yeah
tumours over the last
yeah
year or so
th we're limited to solid tumours or patients that have an element of solid tumour on UNK
we did in fact have sixty eight patients unfortunately erm thirteen of these insufficient UNK material for us to do the count erm and
mm
erm we excluded all the UNK ones that had solid because it was insufficient er one patient we couldn't get the UNK to work
right
just that multi UNK analysis on forty five leaves you with some very tiny UNK
yeah
i it does
we weren't erm we weren't able to do a multi UNK analysis with the grade because we didn't have a sufficient number of the grade to do it
but we er the there were sufficient for all the other
microphone five please
a question
mark from liverpool
the way that erm one might have effective treatment for muscle UNK bladder cancer if one uses UNK is maintain a decent oxygen supply to the tumour and if one uses UNK to deliver the blood to the tumour
have you got any information about the UNK of the UNK that were used in those
we haven't we haven't analyzed the results according to the treatment that the patients received
erm we know that three patients had UNK and one er that then the remainder have UNK but i haven't analyzed the results dividing them into UNK or UNK
and none had UNK
erm i think one had one had UNK
there we hadn't got enough in the group to make that erm analysis
microphone five again
er UNK
i noticed your survival curves tend to er come together er in about four years and you're not attending in that direction
well then all survival curves will eventually
well of
come together won't they
now did you did you find that er were you ab were you able to repeat any of the UNK and see whether in the er in the er group with the less vessels more vessels were er UNK
er
we haven't looked at any of the repeat UNK no
we didn't look at them we just chose death as an end point because it's the easiest end point to choose
so we looked at just the th the UNK of the patient and related it to the UNK
we haven't looked
microphone two please
er UNK from middlesbrough
i just want to ask you about the actual erm methodology which sections did you examine
and you said you just chose the three most vascular could you tell me a bit more
yeah
about that
the section we chose were the ones that were chosen by the UNK because they were the best representative sample of that tumour
in what respect
in being able to stage or grade them
in what respect
i don't know what do you mean by in wh
i mean th there are pretty clear cut guidelines for doing UNK analysis of erm tumour erm er tumour structure
you know cells erm vascular tissue UNK tissue matrix
which particular technique did you use
because you just seem to have chosen the things by looking not by actually UNK from the tumours
w we cut th the path UNK er the where the blocks come from they're graded one two three four
one is the best example from the tumour that came from the reception
so that was a na er that was a naked eye examination
well we know that from the UNK the initial report
mm
done by the UNK
he'd designated that was the best block
we cut that section we stained it and then looked at it under low power and selected out from that block the three most vascular areas
we could have chosen the three least vascular areas but then the counts wouldn't have been would have been much more difficult
yeah but why wouldn't they have been much more relevant
because y you obviously you've presented different information in your talk this afternoon you've given us more information that was in your abstract so the figures are different where you in your abstract you just talked about differences between g three t three tumours
well in the abstract we were loo we i bought them and decided whether they are high or low counts we now have a way of UNK that we have a way of counting each individual er UNK
so we're can no we can number them as such
well ha there's no point counting things unless the counts are relevant to the condition you're looking at
if you can
just look at the naked eye appearance and choose three areas that you think are most vascular
from a one off block
no
they're not it's not just choosing th they're stained
it's not going to be representative
the areas are the most stained
they're the most strongly stained areas they have the most vessels therefore you choose to count them
yeah and i think were not we'll perhaps talk afterwards
can i suggest you do so
yeah
microphone one please
er in use of other you should have the difference in survival between the patients that had more than twenty one or less than twenty one but actually it er you didn't show us the survival curves for
reaction against the survival curves er with the g er UNK grade and the g with the tumour and to see actually the difference which we can in curves which we can UNK from counting the UNK
no
we chose just to show this one curve of vascular count cos that's what we think is important
cos if we have seen the same survival curves according to the er UNK so it'll have been er more that g three is worse than g two but er there is a difference in your curves between the grading quality and the UNK
we know now that it's really needed to count the vessels because we will get definitely more information
well the UNK analysis and the multi UNK analysis shows that i it is adds additional information
i didn't show you the grade and the stage curves because we all know what they look like but what i'm saying is that by doing the count provides us with additional information on this group of patients
more than we can gain from looking at the grade and the stage
i think the real UNK of this question is given a t tumour can you pick out the good from the bad using this technique
and can you give us the figures to support that
erm from a specifically no what i we can pick out the bad solid tumours and the good solid tumours
yes but you accepted that t UNK was still the strongest UNK indicator
yes it is
we will all continue using that
if we add to that your technique
right
will it benefit us and the patient
from this pilot study i cannot say yes or no but what i can say is that this pilot study suggests that it will
it may
it may
a and numbers in our a s in a stage group too small to say definitely that we can pick out those t two tumours badly or well on the vascular count
but what we can say is that we can select out from the group of solid tumours the ones that do badly
can we look forward to your poster next year with a couple of hundred t two patients
mm
have you another question
yes i was just wondering er raise one point
the c d thirty one UNK is that just identifying blood vessels
or is it possibly UNK blood vessels that are under attack by vascular invasion
erm i can't answer that
erm because i know that er cell UNK molecule c d thirty one is present in all erm vascular UNK whether it's erm er expressed in more erm vessels average
thank you very much indeed
thank you
oh we've got one more quick question
oh two
okay
microphone one please
come on
we've got just er two minutes
if this is another exhibition of the UNK distance in er UNK in defining the UNK
both of our eyes here possibility that could be er switched down
cos it's really very oh that's much better
i think at that stage we can we can proceed
erm this is er i suspect this is er a session that er will generate a interest
we are restricted somewhat by time because i want to get everybody back in the main UNK to listen to what i know is going to be a fantastic lecture by professor don er from UNK which i would certainly recommend that everybody go and see
er the UNK this morning are myself john from dublin and stuart who is from newcastle new south wales who is president of the UNK society of UNK
and er this is one of the er new things that's happening really er with UNK this year is that er people are coming from far and wide and UNK session so i'd like to welcome stuart very much indeed
th there are a number of papers and we're going to start off this morning er with when people just i've started actually speaking here so that er to allow people time to come into the room and i know that here we are
so we're having in the first instance
there's two seats over there
he actually is reading a paper from UNK but if he's speaking with a slight scottish accent then er that's only because he's actually from scotland
er he's going to read his paper now
neil
just over to the other side
thank you very much john
er mr chairman members of it's a great pleasure to be here today
before i erm
before i am going to talk about er UNK evaluation of patients with symptoms of UNK obstruction i think it's a good time to be talking about this when particularly in north america we're being encouraged to move towards a questionnaire or score in order to select patients for treatment whether that treatment be UNK treatment or other treatment
this is a study of more than two hundred patients that have been entered into a prospective study er since my move to UNK in UNK in nineteen eighty nine
i'll just give these folks coming in the door a moment to
don't give them too much time
just encourage them to hang around
this is a very straightforward study and we don't need to dwell on the on the er the design
we had two hundred and twelve men all of these men had er clinical b p h or one or two UNK
er all of these men had moderate or severe symptoms and all of these patients were candidates for surgery
and instead of taking them to the operating room for a t u r instead we took them to the UNK lab
in the UNK lab we conducted a comprehensive study that included a UNK a post void residual UNK and a pressure flow study and also er UNK
i'd like to report these results
the UNK er revealed a volume of less than a hundred and fifty UNK in the great majority of patients and we've we would dismiss that er data
er also patients who had a volume of more than a hundred and fifty UNK er the maximum flow was less than fifteen in er only fifty patients
the post void study revealed a residual volume of more than a hundred UNK in about a third of patients
UNK was normal in half and there was instability in the other half
erm these patients were pretty much equally split between patients who had obstruction and patients who did not have obstruction on a pressure flow study
this is an example of a patient who has a stable UNK and in the course of the UNK study UNK with a high pressure the UNK is going up and down the whole time
another kind of
but er here the patient who has a maximum flow of ten and a UNK pressure of seventeen and he UNK in the course of the study
here we have a patient who is UNK during the course of filling and is also UNK with a low flow and a high UNK pressure and finally a patient who is UNK who has a perfectly normal UNK pressure of er thirty five and a maximum flow of twenty
unfortunately we don't have any UNK of characteristics or parameters for obstruction
and this was a hot topic for debate at the i c s in er UNK and we made absolutely no progress at all er with this issue during that meeting
er what i have chosen to do is to do what we were doing in the nineteen eighties which is to take the simplest measure of the maximum flow and the UNK pressure at that volume and when we do that you can see that these patients instead of being a single group of patients with a single kind of bladder pressure and flow these patients are all over the map
if we're going to draw some lines perhaps it would be reasonable to say well patients with a flow of greater than fifteen certainly are unlikely to be UNK and patients whose UNK pressure is less than fifty would seem to fail to satisfy our criteria for obstruction because obstruction in a UNK sense implies a high pressure and a low flow
now if we put these two parameters on here we end up with only a small proportion of patients who actually have high pressure and low flow
so here we've got only thirty seven percent just o about a third of patients who have high pressure and low flow although all of these patients would have gone to the operating room for a t u r
if we look at the information that we have on UNK erm this was quite helpful er a hundred and thirty five patients seemed to have a fairly open UNK and the UNK was narrow in seventy seven erm most of the patients with UNK had a narrow UNK
so if we concentrate our remarks on the findings in those patients who satisfy our criteria this is just thirty seven percent of two hundred and twelve patients
we find that the sensitivity of the flow rate was less than we had hoped
the sensitivity of the residual urine er was also er very UNK
erm the UNK bladder was present more often amongst our UNK group although erm this was not something that would distinguish the UNK patients from the non UNK
so to our surprise of this UNK of patients who would have had a t u r only about a third had obstruction
the flow rate and the post void residual did not seem in this study to distinguish the group of patients who had obstruction
instability was common in the those who were UNK as well as those were UNK and we felt that really clinical evaluation alone may not be enough to suggest who needs surgery and who doesn't
we felt that this study was weak
er partly because it's completely UNK to suggest that all patients should have an expensive er video flow study
partly because this is one void pressure flow study and so we have evolved from here to take on the sort of technology that was UNK in this country by david using a simple UNK erm study and we've added to this erm er a hard wire connection from a UNK
so that as well as measuring pressures we can have flow and volume data on the same patients and the technique that we now use is to bring these patients in er to challenge them with a large fluid load er they get an UNK which is actually part of the way that we fund this study they have a
they have a UNK here before the UNK is placed and then using the UNK period we take several measurements of pressure and flow
this has the potential to be a very economic very easy way to help us to distinguish those pressures those patients who have high pressures and low flow
thank you
thank you very much neil particularly for being patient with the er the late UNK erm early on
thank you very much indeed
are there any questions that people would like to ask er i think it's a very important paper er important also because as most of you know it was all these new technologies and new drug UNK and things like that are coming in an awful lot of rather easy criteria are being used to look at the various things and i think that's why there's a lot of confusion about what is and is not a good method of treatment
is that mike on
chris if you want to come round to this
neil what do you do with the patients who don't satisfy your criteria
er what we tell these patients is that they don't have evidence of obstruction or if they do have obstruction then that obstruction does not threaten their kidney and that it would be appropriate to wait and watch their symptoms
and as we wait and watch the findings are very much those of paul in bristol that a great deal of these patients get better and only very few fall into problems
none of these patients are dismissed without any further follow up
how many of them accepted
erm
i don't know how many vote with their feet in going elsewhere but few of them challenge us at home
erm
wanting a different treatment
yes
andrew newcastle
actually i'm afraid i'm sorry that mike seems to be dead you're going to have to come round and stand in front of all these hundred and fifty three hundred people here doctor
andrew from newcastle i work with er professor
er i'd like to draw your attention to my poster upstairs actually cos we have now performed major study of er obstruction in the before and after UNK
we have found that are very much more sensitive for example in UNK instability erm we found differences pressures of were much higher in UNK studies
we haven't looked the correlation to
well i think this is partly one of the reasons that as UNK we need to be thinking about changing gear
it's been a very big step to use pressure flow studies at all and now that we're used to using pressure flow studies we're going to have to go back to the drawing board and perhaps learn to use a different kind of technology that's UNK that allows us
to take multiple measurements of the same patient rather than making a treatment decision based on a single observation
london
neil you're i'm not quite clear on exactly your definition of obstruction
your figure of thirty seven percent is much lower than most other series but most other series have different definitions er of obstruction
what just tell me exactly what you how you define obstruction
well roger i made great pains in the presentation to make clear that this is not a standard because we don't have a standard
i feel that if a patient has a flow greater than fifteen that flow is adequate normal probably
of course there's always
of course you're going to find one or two patients but UNK a relatively small group who have flows that are greater than fifteen who have obstruction
i have some patients like that
erm clearly you need to have a UNK pressure in order to be behind that flow and if this pressure is less than fifty then i think it's unlikely that there's much in the way of obstruction
i'm looking to select patients who have a high pressure and a low flow and for the sake of this study i've drawn my lines at fifty centimetres of water for UNK pressure during UNK and er fifteen UNK per second
so
if we had if we'd been a bit more UNK with our criteria our group would have got smaller
so y what you're saying is that sixty three percent of patients in america presenting with b p h have a flow rate above fifteen a and UNK pressure below fifty right
that's correct
that's amazing
that's not our experience here
you must be looking at different patients to
would you like to answer that neil
i cannot comment
no
well i have i have i'm sure roger will believe me they're
okay neil we'd better proceed
thank you very much indeed for a very UNK programme
i think er a number of the things that are meant to be UNK this morning for example how we get a clinical er evaluation er of patients selected for a t u r p or earlier treatment b p h but also now
so
are you ready then
right
listen to what you've got to say
thank you
consumer accounts
good afternoon to you
i don't know whether it's ever occurred to you but it is act
it is actually a bit UNK to be confronted with a UNK of teachers like yourselves
erm i feel as if you're gonna to say to me something like erm could do better
er see me
or as it said on my school report for p e er tries hard but lacks stamina
i've always remembered that UNK erm well now consumer affairs
consumer affairs are of course very important not only in retirement but throughout life
and consumer problems and consumer decisions are certainly not going to go away in retirement because we're all including myself who retired at the march are still going to be faced with consumer decisions
in retirement some of you may be thinking of erm having some improvement work done to your house
you may be thinking of moving house altogether and going to live in a different part of the country
you may be thinking of treating yourself to a holiday erm or something of that kind
and even if you're not UNK any of those things as i've said you're still going to be faced with decisions about goods that you want to buy and services that you want to buy for your home
now you will know there are a great many er programmes on television nowadays and articles in newspapers and magazines designed to try to help us to be a bit more aware
of what our rights are as shoppers and also what our responsibilities are as shoppers
and to help us to try to avoid some of the more obvious UNK to be avoided
but despite all those programmes on television and articles in newspapers and magazines the fact still remains an awful lot of people do have problems when they go shopping
i'm sure you don't need me to tell you that
erm things go wrong and there are many different reasons why things go wrong
people buy goods and then find for one reason or another the goods are faulty or they're unsatisfactory in some way and the customer then tries to get some kind of compensation
one of you was talking to me at er lunchtime and telling me that he recently bought er a c d of UNK dances and when he played it turned out to be some country and western music
well we smile but i'm sure that's by no me i'm sure that's not a unique case and i'm sure things like that have happened to many of you
erm so as i've said things go wrong
to give you an idea of how widespread the problem is the trading standards department in nottinghamshire er has set up three advice centres to help consumers with information and advice when you have problems like that
there's w one of those in nottingham there's one in newark and there's one in mansfield
now i imagine yo you come from all different parts of the county so i'd better tell you where they are
the mansfield one is in mansfield market square in the same building as the UNK advice bureau
er the newark one is on a road called UNK which those of you who know newark will know is not far from newark market square
er the nottingham one is on a road called middle pavement
if you're not quite sure where middle pavement is if you think of the rear exit of the UNK centre the UNK exit the UNK brings you out onto a road called middle pavement which UNK quite UNK downhill
and there's marks and spencers at the bottom of the slope
do you know where i mean now
well if you walk up that hill keeping marks and spencers on your left hand side the top part of the hill is called middle pavement and still on your left hand side you'll see a green sign trading standards advice centre
and i think for many of you in this room that'll be the nearest consumer advice centre to where you live
but in those three advice centres er we receive er in round figures we receive about four hundred complaints and enquiries about shopping problems every week all the year round
so to put it another way you could say in a typical year we would receive about twenty thousand complaints and enquiries about shopping
that's an awful lot of complaints
these are things like faulty shoes faulty jeans er faulty furniture faulty cameras faulty video machines erm holidays which have gone UNK wrong complaints about double glazing complaints about builders UNK
you name it
about twenty thousand a year in nottinghamshire alone
now you may think to yourself goodness what an awful lot of complaints
and of course it is
but you do have to put figures like that in some kind of perspective
bear in mind that nottinghamshire is quite a large county there are about one million people living in nottinghamshire
now most of those one million people will go to a shop of some kind pretty well pretty well every day in your life
you might just pop to a corner shop to buy some chocolate and som box of matches some sweets a magazine a newspaper
er all of us go to a shop of some sort pretty well every day
now including of course UNK
now if you multiply that by the one million people living in nottinghamshire you'll see that every day all the year round there are millions of sales taking place
millions of transactions taking place
people buying and selling things
in the great majority of those cases nothing goes wrong
the customer goes away quite happy with their part of their transaction and the shop are quite happy with their part of it
and it's only in the minority of cases where things go wrong that come to the attention at the trading standards department
which means of course if you work for trading standards as i did until very recently if you work for trading standards you tend to get a rather UNK view of shopping
all we ever hear about are disasters and complaints and things that have gone wrong
and we never hear about the thousands and thousands of sales that must take place every day where nothing's gone wrong at all
so
sounds like school
as i say
just like school
it does tend to get you rather UNK
and it is a UNK change to t to talk to someone who's bought something from shop and they have no complaints whatever
now as i say in round figures it's about twenty thousand just in this one county alone
now what we have to do in all those cases is look at every one
first of all ask ourselves is this a genuine problem
is it a real UNK
if it is how has it happened and who erm er who's to blame
is it the customer's own fault
is it the fault of the shop
or are they both at fault
quite honestly a lot of them do turn out to be the customer's own fault
you've probably heard the phrase the customer is always right but believe me it's not true
er and anyone who works for trading standards will tell you it's not true
a lot of you'd be surprised how UNK a lot of people are and frankly a lot of shopping problems do turn out to be the UNK own fault
for example a lot of people change their mind about wanting goods and decide i don't think i want that new pair of shoes after all
or i don't think i want that new pair of jeans
i've taken a dislike to the colour
er and what the law says is if you change your mind i'm afraid the law doesn't UNK you to anything at all
you're only entitled to money back if the goods are faulty in some way
there's got to be something actually wrong with the goods before you can claim money back
so there are a lot of people who change their mind
there are also a lot of people who damage or UNK things they bought from shops usually clothes where people haven't bothered to read the washing instructions
and it might say do not dry clean and the customer has it dry cleaned and of course the garment is very likely going to be ruined
or it might say hand wash only and the customer puts it in a washing machine
so again they wouldn't really be entitled to money back in cases like that
but there are a lot of problems which are the fault of the shop but we find these are usually caused by mistakes and UNK
and we find that mistakes and UNK are a far more common cause of complaint than deliberate UNK or someone trying to UNK you or rip you off
there are UNK traders about unfortunately just as i suppose there are UNK people in most walks of life but we like to think that in nottinghamshire they are in a s small minority
but they do exist
there are undoubtedly er UNK or UNK about
unscrupulous traders
er and it is that minority of unscrupulous traders who make life very difficult for you and of course make life very difficult for trading standards
but most of the problems that we get are not caused by deliberate UNK they're caused by genuine mistakes
what i'd like you to remember is this
people who work in shops are perfectly ordinary people aren't they
just like you and me
and we all make mistakes sometimes
erm i freely admit that i do that myself
i've no doubt bernard does
we all do
however efficient we think that we are if we're honest with ourselves we have to admit we all sometimes make a mistake
and of course the same is true of shop assistants so do please make allowances for human error
and the next time you buy something from a shop and find there's something wrong with it don't just jump to conclusions that you've been deliberately UNK
you may have been of course
but it's much more likely to be due to human error
now out of those four hundred complaints that we receive every week if you take away all those which are the customer's own fault and all those which are caused by genuine mistakes you're still left with a lot of problems which are caused either by ignorance of the law or UNK of the law
do any of you know what the law is called that gives you your rights when you buy
consumer protection act
sale of goods act
pardon
sale of goods act
sale of goods act
well done sir
go to the top of the class
sale of goods act
right
okay
now so the name of the actual act of parliament is sale of goods act er and that's the law that gives you and me and everybody in britain our basic rights every time we buy something from a shop or in a sale or a market stall or by post through a mail order catalogue
it's called the sale of goods act
another phrase that's often used for the same thing is your statutory rights
so if you see that phrase written down anywhere you'll know it means sale of goods act
that phrase your statutory rights is often put in guarantees
i don't know whether you ever take the trouble to read the guarantee
i know a lot of people don't bother
for one thing they're often in very tiny print
for another they're often full of legal
which is a bit difficult to sort out
but if you do read the guarantee you will nearly always find a sentence that says this guarantee does not affect your statutory rights
have you ever noticed that
it's an interesting phrase that
you may have wondered well why is that phrase put in the guarantee
well the reason it's put there is simply to remind you that the guarantee is always a plus or an extra
it's never intended to be a substitute or a replacement for your statutory rights
and even if you UNK the guarantee up and threw it away erm a you've still statutory rights anyway given to you under the sale of goods act
so a guarantee is totally separate and nothing to do really with your statutory rights
now we've had a sale of goods act in britain for a long time
the first one came out in eighteen ninety three
so you could say for exactly a hundred years we've had a basic law designed to give us rights every time we go shopping
but despite the fact we've had that law for so long you'll find that not many people know about it
erm it is if you like a closely UNK secret
obviously the law has been updated since eighteen ninety three
the one we have now is called the sale of goods act UNK nineteen seventy nine
now the sale of goods act is good erm as far as it goes but it's
by no means perfect and there are some UNK in it that we'll have a look at in a moment
right
so let's just have a look then at what our statutory rights are under the sale of goods act
erm and this is the reason why i brought this tape recorder and i was saying to bernard a moment ago one of the most embarrassing things that can happen erm when talking to a group like this is when you pressed a button er whether it's a tape recorder a video machine or whatever you pressed a button full of confidence in all the latest technology and there's an embarrassing silence
and i can the number of times this has happened to me with school video machines
is beyond belief
erm i had one the other day where er it was s supposed to be it was described as a brand new video machine and we got the most perfect picture beautifully clear picture but no sound whatever
even when the sound button was pressed we couldn't get any sound volume m sound out of it whatever
so in the end i said to the chairman oh i'll we'll leave the we'll forget the video
i'll make do with slides
and i pressed the button of the slide UNK again full of confidence
the first slide UNK straight away
UNK
and in trying to free the UNK slide the whole of the UNK tipped upside down
and all my beautifully arranged slides all arranged the right way up and all in the right order all tipped all over the floor
so it was a pretty poor start really i felt to the talk
and then the class started to fight
and then the class started to fight
and i'm sure things like that don't happen in your school
right
er okay
now
so we'll press this then full of confidence and see what happens
this is a typical problem that would come into one of our advice centres where a consumer has bought something f failed to get any satisfaction from the shop and then has gone to the advice centre to er has found and tries to find the nearest UNK advice bureau or advice centre to try to get advice
right
well you all sat listening to that with UNK attention
erm let's just pause a moment there because there's a bit of legal language there that we need to sort out
first of all you will notice that the erm consumer adviser used the word contract which is an important word to remember
and i think that a lot of shoppers tend to forget that every time you buy anything from a shop even if all you spent is ten pence it doesn't matter how little money you've spent but every time you buy anything from a shop you have a contract with the shop and the shop has a contract with you
as a result of that contract of course you have some rights er but the shop have some rights as well
i think one of the problems is that a lot of shoppers don't realize that they're entering into a contract and we don't realize it for the simple reason that most people have as soon as you hear the word contract you have a mental image of a legal document that you sign don't you
if you if you buy a house you sign a contract
and most people think that's what a contract is
but in shopping it's not like that is it
you wouldn't normally sign a legal document
well i suppose you would if you were buying the goods on credit but normally for an everyday transaction buying some food for example you wouldn't normally sign a legal document
you might not even say anything if it's a self service store
in a self service store you choose the goods that you want
you take the goods to the UNK
you hand over your money at the UNK
the goods are then handed to you
you walk out of the shop and the goods are then your property
and it seems on the face of it quite simple and quite straightforward doesn't it
but it's not as simple as it appears
because just by that simple act of handing over your money at the UNK and receiving the goods in exchange just by doing that you have entered into a contract with the shop and as a result of that contract you've got the three rights which the consumer advisor mentioned on the tape
let's just have a look at what those phrases mean in plain UNK in plain english
UNK qualities
that phrase sounds a bit old fashioned nowadays
the word UNK isn't one that's isn't normally used much today
it sounds old fashioned because that's the phrase that's used in the original sale of goods act of eighteen ninety three
i think today we would use a phrase like reasonable quality satisfactory quality or acceptable quality
so all that phrase means in plain english is that the goods should be of a reasonable standard and in particular it means that the goods should not be broken or damaged or faulty and whatever you've bought should work
it's very annoying isn't it if you buy something from a shop and find it won't work
especially if you don't realize that till you've got till you've got home and you realize you've got to go through all the hassle of going back to the shop to complain
so whatever you've bought shouldn't be broken or damaged or faulty and it should work
an example of that would be if you bought a new pocket calculator and then find it won't work then the legal position is the shop have broken their contract with you because they've sold you a pocket calculator which is not of UNK quality and you should be entitled to money back in a case like that
but you besides that you've got two other rights
you've got the right whatever you've bought should be as described which brings us back to your problem of the c d described as UNK dances when really it was country and western
so again the shop have broken their contract with you
or if what would be another example
if you bought some shoes described as leather and they turned out to be made of plastic then clearly you've bought some shoes which are not as described
a sheep if you buy a UNK coat from a market stall then it should be UNK not made of UNK and not made of any other animal
fit for the purpose
that phrase always makes me smile because er my wife recently bought a pair of UNK with three legs in the UNK
and i assure you she would have every right to go back to the shop and say look these UNK are not fit for their purpose
er but seriously that phrase doesn't just mean
fit for the purpose in the general sense it also means fit for the purpose in any particular sense you had made known to the shop
for example if you went into a bicycle shop and said can you sell me a bike suitable for a seven year old child
well that i think that was a quite specific request
or if you went into a d i y shop not me because i'm the world's worst d i y person
but if you did and said can you sell me some erm UNK paint which is non drip and they sell you some matt paint which UNK then clearly they've sold you something which was not fit for the purpose that you had specified
so those three things are called your statutory rights and you've got them as long as you buy the goods from a shop or a trader or someone who's in business
alright
erm but and this is a very big but if you buy privately erm you don't have those three rights any more
buying privately means if you buy from an ordinary member of the public not a shop
for example the classified ads column in the nottingham evening post
the column where people advertise second hand UNK second hand sewing machines second hand cars and all the rest of it
where you're not buying from a trader you're buying from an ordinary member of the public
we call that buying privately
if you buy privately you lose that right straight away
and you also lose that
so what it means is if you buy privately instead of having three statutory rights you've only got one
so you'll see straight away erm by buying privately your legal protection is far more limited than it was before
a good example of that is a car
if you buy a second hand car from a car dealer you would have your three statutory rights under the sale of goods act
but a lot of people buy a second hand car privately and there are pages of these in the nottingham evening post every day you know where people are paying a few hundred pounds or it may be a few thousand pounds for a second hand car
now if you do that the only right you've got in law is that the car should be as described
that would mean that any statement made about the car should ha w should be true
for example a statement about the number of miles it's done or the number it's had
those statements should be true but erm you wouldn't have the right that it was of UNK quality
so you'll see straight away frankly you haven't got much legal protection if you buy privately
and if you do buy a car privately and it turns out to have problems with it there is very little if anything the trading standards department could do to help you
erm simply because your rights are so limited
could i just a
yes
ask a question there
yes
do
difference between a trader and a private person
yes
you know you read the columns and you buy a second hand car and you buy one this week and you read the column next week
yes
and you see the same telephone number you know different model
well it is
and so it goes on
it is UNK because of the big difference between the sales of goods act and buying privately for that reason it is an offence for a trader erm to pretend not to be a trader
if i can put it that way
now you'll find there are a lot of perfectly honest traders in the evening post and the honest ones have put t in brackets to indicate that they are a trader
now an unscrupulous one will as i've said will pretend not be a trader
now that is an offence and the trading standards keep a very and of course the evening post themselves keep a very close check on those phone numbers and it's much easier to do it nowadays with computers
we keep a close check on all those phone numbers to find out are there any traders UNK as private sellers
but that's an important point
but do remember what we've talked about so far is the sale of goods act
but when buying a car or anything from a trader you are also protected by another law called the trade descriptions act which and we've had that law since nineteen sixty eight
so we've had that law for a long time
what the trade descriptions act says is it's a criminal offence for any trader to describe his goods in a false or misleading way
okay
so if for example a UNK car dealer said bargain thirty thousand miles only when really it had done ninety thousand miles then that would be a criminal offence under the trade descriptions act
because he's claiming the car is something which it clearly is not
or if a UNK said you know the rings in my window are made of gold when really they were not made of gold at all then that would be a false trade description
on the streets of nottingham just before last christmas there was some street traders selling coats er which they described as UNK
we UNK they were not made of UNK at all er and we took some of them away and analyzed them to find out what exactly are they made of
and they turned out to be made of UNK
so those gentlemen were not only UNK the sale of goods act they were committing a criminal offence as well by UNK the trade descriptions act so they ended up being prosecuted by trading standards
but i do feel the trade descriptions act is a is a very important er piece of consumer protection designed of course to protect not only you and me as consumer but also designed to protect traders against unfair trading practices
excuse me
can you tell me erm how that applies say if you went and bought an i article of clothing from a market stall
yes
and there were no facilities for you try it on
yes
and when you got it home you found it didn't fit
yes
what are your rights then
if you buy from a market stall that counts as b that counts in exactly the same way as buying from any other er high street UNK
so in other words you're covered by the well you're covered by both the sale of goods act and the trade descriptions act
so but where i know it is a bit difficult with clothes because a market stall erm you don't you don't normally get a chance to try the clothes on erm and you're never absolutely sure are these clothes is this garment going to fit or not
so i always think it feel it's a good idea to say to the UNK look erm if i take this home and try it on and find it won't doesn't fit can i bring it back
and if i can what are you going to offer me
and i think it's much better to get a clear understanding from the market stall at that stage rather than leave it till later
okay
m i mean let's be fair i mean most of the UNK that i've found in nottinghamshire erm are perfectly honest and UNK and many of them been there many years anyway
and of course if they're doing the job probably should be UNK by the local authority in any case
the real problem comes not from market stalls the real problem comes from these people who sell things out of UNK
you know alleged to be gold or silver from UNK
now what should make you very suspicious is a soon as a policeman appears
they disappear like UNK
now that should w alert you that UNK there's something very UNK here
so do be very wary please about buying anything from a street trader
now let's just have a look at some problem areas
er oh before we do that let's just n just listen to a few more seconds of this tape
so i think you'll agree those two things are important as well
that if you change your mind remember you're not entitled to anything
and the other point made by the consumer adviser is try to have a good look at what you've chosen before you walk out of the shop
now i know that's easier said than done
you can't always do it but try to if you can
because what the sale of goods act goes on to say is that if the goods contain a fault which is so obvious you should have noticed the fault while you were in the shop or the shop assistant pointed out the fault to you while you were in the shop then i don't think you can really demand money back on that basis
so what it means is you've got to have UNK about you when you go shopping haven't you
i'm sure you've said this to your class before now
use your UNK
use your UNK
use your UNK as they say in yorkshire and above all pay attention to the way in which the goods are described to you
if the goods are described to you as seconds UNK slightly UNK if any phrase like that is used i think your own UNK should tell you there's something wrong with these goods and that presumably is the reason why they're reduced in price
you've just answered the question
i've just answered the question okay
so the way in which goods are UNK important
now then erm time is an important part of shopping problems isn't it
people often say to me how much time have i got in which i can complain about faulty goods
er and i wish i could give you know a nice clear cut definite answer but the sale of goods act is rather vague on that point
and that i think i feel is one of the UNK in the sale of goods act because it doesn't lay down a definite time limit
all it says is if you do buy something from a shop and realize it's faulty what you should do is take it back to the shop who sold it to you together with your receipt if you've still got it or some other proof of purchase
do that as soon as you can and within a reasonable time says the sale of goods act
now the problem comes of course well that's all very well but how do you define what is a reasonable time
because i think what is a reasonable time is going to vary from one product to another
with shoes i would say you'd normally know pretty quickly
are the shoes faulty or not
because if the shoes are faulty they're going to pretty quickly feel very uncomfortable
with shoes i think you're going to know pretty quickly
but if it's something mechanical like a car erm stereo equipment erm a home computer something like that a washing machine it could be a long time before a mechanical fault became apparent
so what is a reasonable time to complain will i think vary from one product to another
so the only general advice i can give you is you do need to act promptly
if you find some if you realize you've bought something and it's faulty return it to the shop who sold it to you as soon as you can
the quicker you do that the better chances will be of getting your money back
but the longer you leave it the worse your chances are going to get
because there must come a point somewhere in time where the shop will say well you've now had these goods so long they're no longer our responsibility
they're your responsibility
if we take the simple example of shoes
if you buy a p a new pair of shoes and realize they're faulty and you go back the next day and say i bought these shoes from you yesterday i've still got my receipt i believe the shoes are faulty can i have my money back
i think you'll agree you're in a much stronger position that if you left it for months and then went back
you know i think that weak does UNK your case considerably
so time is an important part of all this
erm i've got a heading here sales
a lot of people here think they have no rights when buying goods in a sale and it's quite UNK to think that you've still even though you bought the goods in a sale you should still have your three statutory rights
in fact as far as the law is concerned it's really irrelevant that you bought the goods in a sale
all that matters as far as the law is concerned is did you buy the goods from a shop
if you did are the goods faulty
and were they faulty at the time that you the shop sold then to you
that's all that really matters as far as the law is concerned
erm it is quite unfair and illegal for a shop to try to duck out of their responsibilities to you by pointing to a sign that says no UNK no money UNK
no money UNK on sale goods
all those signs are illegal
and when you think about it they must be illegal cos if a shop puts up a sign saying no money UNK they are trying to take away your statutory rights
you should always be entitled to a refund provided the goods are faulty
that's the point
so don't be put off by a sign that says no money UNK
they pardon
what about the ones where they say well we'll repair it for you
or we'll put it right for you
well they can certainly offer you a repair and of course if you wish to have a repair done that's entirely up to you
you can choose that if you wish
but if the goods are faulty what you're entitled to by law is money back
a cash refund in other words
so that you're in other words you either you're by having the money back in your hand you are then restored to the position you were in before you bought the goods in the first place
all you're en all you can insist on all you can demand is money back
now if the shop want to offer you an alternative that's up to them and you can of course accept if you wish
erm but all you can demand is money back
okay
s some shops put conditions on that don't they
the they say things like no UNK given unless you produce a valid receipt
now when i shop
well
i keep the valid a receipt
yeah
and i've realized that
i'm asking what's the legal position in that
i think i think a shop if you look at from the UNK point of view erm i think it is quite understandable and natural that they would they would either like a receipt or at least they would like to see some UNK
proof of purchase
some evidence
mm
that you bought the goods from them i think that's reasonable
yes i accept
erm
that
i just
yeah
wondering what the legal position was on that
are they legally entitled to say that in fact
they are legally entitled to say either a receipt or some other evidence of purchase
right
fine
but what i'm what i'd like to stress to you is don't abandon hope erm sounds like a religious text actually
don't abandon hope just because you think oh dear i can't find my receipt
mm
because in practice there are alternative ways of proving purchase aren't there
mm
i mean if you've still got the original bag or the UNK or the box or the price
yeah
tag
in practice a lot of shops will accept that
if you paid by cheque or credit card again you would have some evidence that you spent that money
we had a problem with the electrical place UNK erm over something rather different like that
we bought our daughter a UNK player one christmas erm she opened it threw the box away
four days later it packed up
UNK refused to exchange it because we didn't return it in the original packaging
they did exchange it in the end but i had to be very UNK and it took three months
mm
mm
they said that i should return it in its box with the receipt
i didn't have the box
i did have the
d
receipt
you did have the receipt
oh yes
well i think that should have been sufficient myself
mm
it was in the end but it took
yeah
letters to head office to
yes
do it
yes
and i think you'll agree it is a difficult i mean i always stress this point about attitude that a lot of problems that we get in our advice centres have been made worse because the customer has caused er you know argument or a scene
mm
in the shop
erm and it does make it very difficult then for trading standards then to pick up the pieces
and i know it's very easy for me to stand here and say you know try to keep calm and polite and reasonable
and that brings us back to your point that there are times when you know you have in order to get your statutory rights you've got to be pretty firm
and i feel that it is a difficult UNK in practice it is difficult balance to achieve to be polite but to be firm at the same time erm but and there are times when that has to be done
now while we're on this point about what exactly am i entitled to erm we ought to say a word about credit notes cos there are a lot of shops who say well erm you know it is it isn't company policy to it isn't our policy to offer UNK but we're quite happy to offer you a credit note
a lot of customers accept that because they don't really know what their statutory rights are
but that brings us back to the point we were UNK a moment ago if the goods are faulty you're entitled to money back a cash refund
er you need only accept a credit note if the problem is your own fault in some way
for example if you've changed your mind and decide you didn't want the goods or if you had damaged the goods and the shop offer you a credit note i think you really have to accept that with good grace cos it is really your fault
but if the goods are faulty you'd have the right to decline the credit note and ask for money back
i if i could just come in there you mentioned this er if you changed your mind on goods and you seemed to be defining the legal position
you've got you know some of the well known er shops like marks and spencers who will take things back and don't ask for a
yes
is this just
yes
a matter of customer
with marks and spencers it is a matter of customer relations
they are going beyond what they have to do by law and all credit to them for doing that
but the reason why they do that of course is they would like you to keep coming back
and trading with them as a happier and satisfied customer
after all a UNK doesn't want a lot of UNK customers walking about
he'll want you quite naturally to keep on trading with him
but and but marks and spencers are really going and there are plenty of other firms beside them who do it but they are going beyond what they strictly have to do by law
er but there are of course h n while we're on that point there are i'm afraid there are s people who take advantage of marks and spencers erm because they know there's going to be no problem about having goods exchanged so what they do they buy something from marks and spencers wear it on one evening for a party or special occasion
take it back the next day
and it's th they get the money back
now none of you would dream of doing anything like that
thank you for that
i'll
erm with sales
yes
er very often in the shop it says no refund on sale goods
yeah
now i if that is strictly wrong why do the shops put the sale notices up
well as i've said signs like that are illegal
if you do see a sign like that please or any words that mean the same thing like no UNK no money UNK no money UNK on sale goods any of those phrases will you please let UNK your nearest trading standards office know
and we will get the sign taken down
they are allowed to put a sign that say no goods exchanged
or it might say no sale goods exchanged
that's okay that's within the law
but no money UNK is not within the law
alright
mm
so do please let bring it to the attention of trading standards
since yes since you can't exchange the goods then
no because you don't have a legal right to have the goods exchanged
but you can take it back and say i want my money
you can
yes
yeah
erm but there are a few what i call golden rules to avoid becoming one of these four hundred people every week who come into our advice centre
i would say golden rule number one is keep receipts
very important
unfortunately you can't insist on having a receipt because there's no law that says shops have got to give receipts
perhaps there ought to be a law like that but there isn't at the moment
so you can't demand one but you can always ask
way round that
you can say can i have a receipt please
there is one way round that
right
if they're vat registered
yeah
and you insist on a vat receipt
vat receipt
yes
they have got to give you one
okay
er it is important as i've said about we were talking a moment ago
pardon
about evidence of purchase
no
erm
they have got to give a receipt
it is important because if you do buy something from a shop and realize there's something wrong with it if you take it back the first thing the shop would say to you is can i see your receipt
or they may say have you any proof of purchase
you don't need to UNK them for years i know some people who UNK receipts for years
every five years or so have a glorious clear out and throw all the old
y you don't need to get to quite to those lengths but er
you certainly do need to keep them for a while
what i mean by that is er try to have a good look at what you've chosen before you walk out the shop
now that was the point i made a few moments ago
legal documents by that i mean be very wary of signing any kind of legal document in a shop
let's take the example of a cooker
if you decide you want to a buy a new cooker and you go to the gas UNK or the electricity UNK and say i'd like to buy that cooker there and i would like to spread the payments over time normally nowadays twenty four months or thirty six months
nothing wrong with that it's a perfectly er respectable and UNK way of shopping provided of course you know what you're doing and you d you don't get carried away
but a lot of the problems that come into our advice centre have been caused by people signing erm credit agreements and then realizing they can't afford the payments
now to go back to the example of the cooker if you do say that in the UNK you will certainly be asked to sign a legal document
a credit agreement
but be very careful because once you've signed it becomes a legally binding document it will be very difficult to back out of it
you'll need a solicitor to get out of it believe me
if you sign the document in your own home as you would do with a doorstep salesman er then the law does give you a chance to change your mind although i hope for goodness sake you would all be very wary about signing any kind of legal document thrust under your nose from a doorstep salesman
but if you did that the law does give you what they call a cooling off period
what a lovely phrase
they give you a cooling off period of seven days in which you can change your mind have second thoughts and cancel the credit agreement
but you don't have that privilege i'm afraid if you sign it in gas UNK electricity UNK or a shop so be very careful
or UNK
or UNK
so do be very careful about that
right
now
the case of checking the case of checking the goods number two there
yes
that's increasingly difficult these days with UNK and
it is
i agree
yes
and it always UNK me
when i want to buy a shirt that men's shirts are usually all sealed up in a package
with a multitude of pins
yeah
and it's very difficult to have a close look at the shirt without taking the whole thing to
mm
pieces
so you take it pieces
but er
you can it to pieces i don't w i don't want the package
did that
what all i wanted
yes
but if you can do that try and do that
now this leaflet which i'm going to give you in a moment er is called how to put things right which i is quite a good title for a leaflet like this
how to put things right
but perhaps a better title might be how to prevent things going wrong on the argument you know that prevention is better than cure and rather than trying to put problems right which have already happened it might be better to try to prevent them happening in the first place
and i do feel that by just following a few simple rules like that we can avoid a lot of the problems that come into our advice centre
now i want to allow a bit more time for questions so i'll just end if i may with a funny story which didn't happen to me it happened to a colleague of mine erm a young lady who went to give er a talk like this to group of adults like yourselves and at the end of the meeting the treasurer went up to her and said do we owe you any fee or expenses
no thank you she said
no fee and no expenses
ah thank you very much she said we're very UNK very much appreciate the fact that you've given up your time to come and talk to our members you see we can't afford to pay for really good speakers
UNK of course she off
right
well thank you very much for listening and if there are any more questions i'll be very pleased to
okay
thanks john
right
finally
th the legal documents you know th going back to the cooker
do you have the right to take the documents out to look at them a and read them
because if you're buying something like
yes
that in a shop it's extremely difficult to go through all the
yes
bits and pieces and
mm
yes
realize what you're doing
but if i remember correctly on one of the UNK on television going back sort of two three months ago one of the firms and i think it was an electrical firm was working a bit of a UNK one erm they were getting people to sign a document which UNK i think to be erm l UNK money hire agreement
but it wasn't actually it were something else and people were finding that their goods were UNK because they couldn't keep up the payments
mm
now can you take the documents
certainly and i that's a good very point a very good question
erm let's face it can be very UNK when the salesman UNK the document under your nose just sign here sir or just sign here madam just a UNK you understand erm we'll fill in we'll fill in the details later
it's very it's very UNK especially if it's something that you badly want as happened to me recently when i'd set my heart on buying a new erm video recorder
and i thought to myself if all i've got to do is put my signature on this piece of paper and without actually paying any money down any cash down at all i can a actually walk out of the shop carrying the video recorder
and it is very UNK when you've set your heart on something like that
and v very UNK indeed
but you're but you're quite right you certainly you certainly have the right to say look you know rather than signing this now er i do need some time to think i mean let's face it there's a load of s if you turn it over on the back of the credit agree
function engineer is responsible for issuing to the client
that's yeah
UNK urgent work
yeah
that's er procedure d two stop three
and that's the UNK is it
yeah
yeah
yeah
two
it is
it's sort of following the UNK of part of er UNK empire
thus making it even cheaper
for to a smaller an empire
i should use that word that was used very UNK that word cheap
what
cheap
i mean i'm briefed
on that
mm
okay
so the urgent work procedure has now been removed to make life easier
d two
and to let the client know where the job lies within our organization
good
given a point of
straight into a function and that function head will then s write to the client saying i've got it
my project coordinator is mr x and then we've got the point of contact established straight away
there are quite a few fairly minor changes to the appointment contract procedure but i haven't i don't pretend intend briefing those because i think most people can read
right
so they should be aware there are some
yeah
right
er j two stop zero
trainees training report file
yes
erm there is a requirement that all trainees and new starters within the group who are having training reviews undertaken will maintain a training file
so they know where to find and we know where to find all their bits of reports and the like
their performance reports training r reviews schedule of objectives etcetera
and that's j two stop zero
e five stop one
contract documents and specifications for works and bridges
e five stop one
sorry
there is an x on it
works bridges and q and q s
erm there is now a standard pro UNK for identifying UNK damages
the project engineer to agree with the client what the UNK damages ought to be
and there's a pro UNK that goes through to the quantity UNK section
p on it either
mhm
eh
yours
erm
got p on
no
con h five stop two
contract variation orders
erm contract variation orders are to be signed by the project engineer irrespective of value
er subject to him of course having the UNK necessary financial authority from the project manager or the client
there are
mm
arrangements in here that if it's in the middle of a possession and the project engineer cannot be contacted then obviously the resident engineer can sign it
erm but obviously there's er a need the need to advise the project engineer and the project manager erm following the possession
can i can i raise a small point on that
that is
mm
a number of my staff have repeatedly asked me the question what is a project engineer
and i've told them what a b e s one is and they said why
why are works ones different then
why couldn't
they aren't
m s ones be project engineers
in works
and yet in b e s they're only twos and threes
could be anybody
well
project engineers are
you've lost me
t o and s t o level
surely not
but you would erm you would allow an s t o to sign a v o of any value
the only people who sign
point good point
v os are those who are delegated within the contract to do
mm
so
yes
that's what it says though don't it
and that's what it says
the value of authority from the client
yeah
so it will be in your letter of delegation
yeah
which brings up the main point and that is we have got to make sure that those people who are nominated or delegated within the terms of the contract are people who have the knowledge and experience
mhm
yeah
to discharge
mhm
that duty
mhm
then there's i i'm the only person
quite a long time now i begin to understand there are m s twos and threes are project engineers and i
not necessarily
no
er
they can be
that was certainly my understanding and certainly
no
if that is not the case then i'm gonna have to change the consultation documents because
no
it's terminology isn't it
no
because the consultation
we've
documents clearly set out to the staff what i thought was our collective understanding of the section engineer UNK project engineer relationship
right
that section engineers at m s four level er acted as project UNK or looked after their own element of the
yeah
work negotiated the er
the fee
the fees
yeah
and the remit with the client and then delegated to the work to a project engineer
and the project engineers were m s twos on medium jobs small jobs and m s threes on larger jobs
and they were supported by a pool of engineers and UNK at
mm
m s one and p n t created
yeah
but why can't the engineer at m s one level be project engineer
because his responsibilities are different
in terms of
well
that's fine
your using a name
oh no
he's responsible
no
because within our within our procedures and our quality systems the word project engineer UNK up quite a lot
project team
yeah
but it's not defined as er an m s two or an m s three
i mean take the example that hugh is always using is that if i wanted to knock a wall through a hole through that wall and put a door in there with a link in it surely to goodness we
right
don't need an m s two
if that's
mm
the case then can i suggest that we define within our quality systems that project engineers will be m s twos or above for check categories of zero or above and that for jobs with a category of double zero
oh no
they can't be beneath
very making it very rigid
yes
you see what our policy is m s two except b except by exception
for instance erm we would give certainly the better m s ones the smaller jobs to project manage but that has to be very carefully thought about
project engineer
project engineer
that's right
what happens if everybody wants to
panel view this
now i would imagine if we had suggested
in broad terms
i would imagine that if we'd suggested that project engineering duties would UNK
could be done at m s one
at m s one and s t o
thank you
we wouldn't have we
levels the then
wouldn't have no m s threes
then none of our m s threes
would have come back at m s three
what concerns me is the project engineers are in close liaison with the client and have a lot of procedures to go through that er s t os and m s ones at design engineering level do not have to go through
they do have a much greater responsibility
and particularly i mean just signing the v os because if it's UNK up the UNK been asked of me
you know
if you have an s t o in a sense if you don't define what the project engineer is what grade he is he can sign off UNK amounts of money
it doesn't seem right does it
i it seems well
no
but the point t that UNK makes is that y you allocate er y you make the project engineer someone who have trained and that you know is capable of doing that job
yeah
well i can think of one m s one in our er office who i'd be quite erm quite happy with him doing all the project UNK engineering duties except finance
because he just has you know a very slap happy er attitude towards finance but from an engineering point of view you can trust him
mm
so this means you daren't give him anything now
well in that case i wouldn't put him on er on a job that was made out on site but i would keep him in the
t as far as the allocation of erm the project engineering responsibilities that forms part of the quality plan
that he is given a note as part of the quality plan saying here you are son you are now project engineer
these are your duties
you are responsible for that job and you are identified on the project quality plan check list as to what you will be doing and what other members of the team will be doing
he couldn't live by it
you know it d the first thought bloody hell
if you don't want to use it don't use it
s t o with UNK signing power
there's an UNK here
but if you don't want to use it don't
and anyway he can't he can't actually spend this money unless he's got
oh yeah
oh yeah
UNK authority from the project manager
but there may be there may be
i think we're discussing two issues here
can we can we bottom the v o
yeah
one as a start
i don't see there's a problem with the v o one because
it's
nobody can issue v os unless they're delegated to do so in the letter that's signed by me
i rely on you gentlemen
and they have got the permission of the project manager to spend that money
yeah
correct
yeah
i rely on you gentlemen to make sure
too right
that the people who are delegated are competent to discharge those duties
yeah
an and i must admit that i wouldn't i would not expect to see anybody delegated within the contract at less than m s one level
because i just don't think they i they're competent to do the duties of the UNK representative because you need a knowledge of the contract
tt
well
there are some jobs that we get involved with are very small
we've had john on
yeah
john 's been on jobs and he's er
well
he's been as the r e which is reasonable to be fair
yeah
so's steve
we
as r e
we
delegated to issue site instructions
yes
but not v os
not v os
well
no
th the letter of delegation
pardon
is very specific because
yes
the contractor is very specific
yes
but we need
the contract sorry is very specific
i'm not being funny but we're UNK now at the difference between
yeah
site instructions and v os
no
no
well
no
no
we're not
no
we're not
site
yeah
instruction does not involve any er any a an
financial
any financial commitment
and it doesn't change the contract
so i mean
b t
the reason why no the reason why these
but they do
procedures were written is because in the past we had that UNK situation
mm
mm
and i wanted to clarify that and make sure that our procedures actually were back to back with contract procedure
so i think in terms o of this particular erm procedure we're okay
mm
where we're not okay is in the point that jim has raised the general point and that is what do we mean what do we d define as a project engineer
so junior r es then will not issue v os
unless they're delegated t to do so within the contract and i rely on you to make sure that whoever is delegated to issue
what if they're wh what if they're below m s two level
no
no r e will issue a v o
they might do if they're m s two i mean the project engineer
if it's the project engineer
yes
yeah
fine
specifications here trevor
with regards to
on one two or
yeah
three does it use the word th the term
no
project engineer
definitely
not in the erm er in the m s ones
i it involves
does in the two and threes
about erm
does in the two and threes
does in the two and threes
yes
cos senior in a lot
i mean th that's the title
senior project engineer and project engineer
yeah
cos that's where my understanding was
oh
so it's a different issue now
that's the second issue that you've brought up
it is
well
i wanted to bottom that one because i think it's a fairly easy one to do
then go on to jim's point of come on lads
what do you mean
by a project engineer
mm
so that's okay
and that's the so let's put that to one side and let's
debate
yeah
we'll start that with questioning
jim's point
my office
mm
mm
yeah
there isn't a definition then within the procedures of what a project UNK duties are
yeah
the first book on the left there dave by the big fat volume that's called
to the left of your UNK
that's it
ta
where
wha what do we want a project engineer to do
i want him to do an m s two or three
what do we want him to do
come on
manage that project
through from conception to completion
un unfortunately it raises the question of the project coordinator whose role
mm
mm
talk to you about you know ne next week
mm
because it's all rolled into the same thing
right
i say it's
shall we leave it till then
responsibility
right
let us leave it till then because i mean otherwise we're gonna get UNK down in this and whe when we really are briefing procedures
yeah
but you've raised a very valid point and it's one that we need to see through to the end
i can s i can see
the role o of
i can see what you're driving at
the role of a project engineer is defined in q s p six
which roger hasn't seen yet
yeah the role
but he but it is the day to day d detailed development
of a project to meet the cost specification and timescale defined in the client's remit
undertake the requirements of the project quality plan
undertaking all design construction installation to meet all necessary current standards statutory requirements a and the civil engineering design manual er safety manual
in a broad sense
mhm
which seems alright
yeah
l let us then debate i mean you actually have a load of projects which are maybe two or three thousand pounds UNK
mm
where i presume you would just wanna hand that out to some guy and say get on with it
and that guy may be an m s one
the problem is a lot of those are not being managed properly by the m s ones m s twos
right
we will
yeah
okay
let's debate that then when we get together
thanks for raising it jim
fair point
have you read what
it's important that we nail it down very quickly because the UNK reports depend very much upon the input of the project engineer
project engineer
the only the there is only the project engineer can get into the databases to put anything in or their clerical support to get anything into the general notes about that particular
yeah
project
i think we're meeting early next week UNK
yeah
tuesday isn't it
tuesday
so we'll bottom that tuesday
okay
could i briefly go back to UNK damages because there's nothing in the procedure i think that says what happens when you send that form to the client he says i haven't a clue
what do you think
cos that's exactly what's gonna happen
because i've seen
oh dear
that form before and they will not know what to put on it or what they
you may be l well be right there
maybe to tell them what UNK damages
they need leading by the hand gentlemen
can't we just put a clause
we need we need no
they don't
organize everyone by us
perhaps we should set the course up
course up and
eh
absolutely i like that
yeah
no
it's very frustrating because i've never known a client who knew what his losses were
we'll run a course for project managers
as hugh is indicating that th that we have got a degree of expertise and we should be offering that expertise to clients
well we can tell him how much we'd be charging them to
no
no
no
what we've got to do is say look within the terms of the contract
this is what
this is what you have to do
you have to make a genuine pre estimate of your
losses
mm
so can we talk about what your losses are
we w suggest that you have losses under the heading of er
mm
disruption to traffic loss of revenue so on and so forth
mm
and i think we have er a part to play in that
mm
what about my extra costs
and your extra supervision costs
no
i was thinking about the client's extra costs
oh
then the gain
actually
UNK by three weeks
the fact that we've still got our supervision
yeah
but we put that in
yeah
but during
not only that
yeah
but we should be UNK them
course that we know about it
well there's the fact that he might have borrowed the money for a ten million pound project and he can't have a use of it because it's named and he's paying interest
on that ten million pounds
extended plus services for diverted traffic and so on
be discussed
yeah
yeah
so what
good
it needs is it needs us to have an input with their project manager to evaluate them
that's right
a and the forms as it stands picks up most of the points that we've just raised
does it have a box for us to put our costs in
oh yeah
it starts off with that
thank god for that
th they're not our costs terry
they're his costs
yeah
mm
i mean we charge him
correct
he's the one that
no
but
correct
why
and we can tell him how much we're gonna charge him but it's up to him or whatever
i mean quite clearly with something like this when we start using it it's gonna throw up all sorts of
yeah
problems
mm
we have we have had that form kicking around for quite a long time and it's never really been
right
it's easier for
well now is the time for everyone to be aware of it
that's right
we're now proceeding
UNK and joyce did a twenty five page memo
mm
what on UNK damages
next
shut up
s safe okay
procedure k zero stop one safety related admin
i'm making the point that man management procedures erm sorry safety instructions and information and safety information will not be issued via management procedures
management procedures w will relate will only contain procedures relating to the admin of safety matters
yes
good
excellent
go back to the clerical section
you you'll you were UNK about
i've been fighting this b
that my friend
i've been fighting this battle for four years and we've eventually got there
mm
good
good
next
it was
erm maintenance and use of portable electrical apparatus k nineteen stop one
the safety one
er it talks about erm
safety admin one
safety admin one
the functions clerical section maintaining registers
business and planning manager will ensure a UNK in place for routine inspection
business and business manager will ensure that inspection reports are UNK to the function heads after inspections
and there's talking about labelling of UNK equipment and what have you
good
and i've been ordered to
right
mhm
by plant well will be by plant
right
erm m for mother four stop one payment application by contractors
erm there are quite a few in this series which follow the same sort of thing is that er all projects all jobs on site er will have a quantity surveyor from dave 's section
erm and will
eh
nominated
to do all the post contract measure work
nominated
come on
let's what you're doing is you're winding them up UNK
i'm not
i can't believe dennis would be UNK enough to wind anybody up on p on a subject that he's so UNK in
that's that isn't
yes
go on
i've been told to change these procedures to
just taken the knife out of your back
right
the project q s is responsible for agreeing all site measurements normally UNK these personally
however when specifically requested by the project q s the resident engineer or the project engineer may obtain this information
a project q s is responsible for agreeing all UNK and for processing all UNK for payment for physical work and passing these to the client for payment
so what's the change
because on many jobs certainly smaller jobs er the resident engineer or the project engineer would
be doing the
and normally they will do that and in the future
well
yes it will
they can say yeah th the project q s is just gonna say measure me all
that's right
i haven't time to go and do that
what i'm looking for this is part of
i know
sorry
this is part of the
the spirit
the reason this came about dennis is because some people were playing UNK and UNK
and the spirit of the exercise is that we will work as a team and the most cost effective procedure will exist
and in m in many cases the most cost effective procedure will be for the lad on site the r e or the assistant r e to measure and provide the measure to the q UNK who will put that forward and process that in the way they do now and send out a certificate
and i don't see anything contentious about that
can i take it that if
i don't i don't like how it is worded then because i don't think you said that
sorry to
no
it was worded that way because there are
it says the project q s is responsible for agreeing all site measurements
that's what it says
yes
he is responsible for that
he is
and he may delegate that
he may delegate to
i agree with you but
and in many cases will delegate that
he is also responsible for the valuation
he has raised it with the contractor
it doesn't say that here
it does
but there's no
the letter of delegation normally says that
it says normally it says normally obtaining them personally
the letter of delegation has always said that q s will measure
yeah
yeah
measure the works
re
in the past
words
the resident engineer has been doing the measure and also agreeing the UNK
well i don't think
now
what UNK saying is that will be done
th that responsibility
UNK
UNK because we've got this
mm
perhaps you do
which
personally i don't think really there's a need for a great deal of site measurement
i think i think it should all be you know basically it should be done from
the offices
because they've dug a big hole doesn't mean you measure the big hole
it's all part of the measuring anyway
you're paying for the hole they should have dug provided it was at least as big as they
in accordance with the and the er the
what do you call it
yeah well
the
UNK
UNK
can i take it then that these items will be clearly defined when the project coordinator UNK with the team quantity surveyor at the
who does what
yes
who does what because
yes
i don't want any more s in instances where the quantity surveyor thinks he's got a certain fee that he's working to only to find out later
hear
on that somebody's knocked it down by half and not told him
because that causes all sorts of problems on the report and bad blood all round
course it did
it's not what team work's
i mean i no
i would reiterate that my objective is a very simple one and that is to give the client the most cost effective service we can
er with this instruction it will get picked up on the quality
co in accordance
er check list
good
good
could i could i could i ask that b e s be taken off the distribution codes
we do not use quantity surveyors for that purpose and indeed the quantity surveyor is not geared up to do any measurement for us
so you want that
the answer to that is
UNK then
no
because i think that there should be no reason why the q s shouldn't provide you with that service in the same way as he provides anybody else jim
unless there's
but he's but he's not geared up to do it
but you've got erm a q s then
we have
i'm not too sure that means
well i think i think bloody UNK
we all were
in there like
electrical away isn't it
mis yeah
mister metal
that's wound the buggers up
metal UNK
really
metal UNK
well that's
really a bright UNK
you know
yeah
what i'm
but erm
what i suggest is these procedures are we briefly mentioned this morning are supposed to reflect the best practice of what we do now
yeah
that is not what we do now
that is actually saying to the q s you've now got authority to come in to b e s and effectively do what you do on the civil side
and what i'm saying is he's certainly not geared up to undertake that task
and that certainly hasn't
jim
been debated
on in many cases
mm
go on
i mean if i took your line your logic and maybe i'm UNK it er we would not have changed anything when b e s came into to our organization
and one of the most significant changes i wanted to make and i think we have made was that the letting of contracts and the UNK of contracts and so on would be done by our q UNK in the same way as it is for the civil work
indeed
for a very simple purpose and that is that it UNK our internal control
yeah
it puts an in a almost er an independent view in there of the costs and valuation of variations and so on
now i think perhaps you're worrying unduly jim in so far as your men will continue to administer contracts in the way they do now
the they still issue the certificate to the client which is signed off price correct
yes
for them to sign off price correct they have got to have had a look at the measure
haven't they
well they don't
that's just it
if we're to be if we end up being audited on that then we will fail the audit because we do not do that
that's what i'm saying
that is supposed to say what we do and what i'm saying is
yeah
we don't do that
i'm not saying we shouldn't do it i'm saying we don't do it
well i'll leave that for you to manage
and procedures should not say what we don't do
i agree with you
they should say what we do
or
or what we ought to do
yes
oh no
no
no
ah
if we're not UNK with the procedures that's a different
well it i mean if we go down that
a different ball game
path er jim then we're gonna have er five or six set different volumes of procedures
yes
because we all do things slightly different at present
if that is necessary then that is of course what happened and indeed in many cases that is exactly what happened
there is nothing wrong
you have a UNK
with that
but
you have a different quality system for different offices
but UNK is
well you have to do in some cases
yes
but UNK is saying as far the works office is concerned he wants to UNK the system with this procedure
and as i understood you
yeah
again you wanted the to UNK the system with within the b e s office
we well i do unless that doesn't make sense
now i can't see why it doesn't make sense but if jim came to me and said look hugh that's bloody silly
i mean our objective is to give the client a good efficient cost effective service that doesn't meet those
objectives
but d dave could not handle in b e s what he UNK on the civil side
in what respect
h he is not UNK up to do what
could quite easily ask you to do all the erm
running around
the actual measure the site measurements but the agreeing the UNK and the processing of the UNK he does himself
and that is w well within what this procedure says
i mean he does the UNK now doesn't he
well i understood so
or the certification to the client
yes he does he does the certificate
yeah
so really all it all the this would
involve them
doing would be to say would you project engineers er or engineers collect the in information on site provide it to the quantity surveyors so they can check it against the spirit of the contract and make sure that er what's proposed to be UNK they're happy with
well it doesn't say that though
yes
it
sorry
it's
let's
what i'm what i'm saying is if you want to really UNK people up bring in a procedure within telling them what you're doing and then UNK implement it at a later date and people will say this is not quality
hey jim
you will
the reason why we're the reason why we're doing this now is to
right
try and achieve that objective
mm
not t to drop it straight on them but to say
look this is one we're introducing this is the way we in intend to use it
mm
i mean there might be the odd situation the big job where the q s would need to go and
right
get involved in the measures on some of your work
well he doesn't
that's what i'm saying
he hasn't done yet
you can't have that he doesn't
have a word with dave and ask him himself
dave was a party to this s
d dave wrote this
procedure
did the change
well you may be certain he didn't consult with me
yeah
and that's the point i'm making
mm
these procedures should be UNK you know part of management consultation not part of the dave writes it if he like says well that's what we'll do for b e s and then and then i'm told oh that's what we do for b e s i tell staff and that causes a great deal of UNK in staff
hey jim why
why
back on him
jim
cos i haven't had an opportunity to do it to
why should b e s be a different a different situation from bridges or works
well in theory certainly probably there is no reason for it but in practice it hasn't happened yet this is the point
it hasn't actually happened
yes
you're implementing a procedure here that doesn't exist is what jim's saying
you're implementing a procedure
within b e s
which says you're gonna do this
right
sorry
sorry
no
it doesn't say that
this procedure should say you do this
that's what we're doing at the moment
right
he's quite right in saying
book is an instruction
yeah
and jim's
quite right in saying it does not happen
but it's not the first time that a UNK
finished
come out early
so you've implemented a procedure for wh which you haven't set up you haven't even looked at the resource information
but can be briefed
we are introducing a procedure
yes
and in order to c come in and say
like that
no
why don't you do this
and i could say well i i've never done this
i can't do this and q s is not geared up to do it
what
and straight away we say well this procedure doesn't work
yeah
but it's
right
yeah
come out it's come out early
damn it all
we had a procedure erm about senior project engineers er about two years before we
we've gotta keep repeating that
er
does it
put that into the bridge office in
mhm
intended
right
the thing with this the thing that UNK me a bit er
just because you booked that
on this and i'll reiterate this is the process that we go through as i understand it for introducing procedures is that we take a UNK slice through the organization er in other words there's a draft procedure produced
that is sent round to people who will have been involved
they have the opportunity to input it is amended er taking account of the comments
taking account of some of the comments
it can never take account of all the comments
of course it can't
it will always be compromise
but by a very virtue of the draft going round and being commented on people are aware then
we don't see
mm
all the UNK
no
wh what wh where
going on
that falls down hugh is that people assume because they've commented that when it comes out in its final version it'll reflect their particular comment
they never get a feedback saying thanks for those comments but i've those because i thought somebody else's
comments were more
a lot more slice
no
no
not
it's just a modification from
yeah
the UNK
l lots of the UNK are not UNK and certainly in cases like this where
mm
it is a er a specific
direct
request or a direct request that something is changed then it
is given to in this particular case the dave s of the world or other function heads and told
i would still like to issue
that
er a and i think we issue it and then t in jim's situation erm i think what you tell your staff is that this has been issued and we are gonna find a way of erm working it in your organization
or if it is impossible to do so then we will have to have a look
well surely it just means that in jim's organization
i don't see the problem
that when specifically requested w will apply in
in ninety nine percent of the cases
that will be reflected in the quality plan anyway
so
yeah
where's
yes
the problem
mm
yeah
i don't see a problem
but when your project
UNK talk to
in concept there should not be a problem
the erm
you might not have a problem
q s
in four weeks time
with dave but at the moment if we're audited tomorrow
well as i understand it this is what's happening at
well i still don't
present
i don't i still don't
no
but
accept that
at present effectively that
he agrees UNK
mm
mhm
and he can delegate the site measurement to your staff
and in most cases will do
as long as it's a you do your
and he processes the paper
and once you do a quality plan for that delegation
anything to your section at the moment does he
no
it's the other way round
yes
yeah that's true
for long enough i've said budget engineers run the job
yeah
where i mean our invariably our in involvement is much greater than the q s
naturally
and many of my staff in s in not just but one or two others see this as the tail UNK the dog if you like where somebody says you will do so and so or you know i'm telling you you'll do this
now it's how you read that into that procedure
that's the problem with it
there's no problem i
i understand that
mean that you know why
why should the q s estimate all our work
mm
the there is no real good reason
why he shouldn't
why he shouldn't other than the fact that keeping
in fact there's a
up to date
there's a very good reason why he
could he do that
should
perhaps
is he doing that now
no
no
no
not yet
no
but he does he does
all yours
i thought we had a
yeah
procedure that said they did it
aha
we do
yeah
b e s
well you told me
i mean come on it's the same ball game
yeah
i mean i
it is the same ball game and as far as i as far as i'm concerned it makes more sense
so why aren't the q s
for
b e s work now
and p way work
and p way work cos that's what you've said it does and you you're
we are doing
i'm afraid i'm not helped much
we are doing
i'm gonna call a halt to this here because without david here who
right
knows the detail we all we're gonna do is enjoy the sound of our own voices
i think
so what i'm what i propose is that this goes out because i don't think it changes anything significantly
erm jim you need to present it in a certain way to your staff and er after you've considered that if you don't feel it's UNK then i think you need to talk to david and i
yeah
well i've already for a number a number of cases spoken to dave about it
and he knows this can't be worked
that's why
well i
i'm rather surprised that it's we're
will it work
still UNK this
well alright then
the other option
a and the s on the m as it were
yes
right
the oth the other the other option is for us to hold that
because it was supposed to be briefed last
mm
month
well in that in that case
when
i've seen i've seen all this
mm
in that case when
it is ours
well we can't
we've got a
right
in that case jim you say to your staff that you're gonna have a dialogue with dave and myself with a view to UNK how it will be implemented as far as your organization is concerned
but surely
we can still issue it we can still brief
this issue
that issue
of course you can
yes
well
it is
work
it's been issued roger
i think i personally i think everyone's got to work to it until they find it doesn't work
ca can't you just can't jim just brief his staff but er as far as that's concerned w he takes it that the q s has asked him to do all the site measurement er and that they will then produce the certification
mm
based on that
yeah
the
i
only re yes by all means
our project quality plan check list reflects that
naturally your
mm
your way out is to get
d dave to write a letter saying for all projects i wish him to do
y no
no
no
terry there's no point
all that all that
that is stupid
all that jim's trying to do
the reason why
is to change
i don't mean that in a UNK way
no
no
i know but
it is stupid in so far as the more UNK if we were gonna do that all you'd do is you'd write
the procedures in a different way
yeah
the procedures
were written in this way because erm there was a move from a certain part of the organization to exclude the q UNK from elements of work on an unreasonable to an unreasonable extent
now if we work as a team and we work very sensibly and reasonably it may wo may well be that the most sensible way of working is for the project engineer to decide who's gonna do the site measure
but at the end of the day these guys sign off price correct
these guys therefore must have a facility of ensuring that the price is correct from an internal control point of view i want them to be involved in UNK that the price is correct
that is how we came to the conclusion that they should be
i certainly think there's a great deal of sense in it all
but we don't even measure yet
i i've yet i've got a major job on my hands to UNK people and bring in systems for much more accurate measurement of our work
it's a very difficult job to measure is m and e
mm
well a lot of them are just
because
lump sums aren't they
well i mean a lot of it can't be measured you know
mm
mm
hundreds of miles of UNK
UNK
on a site
UNK
for example
yeah
you know we are not geared
s
up to measure yet properly
and we need to be
right
so i'm saying we're wa way off what the procedures are currently saying
a and all i'm saying is that and i rest my case
mm
is that
if we came to be audited
procedures should be what is happening not what our aspirations are
no
i'm sorry
particularly when they're long way
no
but when you're measuring something
i don't want otherwise you finish up with five separate er management procedures
but also is it necessary
jim
so we can make
let's issue that
because
you david and i need to sort out what we need to do to implement it
yeah
and we will then implement it
for you
we've also gotta recognize clearly dennis that UNK and m and e cannot be UNK they are very different engineering
i'm s not suggesting they could
and some management procedures cannot work very well in m and e as they can in UNK
not because
mm
you know we don't want to in the UNK team or what have you
indeed it works very well
but in some cases some procedures cannot be worked on m and e
yeah
engineering
they've got totally different UNK
well it is supposed to be talking about managing the system and not d not taking people's e professional expertise away from them
i mean but if
yes
if we are gonna have
it is a problem
procedures which are don't quite fit you then i think what we ought to be looking for is a certain amount of common ground between your procedure and our procedure so there is not something you're doing something completely different to the way the rest of us are doing it
no
i totally agree with you
it's gotta be married together
totally agree with you
cannot UNK every function under a management procedure
it just cannot work every time
right
the on the procedures should be flexible er written in such a flexible way
yeah
that those UNK of the different sections can be accommodated
th they should reflect the best practice shouldn't they
yes
the best practice in sometimes in m and e is quite different from the best practice in the
mm
UNK
right
le okay
we can talk UNK till the cows come home
i believe that procedure could apply to you the same as it can to roger and terry
yeah
and dennis and alan
er and if y if there is a resource problem then you david and i need to address that
mm
erm and find a solution
if when we address it we find that th the procedure is inappropriate then we should change the procedure
i agree with you
mm
yeah
okay
er d two stop three receipt of appointment contracts
erm what we're trying to do here is to get the clerical sections more involved in the projects and in passing the paper backwards and forwards
er and we're identifying that the clerical sections are required to do a certain number of things when the project arrives like erm recording the project in the index book creating a correspondence file creating project admin wallets and the like
so it's sort of er three things we're trying to do there
what was the reference of the urgent work one
i i've got that down as d two point three
was it three point two
mm
i've got that down as tw d two point three as well
yeah
very good
mm
mm
i wouldn't have spotted that
aren't you UNK
you're absolutely bloody right aren't you
got two d two point threes
mm
yeah
but we seem to have right i'll take that point back
okay
i'm sorry i shall have to fill in the UNK or a quick fix
report dennis
if you if you would please trevor
yes
that's the system
mm
you fell for that trevor
i'm sorry i haven't got one with me
right
right
well
and
i'll just plug that up that
we'll expect one from
you then
i'll tell UNK
so it's not d is it d two point three or not
i'll have to check with her another time
right
okay
yes
apparently we've got a mistake on the back of that form that it referred to a UNK report on the back which is referring to the front but the front was called a quick fix report
you see
so i said should i fill in a quick fix report or a UNK report to say that the quick fix form or is it a UNK report is wrong
right
we'll get there
erm
he said i could leave it with him and he'd sort it out
there have er
first mistake
there have been some fairly er minor alterations to the procedures concerning contract admin wallets er and the various client reports er but hugh did ask me to raise them at this meeting er to remind people of the need to er complete client reports
correct
and i've UNK i raised it this morning
right
and erm in the context of regional railways
fine
wanting them from us
yeah
but i must say that we're using these client reports and managers within each section
i know you are
the only one who is
are finding them extremely useful
mm
in keeping an idea of where the jobs are
yeah
and the comments i'm getting back from the er the clients are very favourable
right
they do find them extremely helpful
have you run off
c
any interim report from t the computer yet
no cos i wasn't too sure if it was available you telling me it is available
a as i said this morning t to the management team it is available
the only problem is as a one off exercise on
er existing jobs
we will have to put in er a summary of the existing remit
including
right
all the variations and what not
and that's something that mike and ken will help dig the historical contracts out and suggest er a remit
erm b cos he it prints a remit back out the client
but it it's ready
when are we likely to have the contract reports available
the q s
the physical works
the physical works
yeah
we're gonna start UNK that now and brian will er
right
will start to work that up
but of course that can become quite a complex thing depending on how much we want to sort of use it to produce certificates and things like that
right
so that's gonna incorporate the q s cost report as well as the physical works is it
yes
mm
yes
a and that's gonna be quite a complex erm
right
thing to specify
as it's a p it's a pound to a penny
mm
that what we're doing at the moment we won't want to b put it all in this system
fine
because it will be very complex
if you want to if you start building a system that's gonna record every variation that's issued to the client and
make it simple
print it all back again
m see if we can make it
yeah
fairly simple
could i just say at this point this is one area where i would envisage us looking critically at what we're doing and altering things quite significantly over the next six months
keep it simple and build up on it
UNK
if we need to rather
yeah
than go the other way
mainly because we're doing we're trying to read the client's mind at the moment
and w we we're putting together what we think the client wants
what i'm looking for is feedback from the clients which say yeah these reports are alright as far as they go but really i don't want all that information or i want this information
or
and i would hope that we enter into that with th that spirit and
mm
we're prepared to look at the client reports and change them so that they become as good as we can get them
yeah
is there anything within these
it is the first step
for the prediction of fees
i mean we've just
yes
got something back from intercity on the p s work where they're wa wishing us to predict to certain date what we're gonna be spending over the next six months
nine months
the football
yeah
yeah
well
regional railways have asked for that as well
have they
yes
erm that
well dennis er roger's been doing for it for leeds north west haven't you
he has
yeah
but he's been doing it UNK haven't you UNK
yeah
yeah
be because i don't think you can trust the forecast reports from dopacs
i think y yo you could UNK from month to month er as a priority slipped in or changed or a person slipped out or somebody forgot to zero something or y
it's too UNK isn't it
it's far too UNK
mm
it it's there for us to use as a as a sore thumb exercise to ask questions but to actually do anything er as critical as saying we're gonna spend twelve thousand pounds next period and eleven thousand pound the period after and fourteen thousand the period after er i don't think that's
computer UNK tying your hands behind your back
yes
yeah
yes
so really
we're gonna have to have a manual involvement or UNK there by the project coordinator to
well if you remember we agreed with keith he would have a think that and a talk to
yeah
roy er roy
you'd remind him about it hugh
yeah
but what i'm gonna suggest is that again we go back to the client and say basically this is what we think we can provide is that good enough
mm
this is what you want
if we give you that we can give you it in a certain way but it is not necessarily meaningful
mhm
if we do this it will be a lot more meaningful
is that acceptable
yeah
one point
fine
that occurred to me where we could
perhaps give them some flexibility is that we could say if that's not acceptable to you we will delay UNK
cos now we don't have to pay interest on our fees i if a UNK spread over six months a and it might risk and slip to nine months we might do better to offer to jam spread it over nine months and only invoice for part of the money
mm
don't like the sound of that
er
the project engineer sits down and UNK let's be honest
no
cos he's gonna just divide it by the number and it's
it's a very minor part of the operation
mm
i think you've got a little bit careful with lots of our jobs which have got
very small fees attached to them
yeah
yes
which
it's hardly worth doing
at the present time we're saying to on the monthly report we're saying to the client we've spent three thousand out of five thousand and their anticipated final cost is going to be five thousand
yeah
and i he knows when we're actually gonna finish the job and therefore
mm
he can almost do that sum himself
yes
i agree
er i think on a bigger job i it it's perhaps a different story
the trouble is dennis a lot of our
little jobs
a lot of our clients
but on a bigger job you can you can put the resource in can't you
yeah
but a lot of our client's finance sections don't see the difference between a big and a little job they see some pigeon holes in their spreadsheet and they want to put something in there
anything
and th they they've got this sort of
but this is where we need to talk to the client
yes
of course they are
isn't it
j just agree with client he might be prepared to accept on a quarterly basis
yeah
you know
i mean we don't necessarily have to give him it every month
one could argue
yeah
if we're not careful we'll be causing him work
oh
know what they want half of them anyway when they're
ah
let us halt it there
the customers
yeah
as er i said before
let us sit down UNK and see what is sensible
for us to provide them with
go and talk to them and say look this is what we can provide to you
it will be meaningful
is that good enough
and the chances are they'll say bloody hell that's marvellous
because what they're getting now is nothing
mm
well
and i'll tell you what they're getting from us is UNK better than they're getting from anybody else
you see even from leeds north west the outside party job and the p t pay monthly so it's important that the client knows what he's gonna be facing
but what we do is we estimate three months
mm
and divide by three
yeah
then you get an average
not bad
you know and that's the way
what's that mean
mm
no
i think's it's quite generous
don't be mean
actually
next one UNK
well
there aren't any more
ther there have been quite a few that have come out recently which i haven't briefed
some of them are fairly minor and it's to read them
others which are perhaps a little bit of er a change from what we've been used to doing
mm
are currently being revised yet again
so i'll pick them up at the next brief
right
i think an hour of this is about enough isn't it
UNK that was great
i mean i know there's been a lot of debate and i know that er you may feel it's been a bit of a waste of time
but the fact that there's been so much debate
if you say mary had a little lamb
mary had a
it will go down in the oxford dictionary or something
right
we've got that out the way
accidents on site
bridge office report
fifteen four ninety three
yeah
right
you've got it
yeah
we should all have received a report from roger about one or two accidents that have occurred on sites
one both were UNK i think weren't they
i haven't seen that
haven't you
team brief items here we are
there we are
haven't you
tt
they were sent down on time i think weren't they
you did
it was a very good report
oh
well
just cos they came down doesn't make the bit of
here we are
it was dated the fifteenth of april nineteen ninety three
erm and erm one was at norfolk park UNK
a mobile access platform tipped over and a steel UNK was injured during its recovery
we briefly mentioned that one last time if you remember
he had his head UNK or something
yeah
mm
i it shot up in the air
yeah
you mentioned
the man basket
yeah
shot upwards and a man's head smashed on the steel UNK
the UNK saved his life
so
i think that's worth briefing
erm
briefed it last time
yeah
right
okay
we don't need to do it this time
we didn't have the facts you see last time
written down
it was al it was all facts
verbally
yeah
next one is erm on bridge three o six eight a UNK
a UNK driver UNK with a rapid metal development soldier and that's some p part of the temporary works
striking
UNK
strike that's right UNK dr striking the driver on the leg
okay
the other one on the same site was a driver a UNK driver a different one i UNK to add
UNK with the existing structure UNK his chest against the steering UNK wheel
and i'm
why
not sure
makes you wonder doesn't it
i will say that
it perhaps there's something wrong with the UNK
was it
doesn't it say whether it's the same UNK
was it the same UNK
yeah
no
it isn't
what are the recommendations
what are the report what what's in clauses what used to be thirty seven and thirty eight
recommended course of action and stuff like that
we're not
that's a good question terry
were these UNK drivers UNK
why it happened
i mean
i've of watching brief jobs for which we are not responsible
oh
it's nowt to do with us then isn't it
well
i'm i mean
i'm not being UNK but what is the bloody point
no
it's s
in telling us
i don't know why you're UNK our meetings up with somebody else's accidents
because i'm supposed to report all accidents
yeah
to here
yes
he is
it's my
mm
fault
i should
because
not have put them on here without considering
what you said there mr
yes
thank you
erm quite a valid point
the unless we want to brief to our staff the potential UNK in er
mm
well
the use of UNK on er sites
i think we should
there are two points that i you would be looking at normally if you were investigating it
one would be
UNK him
were the were th were the UNK in good working order and had
yeah
they been serviced properly
which is something which happens which is done through r es
and the other one is did the d what sort of certification did the drivers have
yeah
even if it was only a car UNK license
mm
and did we er
a and
subject them to a drugs and alcohol test
mm
afterwards
oh ho
a and was the er was their method of operating the UNK in accordance with the site safety plan
or was he driving it backwards
yes
or whatever
yeah
i've seen UNK driven over
upside down maybe
two bits of sheet UNK laid over a ditch and things
right
good
thank you for those all the same roger despite what was said
d do you want a little one from me then
yes
that near miss thing at erm UNK
oh
yes
please
this is where there wasn't an accident thank god but we did find
out er we had nobody on site at the time
work had been planned to be carried out during the possession on a saturday night to carry out some pointing
ha we've had this one
only
we haven't briefed it
we haven't briefed it
did we not brief it last month
no
we haven't briefed
no
we discussed it
we did it at the safety meeting
one which
yeah
erm work was organized during to saturday night during the possession which included people standing in the four foot i in the tracks
and for one reason or another the UNK up on site on the saturday afternoon and decided to do it then
and he set up his own system of work using UNK er UNK etcetera using er UNK and
staff exposed themselves to danger by standing in the four foot
his staff
his staff
yeah
there was nobody else's staff around at the time
it's likely we will ban the contractor for three months from at least three months from doing the work
mm
although h he took a very professional erm attitude in dealing with the inquiry afterwards
and didn't hide behind erm didn't try to make any excuses
he said that it had been done wrong
he's actually sacked his own foreman the main contractor cos the main the foreman turned up on site and this i think is one of the lessons to be learnt is that foreman turned up on site and saw what was happening
and didn't stop it
mm
and so UNK what was going on
mm
and it's the major contractor
er may as well tell you i it's
so possession had already been arranged
for the night
the april the ninth
for the night
yeah
yeah
but they did it
mm
yeah
that's the only reason we found out is our supervisor turned up to take possession and the UNK guy said there's no point we've done it
so
we've actually found it
could have been an inquiry into a death
quite easily
er yeah
thank you for that terry
it was at UNK
UNK station
yeah
i think the message is there that er we took a UNK view of it and we have now
yeah
removed them from our approved list for a period
erm to show how serious we consider
mm
and the UNK by the way who did the work
the incident to be
we're UNK him for further and i'm gonna
whatever
saying ban him for life
again
yeah
good
what was his name
i'll let you know
in fact i'll let you have a copy of what i've got this
yeah
p pa pete i think
that's where we're likely to drop the UNK
pete
yeah
cos he might
ah
but pete might just come out in his wife's name next week
mm
and start trading
you've got no idea
this UNK has worked for a number of years
so
it's not a fly by night firm
no
yes
cos they'd be in
well
he'd just
good
job done
go to the wedding but
yeah
that's what's UNK
oh my god
alright
okay let's have a look
right
next one
i'm gonna go into the erm the irish route improvements thing we talked about this morning
which norm that
yeah
i know about that
okay
right
potential work
erm chris 's visit on the eleventh of june i think we briefed last time
yeah
yeah
er i think it's just worth mentioning again that it's still on and er i think er it is really more important than ever now for us to impress on chris what good work we do because er of the changing situation within the industry
and the more people that know what good work we do the better
provision of UNK services
over to you my friend
oh
provision of UNK services
right
erm just to say that just to confirm the note sent round that erm we will only pay for any UNK services by intercity east coast if it has been UNK using a task request form in accordance with the same way we UNK any other internal b r er service
now
surely if all we want is prints off existing things all you need do is a request with a dopacs number
yeah
surely not you know fill in a task form in for print off a couple of UNK
is this the external
yes
request for external
mm
services
well
b w why
why can't you just use a task request form that says
please p
well
i mean
please provide
prints off the following negative numbers
four number eight by eight prints off these t off negative numbers so and so
splendid
are you gonna write
and put the dopacs number on
you're gonna on something
yeah
copy it to andrew and then andrew knows when the i b i s invoice comes forward that it's something to be
then he'll sign it off
paid for
because we've got thousands of i b i s UNK that come to us that are not for us
and unless we've actually got an i er a request to back it
up
okay
good
good
you're pointing
a and it's come from peter
oh
will you stop being
you've got to do something wrong
it's come from peter
mm
they will not they want to be erm UNK in a structured way such that they know they're gonna get paid
mm
right
that's it
i have unfortunately have some view forms and it doesn't look as though we've got a an overhead UNK
what a shame
we have
it's in the permanent way UNK secure room
no
i mean in here
you
but you never told me to bring it down
no
but we could send for it
if
oh
no
no
no
let's not bother
alright
i'll quickly run through
what it is it's the intercity core brief
oh
that's why i
i've seen it
we've had it a copy of it
have you got a copy of this
yeah
yeah
good
good
have we
yeah
what's it about
does it tell us who's gonna own this
it gives us feedback
this line
on the core nine brief
UNK
it gives us an update on privatization reorganization most of which has appeared
anything
in UNK
right
and it gives us a er tt details of the current intercity marketing strategy which is again
not interested in that either
yeah
we have
good
that's right
and get a green ticket
so
they're encouraging people to drive their bloody cars
yeah
burn more fuel and just travel on a train
extra fuel
environmental
yeah
it is
next time any other business
right
so
hello UNK
i've just come back on that d two stop three
no
sorry
yes
please do UNK
right
the d two stop three the work of an
ah
urgent nature
yeah
erm that was actually issued some time ago but wasn't briefed
but it was quite a significant change that we were
oh
so we d we
d seven was er work on UNK nature
yeah
indeed
no
it's been put through as the procedures
yes
cos people
d seven was the acknowledgement
so
so that was to say that we'd w
yeah
withdrawn d two point three
yeah
and now you've UNK it somewhere else
and erm and subsequently we've actually withdrawn
withdrawn
this particular d two stroke three
so if you look in your manual you've now UNK only got one d two stroke
yeah
three
rather than two d one right
a and the and the and the d seven bit is in a different section
is covered by part d two stroke one
right
thank you dennis
you're a
good lad
right
could i just quickly look through here
i did have a go through this core brief to see if there were any things that i should have picked out
there is a good section there's a good section on pensions
by the way because our staff will be concerned about pension proposals after privatization
is it
it's section one point five
if you view files three to five
the main message i would give is that
the board has responded to the government with regard to the pensions issue and suggested a number of improvements to the government's proposals
yeah
the scheme
the board's
did that didn't it
yeah
the board considers the b r UNK employees who transfer UNK to the private sector should return an UNK right to remain as members of the joint industry
scheme
we've seen all that
but that that's only a suggestion
it's not been
yes
yeah
i mean wasn't this wasn't this
well
they're not
one of these things where they
let's pick out something positive
they actually put forward some proposals whereby what do you call him UNK the clause and wrote another one which UNK anything that was said before
pardon
that sounds a wonderful idea when does it
who's what's her name
pass
what do you call the secretary of state
UNK
UNK
oh
UNK
roger UNK secretary for
yeah
no
UNK secretary of state
roger UNK transport
well
transport minister then
i
thought that the board had complained and put forward some suggestions
it said in the
mm
t s a circular
whereby
UNK the clause wrote another one which meant that you had to go back to stage one again
it wasn't very helpful
and that was in your t s a circular
mm
about
right
a fortnight
ago
i UNK well i found that quite interesting the bit on pensions
th
yeah
th the bit that i found most interesting was at least the board are trying to look after our interests in that respect
er and i think it's watch that space
isn't it
yes
does that seem reasonable
without UNK through it all and things are moving on
yeah
fairly quickly
there's
still nothing black and white
no
UNK stuff isn't it this
yeah
right
n nothing more there
if anyone wants to borrow the core brief they're welcome to do so
ken would like to read it
ha we got have we got a copy upstairs
norman has a copy
that's fine
well nor norman can brief them
yeah
if he thinks so
if you think so
may i
yeah
erm and that's it
good
thank you very much
no rule review
rule review
have we finished
rule review and team brief
shall i get
we've finished the
rule review today at four
can i can i just ask one thing if we've finished
i'm
and any other business
right
plan printing
we're again
plan printing
we're having problems with getting the
drawings back from plan UNK
i'm UNK
are we
i think we complained to you and you complained
er i
did i i've had
and
a letter back this week from him
forty eight hour UNK
s saying that er he's had lots of erm UNK from our
UNK letters would you believe
staff er and he assumes that er everything's back to normal and UNK
well
it isn't
i mean we we're saying we had things down there in excess of three days
and we're not getting them back short
anybody else
had those problems
it was just brought to my attention just before i came down
when we want urgent work done we've really got to turn the UNK tight
it's hard work is it
yes
it is
yes
it is
there's no official mechanism to do it
yeah
it's er
you go down there on your hands and knees and you report it's not meet and then you
yeah
is it
i i'm only
the er
it's not a quality service trevor
it he has erm UNK the erm quality of service a d erm the performance specification he undertook to provide me with
mm
over the phone because he said he was gonna be a two hour urgent work
mm
a and er by telephone arrangement if you want it quicker than that
and now it's suddenly two days
yeah
but urgent by special arrangements
that's you don't have to
do you work his own printer
er that doesn't surprise me
mm
well
i mean
yeah
but he's only buying his own
ye
printer so that when he's UNK off he's got some
well
we might wish to consider using him if you've got problems with
mm
plan printing
let offices services manager know that
no
because we're paying
for the staff down there and the paper
and
well
what the hell are we supposed to do
well
as ask him for a refund on that much we haven't received from
yeah
them
what i was gonna suggest what i was gonna suggest was that anything that we
didn't get
i mean if we're not getting the service why
anything that we didn't get to a timescale
don't we refuse to
we should just go out to UNK and invoice him for
b
the
but what
a lot plenty of firms out there'll do it you know
we don't we don't
what happened whilst you were on holiday after that first few days off the guy rang me up and said hey some of your staff have been down er say saying we've got an urgent service that you can have in two hours
that's right
and he said who told you that
mm
and i said well why we've just agreed that with UNK
and he said
certainly did
he said i'll fucking see about that
bet that's not in the oxford dictionary
l
ca can i
suggest
can i UNK
that er that you respond to that letter from him trevor and say
that the information that we have from our staff does not UNK
yeah
with what he's put in there
we w
and that we now propose
we need a two hour se
we need a two hour service
if he can't provide it then we intend to obtain prints from er an external source and get the UNK sent to him
there's no point in telling him that because he'll just refuse to pay them
we will just let's threaten him that might be a course of action that we're gonna have to re we will have we will have
gonna upset the staff
to er
we'll obtain prices from outside for the work
and don't accept the bill for two staff
right
splendid
well
we can always stop
paying for the bloody machine that er
yeah
mm
i mean we're paying
i mean
forty five percent
there's no way we'll sit back and let him continue in this way
so we've got to tell him what the options are
somebody has suggested that we train some of our staff up to use their machine
and i think it came out of the print room
what a good idea
no
it's not a good idea
there are all sorts of health and safety implications to messing about with erm
oh
well
we'll get a core erm what do you call it
er assessment
yeah
and make sure that we provide our staff with the appropriate
fresh air fans
protection
breathing UNK
i don't see that as an
w what if
he's won then hasn't he
yeah
if he gets rid of his staff
he's got rid of two of his he's got rid of two of his staff and we've had to go in and fill that breach
trevor if we're in business on our own and we want prints
if we're in business in our own
and we want prints we would decide on what the most economic way of getting them is
we would
well
let us now start investigating that
at the moment i'm happy with the service down there by the way
there's only alan so far says he's got a problem
anybody else got a problem
w we want to try and
i think before we take any urgent action we ought to alan ought to monitor the situation
oh
well
this is what we've been doing
i mean wh what i've
after the last time we got a problem
cos we don't normally act
we we've had prints down in there excess of three days
now all i'm saying is that he undertook to give us those in forty eight hours
but all i'm asking is if there is an urgent work system and if that urgent work system is being abused whereby everybody is putting down
yes
urgent work
they shouldn't be doing
which is pushing back his normal service
mm
mm
surely the urgent work UNK gotta be pr reviewed as well
it needs controlling
and it needs controlling
which either means that somebody at my level or an m s three level or somebody has gotta sign for the urgent work
yeah
where i'm
because all it means is that anybody's signing it urgent
yeah
work do me one now
yeah
right
i'll
it needs sorting out
i'll talk to
it it's very
but where i'm puzzled a little bit by terry is about five minutes ago terry said people have got to go and beg and
they have a urgent work
get on their knees
scenario
yes
yes
and then he said he was satisfied with the service
the normal work
the normal work service
yes
it's the UNK er yeah
right
it's the urgent ones
yeah
that cause the problem
but i it depends terry with everybody's going down on the urgent work ones which is putting the normal service
back isn't it
well
yeah
i haven't suffered on the normal service so far
the service is always difficult like roger said
mm
or somebody said
can we put a handle on this
can we
erm i'm in correspondence with him
i'm talking to him about the planned s filing system as well which is
well
that's more than some people
what filing system
would print
that is
of course
but that is a function of this york accommodation
mm
consortium which is
i mean standard drawings out of there
yeah
what is the york accommodation
so in terms of action
oh it's some
some high UNK w one top guy from each erm business get together and talk about UNK house west UNK erm main h q
who represents us
some guy from er s and t i think
no hoping they represent us
cos they're part of the business unit
so i said i didn't want to deal through somebody who wasn't really gonna be fighting in our corner and i'd rather put a paper to their committee an and tell them where the problems were and ask how they were gonna get round them
they've got problems with erm staffing because they got rid of all their staff
well
yeah
but now they've realized that they need more than one receptionist to cover the early hours and later hours
but what they were thinking of doing is taking on another person who could file plans away in the plan room once the once sort of the UNK rush of visitors had been cleared in UNK house reception
but that sounds about as positive as his suggestion that he would train up
er the UNK staff to cover UNK in er sorry the UNK in the staffing in the plan printing
mm
i it sounds very well in principle but in practice i haven't doubt very much whether or not we will avoid having a UNK in the service that we need
but the plan the ownership of the plan print room and the way that the plans are not stored safely and they're not treated like proper documents just UNK me when you compare it with some of the plan rooms in
UNK
b r
what you want to do is ring up the sunday times and get a reporter round and he'll get a scandal story and they'll do something
yes
all we could suggest
all we could suggest that they did w
UNK in certain cases
well
was
not UNK but
UNK in and find the security fencing drawings an and the underground UNK at the york signal box in the plan room and wouldn't they have a
a little wow
yeah
right
what is our proposed action
it will all be in there
well
i will i am writing to
to say that
y a c
we we're still having some problems
an a and saying that we are
good
far from happy with the plan print room with the er o and suggest that the businesses ought to be concerned about the way that their records are stored in their plan room
and that er
i would erm suggest that they go at UNK to see how it's done
well
i would suggest that we use this as a lead in to say isn't it time you paid to UNK all the old drawings
can we be of any assistance
the
mm
well
another this is two things they've got enabled UNK to get where they were
one was a sort of UNK to the sunday times
but we're not gonna go down that path
right
next
yeah but i imagine
not sunday times
can't i finish
well
go on
ye yeah
go on
and the second w was the criticism they got at UNK
they got you know quite a bit of stick for not being able to produce drawings that they said they had
you know they said they'd got drawings and then well where are they
they couldn't produce them
and they got some stick for that
but those two things together were what enabled them to get their plan room into what it is now
an absolute work of art
good
mm
right
what we've gotta decide is what we want for the c e d g i thing
well
i mean i was meaning i want to get your standard drawings out of there
jim knows what he wants and
gonna take our standard drawings out
what he wants to do
i'm fully supportive of the p way office getting the standard drawings there
er and i think roger what you and terry have to decide is what you want of your parts of the organization
and then we can organize
mm
ourselves
the problem is a lot of the drawings down there are historical drawings
yeah
which we don't need
which are storing information which we don't need now but it
that's s
would UNK to
well
d it
yeah
it's the cost effect of not having that information that's going be a cost on the client if he comes and wants to
yeah
do something to those
yeah
but it would be anyway
of course he will
it's not a cost effect on us
well
we shouldn't be picking up the tab
no
no
no
i far from it but i think here we should be encouraging him or highlighting the problem that he's got that he ought to be looking at
what we should be doing is make s making sure that we have er the negatives of all those drawings that we've produced over the last ten or fifteen years that we may need to use again
mm
but ye but yeah
that does need staff to search through them
it does
yeah
it also needs somewhere to store them
mm
yeah
well
we've got that now
but you've got a plan room down there
which until recently UNK quite well
yeah but it doesn't any longer and i can't er quite honestly in the climate that's er
rail track
th that is that is e existing
yeah
now
hopefully rail track will take it on board
i mean that's the way it should go UNK
well
UNK theirs isn't it
erm but i think we have a duty to our organization to determine what we want to do
management buy out do you regret not having
certainly
yeah
so
we really
short sighted to see
but they wouldn't allow us to have
belong to them
yes
they are
well
they ma they maybe do belong to them but bloody hell they the information on it
mm
yes
i think that
right
we'd have copyright on them wouldn't we
we
yeah
we should encourage them to UNK them and then we should then encourage them to give us a
mm
what
set of
mm
do you know that UNK freight went through
i in the absence
that print room and removing drawings of their depots
is it
we've got is it worth considering
and there's not a blind thing you can do to stop them taking
yeah
to them on their own terms
them out of there now
i
well
i wou i would pre
of course they are
to the er the
but you're losing
who's got copyright
a valuable s
yeah
source of information for any future projects
my honest is we should get we
the british railways board has copyright
should get the photo the er UNK facility
jim's gonna do this and i think jim's
jim's
exercise will be a good for us
and if we find it's a it's er an effective system i think we should then do it for bridges
mm
and works
although the cost
and p way
it was fairly it was fairly cheap when i looked into it
yeah
with p b d
forty five forty five pence
about five years ago
yeah
i mean it it's
not only that it's they come and collect them take them away
yeah
and bring them back isn't it
yes
yeah
all in price
what a hundred and sixty quid for five hundred drawings
is that for
yeah
a one or a nought or
so
i mean
regardless of what they want to do the rest of the organization i think that we as an organization should do something like that
with a view to er recording all the drawings that we've produced over the last fifteen years
it would take quite a an exercise to actually find them and
well
that's the w
yeah
would be
not the UNK i think that's a good idea
it's finding out which ones are really any good
because they're not stored in
yes
a drawing number sequence
so
i
no
suppose we could find them easy enough if they were
they're actually stored in bloody line reference and
are they really
bridge number and
mm
what are
i thought the bridge ones were in
no they're rolled up in
the y v er
UNK and things
all we'd of done was taken UNK and go to them and say don't want
that
don't want that
want that
want that
want that
record the number
mm
bundle them up them off send them off and the rest
i mean a lot a lot of the plans in the plan rooms
were actually UNK by
joe and
joe and er
joe and
bernard
fortunate them
about three or four
years ago
so
most of the
rubbish should have gone and it was only the
do you honestly think that they did all
no
they did they did an awful lot of it
yes
i thought they just UNK about
and UNK the surface
no
they
they made a considerable impact certainly on the earlier years' ones
but there's bags of drawings over
yes
fine
UNK
and some bridge drawings among them
and nobody quite knows what's there
they never got to sorting those out
right
who's UNK
the
yeah
but they're ancient
ones
as far as i'm concerned they belong to er rail track or the businesses
what i'm concerned about is those drawings that we've produced with our resources over the last fifteen years
what since n say beginning of selby
yeah
go back to there
yeah
about nineteen eighty
cos before that UNK the codes were changed anyway weren't they
yeah
about nineteen eighty
if we went back to nineteen seventy eight we'd pick up all the selby drawings wouldn't we
yes
and
and all your s current standards
a and yeah
i would have thought that would be good enough for us
well
s
well
shall we what are we talking then
are we talking about UNK them or UNK them
i would UNK them
right
it might turn out to be cheaper
yeah
number of drawings we're dealing with
but we could get somebody who knows something about to come and advise
mm
certainly sounds as if p way wouldn't want anything
get why not get
before about after nineteen seventy
or before nineteen seventy
the plan room to come and advise
on UNK or on or on w
well
on UNK versus UNK negatives versus what else they've got
but i've been down there
we'd need a report order
yeah
if jim's gonna if jim's gonna micro
all the information on it
if jim's gonna UNK his stuff then i think we should UNK the UNK drawings produced since
nineteen seventy eight
s b since
well
nineteen eighty
well
i think we should make sure we sweep up the selby drawings because they do include some fairly good stuff
more costly
i realize that
so
another case of finding the bloody things
we'd want to go back a bit before that
it's basically since you've got onto your er your vertical s and c which goes back to about nineteen seventy
right
and may just
not that long
make the decision here because i think
i think actually somebody needs to sit down and think
yeah
there's
think
yeah
what they do want
yeah
because it may be that you th you look back and say christ we've been using those standards since nineteen seventy
yeah
so it may be that your standard drawings you say oh goodness me
let's just have the standard drawings
yeah
no
we normally use those
and be unaware you may not be interested in them
for er for UNK and any alterations
as a as a
right
as a quick means of doing
a anyway we can
the action is each function head
yeah
is really needs to think about how far back w we should go
yeah
er with a view to us erm considering
oops
whether we should erm UNK drawings for each function
cos we've got
and i think we should erm
we've got records of all the drawings haven't we UNK
that you know our drawing number books once when it's been issued
presumably terry's got the same
yeah
we have upstairs
yeah
so we can quickly
UNK what we need and then budget for
UNK them oh within the next two years
how much do we p pay incidentally for the print room facility
for the print room
er the plan room
sorry
nothing
because it's not our plan room
no
but we
they're not our drawings
so
they belong to the client
the person who owns the asset
well
somebody must be UNK the bill
yes
e east coast regional railways and presumably freight at one time
so
we don't contribute to it
no
it's a bloody massive er that i would
right
good
any other business
no
finished
good
thank you
rule review
i'm not doing that
ah
please can we leave it
no
i mean
i can't get my team brief done before everybody goes home now then
what
right
right
i'll be brief
a to be fair steve has been on standby hasn't he

right
it's been a long day
right
we'll do it next week some time

i'm an old hand at it now
fire prevent ex fire prevention officer is gonna give us some real good tips
i've heard this film seen this film quite a number of times and it really is good
i hope you didn't mind us starting but we decided that we'd
not at all
excuse me
no
it's alright
we'd press on
so we've got a very good film
aha
er so over
right
to you then jackie
before we start is
can you use the o h p
are you going to use that o h p
i am going to use it
oh right
cos when we want
yeah
this afternoon
yeah i'm gonna use the o h p first and then
right
okay
use the films
jolly good
okay
okay
come and sit over here
yes
right
now there's an offer
right
i understand everybody enjoyed the physical UNK this morning
oh yeah
they were nice
was it on radio nottingham
feel the
keeps you fit
remarkable young lady isn't she
yes
right
well good afternoon ladies and gentlemen
my name's jack
i've just retired from the nottinghamshire fire and rescue service after just over thirty years service having reached the er full time that i UNK that's thirty years service and UNK the ripe old age of fifty five
okay
so er they've put me out to grass so to speak
and i myself as er your course leader has indicated i was on a course here myself some four weeks ago listening to the same subject doing the physical exercises etcetera and listening and trying to take in i won't say i did trying to take in all the different aspects that will affect us in our er retirement years
now when we get round to this subject this afternoon of fire a lot of people think that fire is a modern UNK
okay
it's something to do with the new computer age of technology and space UNK and everything else
well we all know from our own history books that fire has been with us for a long time hasn't it
right from the days of the early UNK when he used fire not only for cooking but he also used it as means of lighting and keeping his family warm er during the winter months
okay
but just let's have a look at some of the things that have caused fires or cause us to bring about legislation in fire
and one of the things that we learn very early in history is the great fire of london
can you all see that
great fire of london started second of september in sixteen sixty six started in the early hours at a UNK house in pudding lane
it burned for three days
it destroyed four hundred and thirty six acres of buildings thirteen thousand two hundred houses eighty seven parish churches numerous other public buildings
remarkably only six persons died
but two hundred thousand were made homeless and the estimated loss was ten million seven and thirty thousand pounds in sixteen sixty six
imagine what the cost would have been
mm
today
mm
if that same scenario happened
i mean we've only got to have a look at the recent events in london went on about the UNK over the UNK over the weekend haven't we
to find out
what the er costs are going to be
and this then created the first institute fire insurance and your UNK acts
okay
and not to go into too much depth basically if i can find the switch
that's it
basically what happened from that the crown at the time then decided to widen the streets and UNK the pavements
and also bought out the insurance company fire UNK where when you go round a lot of the older buildings in our towns and cities today and even villages you will find an insurance plaque or an insurance mark on the side of the house or the building concerned
and this was the old insurance plaque and if your house caught fire then the insurance fire brigade would come and put out your fire for you
okay
but not only have we had the great fire of london we've had other disasters in the country apart from disasters of the great war and the er second world war
we had the bradford football disaster and we had other disasters in UNK the UNK night nursing home in nottingham
mm
not far from us
all brought about some legislation
and let's face it ladies and gentlemen legislation has governed us basically all our working lives hasn't it
okay
the education act for example
the fire precautions act
the fire safety and safety of sports grounds act
the factories act
the licensing act
the UNK act
so if you go to your local pub at night for a er an evening social and you have a drink no doubt you'll look round your public house and you'll see all sorts of pieces of fire equipment
fire alarm systems fire UNK emergency lighting all that sort of thing
and this has been brought about to enhance your safety not only when you're at your place of work but when you're out and enjoying your social evening either at a theatre a pub a club or the cinema or wherever you may be
and of course we come home don't we
and as you ladies and gentlemen now are thinking of retiring as i have done the least thing you want to be bothered about is rules and regulations
and this is sometimes where we slip up because fire is still UNK with us even when we're in home
okay
a fire can start in the home and it can start very easily
what do you think are the common causes of fire in the home situation
chip pans
chip pans
electrical
electrical
children playing with matches
yeah
electric blankets
okay
well just let's have a look at a few shall we
from this side too far
right
the UNK use of matches UNK and pipes
okay
so let's look at the first one
excuse me i've got a rather heavy cold
matches and pipes okay
some of us here this afternoon may be grandparents in our right
okay
and school holidays and you've got your grandchildren or UNK come to stay with you and granddad has his favourite chair by the side of the fire
he has his box of matches or his lighter and he likes his pipe
and he likes it in a certain place and nobody must touch it
and but of course young johnny comes along to spend the day with his grandparents and he likes to UNK granddad
he likes to sit in UNK chair and pretend that he's smoking UNK pipe
okay
so if you do have grandchildren come to stay with you please make sure that you put your matches or you cigarettes your UNK and your UNK way out of reach of the young children concerned
i know it's UNK but unfortunately a lot of people still tend to leave these er objects lying about in easy reach of the young child okay
one of your colleagues mentioned the UNK use of UNK and chip pans
too
what happens
you put the chip pan on
the telephone rings you get UNK
okay
and you're on the phone for ages and ages talking about a b and c and all a sudden you think i can smell something burning
and low and behold you can't even get back into the kitchen because the kitchen is full of deadly fumes from the burning fat or er fat or oil within the chip pan
okay
drying the UNK of clothes is another one
you get your fire going
it's rather a damp day outside you want to finish UNK your clothes off so what to do
you stick them round on the old er UNK in front of the open fire
it doesn't matter whether it's a solid fuel fire or a coal effect er g gas fire or whether it's an electric fire
if that er clothing becomes heated and it gets to the right temperature it will burst into the flames likewise if it's not balanced properly and you go out the door the living room or the lounge into the kitchen or some other part of your home the draft by closing the door can knock the UNK over UNK it and of course er set fire to the clothing
UNK open fires
again the problem there is that you get the hot UNK if it's a solid fuel fire er dropping off onto the UNK setting fire to the UNK rug
children playing with matches and UNK a again we've already covered this in object number one but again it's a reminder
make sure that if you have children in the home that matches and UNK are placed well out of place them out of reach
old faulty electrical appliances
again your electrical appliances do want servicing on a regular basis
how many of you use an electrical blanket
well quite a few of you
what do you do at the end of the winter time and er spring arrives and it's too warm for the electric blanket
what do you do
do you fold it in accordance with the UNK instructions
or do you just screw it up stuff it in the box up in the UNK or out of way out of sight until next september october november time when you want to fetch it out again
leave it on the bed
pardon
leave it where it was
leave it where it was
yes
on the bed
mm
okay providing it's not used
okay
but very often people will just get hold of the er blanket they'll screw it up okay
stick it away out the way until next winter and as we all know inside the electric blanket we have little and there's your blanket
we have little electric UNK elements running through similar to an electric fire and if you UNK it up and don't take care of it properly what happens is you will snap one of the fine UNK
and what happens then the electric current as we know flows backwards and forwards and it gets to this bit here and there's a break so what does it do
the UNK tries to jump the gap doesn't it
mm
mm
okay
it tries to jump the gap and in doing so sets fire to y the surrounding material that the blanket is made of and that's where you start to get problems on your fire blankets
excuse me
yeah
y you mentioned folding
is there a is there a proper way to fold cos i haven't
yeah nor
seen it
yeah
normally
normally with your folder there should be some m UNK instructions come
no there wasn't
except there wasn't
well i would suggest that if you have a look and see how the lay of the er
wiring
wires or the elements run and then fold it so it can avoid UNK those
so you fold in actual fact between the layers of the material and you don't try to bend the
the wires
the element
try to fold within the layers of the material so that you don't and you keep your elements in a straight line then
okay
but if you've got any doubts if you're in any doubts at all go to your local e board or some electrical supplier a UNK electrical supplier and they will tell you how to do it properly
okay
UNK and wrongly UNK plugs
okay
again another source of danger within the home because what happens or what's the what's the object of a fuse in a plug
safety
safety
right
but very often we will UNK safety because we stick any old fuse in we think it works okay
but if something UNK happens to that UNK piece of electrical equipment okay
the electrical equipment UNK and then fuse as yo we all know should blow to cut off the supply of electrical equipment to that piece of apparatus
but sometimes if we've got the wrong fuse in it won't blow and it will continue to feed the electric current through to the heater or whatever piece of electrical apparatus it is until such times as we have a fire situation
if we don't get a fire situation the person who is operating the piece of electric equipment is quite likely to get an electrical shock
how do you know which fuse to put
how do you know which fuse
right
quite simply normally when you buy a piece of electrical apparatus doesn't matter what it is normally it will tell you what fuse should be put into the er appliance itself into the plug
mm
but you can next time to go to pay your electricity bill you can pick up this leaflet called plugs and UNK electricity and you
okay
and that even tells you how to wire a plug correctly
it's a
do that
good descriptive booklet and it tells you on the back in actual fact i've got some handouts here which you can pick up when we've finished the talk okay
there should be sufficient to go round
and it tells you the normal plug rating for a particular appliance
like a UNK cleaner should be five amp a deep fat UNK should be thirteen amp and various
er little pieces of information on plugs and UNK
okay
so
thank you
please pick one of those up before you leave this afternoon
has some new legislation just come out about all that
that any new electrical goods supplied after a certain date are now supposed to have the fu the plug the fuse plug
actually er as it were UNK i don't mean that sort of fuse i mean
no
i know what you mean yes
used on to the wire so that you can't take it off
yes
i've got a feeling it is and i know if you
yeah
i believe that has but
now the UNK
yeah
part of it
yeah
i believe that has but the only way i would ask you to ensure this
oh yeah
if you're thinking is if you go to you your electricity board
yeah
or ring up your local trading standards officer
yeah
there's one based at county hall and if you're from the nottingham arnold area there's one based on front street at arnold
but please get in touch with a qualified electrician
yeah
and they will tell you whether or not
yeah
what the latest information is
yeah
okay
yeah
i think it has come in but i think they're still
still selling old stuff
that's right
yeah
they will still sell the old
yeah
they will still sell the old cos it is a
yeah
yeah
it's market isn't it
yeah
i it's a market thing you know
and ninety percent of the plugs sold loose have got thirteen amp
mm
oh yeah
they have
UNK
yeah
yeah
and ninety percent of the things they're attached to still got thirteen amp UNK
i bet they'll have
yes
yeah
whether they're table lamp UNK or UNK
this is a this is a question we very often get asked why do they sell a thirteen amp fuse with a thirteen amp plug if it only wants a five amp in
as i say it's one of these er competitive market things but if you go into an electrical shop and you buy a piece of electrical equipment or if you want er a plug for it a piece of electrical equipment because you found out that the plug on the electrical equipment at home is UNK it's got cracked UNK or something like then please have a word with the person who is selling you the plug and say look this plug is gonna be fitted on x appliance
what type of fuse do i want in it
would you please ensure that the plug is correctly fitted with the right fuse
and i've nine times out of ten a good local electrical UNK will do it there and then
may cost you just the cost of replacing the fuse or they might say there you are my dear okay no extra charge
okay
but please if you're in any doubt have a word with your electrical contractor unless you are a competent person yourself and capable of doing it yourself and working out the UNK yourself
okay
incidentally electric blankets are only three amp
pardon
electric blankets should only be
three amp
three amp
three amp
yeah
mm
just while we're on that subject
anything on multi plugs
you know the sort of the erm thing you can plug in
this sort of thing like this
that type of thing
yeah
mm
yeah
that as compared with the one you can put in that you know one at the top one at the side and
yeah
right
okay
again this i haven't got an example to show you but i have seen one of these that's caught fire and the only reason it's caught fire is because this total piece of equipment is only capable of taking a maximum of thirteen amps
okay
so if you've got a three amp fuse another three amp fuse and a three amp fuse in and another one in it you've got nine amps haven't you
mm
okay
so you only want another small piece of electrical apparatus in there
so if you was to stick your washing machine in there for example
okay
or an electric fire then you would be asking for trouble because you'd be trying to draw out
mm
more electricity out of the system then it's designed to give you
it's like trying to draw more money out of the bank and you've got no more cash left in reserve okay
so if you are using these i've got one of these at home in my lounge and the only thing that i run from it is my television set and the video recorder
that's all
the two other UNK remain empty
and then i know full well that i'm well within the guidelines of not going over the thirteen amp that this is designed to operate at maximum efficiency and safety
okay
a lot of people think because you've got four UNK you can bang four pieces of apparatus
well you can't
you can provided you keep under the thirteen amp rating but if you go over the thirteen amp rating then you are asking for trouble
okay
and the same applies to your multiple socket UNK where you've just got one power point
you stick it in and you've got everything UNK to it
you know you've got the electric fire you've got the telly and everything else to it
again if you go over the thirteen amp you're trying to draw out more UNK electricity and you're causing UNK
okay
and that's where you start to get your problems irrespective of whether your appliances are correctly UNK you must make sure they are correctly UNK but you must not exceed the thirteen amp otherwise you've had it
you will be asking yourself for trouble
mm
okay
am i not right in thinking that the UNK themselves are UNK therefore they are a safety device therefore t the fuse in the UNK will go if you do exceed the thirteen
yes
it will go and it should go but again if you've not got
the correct fuse in it won't go
you must always ensure that you have the correct fuse in
okay
but for UNK sake ladies
and gentlemen please do not exceed the thirteen amps output on your piece of apparatus
probably if you're having a new home built or something like that you may not have to UNK to those because while you're having you're having your home built you can say to the electrician alright i want x number of power points here
i want x number of power points there and i want x number of power points there
but if you're like me moving to a house that's been established for some years you'll probably find there's only a minimum of power points because let's face it over the years the use of electrical apparatus have become more and more hasn't it
mm
you know what with UNK and electric UNK and things like that you know
and of course in the old days they just weren't available because they weren't on the market
half of them hadn't even been thought of especially UNK anyway
i know electric UNK do go back even beyond my years but er okay
portable UNK close to furniture
again we've got the situation where you've got UNK heat
okay
what happens on a cold UNK evening you stand in front of the fire
okay
you're UNK yourself aren't you
it's UNK out there tonight UNK isn't it
you know
what happens
what can you feel
you can feel the heat from the fire can't you
doesn't matter whether it's a solid fuel fire gas fire or electric and this is what we call UNK heat
and if you were silly enough to stand there long enough you'd soon your skirt your trousers you'd soon start UNK a little bit
you know
and away you'd go
so again it's the same with putting portable UNK close to the furniture
let's face it we all like comfort on a UNK evening when we're watching the our favourite programmes on the television and we shove our chairs right up to the fire to get nice and UNK
but if we ever leave the room at all always pull the chair back
okay
a reasonable distance okay
to make sure that er the furniture is not too close
plugs left switched on
okay
again very often in this modern days and age we have to leave certain electrical appliances switched on all the time don't we
the fridge UNK otherwise you'd get up every morning and you'd have a right mess in your cupboard wouldn't you
in your er kitchen
so we have to make sure that again the plugs are in good working order
there's no cracks that would allow er UNK of electricity through
okay
no cracks in the UNK
the fuse again is correct and not only the fuse but the wiring is in good working order
and this happens with electric UNK as well and another thing make sure your electric iron cable is in good working order
how long is it since you really examined your electric iron when you've used it
on the cable
okay
what happens to it
it UNK
it UNK
because it's doing this thing all the time isn't it
you know while you're away ironing you're doing this all the time
up and down the old ironing board
okay
and eventually after a period of time that ins outer UNK will wear down it will UNK and it will break and it will expose the live and the neutral wires until unfortunately sometimes it will be a little bit too late
and you will if you don't end up with a house fire you may end up with nasty burns or even electric shock
so do UNK either yourself or get your UNK to have a look and make sure that all your UNK is in good working order okay
likewise you should never UNK or bury UNK under the carpet because the same thing happens
you lay the UNK carpet on top of the cable UNK all over it over a number of years and again the old thing happens it UNK down the outer protective UNK it breaks down the UNK and then you get a fire situation burning away UNK away underneath your carpet because while ever your er electrical appliance is switched on heat is being generated
there's even heat coming from this lamp now
okay
heat is being generated all the time and that's the problem
UNK and l p g UNK again are another source of danger especially l p g UNK
and when you look at l p g while it's in its UNK okay it's a liquid but when it meets normal UNK temperature and pressure it UNK to a gas
okay
you can't see it sometimes the agents will put a UNK er material in it that you can you can smell it mm i can smell gas you know and it's this UNK thing that you can smell but very rarely can you see it
again if you re rely on l p g UNK as soon as you've got an UNK er a cylinder empty get it out the way back to your supplier to make sure that you only have it serviced on a one to one basis so you get a one for one swap
okay
how many of you ladies and gentlemen are do it yourself UNK
right
what about UNK and UNK
that we use in the home
okay
a lot of the UNK and UNK that we use in the home especially if you're putting UNK tiles down or carpet tiles down contain substances that are highly UNK
okay
the material itself is highly UNK and it's heavier than air which means in chemical means it drops down to ground level
okay
it doesn't float in the air it drops down to ground level and some years ago when i was based in ashfield i had an experience of this
we were called to an explosion and house fire in UNK in ashfield and i responded as officer in charge and i pulled up outside we dealt with the fire and then we began the investigation to find out what had happened
and the story goes to cut it quite short two UNK were in this person's house laying carpet tiles in the lounge and they were using this substance that was heavier than air and it was also highly UNK
and of course with it being heavier than air it does tell you it can give a nasty headache cause UNK etcetera
so after they'd been using this stuff with no windows open or anything one of the UNK began to feel a little bit UNK so he said to his mate and open the back door charlie will you i'm feeling a bit UNK
okay
so what happened was quick sketch that's the kitchen that's the cooker
okay
lounge window that's the lounge where the men were working
okay
so his colleague went and opened the door to the kitchen from the lounge and opened the back door
the UNK of fresh air came in through the room circulated inter mixed with the UNK air in the lounge
okay
and of course being on the air current it went on its way back and what was waiting for it here
the pilot light on the gas cooker
and as soon as it hit it UNK
it went
fortunately the building suffered more injury than what the men did UNK but obviously of course the building by insurance it would still it was still a nasty shock for the owner UNK of the house
it cracked the wall down that side and it took out that window put a big crack in there and also in the ceiling
okay
so if you are ever using UNK okay in your home please UNK to the UNK instructions
okay
this has happened in my house with a UNK
yeah
and he set kitchen on fire
yeah
he lost his UNK and most of his hair and the whole house was
yeah
okay
UNK don't guarantee that he is doing it according to the thing because
yeah
the central heating could cut in
yeah
or the gas boiler
yeah
cut in
yeah
and did exactly
yeah
the same sort of thing
yeah
we didn't have an explosion but we did have a big fire
yeah
well this does an explosion actually rather than a
yeah
little fire but there's enough damage from the explosion to d do the
job
but as the gentlemen there he's got UNK experience
yeah
erm paint is now UNK based or s i know it's gonna be UNK out but basically it's UNK based
yeah
a are they UNK
they're not as UNK as such
they're when you're talking about the normal household UNK yes it is UNK but it's not a nowhere near as UNK as your UNK that you spray your car with and things like that your touch up UNK because it doesn't contain the amount of UNK er UNK i should say in the er in its mixture as does er
a and are they heavier than air ones
or are
they are heavier than air and
again if you follow the UNK instructions if it says when using this paint allow adequate UNK
yes
then you're okay
you see i mean i had an uncle he's passed on now and he was an UNK pipe smoker
okay
and i've seen him he's made me UNK he used to have a UNK cigarette lighter and he used to fill it with this l p g stuff
and i've seen him standing UNK in front of the open fire with his back to the fire going like that and you can see the heat UNK stuff coming off and you know it's the l p g
i used to say uncle i don't lie you know you're do oh i've been doing it for years you all that sort of thing you know
you couldn't get him to alter his ways
but it's just one of those things
if you're using these substances do please be careful but not only about do it yourself er UNK
what about the normal everyday consumer goods we buy
hair UNK
UNK to make us smell nice when we're going out to a party
what does it say on the UNK
UNK
keep away from heat
UNK keep away from any source direct UNK
because again the UNK are UNK
the substance whether it be UNK or whatever it is put in under pressure
okay
and the UNK of the UNK are only designed to UNK a certain amount of pressure
once that pressure is exceeded bang
it will go just like a bomb
and that's why we strongly recommend and the environmental health people strongly recommend you never shove them in the garden refuse
when you're doing your annual burn out when you're burning all the weeds and you might think oh i'll get rid of this
and everything used to go on the old garden bonfires didn't it in the past
okay
and very often people stick one of these UNK in the er in the old garden bonfire alright
and of course when it got heated it used to blow and it used to blow all the burning UNK all over
well if your next door UNK got the window open the burning UNK lands on her bed or his bed and away you've got a fire situation okay
because these UNK when they do blow they can spread UNK quite some considerable distances
okay
so whenever you're er tt using er these type of things do be careful
i mean if i was to s stand here and tell you that self raising flour is classed as an x one as a class one UNK dust
your wife would never make any an apple pie again in her life
but i'm not gonna tell you that
okay
but it is and that's why in flour mills
they have blast UNK built in and everything else
but the reason being that er flour and stuff
is a class one dust is because if you imagine a UNK of flour
it's surrounded by a large volume of air isn't it
and the flame UNK is so rapid it's UNK that it just UNK
okay
so that's why again you have to be careful with most of our domestic er things that we have er in our homes
again poor servicing of electric appliances
if you have electrical appliances i know it's gonna cost you a few pence or probably even a few pounds these days do make sure that your electrical appliances are serviced properly and correctly
then you should be reasonably safe
gas central heating UNK if the UNK doesn't UNK fast enough you get a build up and that can go with an interesting bang
yes it can
yes it can
so everything we've got in our home the old gas central heating and that's why very often there's a reminder in your annual UNK er bill that you get
the one that's the biggest one of the year they will say when's the last time you had your er gas boiler serviced
is it ready for doing
would you like to take effectively a three star four star one star er servicing
okay
i think it's well wor er well worth your while taking er note of these things
okay
let's have a look on a little bit then
danger from fire in the home the facts
approximately there are a least sixty thousand fires a year
approximately seven hundred deaths a year
seven thousand injuries and many of these could be avoided if we will only take reasonable and proper precautions that we should do
take advice if you've got any doubt each old time fire station ha in this county has a fire safety division attached to it and there are usually two officers on duty okay
unless they're out carrying out their inspections but at least the UNK there she will help all she possibly can in the absence of the fire safety officer
if you've got any doubts get in touch with your local fire safety officer and he will come along and er UNK any problems that you may have and he will indeed er give you the best of advice that's available
okay
are they facts for nottinghamshire
those are for nottinghamshire yeah
yeah
if you're from derbyshire or leicestershire then in your local telephone directory er do you mean the fire or these numbers
those numbers
no these numbers are basically nationally at the moment
but unfortunately it's on the increase
mm
and as we are all aware i feel sure for there being in the you've been in that it is unlawful to leave a child alone in the house under the age of twelve years
cos if anything happens to that child especially in a fire situation you are liable to criminal er tt etcetera
ah in fact there's a case in london where they've just recently charged a mother where the firemen were called to a house fire over the weekend and erm during the putting the fire out they discovered a child's body er i on the UNK
er apparently she was a four year old er they UNK for the mother they found the mother and i understand now that the mother's been charged with murder
so whether she'd committed the act before and er tried to cover it up i don't know cos obviously it's subject to sub UNK at the moment until they've got the everything in the outcome
but that's the latest thing i've heard of on the one anyway
yeah
how can we protect our homes then
okay
we've gone along to lengths of making sure that all our electrical appliances are in good working order
we switch everything off at night that's reasonable to switch off obviously we're leaving the fridge and UNK on and the electric clock working
okay
we close all the doors at night
what else can do to protect our homes
what should we be thinking of doing
smoke alarms
smoke alarm
how many of you got smoke alarms
quite a few of you
good
okay
and we should also have a fire escape plan
okay
just to s talk a little bit on the smoke alarms and then we'll go into the video cos i i'm UNK of the time
okay
heat two types of smoke detector you get in the home heat and smoke
okay
heat reacting
increase in temperatures and smoke UNK to smoke and fumes
okay
domestic smoke alarms are basically two types
the UNK type and in this in the centre of the core of the er detector is er a small chamber and any UNK or substance getting in that chamber is UNK by a small UNK source
okay
but don't worry about the UNK source it's not gonna do you any harm whatsoever
you're not going to suddenly turn green and walk about like that you know
okay
it UNK causes the current to be completed and then that sets off the alarm
okay
and the optical type it contains this UNK cell which UNK alarm when the beam is disturbed by smoke UNK
so very often you'll see it on these erm infra red things in er burglar alarm systems
where you can see a little red light UNK going in one corner and a reflecting light in the opposite corner
and anything that goes in between those UNK the beam and it causes an electric current to sound the alarm and it's the same thing that happens with the er UNK
okay
what's the reaction factor
well let's just let's have a little look
okay
the UNK detector often a little bit quicker to react to a hot UNK type of fire such as your chip pan
okay
the optical detector ideal to react to UNK type of fire a example a cigarette fallen down the side of the er UNK
some UNK incorporate the two types in a single unit to give you a better performance
okay
but they are both UNK in th they'll do and they'll both do the job
so don't start getting yourself worried well have i got an UNK or have i got an op an optical one
the only thing you have to bear in mind is that if you have a smoke detector that UNK to the british standard UNK mark british standard five four five part one that'll be quite sufficient
but what should we do to ensure that our smoke detector is working properly
test it
test it
yeah
test it on a weekly basis
okay
but what also should be do
cook fish
cook fish
yes
yes
or UNK them
that goes off when we
yes
cook fish
always
yeah
yeah
will do
yeah
mine always goes off whenever i'm UNK anything at all
yeah
mm
yeah
yes
you will find they are very susceptible and that's the object of the exercise
that's why they are so keen
and that's why in buildings industrial and commercial buildings where we put heat and smoke UNK in for the protection of life and that's why you put it in your homes
erm it is because they are so acute the least little UNK and they're away
okay
you must also remember ladies and gentlemen to change the battery at least once a year
or especially when you start getting the low UNK about every thirty seconds
okay
or be aware that the UNK could happen when
is it on
you're on holiday
pardon
or be aware that the UNK in our case happened when we were on holiday
yes
mm
mm
it cold doesn't it
can trigger them off
this
mm
has happened to us several times
been away at
yeah
sometimes can get a cold
winter in the winter
yeah
and we've come back or in fact
yeah
our son had been in to check the house
yeah
and the thing was going so
taken the battery out
yeah
and he thought the battery you know was running down but in fact it wasn't
mm
it it's the cold
yeah
sometimes
but
you can get those a little bit offset with temperature
yeah
that will affect them b
this happens every time doesn't it
yeah
yeah
sometimes you will get a er a little bit offset with temperature but it's only a minute thing
i'd rather have that than nothing at
yeah
all
yeah
it's cold that's affecting the battery
yeah
and if it and if instead of putting the ordinary zinc and carbon battery in you put a UNK battery in it'll stop it doing that
okay
so
right
try that
expert advice there
okay
right
the other thing is ladies and gentlemen i don't know whether you know or not but it is now if you're having a new home built fresh build as we call it okay
but it's now in order to comply with the building regulations nineteen ninety two it is mandatory for you to have an UNK operated smoke detection system in your home
so if you are thinking cos you are now finishing work and you're going to retire somewhere nice
okay
in this country anyway at least in the u k and you're having a new dream cottage built okay to your needs and satisfaction okay
please remember
that in order to conform to the current building regulations it is now mandatory to have a proper er UNK mains operated smoke alarm system installed in the home
otherwise the tt building will have deemed to not comply to b one of the building regulations which i don't want to go into too much detail but basically what it is that with effect from nineteen ninety one the smoke alarm smoke detector bill came into er operation and it was brought in into the nineteen ninety two building regulations when they were amended from the nineteen eighty five regulations that states now any new build homes shall have and be fitted with a mains operated with battery backup smoke detection system
and in fact in some parts of the country there have been experiments tested with having UNK system fitted into the home
how long do
okay
the batteries last if the mains are off while you're away
about er twenty four to thirty six hours
because part of the condition of your insurance policy in some cases if you're away more than x number of days the mains should be switched off
yeah
yeah
that's something obviously
you go abroad for
yeah you'd
a month
you'd take with your insurance company to make sure you were still covered if anything UNK happened while you know
but er normally your
battery on a mains system will last forty eight t thirty six to forty eight hours
that's thirty six to
yeah
forty eight hours worth of noise
no
it's thirty six to forty eight hours of standby
cover
cover
so if your mains goes off through an electrical storm or something
like that or your power is cut off because the e the m e b is digging the road up down and they say that your electric will be off for the next
yeah
x number of hours then your battery will take over and it will operate
the fire al your domestic system for a period of thirty six to forty eight hours
what about the batteries in a battery operated one then
how long do they last
well in the normal battery operated one they
for years
they're not affected at all
they wi they will last at least twelve months
ah
yeah
it does seem self UNK if one authority requires you to have a mains operated system and another authority says turn off electricity if you're going away
and the gas
and the water
well
yeah
well yes
what it is le let's just sort of get things as i say in a new build situation if you were having a new house built
the building authority anywhere in the u k even in scotland and northern ireland will require you to have a built in smoke detector system mains with battery
obviously
once a building has been built and you've got that in it's under you then to maintain it
okay
if you are going away on holiday like i go away on holiday and probably some your colleagues and you're going abroad for two three weeks it makes UNK to try and protect your home as soon as you possibly as much as you can by UNK the risk
so the first thing you do is turn off your gas
you turn off your water and you turn off your electric
because there's nobody going to unless you've got somebody watching your house unless you get a an enforced entry or unlawful entry into your home nothing's gonna happen because you know alright you've left you've your fridge and UNK switched on
okay
so you've got to have your mains for your fridge UNK haven't you
basically
mm
so you're gonna leave your mains on anyway for fridge UNK
so there's no great problem really
providing you're you are correctly UNK and your wires are okay then no problem
i can't see er you're gonna have any particular problem with your insurance company cos you've got to leave your fridge UNK switched on haven't you
mm
otherwise when you come back from a month in UNK or UNK or wherever you've been you know or UNK
whichever takes your fancy you're gonna have a right mess in your kitchen aren't you
yeah
so if i were you i would just have a word with your insurance company and make sure that everything's okay but you're obviously they must know that you've got to leave your er fridge UNK switched on so you've got to have your mains UNK on
okay
are you alright on that
or have
you got a
i wouldn't trust anything this government does so
well it's not it's not the government that's doing it
anyway
it's the
yeah
okay
any questions ladies and gentlemen
before we se now hopefully it should bring us to about four o'clock
now this video although it's american based ignore that fact that they've got tower block UNK and that'll mean we've got high rise buildings i in the city of nottingham and places like that
okay
but try and look at the fundamental basis of what they're trying to put over to you on the video okay
that's the main thing and then if you've got any questions afterwards hopefully we'll still have time to go through a few questions
okay
it is essential that we plan to get out alive ladies and gentlemen
okay
so if you have a if you live in er a two storey house okay
make sure that all r eve even if you're in a bungalow make sure that all your doors are closed at night okay
get everybody preferably into the front of the house in the bedroom upstairs get some clothing or some packing UNK at the base of the door to stop the smoke UNK through the bottom of the door okay
go to the window shout and make it make your plight known to your neighbours because normally there's somebody passing policeman on his beat or somebody who'll make your plight known
okay
if it becomes necessary the
invitation from me and also the UNK society
thank you
and now i introduce erm mr to present his paper on the northern regions of
thank you erm mr chairman
er mr chairman ladies and gentlemen i'd like to present the early result of an audit of the UNK which has been performed over the northern region
er the audit period UNK eight months starting
april nineteen ninety one and ended on the thirty first of november
twelve out of sixteen separate hospital sites within the northern region were included
one of these sites was a teaching hospital and the remaining eleven sites were a mixture of large and small district general hospitals
erm the northern region audit UNK er the national audit er and has been presented by er mr and its erm data collection UNK from it in that erm all notes were reviewed at three months er by using a standard pro UNK independently by two clinical UNK and so would not be
upon self by medical staff at each site
and all medical staff at each site knew what data was being collected before the audit started
w we have obviously collected a lot of data er from the audit and today i'm presenting the initial er early result
our main aims initially have been to assess mortality and major UNK arising from t u r p within the northern region and assessing also the inter site variation for this
in our er assessment of major UNK we have included a return to theatre er a UNK blood UNK of more than two units of blood and the development of UNK
we have also assessed written evidence in the notes of counselling for UNK
er in our first assessments of mortality and major UNK we would UNK our consultants into three types general UNK with an interest in UNK
district general hospital UNK and teaching hospital UNK
we have also looked at the effect of volume on er mortality and major UNK by comparing sites where fewer than one hundred cases were performed during the audit period sites where more than one hundred cases were performed and we have also examined the effects upon mor mortality of both admission types and UNK
during the audit period one thousand four hundred and thirty one operations are performed and of them one thousand three hundred and ninety six were t u r p
the mean patient age was seventy one years and the mean weight UNK was twenty seven UNK
the percent of patients er who were put into the audit erm varied from four to thirty five percent erm site for site
this shows the early UNK mortality and we have defined early mortality as appearing at less than thirty days
the mean overall early mortality was point nine percent and the inter site variation for this UNK from zero to three point eight percent
the late UNK mortality and we have defined this as death occurring between thirty and ninety days was a mean of three point seven percent for the region as a whole and the inter site variations for this UNK from one point seven percent to six point eight percent
would say that there were no differences in mortality rates when looking at the various UNK and control
the early mortality for elected admissions was point four percent and this was found to be significantly lower than the early mortality rate for emergency admissions which was two point four percent some six times higher
the late mortality rate for elected admission was two point nine percent and this again was significantly less than the er late mortality rate for emergency admissions which was six point one percent
examining the effects of UNK type the early mortality patient with UNK was point three percent and this was significantly less than the early mortality for those patients who had UNK cancer which was two point nine percent almost ten times greater
the late mortality rate for disease was one point seven percent and again this was significantly less than the late mortality for patients with UNK cancer which was some four times higher at eight point four percent
a mean of two percent of patients were returned to theatre across the northern region after t u r p and this UNK from zero to seven point five percent
a mean of two point four percent of patients received a blood UNK of greater than two units across the region and again this UNK from zero to six point six percent across the region
a mean of eight percent of patients developed UNK and we have classified patients as having de developed UNK if they have developed two out of three of the following a temperature of greater than thirty eight degrees celsius or a positive blood culture
the rate for this was zero to sixteen point nine percent across the region
you may have noticed over the last three slides that several of sites have had a zero er percentage registered and we certainly feel that in a couple of these sites this was probably due to poor note keeping rather than a percentage
this slide shows the cumulative percent of early mortality and major UNK
the dark areas on the slide are er the dark areas on each bar at the bottom represent the early mortality rate
the UNK areas represent returning to theatre the white areas represent blood UNK of greater than two units and a UNK area represent patients developing UNK
if it's expressed as a percentage of patients the bar on the left side represents those sites who performed more than one hundred cases during the audit period
there were five of these sites and in the UNK in total nine hundred and twenty eight operations were performed over the five sites
this bar on the right hand side represents those sites where less than one hundred cases were performed during the eight month audit period there were seven of these sites and they performed a total of four hundred and sixty eight operations
when we looked at the cu cumulative percentage mortality and major UNK it was found to be significantly less in those sites performing more than one hundred operations compared to those sites performing less than one hundred operations during the audit period
in a mean of thirty percent of patients across the region there was evidence o well there was written evidence of counselling for UNK and this varied from zero to just under seventy one percent
we found that patients who were significantly younger er sorry we found that patients who were UNK for UNK were significantly younger er but we also found that UNK status did not seem to have an effect on whether they were UNK for UNK or not
in summary mr chairman the overall mortality rate for disease for t u r p over the northern region was point three percent and this UNK very well with the large published theories from america but we did find large inter site variations for both mortality and major UNK rates
we also er demonstrated that mortality and major UNK rates were significantly higher in sites treating fewer than one hundred patients compared with sites treating more than one hundred patients
so we feel that there may be a volume effect
this difference could not be explained by the distribution of either UNK types or admission types between the erm sites that had less than one hundred cases and those that had more than one hundred cases
we did find however that UNK type and admission type overall had a significant adverse effect on mortality and overall we feel that written ev evidence of counselling for UNK was poor and was not acceptable
thank you
thank you mr
we have time for several questions i wonder if you'd be kind enough
thank you mr chairman ladies and gentlemen
there have been suggestions in recent years that there's a sub group of patients with bladder cancer in whom there is a reduced likelihood of recurrence and it may be possible in those patients to amend the follow up protocol and UNK the six and nine month check UNK
before implementing such change in our practice we reviewed our own experience and assessed the likely impact of that change and i'll present that experience today
the paper which first drew our attention to this possibility was that of UNK in nineteen eighty six
he looked at four fourteen patients with well differentiated on the basis of tumours and found that both number of tumours and size of tumours were significant in determining the likelihood of recurrence
he also found that UNK eighty percent of patients who had a negative three month cystoscopy never had another recurrence in the remainder of their follow up
UNK only ten percent of patients who had recurrence at that three month cystoscopy went on to have no further recurrence in the remainder of the follow up
several other ones issue in a number of different ways
UNK looked at three hundred and five patients in an m r c study and from a UNK analysis he found the number of tumours from that diagnosis was the single most feature
the size and the result of the three month check cystoscopy were also of considerable importance
morgan in nineteen ninety one took a hundred and seventy patients again found the number of tumours at diagnosis to be most important
then he looked specifically at the effect of the results of the three month or si six month UNK but they did note that only those pa only those patients who had recurrence in the first year went on to progressive stage
and the final paper of these
UNK in nineteen ninety two a hundred and seventy patients and again found the number of tumours the most important feature
the size was also important but only in those patients who had single tumours at presentation
despite these this data there seems to be little evidence yet of any change in common practice of three month check UNK in the first year six monthly in the second year and yearly checks thereafter
the papers i've mentioned did make some suggestions in particular UNK in his paper recommended that if the patient had a single tumour presentation and a negative three month cystoscopy then subsequent cystoscopy could be performed yearly
kent performed a mathematical analysis to determine the UNK follow up erm regime and for patients with well differentiated non UNK tumours and no recurrence in the first year he recommended a nine monthly regime
and finally morgan looking again at UNK well differentiated tumours suggested a regime similar to that of UNK namely missing out two or three of the check UNK in the first year
we felt from this that there was there was reasonable evidence to introduce this programme into our practice and we looked at our patients erm at and we looked at all patients who'd had UNK or well differentiated transition cell UNK of the bladder at diagnosis a non UNK tumour small UNK with a minimum follow up of one year
we didn't UNK measure or weigh our bladder tumours over this time erm we have excluded any patient any patient where the weight was recorded to be over ten UNK and similarly any patient wh where it was recorded that the diameter was greater than three centimetres
and we've also excluded those patients where the surgeon recorded that it was a large extensive tumour
we excluded patients with UNK or tumours at diagnosis
we divided our patients into three groups depending on the results of the three month check cystoscopy
group one had no recurrence at the three months
group two had recurrence at the site of the original tumour and group three had recurrence elsewhere in the bladder
we calculated the recurrence rate using the formula here the number of UNK at which UNK were found divided the total length of follow up in months and multiplied by a hundred to produce a convenient figure
and this is what we found
we identified a hundred and forty one patients who fitted the criteria at the diagnosis
the mean age was sixty three and the male to female ratio was approximately three to one
the maximum length of follow up was twenty six years
group one which is the patients we're particularly interested in there are ninety two patients here and eighty percent of them seventy four patients had no recurrence in the first year
there were eighteen patients who had recurrence twenty percent of patients who did have recurrence in the first year and we've UNK those labelling seven patients protocol UNK
these were patients who missed the one or more check UNK in that first year and went on to have recurrence when they were next UNK
the mean recurrence rate for this group overall was one point nine five
there were forty nine patients who had UNK at the three month cystoscopy
erm and the recurrence rates were considerably increased at eight point one and nine point three
and this does tend to add weight to the suggestion that the result of the three month cystoscopy is a good guide to the likelihood of developing recurrence
looking at UNK a little closer of the eighteen patients fifty percent only had a UNK recurrence in that first year and no patient had more than four UNK
of the protocol UNK those seven patients who missed out a cystoscopy and then had UNK six have only had occasional UNK during the remainder of their follow up and one required UNK four years from diagnosis when he developed multiple UNK
if we implemented this protocol on these patients we would certainly be leaving these eighteen patients with small tumours in their bladder for several months longer than would previously have been the case
now we don't know the long term effect of that but the experience with the protocol UNK suggests that they won't come to any great harm but obviously the number is small
one patient in the whole series went on erm to progress to muscle UNK disease
he was in group three
that is he had tumour elsewhere in the bladder at his three month cystoscopy and no patient has died of bladder cancer from these hundred and forty one patients
to summarize for a well UNK group of patients with small UNK non UNK transition cell UNK at d at diagnosis and negative three month cystoscopy we found eighty percent of our patients would certainly have come to no harm at all if their second cystoscopy had been one year from diagnosis
twenty percent of our patients would have had recurrence in that year but on the basis of our experience we think it unlikely they would have come to any great harm as a result of having their cystoscopy delayed and we would recommend this protocol to the management of UNK bladder cancer
thank you
thank you
i think what we should do as we've got two papers on similar topics is er take any questions that are specifically related to the t to this paper and the methods used in this paper and then after the next paper have both speakers up to address the topic er of er of timing of follow up UNK
are there any questions now that we would like to ask
light on the UNK
UNK us a little less so that we can see
right
can i just ask you your protocol UNK who
mm
should have come back but didn't
yes
did any of them have symptoms during that time when they had UNK that brought them back
i don't think they did no
no
they all just came back for a regular routine follow up just a little bit late
right
well let's assume you're saving the questions for after the second paper
shall we now move on to er the next paper the better use of a check cystoscopy by steve

well one subject that i think a lot of us shy away from is mental illness
and we don't seem to be very UNK in our society of people who are a bit different
part of the problem is that most of us don't know very much about mental illness and we tend to see very negative images around us and on television
something like UNK for instance is widely misunderstood
even the idea that people have a split personality isn't strictly true
now this coming september there's going to be a mental health awareness week but if you'd like to get involved before that then the nottingham branch of the want to encourage anyone who's interested to visit them
now their UNK is a positive response to mental illness and are heavily involved in the awareness week
they're also there to help anyone who's had experience of mental illness or who cares for someone who's mentally ill
just call us for more details about the group and their next meeting which is on july the sixteenth
and finally a local furniture project are opening a new twelve bed UNK for young people who are homeless
it's seen a the first stage towards living more independently for many young people and they're offering quick access to a bed for the night
now need you help because they hope to offer a lot more than just a roof over the heads
they need donations of books and magazines board games a t v UNK and sewing machines
