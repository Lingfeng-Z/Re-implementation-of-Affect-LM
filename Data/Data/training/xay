a car is stolen every minute and the frightening reality is that your car could be next
if you leave your car even if not for long you should be taking necessary precautions
always lock your car whenever you leave it even if only for a moment
if you have an alarm or security devices remember to set them and close all windows
also have your windows UNK with the registration or vehicle identification number
this will UNK the car thief
remove all personal UNK from the car when you leave
and it's also important to never leave young children or animals in a parked car because if windows are closed there is a grave danger of UNK

good morning
monday morning trent it's just gone twenty minutes past eleven
as we begin for the next few weeks on monday mornings with jenny a day in the life a day in the life of nottinghamshire county council
and jenny recently was chatting by the UNK at county hall to mick who's the chief executive of nottinghamshire county council about just exactly what does the council do
it's a very large organization and it provides most of the local government services for the county of nottinghamshire
so we serve a population of over a million people
we provide all of the key services education social services fire police highways libraries
very wide range of activities
so that's a big and complex organization
but as well as providing services it's also the council which speaks for the whole county
so where do you start
i mean if somebody wanted to find out about erm a house or child care where do they turn
erm well in every case they go to the individual service
i mean eventually of course if somebody is UNK and they don't believe that they're getting er what they want then they may well end up speaking to me or writing to me but er it's the first place to start is with the individual service
so i if it's education you start with the school
if it's er social services you start with the area social services office
erm if it's erm er a highways matter for instance we've got new area offices for highways matters
some very big issues for instance er like how nottinghamshire responded to the prospect of the closure of mines
er other big issues are how we actually make the best use of european money
but of course you move UNK in the same day sometimes from very big issues like that to very small issues
somebody actually writing in as somebody did yesterday because they want to deliver erm some w some elderly ladies want to deliver some goods into an area wh where tr traffic restrictions exist and they want some help so that they can actually park their car whilst they UNK

and mick chatting to jenny about what we can expect over the next few weeks as we spend a day in the life
well we're going to er have a look at all at lots of exciting areas
er you're going to look at one of our UNK which is leisure services
nottinghamshire has a national reputation for work that it er does in sports and arts
er and that's because of a good cooperation between the districts and the county council
erm we've er we you'll be looking at education our biggest service and a service which we should which is going through some very profound changes at the moment where we're trying to er increase the resources that are within individual schools so that they can make their own decisions erm about er how they best meet the needs of their youngsters
and of course you're gonna look at social services which is one of the most difficult areas
it's a great county
er within it there's a great city and erm we've er g got a very good future
so er i hope what this er series of interviews will er serve to prove is both the quality of thinking that's going on about public services and our very strong commitment to the customers and citizens we serve

only two consultants are working on ward four at hospital a year after a health authority report called for increased supervision

the government's so called UNK army proposals have come under fire at a meeting of teachers and councillors in nottingham this afternoon
they're angry over plans aimed at encouraging parents to take up teaching in primary schools
linda a UNK for the county's education advisory committee says a one year training course isn't enough to turn parents into teachers
just knowing children does not mean that you can teach that you will be UNK with all the UNK of the national curriculum that you have any degree of UNK skill
there are so many things involved
obviously people appreciate that children learn things and they can help them but the question is why
how
when
what is most appropriate
all of those things need quite a degree of training
now the government has said that erm if these proposals are implemented parents would be given a years training
graduates straight out of university can do one year UNK training to become teachers isn't that the same sort of thing
no in many respects it isn't
it has taken a hundred and forty years to build a graduate profession
and we as teachers see no reason why that should be cut away overnight
we're not saying that people shouldn't have the opportunity to train to teach
of course they should
but why should women for women t it will be become second class citizens and why should our nursery and infant age children be second class citizens too
the women deserve a right to have a proper training not a UNK down version
and then as sure as night follows day they will be paid less

the group were approached by two males who were not known to them and the female was asked to enter the tent and both youths took turns in entering the tent where a serious sexual assault took place on the female
it is felt that the persons responsible are in fact local although both youths stated that they were from the nottingham area
it's thought one of the youths is called mike or dave he's white about five foot ten with light UNK hair and was wearing dark jeans a dark top and a UNK cap
the other could be called UNK he's of mixed race about five foot six with dark UNK hair and was wearing dark jeans and a dark UNK jacket
UNK fallen again to a new thirty year low and now stands at one point two percent down from one point three percent
danny reports
during june sharp falls in the price of seasonal foods like fruit and vegetables contributed to the heavy slide in inflation
and the start of the high street summer sales with clothing and household goods being discounted also played a part
after removing the effects of falling mortgage rates the underlying inflation rate the one the treasury watches was unchanged at two point eight percent
it could be the figure will turn out to be the low point of the trend although if the pound continues to strengthen that'll be good news for the government's control over inflation

it's message is to think before going into a car
think about the possibilities think about the consequences it may not be you it may be an innocent life

nottingham spokesman for housing charity tim says it's a major problem
we've noticed that the numbers of young homeless people who are coming to see us have risen and risen over the last few months and few years
and it's all a situation that was predicted back in nineteen eighty eight when the government cut benefits for sixteen and seventeen year olds
at the time voluntary organizations like said if you take away young people's money you take away their ability to find housing
what will happen is you'll have homeless people on the streets begging
and that is precisely what has happened
UNK is a manager at house a day centre for the homeless on in nottingham
she says the governments recent care in the community legislation has forced many people with mental health problems onto the streets
i think it's made it more difficult for people to be monitored when they're er taking medication
i think that's a problem they're on medication they're all perfectly fine
but if their UNK not being taken correctly then obviously that creates problems

half past two on a wednesday afternoon on trent f m as we join rachel at the UNK
carol is a member of which is a group that help people with UNK and other blood disorders like UNK disease
and it's usually help with the disease that her members want
not with things like the shopping
mainly it's straight on with the illness
they don't really talk about what's happened in the past all they're bothered about is what's happening to them at present
we don't give out medical advice cos we're not qualified for that but we do sit and listen to them and they talk about different things and what they've got to go through
we can give them booklets information on you know what to expect
is different from other groups because as well as giving people someone to chat to the can give some people financial help which carol thinks is really important
at least when the financial stress is UNK they can get on then with going to the treatment for UNK or a blood disorder whether it's UNK whatever
erm they can then feel that their family's being looked after as well so it helps them not to worry about that side of it
carol became involved with the group because she knew someone with UNK and wanted to help
but coping with the disease can be UNK for both the patient and their UNK
i think a lot of people do realize that with UNK you do lose your hair
but it's alright just you know knowing about that but when it's actually going to happen to you it's something totally different
you do try and use them through that and try and make them more confident in themselves they're you know people do accept this a lot more today than they used to erm and you know they needn't feel quite so self conscious
there is some positive news though
in children's UNK particularly the cure rate is really high now so that's wonderful
and the different stages of ages the cure rates are getting a lot better
so it's not all of it is terminal and not everybody's gonna die with it
are there for everyone with the disease and other blood disorders and they always need helpers
if you know a little about cancer feel you could cope with all the emotions involved and you'd like to give them a hand then carol would love to hear from you
for more information just call us here at the trent f m UNK

er
i think you're meant to ask if that's a true record
not that any of us was
yes
here very much
so
yeah well i would say that was a very true record i was here i think that's a
yeah
true record
i wasn't
yeah
yeah
you weren't here
tt
right thank you mr secretary
matters arising
several things come straight to mind
do you want to take them or shall i remind you of what the headings were
er y erm well the three things i've got down here piano i notice the UNK arrived
er which is very good
is there only one key
mhm
not that we've found it really matters we've been
yeah
able to get into it anyway
but er
mm
well of course yes
that's fine
the tickets and the UNK d did er
could i could i just go back on the piano please
yes
yes you
yeah
erm could i suggest that the committee might like er to ask me to right to the w i to thank them for getting a new piano
i think that's a
i think it would be prudent
i think that's a
i would certainly think it's a good idea
good evening malcolm
good evening
i know i've been er elected vice i intend to display all the er UNK
lack of UNK
well that's
erm you're being recorded by the way
would you like to sign this to say that your words are being recorded and you don't object
that's just like a clarinet player
i don't give a damn
i'm sure that
but you've got to sign otherwise
oh
same also liz if you don't mind
so yes if you could write to the if you could write to the women's institute that would be very good
thank you
well i will when i've got my pen back
right that's fine
oh dear what a UNK
what's that scribble
like a doctor's signature
thank you very much i think you can read mine
sorry er ch could we raise that under
under carols for everyone
yes if you want
it's er
yes that can come along later
er there was something else i sorry UNK y you were going to raise
oh the boys' brigade but that can that can also you
yes
were going to write to them
yes
as well
erm
i think all i think most of the other things i the only er one i would like to raise is that it was agreed that the new committee should be recommended to appoint a press secretary
yes well that's the next item of course
it is isn't it
i
yeah
i'd forgotten i'd put that on the agenda
how clever i am at these things
yes
no other matters arising
okay
number three actually it it's not number three
there's two number threes aren't there
there are two number threes
appoint appointment of press secretary
appointment of press secretary erm this was decided last time that a press secretary would be a very good idea er to try to achieve more publicity for the orchestra not just for er concerts but perhaps for recruitment purposes too
we now need to appoint someone
i should say i s i have today because it was things were running a bit late written to the three usual papers
mhm
er the UNK newark advertiser with er the usual useless information that they don't do much with
and er so we we're covered to date
right
but i would like someone ideally to take over from now on
so that's where we go from here
i don't know whether anyone is jumping with joy at the thought
ooh that's quite good
well i could i could er i could probably take on that task if you wish cos it's easy enough to actually write letters to people cos i can just ask my secretary to do that
so that's ac it's actually quite easy
it
and i certainly wouldn't mind doing that
well i if you could combine it with the chair that would be
gosh
no reason why not
the only thing i don't know i
make sure make sure that this secretary gets a ch suitable UNK at christmas
our staff get very well treated here
would be nice if other people do
but
yeah
but what i what i what i don't know is who the who the contact at these
no
various places are
i will give you a note then
yeah
yes
yes i won't tell my wife otherwise she'll be UNK
mm
yes
normal state of matters isn't it
so that's that that's that rather awkward item so quite rapidly sorted out yes
it was yes
and john's got us onto the next one i see
well i thought you'd have to be
yes concert at holy UNK church which is of course our next concert
erm these are the these are our publicity posters
right
yeah
there are a few at that size
mm
very nice
nice
and that is er one of the programmes which are now being printed
oh lovely
have you done those
thank you very much
no jill did
oh
efficient
terribly
she's not very pleased with it
she asked me to say that for the record
oh no it's beautiful
it's nice to have
i think it's not i
the erm actual churches
mhm
i think it's excellent
yes i think it's
but she's actually been in bed for five days
oh very nasty
well i would like to propose that the again we er we thank jill for this
i don't intend to write if you don't mind
well supposedly she'll come tomorrow night anyway
ah
and do some work
oh lovely
it's an excellent poster
lovely
and i will endeavour to advertise this
do you want us
can we take these
to take some to hang around
you can take some and who normally put things where
well that that's the important thing is we shouldn't they shouldn't
just lie around anywhere
i'll take i'll take a couple for the moment
i did about twenty because i thought well we don't normally sort of UNK more than
that do we
is there a notice board down at the that one of those could be put on
oh yes aha i will do that
that's a jolly good idea
to oh shall i put that one up as well
mm
that one
anyway
if i take the rest away and try and who normally sticks one in the library or
it needs a big one doesn't it
i
i usually do that
no they no d don't give don't give them big ones
don't they put a big one
they don't put them up
that right
well they don't put up little ones either i mean they they're very UNK to put
they've got so little space
that's right
UNK they're peculiar in the library
yeah libraries are very funny aren't they
mhm
i find that with our local but well twist their arm
but it's a UNK if you take something of reasonable size not too far in advance you're usually alright
that right now
it's three to four weeks
UNK
yes
erm the arrangement erm i think for this concert arise on the er sheet which we distributed last week and the week before er
which i have UNK forgotten to bring with me
doesn't matter we've got some spares
ah
i knew somebody would take the hint
not here but we've got some spares
ah
we've got some spares in the
that's unfortunate
erm which i can remember som go something along the lines of UNK at four thirty picnic tea
f four
four
beg your pardon
four
well
sharp
this is all off the top of my head four sharp picnic tea concert and go home
or go back wherever
i anticipate that the concert should be over about nine thirty although i hope no if we finish nine thirty five no one 's going to
shoot me
i wouldn't mind if it's over
er refreshments everyone's going to bring their own er packed thing which we're going to share
UNK should i
i should think
last time there was some tea around available
i must yes shall i
yes there was
i've said on the note that tea will be available i must admit i didn't check that but i will do that
well the kitchen is still as was
that's what i thought yes
alright
yes but is there somebody going to be climbing all over us saying no you can't use our tea UNK
well unfortunately the lady who lives in the top cottage is now in erm hospital
ah
cos she had her what we think is probably a final stroke not too long ago
so erm she's usually the one who would have UNK round
yes
and said
yes
you can't do that and all the rest of it
yes
erm and the place is like UNK at the moment cos it's got double sort of ten lever locks on every door because somebody was UNK from there
tt
not too
oh
long ago
but i well i will make arrangements for it to be opened of course
yeah
on the afternoon but i wi when i'm doing that i will check up about the tea UNK and
yeah
so on
has anyone got anything else they want particularly they'd like
i mean er d we usually offer a choice of soft drinks
yes
er it might be nice if someone was to er obtain something
okay well i'll bring some
well i'm going to the cash and carry sometime
this week so if you want me to get some squash or something
well provided someone does we don't want two but we do want one to bring it
yes
especially for a summer concert on a boiling hot day
oh yes
i've got i'm going to the cash and carry anyway
you're going to the cash and carry so
i'm going to the cash and carry yeah
i was actually considering getting some of those little boxes
yeah
i er
or whatever i mean er as well as rather than the
expensive
they're expensive and they're
not very nice
i think we're better off with orange squash just
ordinary orange squash and dilute it down
to be honest
okay
it's certainly more flexible because you can then
we've got we've got the rest left for use on a wednesday then
use
er
yes
there's still quite a big bottle for use on a wednesday down
is there
is there
well we want to use that up
mhm
from a hygiene point of view it's it must be a little ancient by now
well i don't know if it's if it's if it's got sugar in it'll be fine
sugar free one
we'll see what they've got if they've got something exciting i might get more than one exciting squash so
i'm alright as long as the tea keeps flowing i
cash and carry
don't care
we didn't actually get through all the arrangements question erm j john a are you w there was some ce uncertainty as to whether or not you were going to be able to bring your UNK piano
well we'll use the piano that's there
you're going to use the piano that's there
cos it's for piano UNK not
yeah
two UNK cos i was
the piano there is adequate for the job is it
well not really but we'll use it
is i is it in tune
because if we're going to use it for the UNK and er
well of course it's in tune
right
yeah
it's electronic
oh is it
no er the piano in the church we're talking about
yes
oh i'm sorry oh sorry
yes
i thought you were talking about
yes
an ordinary piano in the church
oh right oh well
yes
that's fine yes
ideal
no
ideal yeah
it's UNK
oh mm yes
oh even better
we can put it down
is it one
no
i think it's got a piano and UNK john
oh
well we could use the UNK for the UNK anyway
oh yes
oh yeah that'd be nice that'd be great
yeah
that's alright UNK i heard it'd
but what we can't get is an organ out of it which is a pity
well we have got an organ in the church
there's
there is an organ in the church anyway
yeah
ah but that's the devil to try and coordinate that with an orchestra when you're at the other end
yes it is isn't it
sense of
you can't put the devil in a church john come on
the one thing which we haven't got still are er bells
mm
er other than wh the church ones which obviously aren't a lot of use to us for this
can use that
erm i was thinking of phoning john i don't know if anyone else knows anyone else who might have UNK bells of the right pitches
what do we want those for
er in a UNK garden one of these vital things it d it you can do it on a piano but it doesn't really sound
has got any
that's a thought isn't it
has probably got some in his shop
well i don't know if UNK bells are what most music shops carry standard
mm no
mm
well he has most UNK stuff
it wants to be deep o a deep one i mean i it's
not just a not a high e it's got to be a very low e
yeah
mm
it'd be worth asking him first though
that's not that's not a bad idea yes
mm
john would
yes
come across if he's got access to
well i was thinking if he couldn't actually make it he could actually l like
it's not really the height of the concert season is it
no it isn't no
i'll ask him then
tt er anything on those arrangements
i don't think so
publicity and programmes
well we've got the programmes being printed haven't we john
yeah
and the posters we can ask members of the society to distribute those er over the next er
i ought to ask malcolm if he c i don't know what day you'll be in
sorry
the
there's only there's only actually one day i'm not there
ah so if i
i'll UNK that n only one day i don't appear
if one can go very gentle with i think in
i
the end we're going to have to seek alternative
yeah
it's a matter
arrangements she seems to be getting more and more
yeah
UNK under there
yeah
it's a matter we need
cos they're doing more and more in half an hour
yeah
is this copying we're talking about
yeah
this is yeah
yeah we've got an a i can copy but we've only got an a four UNK
mm
which won't er which is just a sort of straightforward UNK
yeah
but i can c copy there
the only trouble is the only other place i know with a UNK it's one of these typical photocopying as we know you know
well i think the school here does do erm er you know outside work
we do
and we have a woman does it
erm yeah
well th that's two
just have to pay very cheaply
cos i know the woman who does the is the UNK
how much is it a copy
woman down here
two p i think
two p
mm
yeah well that's still
yeah
about two thousand per cent up
on our current system
getting an awful lot more
well i mean sh we could probably do it cheaper you know
i wonder whether the would do you know
it might
i think le let's keep let's keep the for the carols
yes that's
that's the one that it's the one that UNK me
yeah i mean we could we'll do it cheap we could do it cheap and i could work that out in a private way
yes
that's the one i'm thinking of
yeah but you mean UNK we can do the odds and ends but it's the it's the other one
yes it might be promised for the carols but it's not
yes
well
yes we'll see
right item four concert in the great hall third of november nineteen ninety three
y you'll see at the bottom of the agenda that er john and i talked about this the other night er and there are
the great hall
at least yes the great hall
ah yes right yes right
right down the bottom
oh yes it's right down the bottom isn't it
yeah
right
and there are a number of possible pieces there
did we talk about this
we did
ah right yes
someone must have made the list
er but that's just er something to talk around
i should say i have one problem and that is i have the ballet music from william tell there but that seems to have walked
er n
UNK
UNK
where did it go
i had a set a full set of music which i er was at the w i hall and has now gone
oh
where the UNK it's got to
i remember it
someone took it i think
i remember it being collected in
well i'll check in case i might have picked it up with my school stuff to be honest
i remember it being collected in but er
cos i just picked everything up that was in there thinking it was mine and
well i haven't got it
so i've probably got it
ah
if you could put it
and i put it straight in my cupboard so i'll go to the cupboard tomorrow and look
ah c if you could look i'd be very grateful
yes
but someone
i'm almost sure in fact probably have
took some of the took the clarinet parts to UNK them and they have gone
i remember discussing that
now someone took them and i don't know who took it intending
but not me
to UNK them
no
i shall have a look
no i don't know who
no
i mean i'm not looking at anyone in particular because i can't
i remember speaking about it to malcolm a and
remember
well who would do that
well i shall have a look
i don't
you and i discussed whether i was going to be able to do it
i don't i can't remember doing i can't remember taking it
it was quite a long time
i am going to raise later a number of missing parts that i
quite a
it matters for this one for this concert
haven't got but i shall have a look for that
what was that for the UNK
william tell yes
UNK william tell
oh
such a wonderful piece
it would be nice to do it i think and it would
i don't know i mean
well i may have taken it because we
had a set at school and i might have thought that was amongst my set
ah
so in
it's quite old it's sort of
i'll have two sets at school anyway then if i've got yours
of the original
bring the decent
bring both bring both yeah
is our is the UNK w going to be available for the
i have just written down that i must write to him
alright
because he has now left school having
yes
finished his exams
right
i have now left school
yeah
and well just about
and so the only communication i shall have with him is by letter but er it's the third of
UNK
november isn't it
yeah
mm
have you done now
oh yeah
i can bring some reports round for you to right then
aha ha no
it's a nasty UNK you know
we we've still got the parts for the UNK the UNK yeah
ann said ann said to me
oh yes
the other day she said
we own the parts
oh do we
oh
courtesy of a certain UNK
at the moment
just finished no more course work the last course work i'm ever going to do she says erm i've got a hundred and twenty pieces you can help me mark
the rest of the conversation is not for repetition
no
the UNK parts for the UNK clarinet UNK are somewhere between the music library in nottingham and the library here and should reach me a week tomorrow
sorry about that done it
well i don't know they usually co they usually deliver on a wednesday so with luck i'll get them tomorrow
very good
er it it's really a matter of whether you feel you'd like to do it
yeah no sweat
yes
good well okay i do
you'll be lucky yeah
erm it it's not easy
er
you are playing double bass
mm
i think i think the good part for
find a piano reduction for this cos i
i think there will i think there should be there may well be one there usually is with the
i shall make you work
i thought you'd been doing that for the thirty whatsit of july
but there may be i mean
UNK up for that
this is just a sort of first list the one thing erm you were going to ask jimmy
i have asked jimmy and jimmy has declined
right
i'm afraid f for a UNK he declined i asked him er a couple of weeks ago
tt so that was a shame
he i
we've probably got actually quite a bit of other stuff already but er
tt well if we've got a UNK a clarinet UNK and possibility of a UNK
mm
alright
tt we were expressing john and i some erm concern that the same few people seemed to be offering the UNK or we'll do something bits
and maybe it's aren't there others who can
although we did of course have that disastrous UNK that came to UNK two years ago
yeah but look
oh yes
last year we didn't actually make a lot of noise about erm you know come and do your party
piece business
the year before wh
we did
we made an awful lot of erm noise about erm you know this is not actually a co a concert this is come and do your party piece come and show off is there anything you'd like to get together
and when we actually introduced it last year it was too late
mhm
people th there wasn't really enough
mm
time quite
erm perhaps it might be an idea to
well i
open it up to the membership
well i wonder if in fact er tha that this might be a task for the vice chairman t to go round to
if the vice chairman was to
i shall do that
i shall do that
good
UNK bother
you w you will tr we don't want you know UNK i mean if we get too many it could go the other way but we i if we could get three or four items that would be very nice
and especially a er they could be from people
well i'm sure john and jimmy and bill have got something
that's what we were commenting on
yes that's the point to get someone
new lot who haven't played before
i know i realise that it's alright
you see i mean it did occur to me that er erm on the three occasions that we've done this now it always turns out to be er me involved in about just you know either playing the piano or something else in just about everything
er
yeah i'm
it's nice to have other people
i i'm working i'm working with erm howard on er a little clarinet UNK actually UNK two UNK and a UNK
erm which would be alright but then again the
the UNK doesn't practice
the r we the UNK wo i doubt whether the UNK will be there
yeah
anyway so we could get erm he'd better not be there
yes
poor lad the pressure on him
why
i've lost this
it's alright it's just about three different conversations going on here
erm we'll get er you know it's not er a very taxing UNK
no
so would be i reckon would be
's pretty good at it
and would have a good time playing it cos i there's enough there but it's not you know
alternatively the chairman could do it on his horn can't he
yes well
or the vice chairman could do it on alto clarinet and give somebody else a clarinet part to play
now there's a thought yes
mm
hey that's an idea we try this as clarinet choir
yeah
clarinet choir can sound quite nice
most UNK
whichever
with there being
that's
double bass UNK would be interesting
that's back to me again isn't it
would it
yeah
yes it would be alright if we had a decent double bass
need much more UNK at the moment
well we're going to have this UNK and i was
string player see what we can
but erm well
right
so the
you you're going to try and get some UNK out persuade members to
yes
are there any other suggestions for possible works while we're on the arrangements and the programme
i've thought of one which i don't i can't remember whether we've ever done that's UNK to UNK which
erm yeah
is quite a jolly little piece
do it but not a bad idea yes
er
we did the fireworks suite didn't we
yeah
yeah
we've done that
UNK
erm
it's the UNK isn't it
oh yeah i wasn't thinking about doing the ballet music
the one which die UNK
although some of the ballet music we actually some of
that's right
ballet UNK quite good as well
and not un not unreasonable
it was some of the ballet music we did before
did we
we did the o we did try the UNK i think er but we er we didn't get on very well with it
it didn't get on very well with us
about time we gave it another UNK
but some of the ballet UNK quite nice as well
the only slight concern i've got is there looking at what we've got here what we really need to add is something which is relatively short and relatively easy
mm
because i can imagine looking at UNK what we need are a few sort of easy things to start and end UNK with or for UNK when we're a bit thin on the ground er
well the UNK is that
the UNK is quite
yeah
useful for that yes in fact several of i suppose
i've done the wind parts for that they're done and copied
we could er there's the air for southwell we could perhaps play that again
oh mm
yes i have to tell you that the air for southwell is now in the process of UNK a beginning and an end
ah
ah
it's actually got sixteen bars of start up at the moment in short score
cos that'd be
which is being sort of developed
er cos that'd be very nice
i've got that broken arm which i had to put in a sling every time
i think that'd very good that one
and a lovely place to play it as well
oh yes
of course
mm
well if what we're looking for is another time
well i think we've probably got enough something's got to go oh we've got too much some of
yes
yes
these things will have to go but almost
certain usually we
well i could volunteer the air for southwell
try things and we discover some things don't work very
yeah
well and we drop them and we add other things
we usually have a fair bit of time to do it
to look at it so
er yes some of them will come and some of them will go and er
and a lot's going to depend on the number of UNK items of course i should think so
yes oh yes yeah
er
now copying UNK so the exactly what we
yes the copying music what i'm asking for is not so much copying there ag it's the old friend UNK well it's partly copying but it's mainly UNK of erm horn trumpet and clarinet parts
yeah
which tend to be written in every key other than the one we want them
so some things we're alright for i don't know about the clarinet UNK i've no idea what that'll come in
UNK joy
you're doing john
yes it's done
oh gosh
one in d one in e one in b
good
erm the UNK needs
yeah
doing
yeah i can
there are really it's a question there of trying to sort out who does what in there are horn parts there are no clarinet parts of course there are two ob is it two UNK two horns i can't remember UNK
erm tha that's all wind parts
so we need some clarinet parts
we need some clarinet parts yes
i think the best thing to do with the UNK is to put them along with the first
you want to put on clarinet
and put two second on UNK
second on UNK perhaps
doubling just perhaps just doubling UNK
well in that case i'll play UNK
or double or double UNK and horn
well they could do second UNK
i mean if they're not
in fact presumably one also needs to do the UNK of first UNK and second UNK in case the UNK isn't there
that's true
mm
yes
cos if you cut out the first UNK part you're in a little bit
that is that is crucial yes
yeah
so it's UNK to clarinet i haven't got the parts in here but i can if i n if someone is going to volunteer to clarinet horns will stay at horns but horn two presumably on UNK what are the what are we going to give the trumpet to do
usually it's a horn part
yeah
he's not got much choice really about it
no he hasn't really no i yeah trumpet for the horn yeah
which one goes better ho horn one or horn two
or do you want to have a look at them first
just
i mean you can imagine what th the horn parts are playing in something like thirds fifths and sixths
it sounds odd yes
up and down the intervals i mean it is a bit of a UNK really
i mean the trouble is if you put the trumpet erm if you put the trumpet too low it's it doesn't sound good and it goes out of tune
yeah
you put the ti the trumpet too high it sounds very much out of place
you don't
so er
tricky
it is tricky really
so it er you know
and probably the best thing to do is say is say trumpet plays horn two and plays quietly all the way through
mm
actually that's actually quite hard work
you can say it
it's actually quite hard work on the trumpet
well it's j it's just the same problem as playing string parts on wind instruments you
yeah
by the time you've finished you you've
you're killed
you've really had some playing
mhm
the trouble is with the second horn parts they often have a wider register gap and the first horn part which tends to UNK up and down in vaguely the same place while the second sort of goes UNK jumps up and down
wh what i'd like to do please is
the trumpet
i if someone would like to volunteer to do these UNK
i'll do the brass the horn trumpet whatever is necessary for that
and i'll do the stuff
if i may i'll give them to you tomorrow with post its telling you what to write what to UNK it to
that'll be fine yeah
i mean there's no huge hurry for those is there really at the moment so
we need well we need to have it ready
yeah
after for
yes
after this concert this is the point this is why we've
oh yes oh yes
got f we've got a month to do it in
now just as a matter of interest whilst i remember how are we off for UNK paper
point
i've got quite a bit at home
we could always print some more
but er
well i was sort of erm
it'd be cheaper to buy it actually
progressing aren't they
no
is it really
i've got a UNK that i never use
oh
yeah i'll bring it in and you can have it
yeah you can have it
no it's just as long as you've got a supply somewhere
no i
yeah
don't want it
well could you could you bring it in
i'll bring it tomorrow
yeah
please cos i appreciate more UNK paper
i've got enough stuff in our house without any erm any extra
good
so we're alright there
a while to UNK i've been printing stuff on card recently
poor lad
and then you just photocopy from the card and it's a nice and you keep the card you don't give that out
great stuff
well it's easily identified
yes
well we're probably alright for the other things for the time being but we may need about the UNK erm
alright
yes if we're doing the UNK
why
oh sorry horn and
yeah horns and er the optional clarinet may be an
the horn
i would doubt it yeah
what UNK the clarinet part in
i if er
oh god it's in f so it's in e flat
UNK
or what it is
it'll be
it's a UNK it's actually minor and i've got
well this is the one with the business i had with the library
they said no
i suppose it could be e flat couldn't it
there isn't one in e flat there's one in c minor
yeah c minor yeah
and actually they've got two UNK scores in the library one of which said it was in e flat and the other one said it was in c minor so you pays your money and you takes your choice erm
it it's very strange i've never come across
if it if it actually finishes on clarinet f which is the e flat
it's probably e flat
i i've always called it the e flat
mm
but there's one score which un UNK calls it in c minor on the and it starts in c minor so
it starts in c minor
it starts
what the one the one
the one on the roof yeah
john can i ask you full UNK during the holiday period was there any particular point you're considering about that
well just concerned about the usual thing that obviously many people are away on holiday then er i i'm wondering if th anyone UNK any particular problems this year or if anyone thinks we ought to do anything by way of special arrangements
i may not be away very often this summer
i don't think i will be
no
well i shall be away for a while this summer so hard lines
i'll actually be here cos i if we get some builders in we're
er i don't see
not going anywhere in a hurry
till july and august
i don't see any point in adding UNK to life
just let it run
right okay
that's what i like to hear
easy who's going to be here next week isn't it
yeah
tomorrow
well yes that's what we usually do yes but
mm
why
what's wrong with next week
you just stand there and say who's going to be here next week
no each week
no
oh i see from week to week yes
i had a meeting last week
er next er next item
then carols for everyone eighteenth of december nineteen ninety three we have a draft of carols for organ paid by our special sub committee thank you very much gentlemen
for discussion
i see we have some erm non english carols down here
splendid
aye
masters in this hall my jug cup of joy UNK
that's it that's why i put it there
i accept everything
there was some reason for having it there
it's cos we knew that otherwise you'd be complaining
because i thought there were complaints about foreign carols
wonderful
is this erm is this a suggested complete list or are we going to take
we need
so many out of this list
no we need
i can't remember how many
we need last year fo we found ab was about the right length
fourteen yeah
and that was fourteen if we go over that it really is too many
yeah
we can certainly substitute for these no problem
the things you've got to watch for are that you keep a decent balance of familiar and UNK ones people complain whichever way you
go either way on that er you've got to be careful with your number of foreign ones we've got two down there which may be one too many i don't know
er
just right
is UNK bells a carol
well that one doesn't count
no a carol no it i i'm not going to call it in the programme that i'm going to call it a song for everyone
i don't think i would dare er call it a carol
there's going to be a competition for the best alternative verse i think
can i can i do you think i could just ask to run through all these cos er you put a couple of strange UNK
yes
so i'm not quite sure how all the ones go
i think everyone knows god
er would you like to sing these john
everyone knows god rest ye
is that a brick UNK brick b brick built handle
brick built handle aye
while UNK watched the tune for that is going to be
the tune for that is john it's
UNK
erm
UNK it says
yes that's UNK arrangement UNK
page one three five
so how would that go
arranged the american UNK
who bought him this book
people expect the normal
no they don't expect the normal
what book is it
what book is it
they want the normal but to get
this was my christmas present about
sing it out
while UNK watched their UNK by night all seated on the ground you want the rest of it
yeah
the angel of the lord came down and glory UNK around and glory UNK around
they a they er they're not going to know that are they
yes
no
well of course
the choir will sing it won't they
the americans this
we shall
so how
is the p proper american version
so are we going to teach them it on or
have to
away in a UNK is that going to be a standard tune
oh yes
UNK bells masters in this hall how
UNK
la
yes
so o little town the tune
ah yes now john that is page three six three
is it as nice as the proper one
it's again it's the
proper one
this is the original tune no this is the original tune
la
because the man who erm
it might be an idea what he actually said about this
philip UNK was director of holy UNK church in UNK erm on and he was in the holy land on christmas eve in eighteen sixty five and he stood in a field outside bethlehem where the UNK were supposed to have received the UNK and thought of the beginning of o little town of bethlehem
and it eventually UNK out and he wrote it for his sunday school and his church UNK lewis UNK was asked to provide the music and this is the music which UNK provided
aha
for the original
and once again it's american
o little town of bethlehem how still we see thee lie
oh yeah
oh yeah
every american knows it
right
flows nicely
do know about that
yes oh that's nice yes
there aren't too many americans in
so what
has everyone heard
no
no
la
la
is it sung in latin
yes
splendid
la
well that's a foreign one then
la
UNK
la
it's UNK isn't it
yes
yes
it's the UNK arrangement although they've got UNK version of it in there which isn't UNK
oh no the UNK
which they
i think the UNK
UNK goes above
we've got to have UNK yes
the virgin mary had a baby boy
last time and the problem was starting it
la
starting it
we've done that before haven't we
yes
we we've got it complete with UNK and all the rest of it
the twelve days of christmas is that the did we
do that the year before last
we did it last year didn't we
yes we did it last year
no we didn't
we haven't done it for a while
we haven't done it for two years
no bu i'm sorry the other thing i'm sorry i should have said the other thing i'm going on is when things were last done
oh yes
i've seen i've seen famous sheet before
yes we've got a little list we've got a little list
i've seen
ah
this famous sheet before yes
the twelve days of christmas was last done in nineteen ninety
yes
before that it had been done in eighty one eighty two eighty four eighty six eighty eight and ninety so UNK now it's missed out several years
mm
oh dear
it was getting
a bit regular and now it's dropped
it was yes
so we really must have that back and i think we must have it in the er traditional tune
three years ago
yes
well we've got the traditional thing without the UNK to g flat major
oh
can't we do can't we do the old one
oh i like the one
every everything always went very quiet at that point
yeah
not a lot of people played it
tricky for the
you'd wrong and they'd all shut up
should give the audience
the UNK the UNK used to carry it for a long way
yeah
UNK ne is that going to be in french or
UNK
UNK
UNK ne le divine UNK
la
la
we tried to sing that last christmas but
er bleak UNK we can either have the traditional tune
yes
or harold UNK but the traditional tune is
we ought to have some traditional ones
i have a feeling we're a little bit low on familiar things you see
yes
i'm worried about this
but both UNK are very familiar
well come on you've got good king UNK god rest you UNK gentlemen eh
in the bleak UNK
away in a UNK
i like that
the only trouble about that unless you
what is the other one
start it at about er UNK you end up
la
la
that's a problem we ought to sort out
no
la
couldn't we rather pick the one tune and the other
that's more of a choir setting though isn't it really
oh i dunno
yeah well per perhaps we'll get good king UNK looked out
did you want to s you started your way through there
no i'm just listening to the two yes
now we were going to do the UNK and the UNK but that's why the carol UNK in
UNK meetings these
what's that one
la
it's the one
la
no
erm
erm
it's also choir practice
give us an a please
la
are the words in english to that
yes
i saw three ships
la
i there is a version by john UNK in five eight time if you want me to find that
yes i'd like to see that
i think i've seen that one
la
one two three four five one two
la
i like it
lovely it is it's great
isn't that one of the carols required
erm i don't know it probably is yes
there's a horrible UNK one in there which was i've never
you can't say horrible
we usually do the UNK one which begins with a horn UNK which
no we
should always worry you i don't mean now but in the past
it's always been because er it's
it's a horn then UNK and it it's a most worrying opening for er a because it is
it is literally a UNK er UNK
it is it's straight out the blue yeah
pop
yes and everybody else sort of goes who
yeah er i must admit it it's alright but
it's slightly UNK
it's the one that gives you your worst fears isn't it when you conduct it and you go and nothing happens
then it's start again
well yes
but i do wonder whether or not there aren't there aren't enough familiar ones
some of those some of those are a little bit UNK especially in the
UNK
and i wonder if there is an absence of the two UNK i mean it's always nice to have one which people can really UNK onto like er
you're talking about
UNK the herald
UNK the herald i is one which really i
i p i'm inclined to suggest that it's a pity we haven't got that in somewhere at the beginning or the end to sort of give a bit of beef to it
you can get in an awful track
cu cut out i saw three ships and put UNK the herald angels in
but if i saw three ships was in there because it was one of the few in six eight time
yes that was the reason for it
i think it would be a shame to drop something
i mean everyone knows it it's very familiar
well drop something else
UNK bells
i must admit if i had if i actually had to say which of all those would i be most happy not playing i'd say in the bleak UNK but
ah
it is
i find in the bleak UNK a UNK if you're not very careful
i think it's i it is
and a lot of people
i would want to agree that would be my first out
i agree
yes
yes
because there are some UNK ones o little town is going to be a quiet one away in a UNK
yes but it's not the proper tune is it
UNK ne
it's of course it's the original tune
it's the proper tune
it's going to be very quiet if people don't sing it
UNK ne UNK ne is
fairly UNK in places especially if it's in french it'll do qu it'll be sort of quite quiet
er
we we've dropped in the bleak UNK and we've added UNK the herald yes
i i'm trying
mm
to make sure i've got this right because
yeah
it gets complicated if we're really not careful
if UNK the herald goes at the beginning it'll need a UNK won't it
well i was yes unless you i don't know whether i saw
must be
three ships ends well i'm not quite sure on that but the order isn't i mean the UNK just a sort
oh no the it's
of rough and ready one the UNK got to be UNK out
i would have thought you needed a nice UNK at the end
it's always difficult you know the end is
UNK the herald is a good way to end actually
UNK the herald is an excellent ending
yes
yes i can't help feeling that would go nicely
but either would
well we can have a UNK at the end can't we why not
yeah
this year we decided to end with a UNK
i mean god rest ye UNK is a very good starter
yes
why not
it's a real warmer
it's a real UNK that one and UNK the UNK at the UNK fine
where we could ideally then i think i'd move i saw three ships if this is anything like the order
the middle
to somewhere in the middle because around er play it between o little town of bethlehem and because that's a bit we need something a bit more
yeah
familiar around there
yeah
well what we did last year we altered the order really quite late to UNK
mm
to fit in with some of the other things that we
oh that's the trouble until you know who what the UNK
yeah
are you er you're wasting your time really but it's useful to have some idea
we've got opening and a closing
er any other comments on the actual draft list of carols
nobody UNK to the bit in the middle
for the mo i mean some of this may depend upon the availability of music
well will UNK the herald be an o u p one
yes
yeah
oh they're always available yeah
right
cu the other thing we need to discuss are po things that actually erm er i suppose hire or arrangement of music well the UNK will be o u p or what we've already got
yeah
or re arranging bits and UNK
quite a number of these we already have
yeah were you planning to
yes
yeah were you planning to just
yes
the o little town were you planning to arrange them from the
yes
what you've got there
yeah
that's fine
i don't mind UNK unless anybody else wants to
they'll be s they'll be quite simple versions
you're going to have more time than us by christmas
oh i see yes it's like that is it
yes
so there were two things that er well or perhaps more than two from matters arising from the minutes er the UNK for the tickets i think was one thing that was
are we on
we're not going back to are we
i'm sorry i'm getting
going back to number two
no that's alright
we're still on we're still on carols for everyone
yes i know er i can i just get my bits of paper on there
yeah
yes i have at last and the i'm sure that they UNK in their teeth they assured me they had written to me after my second letter in march er in fact and they said they were going to send me a photocopy of that in fact er she wrote me a letter in june so i don't believe the other one existed
yes you keep everything don't you john
mm
er with reference to i write to confirm we are very pleased to be able to contribute towards your forthcoming carol concert
susan at our southwell office will help with the sale of the tickets
we will also offer a photocopying service er at a fifty per cent reduction
that's not really enough for us but still
er our local reporter caroline er will be contacting me with regard to any suggestions i may have on the UNK side
please do not hesitate to contact me if i can be of further assistance one lynn head receptionist
that's all i know about
i wrote her a long
sounds very
letter all about it so she's got no excuse for not knowing
mm
what the hell it's all about
quite good
so they are doing it now
can i ask i this is i don't know why i keep asking to work erm can i write to mrs to i think we ought to as it
please do
were formally
tell her to get lost
UNK our er i think
thank you thank you for your association with our
and saying that we
due to last year's
no we but we
very UNK
i was joking
leave it to him
very simple reason she can't get she can't argue this is a charity concert she charges the UNK don't and therefore from the point of view of the charity er it makes obvious good sense that we should go to somewhere which is free
she can't argue with that
all she might do is offer to do it at a lower rate in which case
er we don't take any offers
no
we we've taken the contract up with the UNK haven't we
we've already said
we've already we've already
yes
the real UNK will w will be when we try to get her to display one of our posters saying tickets available
in the
oh no
UNK office
no i think
that's alright i'll go and stick it out one night outside the window
yes
with UNK
i think we'll erm be grateful for that
UNK
i think so yes
i mean i think it would be nice to erm
now that's another thought about posters and things
if we want to coat these things at any time in erm UNK
yes
i know
so it can go outside
a
oh
machine where there is a machine that you a
so do i
heat UNK one that you can just run things through and they come out neatly sealed in UNK and UNK like
then we can UNK it onto her window and it won't get wet in rain
nasty little vicious UNK in you
yes i know
course things have happened various things have happened
aha
mainly er that among groups now i've had a definite offer from the er sunday school again wanting
mm
to do something
suggestions
there was a suggestion for that wasn't there
any suggestions er will be duly received but er we'll come back on that one if we may in a minute
i saw three ships or something in the region or something
er n no c can i just finish off explaining why it is i'm not writing
no i'm going to interrupt you as i usually do
i thought you were yes
erm UNK however have now erm raised their lovely legs or er whatever you
well i can't say raised their ugly head can i UNK yes
erm two UNK have come er h have appeared both of whom er w say they would er one is an UNK dance group called just for kicks who i saw at the open
day who're very good
er and would make a tremendous UNK on the minster floor and they would be er lovely
er
sweep their legs up like you know an extraordinary sight er
i'm sure it is john
no a little like er UNK sort of UNK
yeah
right
you know they just sort of wave around i don't know how you do it it's incredible
erm and the other one is a is a UNK morris group from nottingham er sort of UNK really i suppose again who would again be er prepared to come along er
have two
i spoke to them well i think that would be a bit naughty
yes so do i
i think if we get one of them we'll be doing very well and to get two would be perhaps a bit naughty
we don't want two UNK but one set of UNK
but erm i would like to suggest that the er the morris ones are er possibly our better bet partly because i know one of them er and er
and she would i think be prepared to as she's in charge of their sort of arrangements for where they dance er it's easier than ne negotiating with someone who i've only met once er very briefly
so if i may i would like to negotiate to one or the other if you will agree er to that to try and get us a dance group we've been trying to get a dance group for years
mm
and we may now at long
but because they're essentially a sort of er a noisy and UNK thing erm that's why i haven't done anything with regard to
erm
the boys' brigade as yet although i don't see any real reason why we can't have both but i wanted to get your views before i
are the UNK going to look down their UNK at this
well it's traditional english
erm that's a
isn't it
that's a good question
perhaps i ought to ask the er ask the provost
i really i
i wouldn't have thought he would object i mean we have used morris
yes before
not like you're using can they're doing the can
but under different erm different er UNK
i think it'd be i think it'd be worth asking them
true
i'd rather ask early rather than late
yeah
yeah
i'll ask
be worth be worth UNK about
alternative UNK okay but the old UNK a bit sort of pushing it
no i mean you're quite right erm well i think they're not going to sing the last one got away with absolute murder singing
i know it was fantastic
erm but i think er it was the words they were singing
oh i see
yes
but i think this lot will just dance er and on the whole erm mu music
behave
is regarded as being essentially something which is neutral which always seems to me a very wrong thing to say i i'm sure it's quite incorrect
so er we've got also we pr we must assume the UNK society
yes
must be
well as they include it in their UNK for the year
we can't ask them to come and keep us warm from behind er keep the UNK off us from behind and
and not do anything
not do anything
oh they have a purpose right
fact it might be UNK this year to suggest to them that they might like to introduce one or other of the things that we were looking at in there
yes
i don't know
cos we've always
well we we're talking about the UNK society and saying well sometimes they're a bit inappropriate in what they choose to do like movements from christmas UNK with only organ UNK whereas in there's some
gets a bit UNK doesn't it
yeah
there's some super things in this new carol book
which they
are absolutely
you
they make you feel they're trying to raise the tone of the whole proceedings
that's right yeah
i'll certainly suggest it
cos peter might be interested in
well i'll UNK
i'll UNK suggest it
but er
i have to say i won't take no UNK as to what we actually get
no i agree
it would be interesting in the orchestra because the orchestra haven't UNK a choir before apart from the UNK singing
yeah
as far as the come t to the orchestra now erm
the UNK item
the UNK item and erm i don't know which of us thought of it but anyway the erm er
er i know who thought of it
alright
you don't think
la
margaret
yes
that sort of
right
the christmas UNK we've had the menu come from mr
but this is the menu
oh
here it is
and erm we've talked about it in committee and decided on the menu that is six forty
which is the usual sort of christmas menu and then there is a choice of er starters and also UNK cheese and biscuits and UNK coffee tea or dinner and dinner UNK
six forty plus v a t
yes i'm coming to that
oh sorry
er yes er the six forty is plus v a t
now they've got v a t as erm seventeen
seventeen and a half
yes
and with the wine that brings it up to about eight pounds

so that the overall cost each member will be six pounds
oh right
yeah six

if you could get the right money it would be appreciated
yes

having just given a lot of money back
yes
that is handy if you could bring just the six pounds
you know and erm then that will be fine
and that's on erm

vera would you like to say som oh
i have to thank vera for the holiday to scarborough not that i went
it's not next saturday
no
no
never mind
i mean it's it was next saturday
oh yes
well it was it was from then
erm we wo i would wish to thank vera cos it's a lot of work for erm a lot of worry and i do hope that you all enjoyed it
now vera you want to say a word don't you
thank you
first of all i expect most of you have heard that the proposed holiday to UNK has had to be cancelled cos we didn't have enough support
oh
and er if you'll bear with me i'm having competition about this with these holidays here i haven't got anything as cheap as that probably
oh have you
yes vera
but those holidays they're in february
but
and they're only two nights
yes
but we don't
ah
but some
want two nights in the middle of winter
somebody is a bit later on in the season but they're overnight travel by coach i would have thought
no good
vera
right
oh
so that's sorted
i wouldn't have thought they'd be brought forward either
no
i shouldn't think so
it is ho well you know i suppose
anyway i have erm started to arrange a holiday if you can bear it for next september to UNK
the price er wi we depart on the eleventh of september for eight days the usual additions you know the coach from here and everything
and the price is two hundred and thirty three pounds with four pounds UNK fee
er i've got a couple of brochures here if you like to have a look at but don't please take them away
and i've got some UNK which you can take away if you want
if you'd like to come and get one in tea time
er i should like to the names next month and i hope you'll all support us because the numbers are going down and if we don't get sufficient numbers it'll have to cancelled like the UNK one
and that's rather a pity because we've been doing these holidays for a long time now and i think those people have enjoyed themselves
say yes
yes
erm i think that's all i can say to you today
names next month
and come and get an UNK if you want one
okay
ah
thank you
thank you
right
thank you
essex news erm well we couldn't really find anything very exciting in it

and erm there's a five day tour to UNK and the cars of UNK on the first of march
half board a hundred and nine pounds
getting a little competition aren't i
but there's no UNK though vera have you noticed
no
i'm only trying to sell the time then

but you have to do a dance when you want to fill ta time in
oh well
that'll be the finish
erm we've got for friendship UNK name is mentioned

oh

oh is it
oh really
if all these people about were to be quiet
i shall
i was told the ring the bell so i did
yeah
good afternoon ladies
it's very nice to see you all here this afternoon
my name is UNK and i run a beauty UNK which is at the end of the high street by r d
UNK the
mm
UNK
okay
i've been there two years now
and carol has she joined me in june
so this is carol
so if any of you would like to come and see us at the UNK we will both be there and very happy to see and answer any of your questions
i would like at this point to say thank you for sh to sheila sh sheila she UNK in to ask me would i do this er talk for you this afternoon
so thank you to sheila for asking me and letting us come to your meeting this afternoon
it's been a pleasure
now the topic that sheila asked me to talk about was skin care
now er there is no what can i say
there is no skin care is a very basic thing
you don't have to worry there is no i can't think of the word that i want to use
never too late to start
well it's never too late to start with good skin care
i hope so
so what is skin care
what we must do to have good skin is to cleanse tone and UNK
how many of us do cleanse tone and UNK
how many of us here use soap and water
yes
okay
if you use soap and water that's fine
but really soap is very drying on our skin and if you didn't use soap and you use a cleanser you would certainly find a difference immediately
you don't realize how drying soap is
so we do try to avoid using soap
so what we use as a cleanser is either a cleansing milk or a cleansing cream
now today i've got two types of products with me one is UNK m products that we're going to use as a demonstration and the other UNK products that we're going to use as a UNK demonstration
so i'd like two volunteers later on to come and have their faces UNK and UNK
and then you can go and tell all your friends how it feels okay
now the UNK m products in that range we have a cleanser which is UNK cleansing milk
now all these products are water soluble which means they can be UNK off with water
gone are the days when you've got these thick UNK that you couldn't get off unless you used an alcohol UNK to remove them
so a cleansing milk a little a amount in the palm of your hand put over the face then UNK off with warm water and then you can dry your face with a UNK and you would feel then perhaps that you'd really washed your face
then you must UNK you must use the UNK after that
and the UNK really does get rid of any of the cleanser that you've left on and closes the UNK
now the fact that you've UNK off with water anyway you shouldn't really have any of the cleansing medium on the skin
so really we use the UNK to close the UNK so that you don't get any UNK or any dirt in the UNK so that the skin is nice and clean
so you cleanse you tone and the most important thing after that okay
is to UNK
now in the UNK m products we do the UNK moisturizer or the UNK moisturizer
now ladies i don't mind if you don't cleanse properly or perhaps you don't even tone but the moisturizer is the most important from my point of view
i feel that the moisturizer will keep your skin nice and soft
you won't get any UNK you won't get any UNK on the skin if you use a moisturizer
you don't have to use make up but certainly to cleanse and UNK is very important
now with the UNK products i actually haven't bought those with me apart from those that we're going to use as a UNK erm the have a very nice cleanser called special cleansing gel and if you're used to using soap and water it really is very similar to using soap
you put a little of the gel in the palm of the hand use water to UNK it put the UNK over your face and then again UNK off with warm water and you feel as if you've used soap and water
we th do then have a UNK but you don't necessarily have to use the UNK because you've used to water to cleanse off the cleanser
and then again a very important product is the moisturizer
the moisturizer keeps your skin nice and soft and UNK it doesn't get dry
now don't forget we're coming up to winter we have the cold winds we have the rain if you're not wearing a moisturizer the skin will suffer
okay
it wi really will get dry and possibly very red
you know you get these little red veins on the su on the cheek area if you don't wear a moisturizer those little red veins can get worse so we use a moisturizer to try and protect the skin
so there's no secret about good skin care
it really is only cleanse tone and UNK
it does depend on the products you use
if you've got plenty of products at home fine use them okay
if you haven't if you're using soap and water just think about perhaps whether you should use a cleanser a UNK and a moisturizer
alright
now is there anybody here who would like to volunteer to come and have their face UNK and UNK
come on
yes
of course we go back an awful long way don't we
yes
yeah
are you going to tell them how much
er about
forty years
forty years
forty years i've known UNK
miss used to be a UNK the what were you
UNK chief
she was a UNK chief when i was a UNK
my lovely little girls
can you margaret
ca can you see
do you want to just round her neck
ooh
put a band on just so that we don't you know erm squash their hair
that's it
now somebody else we need another volunteer to try the other products er
well i'm thinking
erm
about it
go on
just so that we don't get any products on the clothes
right
that's it
so carol is now using the UNK cleansing milk and she if just show the ladies what you're doing carol she's just actually UNK it out into the palm of her hand there's no water necessary okay
rub it into the palm of your hand and then spread it on to your own face
it will be nice if you could get somebody to do this for you every day wouldn't it
oh yes
so when you actually are putting it on your own face make sure that you rub your fingers all around especially around the nose
okay
you get a build up of black heads around the nose and around the UNK
okay
so really make sure you spread it over the whole of the face rubbing it in with your fingers
now UNK doing this beautifully and it really does feel nice
okay
she's UNK in the cleanser
and does it feel nice
that's lovely
so once you've got that one even if you're wearing make up you can use this cleanser okay
it will take the make up which you might need to use the make up er the re er the cleanser possibly twice or three times if you're wearing make up
okay
we normally say cleanse twice anyway
so you should cleanse with your cleanser twice
if there is make up on from the first erm removal then you could then take off the make up with the first application and then go over twice more so it would be three times if you've got quite a lot of base or foundation on
okay
so now UNK going to use damp pads damp cotton wool to take off the cleanser
now you at home would actually use warm water to UNK over your face
now if you notice UNK movements they are always in a an upward direction and the reason for this is so that you don't drag the skin so when you're whatever you're doing with your face whe when you're cleansing UNK and UNK always try and keep the movements going up because you don't want to stretch the face you don't want to make any loose skin any UNK than it is
mm
or bring any more erm little UNK or little lines that we have
now we're going to tone
and the UNK actually closes the UNK because we may have opened those UNK slightly by using the cleanser and also if there is any cleanser left on the skin the UNK will remove that as well
and the UNK we're using is rosemary skin tonic and that's erm from the UNK rosemary
it feels nice and it's it is very good for the skin
it usually is cold
mm
so once you've UNK and once you've UNK you then make sure that the face is either UNK dry or you can actually pad to your face after the UNK with a UNK
as long as it's dry before you apply the moisturizer
have you gone to sleep down there
UNK now going to tissue dry the UNK
and now the skin is perfectly clean and it can be ah it can have the moisturizer on it
UNK using the UNK moisturizer which is very UNK it contains UNK oil which is very good for the skin and it's a natural product
if you feel ladies that when you put your moisturizer on and the skin is still feeling quite dry put another application of your moisturizer on
alright
and do make sure you put plenty of moisturizer on the UNK and on the nose because they're areas that actually do hit the elements more than the other parts of the face
not to forget the neck the neck is part of the face and this is where we show the lines don't we
around the neck
so if you massage in the neck with your moisturizer with upward movements it will help those lines
okay
it won't take them away once they're there they don't disappear but it does help to ease them they don't look quite so deep
alright
if you actually massage the cream into the neck
mhm
right
how does that feel
that's fine
yes
am i finished with now
nearly
and yo do you want to UNK your hair
mm
right
would you like sit down
yes
oh
that's it
alright
thank you very much
do you have
can we thank margaret
thank margaret for being a volunteer
okay
please may we have another volunteer
and this is UNK
so she's going to have the UNK products used on her this afternoon
do you usually use soap and water on your face
yes
UNK uses soap and water to wash her face so we're going to use the cleansing gel which UNK up like soap
alright
and we'll see we'll ask her what she fe what it feels like on her skin to see if it feels better than soap
so UNK using the gel and she's making it into a UNK
alright
it's just a little gel that you put in the palm of your hand use some warm water and UNK it up and put the UNK over your face
and again make sure that you use your finger to go round the nose and over the fore head around the eyes
and another thing about directions of your hands upward movements all the time and make sure with the eye area go in towards the nose because if you keep bringing
mm
your movements coming UNK you stretch the skin and you make even more lines come around that area
oh that's nice
so take your fingers from the outside and move them in towards the nose and round so that you don't stretch the skin even more
look at your hands
perhaps we just need a little more water to make a bit more UNK
now of course if you went to a UNK
for a facial cleanse you would actually laid on a UNK like this and er have a head band and have a UNK round you and you have nice soft music playing alright
mm
so
and
sing everybody
and then the UNK will actually cleanse tone and UNK
and you would actually in a facial you would have a facial massage with UNK oils and that's very relaxing that's very nice
sounds like
so we've got the cleansing gel on and now we're going to remove it
UNK uses using UNK to take off the gel
yes
we haven't got any more
the UNK feel nice and soft they don't drag the skin
and it is important ladies to remove all the cleanser not to leave any on the skin
so do make sure that whatever cleanser you're using make sure it all comes off
because if it doesn't your moisturizer which is very important isn't working properly
because there's not the ingredients in the cleanser that there is the moisturizer and if you have any cleanser on the skin it's blocking the work of the moisturizer
so we've UNK off the cleanser now going to tissue dry now UNK is in a spray bottle so we're going to gently use the spray over UNK face
close her eyes it's a very gentle spray
mm
it's like UNK
and then we're going to use a very nice cream erm called UNK balance and that's a UNK product and that's for keeping the skin nice and soft and keeping the UNK at bay
and again when you're putting on the moisturizer don't forget the neck
and always use upward movements
can you do the neck
and how's it feeling UNK
that's really lovely
you could do this all day long
it is very relaxing really
i tell you something it's much better than the operating table
in fact some people when they do come into the UNK they say ooh it's like an operating theatre
it's not really
it's quite pretty in there
it's just i think when there's a UNK and there's white UNK over the UNK it probably can look a little bit clinical
but certainly we don't operate
we don't UNK
we don't do anything in that line
thank goodness for that
i can but it is but it is nice
what was tha er tha that one
no this is the UNK
yes
oh
this has a lemon grass in
yeah
which you can actually smell
would you like sit up UNK
yeah
right
back down again
the only thing ladies when you have a facial your hair get slightly UNK
with that on
so don't go to the UNK before you us alright
go to the UNK after
yeah
we've seen you
good
there we are
there you go
can we have a UNK for UNK for
yes
for being our volunteer
they were just very quick demonstrations but it does take longer if you come to a UNK
but with yourselves do make sure you cleanse properly i'm not too worried about your UNK but you must use a moisturizer just to make sure that your skin is nice and soft and UNK
okay
and if you want to wear make up then of course make up goes over the top of your moisturizer
okay
erm i have brought some price lists here and i think we've got some time sheila what time am i finishing
erm well you it really doesn't matter
it's up to her
about erm twenty past three
i dunno what the time is now
well i said you know
it's three o'clock
it's er about quarter past three
about quarter past
yeah
three
so that's a little time
so i've got a little time to speak
yes
yes
erm if you would like a price list by all means at the end you can come up and take one
erm i'll have some brochures going around some leaflets going round just UNK what we do but if i'd like to just mention to you that erm there are other UNK that we do of course at the UNK
we do a selection of UNK all are very nice erm we also do eyebrow UNK eyebrow UNK some people would call that erm and removal of facial hair
sometimes people have problems with doing UNK if they wear glasses
mm
you can't see your own UNK can
no
you
and you take your glasses off to do your UNK and
you can't see them
you can't see
you put your glasses on to try and see and you can't UNK the UNK because the glasses are in the way so we do quite a lot of eyebrow UNK erm at UNK
and what we do with the UNK we don't just use a pair of UNK we actually use wax so if you've got quite a lot of hair underneath your UNK we never take from above the UNK just below if you've got quite a lot of hair it can be painful if you're just using UNK so what we do now we use a little bit of hot wax which is pink so we put some wax under the UNK either side let the wax erm cool and set and then pull the wax off
ooh
yes
and everybody says so ooh
it's really not too painful it sounds painful but if you think of the eye area being very small it really doesn't take long
the wax is on for about two minutes and it takes two seconds to pull it off
and when we pull the wax off all the UNK are in the wax so the majority of the hair is out in one pull
then we use our UNK to actually shape the eyebrow
and then after that we have some UNK gel put on the eyebrow so that the skin is slightly pink so that when you actually have a erm an eyebrow trim the UNK gel takes away the UNK
and that would last six to eight weeks ladies
oh lovely
it's very nice treatment
erm a lot of us are bothered by UNK some of us have got really long UNK hair that grow in the UNK and we take those out as well
so don't ever be frightened of having an eyebrow trim because it really is a very simple treatment
and the other part of facial UNK is on the UNK we tend to get quite a few growing on our UNK and upper lip
there are two things we can do with hair on the upper lip we can either UNK it so that it doesn't notice or we can actually remove it with wax or we can have UNK
now UNK is the permanent removal of hair by the UNK of a very small needle attached to a machine and you press the button on the needle holder which releases current and that UNK the hair it actually UNK the root of the hair but each hair has to be individually treated so if you've got quite a lot of UNK hair it can take a lot of time and a lot of money
okay
normally the time is fifteen minutes and for fifteen minutes it's five fifty so if you've got a lot of hair it's quite UNK it's going to go on for several months
so if you didn't really want to embark on that treatment we again use the UNK treatment as for the UNK we use ca ho hot wax on the area that you need on the UNK on the upper lip
a small piece of warm of hot wax applied to the area it's set pulled off and the all the UNK come away in the wax
and it feels really very smooth afterwards
it doesn't take long it's just really seconds
it doesn't hurt because it's pulled off so quickly and when we pull it off we put our finger straight over the area and it takes the UNK away
so really it's not ma you know don't be frightened about having UNK
so we do the UNK for the UNK and for the upper lip
so you see you've got other methods you've got UNK you've got UNK you've got UNK
but i would think possibly UNK would be the thing that the treatment that perhaps you might consider
if you are worried about facial hair they're out in just seconds
okay
so along with your UNK and along with your facial hair and along with your erm skin treatment your facial you'll feel a new person won't you
yes
really will feel nice
and what else do you
we do UNK and we do UNK
UNK are i are ideal for UNK your nails pushing down the UNK and making your nails look into a nice shape and nice and clean
you don't necessarily have to have bright coloured polish on at the end
we can UNK them until they UNK or you can have just a natural erm base coat on just to give it a UNK
and then we do UNK
now UNK is really a UNK of the toes but what we do with a UNK we actually rub away the hard skin that you may have on the bottom of your feet on the side of your big toe that's usually where it builds up or on the ball of the foot
we are not UNK we don't actually cut away the hard skin because that i is a UNK job but we certainly do have a good try at trying to get rid of as much hard skin as we can
we UNK the feet in nice erm UNK water and when we think the feet have UNK enough for the skin to become soft we take the feet out and then we rub with a foot file to get rid of the hard skin
you have a nice foot and leg massage which really does make you feel nice
you feel at the end of the treatment you feel as if you're walking on air
it's really a very nice treatment
a after the foot and leg massage erm we actually cut the toe nails and we file the toe nails and again sometimes toe nails aren't terribly easy to cut yourselves we can't always get down there can we
and also the toe nails get very thick and quite hard to cut as we get older so we actually do that for you we've got toe nail UNK that make it a lot easier
and once we've UNK the nails we actually file the nail so that it's nice and smooth and it doesn't catch on your UNK or it doesn't catch on the sheets at night
so that is another nice treatment that makes you feel better
okay
so that's a UNK which helps you to have your toe nails nice and short and to get rid of the hard skin
so what else do we do
we do body massage or back and shoulder massage
now if any of you get terribly tense at the back of shoulders which we all seem to do nowadays if you come for just a back and shoulder massage we actually work on the back of the neck and along the shoulders using massage movements which helps to relax you which helps to actually break down the UNK acid that builds up in the muscles that causes you pain
you don't realize ladies how much you sort of keep your shoulders up with tension
i mean i do the same thing i get home at night and i'm like this
and i think tt
oh
i need a massage
but carol and i never seem to get time to be able to do these things on each other but we have had the treatment so we do know that massage really does help you to relax
so that's another treatment perhaps that you might like to consider
it doesn't mean that you've got to take all your clothes off not at all
you lie on your front and we actually take ask you to take either your dress or your UNK off and we put UNK over you
if you're wearing a UNK we just undo your UNK okay
and then we work on the back
there's nobody else there is nobody else looking at you
a curtain is used to screen you off and if it's a very cold day we've got infra red heat we've got a lamp above the he the UNK and we actually put on the infra red heat so we warm you up first before you start before we start so your body is feeling nice and warm and you're feeling relaxed we have nice music playing and it does help right with the tension that builds up on the shoulders
oh
so that's something else to think about
i'm telling you all this and perhaps you don't have to erm pay for any of these UNK we do gift UNK so if you've got anybody who wants to buy you a gift of any sort you could always say well i fancy erm an eyebrow trim or i fancy a UNK perhaps they would like to buy you a gift voucher and then you can come in and it could be a present for you
so you wouldn't necessarily have to pay out for these UNK you see
so erm you know if you if you er don't know what to say to your family to buy for christmas why not come and have a eyebrow trim and they can buy you a gift voucher for that
so you know we're always there carol and i will actually help you if you'd like to pop into the UNK and ask about the gift UNK
a gift voucher can be of any value
alright
you don't have to actually look at the price list and say oh well i'll have a back and shoulder massage which is ten pound you don't have to have anything for ten pound you can have it as little as five pounds two pound fifty we don't mind it can go towards a treatment
or if that person buys you a gift voucher and you don't necessarily want to have a treatment that states on the gift voucher you can come and exchange it for products
we're not worried we're not actually keeping you to anything that's down on the gift voucher
but perhaps it would be nice if somebody gave you a gift voucher for christmas and it said an eyebrow trim and you were dying to have an eyebrow trim but you didn't know where to come and perhaps you were a little bit frightened about having one so it might you know get you to come into the UNK
and now that you know that carol and i are there erm you know somebody to speak to cos sometimes you go into a shop and you're not really sure who's there and when you see a face that you recognize it helps you doesn't it
are there are any questions you would like to ask
what kind of erm UNK do you pu put on your face
a what
UNK on your face
yes
aha
you know the therapy oils
aha
erm when we do a skin treatment we actually do a skin analysis and we use the appropriate erm UNK oils for the particular skin we're working on
we have a selection of er three small bottles and they have a mixture of essential oils in them
mm
and it does depend on what skin type we're treating
sometimes we're se we're treating a very sensitive skin sometimes we're UNK we're treating a very dry skin or it could be dry and sensitive
so it does depend on what skin type and we actually choose the erm UNK oils according the skin type
yeah
and i must say ladies they do smell very nice
and when we are actually doing the massage i the massage itself is relaxing but to have the sweet UNK erm essential oils being used as well it really is very nice
any more questions
do you know where we are at the top of the high street
not really no
i know where you are
but i wondered if everybody else knew
okay
do you er actually know erm where the george is
or it used to be the george
mm
the big white building at the other side of the er pedestrian crossing
yes
about five yards
if you just continue five yards that's right
and then UNK flowers is in the corner and then the UNK is just at er it joins on to UNK flowers
it has a black UNK over the front and it says health and beauty UNK with a telephone number and at the side of the door it says UNK m
and please if you come up to the door and the times of opening says closed on there we're not closed it's just sometimes we've forgotten to change the closed to open
but do come in
you know sometimes we walk in first thing in the morning and we start UNK and we forget to turn the er closed to open
so you know mind you we've left it now and it says open and we're not we're here with you
are you open every day
we are open UNK through to saturdays
we close all day monday UNK we're there from nine thirty to five thirty

right
thanks very much doctor thank you
bye mrs cheerio now
time when i first came to
and how old were you then
i should say about six or seven
what year would that be
tt let's see i'm sixty one now so sixty one that's er twenty one isn't it
twenty one
yeah
twenty one ye nineteen twenty one when i first came to
but it had been just a wee little village then
we had we had the two schools the school and the what we call the boys school that was the other one on the green and it the girl's school near this school you started there as an infant between five and seven
and then the girls stayed on till they were fourteen
but when the boys became seven they went on to this school on the green
now the village green in those days was all UNK completely all UNK
n not as it is today beautiful green grass and we used to play er cricket football marbles er pitch card ring UNK er UNK stone and all that of course the village in those days was divided into two parts and if you lived over 's hill you was a UNK
and if you lived this end of the village you was an UNK see
and we used to arrange football teams cricket teams during the before you went into school UNK and very often when you came out of school
but if you went over the hill after school time then you were in for a fairly rough time the other end you were challenged and all sorts of things
and of course there were no houses down where the village ha past the village hall in those days
i think row was about the last row in and of course you'd got all the fields gardens and what have you
and there was nothing till you got to the UNK absolutely nothing
and there was just well road other than er the estate was pretty well the same as it is today very little improved
and the w the road might have been UNK but the houses are the same and er the er of course with a lot of the old factories have been pulled down mills was pulled down that was a v very UNK f factory at one time when i was a boy but er i'm afraid that went according to you know the lack of trade
it was er the village centre is about the same as it was when i was a boy more UNK of course all the private houses that were on the front you know street
that's all been altered i they've all been made into shops and spoilt the you know the and there used to be old 's the shoe shop and mr 's watch shop and mrs 's UNK shop
mr the bar local UNK who's son lives next door for years he used to start at nine o'clock in the morning and finish at nine o'clock at night
still cutting hair at nine o'clock at night and UNK people penny and tuppence a time
old mr the old er our only as i could remember UNK died when he was a hundred and two
he was going to have his hair cut w in every and a UNK mr er 's UNK shop right up until practically the morning he died
and he did his own gardening right up when he was a hundred he was fit as a fiddle when he was a hundred doing his own gardening
where about did your family live
the first house they lived in
the first house that i can remember was on road
that's just by where your friend lives
lived in that house there and it was three shillings a week i think it was two up and two down
one UNK living room and a little back kitchen with no water and no UNK and if you wanted to dispose of your water you'd have to take it out on the UNK and chuck it down the main drain
and you used to have to fetch your water from the UNK head just round the corner outside toilets we used to have to go about fifty yards to use the toilet
and then you'd share it with somebody else on the same row
yeah
and it was a fight for the f towards the end of the week it was a fight to sort of say well shan't be able to move it use it until t the man comes
but although in that house there was eight of us
that was your
mum and dad and six kids there was four in one bedroom me sister me and her my me two sisters in the slept in a double bed in me UNK bedroom and we four lads slept in the back bedroom w whi which was just big enough to get a double bed in as you can see and there was two that slept at the top and two slept at the bottom
and you can guess what that was like with four of us in bed hey wi move your feet
and of course y you didn't have extra blankets in those days you had to fetch your dad's UNK up and put on if you're cold
that's sort of business
what did your dad do for a living
well dad he worked in the UNK in the UNK at coventry down lane for the UNK people during the war
that's how he g he's UNK is here he's a UNK of there was a very big sam family of them about seventeen brothers
and they always formed the village church choir see
but he was tt er a twist hand in the hosiery trade making socks and he worked in the last mobile not mobile er mechanical stocking manufacturers owned by my uncle mr frank in street and th what we used to called street
it was never known as street in those days it was called the street
and they had a big tt gas engine there with a great big UNK and you can see these machines today they didn't make them round they used to make them flat
see
and i the UNK an and that used to run across like that the UNK always used to run across like that
from side to side
aye
and er great big UNK with three inch leather belts if they'd have done it in er do it in these days and the factory inspector would have cut him to pieces
and i can see the o old father when he used to have s want to make the mo the machine UNK while he did something particular to it so like you switching the electricity off well h he used to have to take the belts off
he used to get this brush handle and shove it in between the belts like that and twist it off like that
then when he wanted it to go again he used to get the th the belt the leather belt and er sort of hook it on to the lower end of the cast iron UNK and follow it round until it went on
and that's how they used to start the o and the old gas engine it used to pop
a y that was the last one of the UNK o well it was the only mo er UNK stocking UNK shop in the village
the rest was all hand operated which was UNK by UNK shops in those days
that was the framework
the framework
UNK
yeah
and you can you can see the n the buildings and there are one or two of them pulled down now
i don't remember all i the last man i can remember working one was mr joe and he was down he the last one i can remember as i say was being operated in the yard just down street
opposite to mr where mr fred used to live at the back of his house
that was the last one i can remember being worked there but i do remember frank where me dad worked
then of course me dad when that closed down it was like everything else it's as bad as it is today for jobs
they couldn't get work and my poor old dad went miles round these outside villages on a old lady's push bike trying to find work
and the work they'd go for they were building their house they'd v volunteer to take the UNK out or dig UNK to or find out which farmer would have the UNK engine to do the you know to help them with the UNK which was UNK work in those days
UNK coal and water for this poor old steam engine taking the UNK away which was a UNK horrible job
carrying sacks of beans and s oats up into the storage block in sixteen stone bags and twelve stone bags
and how they used to they used to put them on like a you know what these two UNK like they put the sacks on don't you
well it was a similar thing to that only bigger
tt they'd got two UNK which was b made it mobile two wheels and used it have four sacks at the end of this UNK engine hanging on little UNK and a bloke there seeing that it got filled alright and it when it was full they used to run this thing underneath a sack UNK it up by hand like that till they got it to the required height then nestle it on their shoulders you see there was a there's a there's an art in carrying c in carrying coal and there's an art in carrying corn and there's an art in carrying beef
there's an art in carrying everything which makes it easy if you know how
but if you don't know how it'll kill you
same as all farm work see farm work they don't know as they're born these days these youngsters don't when they come to talking about farming
used to have to w run the old b back the old horse and cart into the co crew yard which had been standing all year with about UNK beasts on it UNK it down more straw UNK it down more straw UNK it down
then in back end they used to empty this crew yard and you used to have to handle all that with UNK muck UNK they used to call them and that was big biggest UNK and by god they used to pull your heart out
you can guess what it was like straw and everything being UNK down all winter UNK with water and everything
and then when that was done you used to have to take it to the field and put it in we used to put it in big UNK and then come back fill it up and then go out and spread it
and
so
the o the old farmer used to go along with his one UNK plough and a pair of good horses and it was no mean UNK
i mean it th they were called farm labourers in those days but they weren't labourers they were clever men clever men make no mistake about that
i mean today you've got to be an educated man to know how to even they've got er UNK and everything but in those days you'd got to set your plough UNK out so as you could run your plough down your first one and then as you as you UNK your first UNK out you'd got to plough your next one into it
ten inch UNK
and keep old UNK in his in his UNK
one in the UNK and one on the UNK see
and you used to do that at a ten inch UNK all day up and down that field
day in and day out today they can same with old UNK machines they used to go out to open a field up in those days they used to have to go round with a UNK
go right round a f these the field and cut your first UNK out and tie it up with a load of the straw that you'd cut and bind it up bundle it up and shove that in the hedge bottom
then the old binder used to come in with two year old UNK horses and he used to go round this field and it used to take him days
and then after the first seven or eight s UNK then they used to come along UNK
you used to get two UNK underneath your arm like that and they used to drop them down like that across your knees and top them like that see
and you used to put eight to a UNK that was so it would dry out you see
and er and when that was been in the field whatever days depending on the weather if you'd got a good dry summer well you'd perhaps take it in after a week you see
and then we used to and they used to come along with the old cart and start leading
and when they'd finished UNK at they'd usually start UNK about half past four in the morning some of them used to go delivering milk and then they used to go leading
what we call leading that was picking your corn up
and they'd knock off for a bit of dinner come back and do the second UNK
wash your cans up erm and er and then they'd go and finish off in the corn fields
and i used to go down you used to see all the UNK and kids going down the UNK here taking their dad's tea down in the fields so they could have a bit of something and then finish as got dark
and then they'd wind their way home with the old port and everything
and hay UNK was a different kettle of fish altogether
UNK you went in the fields but you didn't open the field up in th erm with a hay UNK you used to go in with your cutter straight away
take you didn't bother about the UNK you'd do your UNK after you'd UNK all your and then of course then that was left to dry after two or three days depending on the weather again
you used to go in the fields and turn it and when it had been turned they used to start leading
and i if the man in the field had got a UNK against a bloke who was UNK i or taking off in the stack yard he could make life hell
cos there's a way of putting hay on the cart and you used to have to start one lot in the corner one lot in the other corner another lot at the back another lot at the back at the other side and then you'd fill in your centre
see
and when you'd got your centre filled in you used to start again one in the corner one the other corner one between the eyes one in the middle and back again
now if you'd got UNK against the bloke who was taking it off in the shop in the UNK after when you got back home of course you had to come i mean they didn't stick it in the field like they do now
you used to have to bring the stuff to the UNK to store it you see
and if the old boy in the field had got a UNK against the bloke taking it off he used to shove it anywhere so he'd have to pull it off instead of following the UNK round you see
by god it was hard it was hard work in those days
and see the same with UNK sugar UNK pulling
sugar UNK in those days you used to stick the old plough in plough them up and then we had to go along knocking them to knock all the soil off then chop the tops off put them in UNK go along with the old horse and cart
load them up and then t take them to the heap and ready for off again to the market
did it was all road transported in them days
m sh you see that i was saying to be a farm UNK in those days you'd got to be a clever man you'd got to know how much wheat to shove to an acre no waste you see
you couldn't afford the waste
even though it was cheap in those days the farm farmer couldn't afford to waste it
oh no
and then of course your sugar UNK went direct to UNK and it used to go by horse and cart in those days
and er but your y UNK and your potatoes they went in pits in the field
and of course you your UNK was for your a and your turnips for your winter UNK
and that was another d another task
you used to have a special UNK for your UNK and it was like a big UNK machine with a great big wheel on and you used to fill it full of er UNK or turnips and it used to come out like chips
and then you used to mix it up with UNK and oats and cake and that sort of stuff for the horses
an and then we used to have to and there was no such a thing as UNK in those days UNK
no such a thing as UNK of straw it was loose hay UNK and you used to cut it with a big hay knife
oh great big UNK thing it was it was an art to cut hay with these big knives
and then we used when it g we used to fetch it off then like cut it and then fetch it off in UNK like h you know like a big slice of bread
and my god again it was hard work we used to put it in this hay UNK pile it in and chop and it used to come out like UNK
and that was for your horses you see
an and they had to be fed
the horse man used to have to go before anybody else to feed the horses so that and groom them UNK them water them and do everything before any of the farmers dare take them out on the fields
yeah
so were these temporary jobs your father had on the farm
they'd do anything my duck
did you used to go and help on the farm as well
oh aye of course you do you had to do you used to go UNK picking my UNK for one and sixpence a day
and if you were lucky and you got a good farmer he'd let you take one o what we call UNK home
so you your mam could shove them in the oven and UNK them for you take your own bucket
you'd be oh perhaps twenty or thirty of us in these fields and you used to do so a length what you call a length
you'd perhaps have three of you picking up er the potatoes and then another length another UNK another lot of kids another three used to do another length
and then when the old UNK used to come up again if you were lucky he'd probably he had a probably a little wait before you'd finished the other you see
UNK pulling
stone picking
oh UNK turnips anything like that
one and sixpence a day but mr was the best paid was two bob a day
and we always u everybody used to try and get to 's
this was while you were still at school
this was while we were still at UNK well you used to have a week off of school my darling for UNK picking only
when i was kids
did you do any other jobs part time
paper
jobs while you were still at school
paper boy
taking it out and all these what's name half a crown a week
on lane walking it
come rain come UNK
and you had to put it in the letter box you daren't leave it in the in the
milk round with the old UNK and jug
and you'd be surprised what you had to put your milk in those days
anything
and we used to do that twice a day my darling not once a day twice a day
and then come and then wash your own cans out and you used to carry them all through all round the village
then i got a bike and i was alright then i could put two milk UNK on
but you couldn't fill th the milk UNK then you used to have the half pint and pint measures hanging inside your milk
and it was milk full of cream
when you've got up next UNK and then we i can tell you another thing and very few people know about it especially i bet you don't know wha what they called UNK do you
well in those days UNK was a UNK it wasn't a luxury because you could get it for nothing
they used the farmers used to give them to you
and it was milk after they'd UNK the cow first time after she'd had a calf well the first UNK they usually got blood in the milk you see
but the second UNK and so forth on perhaps the thir second or third UNK they used to get milk what they called UNK and it was very often too much for the UNK to take so she got a full bag
so they had to draw it off you see
and if anybody had got a cow and it UNK we used to go to him and say could we have the UNK please
then your mam used to make p UNK and put these UNK in and make a UNK
and it was beautiful
you didn't need you didn't need eggs in that so forth and fifth in that stuff
full of all the UNK and everything
you used to and then you could also go to the local farmer's and take away a UNK jug for two UNK of UNK milk
and that sort of thing
did your mum do any sort of work at all
mum she'd got to do darling
six kids dad on a few shillings a week when he was out of work mam had to go out UNK washing
my poor mother had got UNK on across her UNK right to the very day she died from UNK for different people and UNK up there
these UNK in what we called UNK in those days at these big houses up round a about the village
y you got about twelve and sixpence a w a year
and w half a day a w a week and had to be in by nine o'clock
my mother was servant to at the croft up there about fifteen bob a week and she didn't know when she used to come home
eight o'clock in the morning till eight nine o'clock at night
cooking dinner and if she got a what's a name if they'd got parties on she used to stop there had to stop there till two
what happened to you kids while she was out working
we had to look after ourselves
and if me dad wasn't home at work a out at work he used to have to do it
my father six kids on a friday night we used to put a bucket of water on the hot sink on the old gas stove and my father used to bath us six kids in front of the fire
friday night
and never once on a sunday morning did that man fail to get up and cook our breakfast and polish our shoes so that we'd go smart and good to sunday school
never once
yeah
my poor old mother and me sister finished at the same big house servant there for them
same oh
and the mothers had to do it in those days half a crown to do all the washing for this woman
and you used to get up and light the copper fire fill this old copper which held about ten gallons and then put plenty of stack o UNK on it
and it was there was no what's a name in there
i can remember me first mother's what she called automatic UNK
by god i can remember that as if it was yesterday
and it was a little square thing about two foot square with a er and about eight inches deep tt and you used to put the clothes in with warm water and your powder close the top and you used to have a handle and like that there and you used to be backwards and forwards like that with this UNK going backwards and forwards inside it
and that's what they called the first automatic UNK
aye
and of course they'd never they very rarely thought of washing clothes in tap water those days it was all UNK
every house had got it's own it's own UNK tub
and by god it were a luxury if w you washed out holding hot water first thing in the morning
you used to go out in the in the wash house and wash yourselves under the cold water tap
up to the eyes in snow up to the toilet which was about twenty yards away that was where lived then in the house where building society is now lived there for thirty four year
where's that
on street
can you remember things that your mother used to do to make the money go further when
i can
when you were short
oh yes well i mean i o obviously i when she worked she used to get up i'll tell you another thing that she used to do
she used to get up in the morning every tuesday and friday and catch the half past seven bus from to nottingham and another bus down to UNK to miss 's do a day's UNK and come back again and then do her ironing and so forth at night time
and my god they weren't such facilities as er what's a name if it was er wet weather
you every house had got lines across the kitchen you used to put hang the washing in the kitchen to get it dry
on the UNK above the fireplace i there wasn't many houses that hadn't got a line across the fireplace like that
and you'd put UNK and UNK and that and you used to have to UNK the UNK in those days
UNK blue and all this and that
and then of course they used to iron them
and it was UNK own job with sitting in the kitchen at night time a little kitchen with washing hanging above your head so the poor bugger could get it dry
this was other people's washing that she took in
aye
and her own
and we didn't we hadn't got a wash house of our own we used to have to go to miss 's down the road to do our washing
borrow miss 's
why was that
you hadn't got we hadn't got a washing we hadn't got a wash house
oh you were lucky if you'd got a wash house attached to your house in those days
you had to go to go to miss 's and have it do it there borrow her copper and UNK
UNK no it was a luxury if you'd got a UNK then
and i and of course when she worked when mum used to work in nottingham you could er be assured that you'd have some bacon on a saturday and sunday because she used to call at t n 's in street and buy UNK worth of bits of bacon
which was say when they'd started the roll of bacon there always used to be some little bits before they got the full UNK well you couldn't sell those you couldn't s i mean even though things were tight in those days you couldn't sell any sort of bacon you either sold best back or you sold UNK bacon
and the bits that you got off well we poorer families used to have it then
had to have that
eggs were twenty four a shilling little eggs looked like bullet eggs came from egypt
you still had to ask your dad for a top off the egg if you were if you were a poor family
so only your dad got an egg
on occasions yes
when he was in work and then sh we used to go to the local UNK shop on a saturday night with the old bag six o'clock saturday night to mr 's
that's where 's is now on the hill
and my dad used to say go to mr 's and tell him you've come for your dad's meat
half a crown and that's what you got
now half a crown in those days was a lot of money you had to a full day's work for half a crown make no mistake on that
half a crown and you used to come away with a big piece of flat UNK and if he's got any sausage left or bits a of pork pies he used to shove a bit of that in
and mr me dad wants to know if you've got a ham bone
he says one day me lad if you don't come back quick he said i shall sell it threepence and there was a lot of ham of it in those days
bones

and they used to make two penny worth up and that's what they called UNK in those days
why they were called UNK don't ask me but it was always known as UNK
two penny worth of bones from the butchers and two penny worth of UNK
now that used to go in the old UNK pot and they used to boil the bones till the meat dropped off and the vegetables and that was your most of your meal for the rest of the week
and in the morning you used to have UNK very few pe very few lads had breakfast bacon and eggs in those days
it was UNK or UNK

a little enough to cover a silver UNK bit in a UNK and some tea on it and you just had to take it drink it
to keep your bowels right
and as i was saying about all this you're saying what did my mother do to UNK it out
UNK the food out
she used to go to the butchers and get breast of lamb UNK end UNK head UNK head
and if she got half a UNK head she used to cut the UNK head in half and used to use the top half and that was where the ears was and everything boil it until all the meat dropped off and then she used to put in er a big UNK it up in her fingers put some of the juice in and put a seven pound weight on it and a UNK and make UNK
