and then you'd send for mr the undertaker or mr and he'd come along and measure and then make your coffin
i've got my mother's bill here i'll show it you
that was what that was nineteen twenty eight when i started work and i worked for and m
house road
and er i used to get se seven and sixpence a week seven and sixpence a week
and of course i wa i was due to learn the trade i wasn't an apprentice
i was due to learn the trade from start to finish with the with the idea of getting myself up to getting on the road
so i started as an UNK boy and half a crown a week was my bus fare which give me entitled me two journeys a return journey each day
from to nottingham
from it was fourpence return
or if you wanted to go home for your dinner and go back again in the afternoon well that was four and sixpence which entitled you to do a saturday journey
and you used to have a little ticket with the days on and they used to punch it with the old you remember the old UNK machines don't you
well they used to punch your ticket with a little hole in so that they'd know you'd had your journey
now as i say i started at that price and i used to have to help in the warehouse in the packing and so forth and then if there was any parcels to go into nottingham i used to have to deliver them by hand
and carry them either carry them or push them on a two UNK trolley all through the round the lace market to 's and various other and if i were lucky and the 's van was going round the lace market and i'd got three or four parcels i used to go with little tommy and his horse and van round the lace market and he was delivering dress goods then
and then he used to pick the UNK goods up to go to g and w 's still down road
see
and er of course as years went by i got to a to be on the UNK side after that
so you
that was an office job was it
yeah
that was making the UNK out for the parcel
oh and then i went u started as a UNK after that packing which was an art in those days
h we had to pack UNK and so forth see
and big parcels
and then i went on UNK
and then from UNK i went into the factory of course to learn how the goods were made which was very interesting
you see the i it was er we used to make curtains then for UNK as it is now they're still you know the they were about the UNK of the er tt this er catalogue business and if they gave us an order that would last us a long time and that usually the eight points which was meant to say there were eight UNK to an inch
that's how you measured curtains in the quality of the curtains was so many points to an inch
the more points to an inch the UNK the goods were you see
if it was just a six point or a seven point then it was a real UNK one cheap for american markets
but we used to UNK used to give us an order for one machine or two machines and you could keep your machine on this one particular set of curtains without changing your UNK without changing your UNK without changing your bodies you could work straight on and on and on
well they used to do them at fourpence ha'penny a pair and each one must be put in a big envelope so as it could go out on this catalogue business
and that sort of stuff used to go to america because in er we had quite a big american market in those days because they didn't wash curtains in america they used to put them up until they UNK until they dropped down and then put new curtains up you see
and er we er tt we er we made er a lot of UNK stuff during the war we had they called the federation of british industries which was an annual fair at birmingham and my firm used to s used to UNK there
bu and er of course most of your work was done from these federation stores stalls birmingham and london
and i recall at the beginning of the war they got a an almost light proof black out UNK and i can re see it today the queen bought some they were on exhibition
UNK palace i should say not the queen but UNK palace bought some
and i can remember UNK coming through and we did our own er signs in those days you know er advertising UNK it was red hot on the press
UNK as bought by UNK palace
and of course you couldn't keep pace with it because UNK palace had bought it you see and it was good
what were these UNK curtains made of then
well it was er a dense thick curtain so dense that it was hardly visible because in those days during the first world war during the thirty nine forty five war UNK was essential
you can't remember the UNK can you
you see the idea was if you had lights in your house and there was just a UNK or UNK they used to call them in those days they could be spotted from the air so th you either had wooden UNK at your window or UNK
you weren't allowed to show any lights
even the what few bits of lorries were on the road they had a special mask on with er a shield over the top so that the light wasn't visible up above
cos probably you don't realize that even a cigarette light if you drew a cigarette like that and er and made it UNK it's visible for quite a few hundred yards in the darkness
and consequently we was all subject and you were fined very heavily if you were if you UNK these what's a names UNK that's the name
and then of course we also made the at my firm made the er battle of britain curtain which was very famous in those days and i think they're still i used to have one but i don't know where the devil it went to
cos it most of the things got lost during the war you know
UNK
that was the
hello
hello mrs what can i do for you today
it's my stomach again i feel if i could just get it
so
took out
see the UNK she gave me the last time
there they were brilliant and i felt as though they were just starting to work when finished
oh right
if i could have i'd be able to get a wee bit
aye cos i even done a toilet with them
right
cos i feel
yeah
as though i've had too much water
i don't same as i did with them
no pain passing your water then jane
no it's not sore it's just my stomach all seems to mm
mhm
across your stomach swelling out right
that's fine
do you still have the burning this
mhm
ah these are the first ones i've
yes right as long as they're working it's half the battle
mhm
box
there you are jane
that'll keep you
away for a wee while again
thanking you
go away and look after yourself
it was i'd only just
no that's good
mm
that's good
well be good
mm
to yourself
i'll try my best
right jane
right
cheerio
cheerio now
so mr can you tell me whereabouts you were born in nottingham and when
well it so happens i was not born in nottingham though my early memories are of nottingham right even from infant school which er started at five years of age till about seven
but in fact i was born in UNK
my father being a UNK and er asking and doing various jobs from being ordinary UNK and man about eventually graduated by way of he's he was a lancashire man you see
and the family really come from in lancashire
which is a considerably humble place
anyway he went about in railway jobs as the years went by and i was born in taken with the rest to leicester city of leicester but my early memories was in nottingham
i don't remember the prior it's what my parents have told me and the birth certificate shows of course
and so the first memories is in the UNK of nottingham going to infant school about the age don't remember starting but perhaps i'd be six years of age and it was a little church school and they were all lady teachers and most of them mrs and not the miss which is nowadays er more common
and strange to say it had coal fires in the winter huge coal fires to keep it warm or attempt to do and most of the classrooms were only divided by portable UNK so that while we went from class to class as the two or three years went by it really was in one long building and quite adequate for the time
how big were the classes then
can you recall that
i recall being in the first class and er a teacher coming to me as i weren't paying much attention i think and to this day i shall remember and never forget she just folded my arms in front of me and says UNK you're not listening you'll have to have a rest
and she put my head on my hands on the desk in front of me and believe me i went to sleep it was must have been very new compared to being at home and perhaps being laid there
but they're they were all kind ladies and er the thing that they punished us with really was made of cardboard like er a UNK or a stick it was a UNK that they pointed to the board when they drew things on and told us about them but sometimes boys by the way boy sat with girl at the desk with two in and er it was quite satisfactory i don't remember any other upset with being there th there were two sexes we were five years of age to begin with and stayed till seven
anyway that took a year or two and i even remember taking my next brother to school me mother saying take frank to school and tell miss he's your brother and he's five
so i did and it's very strange i remember UNK off with this little chap and er and miss said who is this then or words to that effect
and remember now the language of the day said it's our frank
and er that was all the particulars i think miss ever got for him
and that er church school took us to the standard at that time called standard one which was in a big school about half a mile away and was built by the nottingham education committee and was one of say six or eight in the nottingham area i suppose
and there was a far cry from the kind lady who would lay one's head on a desk and say you have a sleep
and er
in wh in what ways was it a far cry
how did the contrast strike you
well although it was so near it was really a mining district and ninety percent of the boys we were at separate schools by the way the ground floors were boys from the age of seven upwards till fourteen
upstairs were the girls from the similar ages and one wing of this big school was infants
which i hadn't known about or my mother and otherwise living near enough they could have s done that school and gone through from five years to er fourteen
anyway standard one was a breaking in for this er other discipline and not quite so easy and learning how to spell
and teacher would er tell us that next week with her spelling lesson she'd want a new word would we learn one at home
and er the week following we'd all have to spell the word we'd chose
and it was a simple as that
again oh we'd graduated then from UNK and paper to pen and ink and paper the ink being in er a well sunk in the desk in front of us
each boy had a UNK and er a pen blue black ink and so on and some of the small books that we used for writing in were kept under the desk
most of the UNK were handed to us came from cupboards of storage of which they must have had about sixty each those classes were always from then on sixty boys in a class for one teacher
er standard one was er no trouble except er pretty UNK remember being UNK the boys could be very rough in play and there was much UNK in the playground as they ran about at their various games
and so to standard two where the that was th the next year each class was expected to take about a year which it did
in st in standard two though having passed through there the headmaster came in near the end of the second year and said because of the number of UNK er some boys would have to miss standard three because there was too many for the class
they could er because thi it this would be a UNK problem not known to us as boys and i along with seven or eight others were taken to the standard four to start after the holidays which was in august
we had a month's holiday in august every year
but to break us into this new er schooling the headmaster had us in various mornings for an hour and was supposed well tried to make a sort of summary of what the lesson would have been in standard three
and believe it or not one of the subjects was er the geography of england
now to this day i'm a UNK at the geography of england i know where the principle towns are i know you go north to manchester and south to london and generally get about
but the UNK i know more about europe eventually and other countries due to not being having a briefing by a headmaster for half an hour of something the group of us he had eight to ten of us in the room trying to prime us on what we'd missed for a year
and many times i apologize for asking where various places are because i just can't UNK most of the other things from school come without being UNK er one thinks of er the economy they taught about us about various things of the economy
oh by this time er being born in nineteen hundred and five by nineteen fourteen that was nine years the great war started
yes what impact did that have upon your schooling
the great war started and took the UNK er this road school had all men teachers UNK except standard one which was an introduction from infants to grown up and a UNK lady always called miss er broke us into this new sort of discipline and UNK really
the rest er standard two to standard six were all male but lo and behold before i got to standard five that had all become women and the men had all gone to the into the services
because although that war didn't have UNK in nineteen fourteen or nineteen fifteen i believe it started in nineteen sixteen back end and er we we'd got all women teachers who were quite a different problem from a school of that nature
cos a boy in standard five could be getting on for thirteen
there were quite a few UNK and er some didn't always get moved on and they didn't all make it into the top class they had to stop again for another year or period in the class they were
yes i was going to ask what well what effect did the er the UNK of the male teachers by the women teachers during the great war period
h how do you think it affected the schooling
well in my observation as regards young boys it er th they played could play them up the lads would play UNK on the teacher who would put the best on it for a long time
worse come to the worse she brought the headmaster in with his cane and he was er like the one in the stories skilled to rule but anyway his most UNK was UNK this cane which was a good three foot long
it wasn't the things you go fishing with it was a s solid cane of er not UNK and er i never knew him have another one
but if even if one was late from for school he had a monitor on the doors to the outside world and when the whistle went for nine o'clock that door was closed and there the boys UNK in the yard to er get in the lines and marched to the classes
he then dealt with those who were late and those who were late would then appear to be six or seven minutes late because of these other UNK
but he UNK nothing he just asked er what's made you late
and there's various reasons whether your mother wanted some milk bringing
by the way this was the period when i could to a milk shop for a UNK of milk but it's not the UNK that people think now cos the UNK been altered quite a lot it was very UNK but it's true
milk a little dip of milk was sold into a jug there were no bottles and er you could get some for a ha'penny
and so you could be late for various things like that but you got the stick
oh so whatever
and er
did it happen frequently
children getting the stick
it happened everyday for those who were late
eventually the discipline is such as one used your influence on your mother and so if i'm late i'll get the cane and so on
so er it wasn't pleasant and i didn't have it a lot either because i never were very big and i never liked punishment it made me cry every time
it did really
it's a cruel thing and especially to hit a boy on his right hand and then expect him to write with it
this i found at various times my fingers were suffering from this UNK in the oh at ten past nine in the morning
but anyway most things were like that i think it had to be something like in his noisy mansion skilled to rule
it had to be he had to do something or they would never have er got in other ways in was a UNK school because as the years went by it was a register was called a teacher er opened a book and we called numbers
UNK i found that my surname spelt was always first on the register whichever class i was so i was number one
and er l er those whose names er began with er later initials in the UNK and we didn't have any z 's there were no UNK in those days
but they were some well on lo and behold could open the door er two or three minutes late and c er call the er number yes sir er as they entered the class and they would get their mark this being i think you got a red mark if you were late t to stand out so that an inspector who came down UNK could look down the register and there was the record of who was early and who was late by the colour of the ink pens i think
so that was a strange thing too with this er UNK thing
so
the only excuse me er no we even had UNK a double b er didn't always get in front but i think it should have done you know you take the first letter and then you take the
we had UNK and all sorts of UNK strange isn't it
the UNK
anyway that was a simple rhythm there and UNK a chap from the education committee used to come and check this register and the classes and some passed through the class
but that was just er ordinary the geography of this or the history of that many battles UNK field and
i was going to ask d do you think looking back er th that the school erm tt taught you to regard certain things as important in life
was it d w was there was there like er erm sort of pa er erm love of country or did they stress say the virtues of honesty a and fairness can you remember anything like that
well i think the period that UNK my school days you see i didn't leave till nineteen and th that meant there'd been four years of war at school and the last year well it ended in er nineteen eighteen the war did so only the last year but it was full of UNK and all the old UNK that had er served or suffered or been killed their names were up
yes we were very UNK and er i'm not ashamed of it
er i have a love of country i know i'm er english i don't like to say i'm british i live and was born in england
and when i go to wales for a holiday and there are UNK they're just as good as i am some can sing so much nicer and i've worked with UNK in engineering factories and there's no better engineers than UNK but they don't necessarily call them british
everywhere i've been he's a UNK
or he's a p er UNK can be a paddy and so on
and so i er never went the whole UNK that way with UNK the british and best and so on
it could be and sometimes was but i er the standard takes a lot of keeping up and er much of the influence comes from newspaper and superior people UNK it on the population by UNK these standards which often are UNK and they would like it to be so but er they were hard days they were hungry days
i was growing but i'm now i never got much higher than about five foot one and i weighed eight stone for a many years
but i was a little person in er a UNK community of little person and er my brothers worked down the pit and i believe it was an advantage not to be much greater than five foot in height down the pits
it was the time of wooden pit UNK and er much UNK and laying down and UNK away at the coal with picks and there was no mining machinery as we know it now
could i
could i just move you on a little bit
having talked about your schooling to er
ask you about er family life and the impression that left upon on as you were growing up
w what can you remember of your father
w what job did he have
and what kind of man was he
yes
my father worked on the railway and in my conscious life he was a supervisor he was called an inspector
he had two UNK worked under him the purpose being they did the shifts my father did all the writing for the great central railway depot the UNK yard or sorting out the trains
strange to say these trains do not come from other towns say birmingham with er a UNK of stuff for nottingham they come with a UNK of stuff for here there and everywhere
and the person who had sorted it together at birmingham made sure that the next stop it was at the UNK would be at the back end to leave in that town and this is what my father was doing by er UNK as it was called or making a train up to go from nottingham to london or some other place in the country with up to fifty or sixty trucks behind it and they didn't want the trucks next to the engine to be dropped off at the first place and having to shove and push about in their UNK yard
it seemed a simple system when i got to know it but wondered what it was all about with chaps standing in different places and shouting and UNK where they wanted this waggon that was being pushed off as he came running without the train they diverted it into UNK you see sorting out a train
and it's not everybody's job to do that so ordinary people took the jobs as UNK and could be taught how to do it in short time if they were average and er in good health
cos it's an UNK job it's a three shift system for those on the bottom er early morning and late cos the eight hour day had come in at this time
which would whe around when
when are we talking about now
say about n nineteen
in the early nineteen twenties
we'd er
twenties
yeah
er s er but those UNK that worked shift and had to go round the clock had to have eight hour shifts three shifts
you could have UNK and nights which many people don't know and i worked UNK and night in engineering
UNK er when i worked at the ford motor company it meant getting from UNK to UNK and starting on a machine at six a m in the morning in the middle of winter or the middle of summer
and the next fortnight i would be on the afternoon shift which meant getting the same distance to half past two to work till they were eight hour shifts you see and the night shift likewise had to come a very er a tremendous number from working at the ford motor company at UNK ev even in those days travel from various places
and it's not all honey starting somewhere at six in the morning if you live eight or nine miles off
there were not the multitude of UNK about in those days as there are now but that was one of the firms that was trying to make it and has done it like that
so UNK have very UNK hours of work UNK hours i think they call them now one of the most UNK is the night shift
i've never been in any factory in my life working nights i have been in many but i've never found my fellow men very UNK on the night shift
actually you go there to work but there is er a meal break and various things you have contact with each other either borrowing tools or sharing the use of them but UNK get very short in the small hours of the morning and men get pretty tired
they can be it's no comparison with day work
okay
just to t to come back to what prompted you to give us that interesting er little evaluation of the differences that night and day work have men
night and days
to get back to the beginning to get back to your father
yes
erm y i is it growing up
yes
on the railway
yeah
erm
well i find and still find the clerical people are remote from reality
they would think that a man er starting at eight in the morning will do as many and as quick for ten o'clock as a man starting at night or at six o'clock in the morning or the afternoon shift
but it's not so
there's different UNK and i would think er on all the shifts there is a variation of production just because of the hour of the day
it is not natural to work through the night shift i've worked it there is no way of starting a week without your er i've slept a night before somewhere at the weekend when the day comes but you've got to go the next night to work
even as a young person me mother used to say you'll need some sleep you go to bed this afternoon which i did in UNK
but you know sleep UNK a young person if one's in their young twenties and they think you can go to bed at er half past two in the afternoon and have an hour or two
it's not on
er nowadays i've no trouble in dropping asleep in the afternoon
no
but in the twenties i was better at the pictures or somewhere like that which you could get for a few pence but you're not walking about or doing UNK thing
could i ask you then when you
when was your first job
when did you leave school
and did you know what you were going to do when you left school
well my mother i left school and me mother said the labour UNK had come into being er this was nineteen they were in existence in nottingham
and they had addresses and i ran around i went to get a job at the pit which er i had no more sense so i'm glad now that i didn't get on
and i found months and months after that most of the boys that got on there had their fathers work there who went to the office or asked the UNK they used to talk about UNK in the pit and i found this was short for deputy
not er the th the employer UNK his authority and there was UNK in the pit but never in factories
they have UNK under UNK charge hands and so on but in the pit they UNK down there
and er
you passed up the chance to go the pit then
yes
inside a month i was sent to an engineering place which was er close to where i live and i started there inside about a month
can you remember the name of it place
it was the john and a very big factory in it's day in as much as it was er four UNK high rather high in those days for heavy machinery to be on level like that
and with the war ending the germans had to pay UNK and that factory and many more were extremely busy because they were making lace machines for france
france was UNK and er they had always had a lace trade but we found in after years this is a point that shouldn't be missed that destruction by the germans and the replacing under UNK i understood the money came from anyway the firm worked day and night for years er left nottingham the lace centre with the old pre war machines and france and areas including italy er with the modern machines
even in villages i known men who've worked abroad fitting them up in er germany and in france and in italy one of whom went to night school in germany to learn the language t to get on better he was there to receive machines
they're very big like printing machines are
yeah
yeah
so i it was a thriving and UNK factory because of this supply of machines through
it was a working day and night and the er just as busy as the
wartime until oh before say four years
and then much of this UNK was made up and the capacity being there er well the hours of work were getting tackled then they'd been longer hours and er i think as a boy coming out of apprenticeship er the forty seven hour week had come into being
did you take an
apprenticeship then
yes
yeah
i was UNK
yeah
and er worked till i was twenty one and you usually got the sack when you were twenty one unless they were busy very busy they would say you er you won't get the full money at twenty one because er w i can get a man of forty one for that money
th there's a t three a two year period where you'll be an UNK where you could have an increase in pay about every six months bringing you up gradually
but should go to another factory and er hold your own in the factory you could expect to get the full money which i did at twenty one
i went to newark and got a job at a ball bearing factory and er they paid me the UNK wage of er two pounds sixteen for forty seven hours
it came to about one and three UNK an hour
you have to allow the coins changed now the three UNK is not comparable with the present pence
but it was very low
yeah
you wouldn't ten shillings for a day
or it would be approximately ten shillings for a day because we had to work saturday morning although it was at newark and got to travel twenty
yeah
miles there and twenty miles back
we was it apparent to you at the time that the wage was low
well to me it was a first time and being an UNK man that i'd earned anything like it
it was the men there who were UNK who had better wages as the war had ended and there was such a rush on wages had gone up but the once the boom was got over they came down
and by er nineteen twenty six the engineers suffered a UNK drop from about er four pound odd down to this two pound sixteen
newark by the way was less than nottingham because it was a country district
nottingham considered to be more of engineering not quite metropolitan but varied trades and factories
mm
mm
mm
yeah
and UNK a little bit more
yeah
was it was it difficult then to have to have got a job in nottingham you had to go to newark because it was w work wasn't as UNK as er
as i said the er lace trade
available in
had er b building lace machines had er had it in the term and they started to UNK into a variation of the hosiery which was quite another UNK
there were other places in nottingham that had made nothing but hosiery machines and weren't quite as good as were at making lace machines
had a good reputation although it was a non union firm and n much UNK by er union people who UNK stand for not er sort of recognizing
you could work there being in a trade union but didn't have to say so
yeah
see
it was kept small
but they made machines that did lace curtains lace er is er a UNK now and er probably a thing of the past but there was amazing things done on a lace machine
there's some in nottingham in one of the UNK museum that has the nottingham coat of arms i think it has the council house and various things and it's all done UNK on a huge machine that er is a repetition in each bay it's probably thirty forty foot long but in each bay of about seven foot it's separate curtain
but that machine can be doing say eight curtains coming off a bottom roller being UNK over and onto another one till they're taken off
UNK this pattern repeated UNK and the man could walk along and they'd all be working he just goes with an assistant to er repair broken UNK
they get broken or the end of the line and so on to join up you get a little UNK there which a UNK will do
so they they're pretty accurate er machines in a pattern way not a i found later in engineering where they needed things to the UNK and the very fine measurement very particular to the th the tissue paper difference between er one thing and another wasn't good enough
it had got to be as near as thi UNK of tissue paper
we have UNK metal strips that are one and a half thou thick we call it you can't have them any thinner because they can make them in sheffield at one thou thick but they suffer and bend by use
if you try to push them under a place to see if it's touching you'll find they get bent up and once there's a bend in you can't smooth it
so the standard UNK for an engineer goes from about one and a half thou up to fifteen thou the rest you can measure by other things
these are UNK
y yeah
you mentioned er earlier the trade unions and er you mentioned the er middle UNK middle nineteen twenties as a period of industrial un UNK
yeah
w when did you first join a trade union yourself and get involved
when i er were in the tool room at newark at the age of twenty one plus you see not twenty two er i was approached then by a shop steward who worked on the bench was a fitter
i was always on a machine cutting UNK machine
and i joined the UNK union one saturday night in newark had to go back there and they had meetings in the UNK a room that was hired and er was er particulars taken and i've been in ever since
i'm still in the union from nineteen twenty six to nineteen eighty three and next monday i shall go to the branch cos i have an interest in the organization and the movement
i can't say it's been UNK successful but i do know for a fact that the conditions of the working class was improved tremendously by organizations in the thing which has come to be described as trade unionism
er there are UNK in some and variations and er not always a desire by everyone to belong to it but the odd man out is often like a bad apple in a barrel
and er it's strange to me how an employer would be happy to have a room with a hundred and hope to get one or two who weren't either for reasons of information or things that one couldn't trust from a worker
they are not in company in factories there's UNK between management and the shop floor
there is also the difference between employees who are in offices who for some reason or other i've always found and still do they seem to have a notion that they're a different class to others who work for wages
they will talk about salaries and things like that but they're often paid well very UNK some of them monthly now and think that's er UNK or something
but mostly in my experience they were paid just the same as we do we were perhaps on a different day and a different method
we had to stand in a line
i've been to newark on a friday night and stood in a line with others on a night shift at a w wooden hut in the yard whilst a clerk from the pay office came to meet us the day shift finishing at er say five o'clock
he'd come half past seven to eight to pay us as we came to work to hand us the money we'd UNK for the last week always keeping about three days in hand
so employers in my experience even to the day i left always owe the UNK something for what he's done
mm
and it would appear in the simple times before mine even i had experience at newark that men could get a sub in the week because you're actually in two days you've actually UNK two days money and you haven't got it
and if a UNK was UNK or a general true story that a man had to have his train fare to get to newark and he had to pay this and that you could er get a loan on your wages
but you had to have qualified for it by working see end of the week and the only place i ever had one was at and because the foreman approached me i'd been out of work and got the job by writing to it going to the library and it was in one of the london papers they wanted men for the tool rooms
i got to be working where they made the tools in that of the engineering shop and er i travelled on a sunday from nottingham to london and
what year would this be
just to put it into context
yes
yes
well i'd be er i'd got er a daughter nineteen twenty nine i would say nineteen twenty eight
twenty nine yes
i'd er at been at newark till then for about four years or so and the er UNK had come about and they were sacked by the hundreds including myself
i asked the under foreman what i'd done to deserve this he says you're not on your own there's er a quarter to go this week and good many next so that's what it's come to
we made ball and roller bearings for the car trade the car trade had come a UNK and the car trade to this day doesn't want one bearing or one detail for a car until it's ready to put it on a car
i found this out at UNK when i worked at UNK the supply lorries used to come through the day and through the night with articles made in other factories including bodies and wheels and these were put on the assembly line and UNK through UNK to be UNK
it's quite true that er wheels from UNK in UNK and bodies would be on the road inside two hours of having left another factory because they were on the same industrial site
but they hadn't been made at UNK they'd been made in a subsidiary taken up the road on long UNK taken off the trailer onto the assembly UNK which er UNK round the assembly line and fitted like that
that's the economy of the motor trade apparently henry ford in america had an upset and er tried to beat the banks and er had loans and he was frightened that they would get control of his business and the we were told that at UNK
and it's quite true i was there about four years and they always took stock before january the first so that after christmas came an UNK we'd had a christmas holiday and gone back to work
in the north of england they have new year's day but they don't in the south in england they might do now
and but at UNK we they we were laid off again for this other weekend till they took stock
it would appear henry ford had insisted on this ever since that UNK so that he could always how he stood financially
it's with not knowing how one is that one has to go to the banks and so on
anyway that was their way of dealing with UNK there they their word was law
so whilst it was a good paid job for instance ri
well mr
good morning
what can i do for you today sir
i was down last week i had er from saturday er my ear was all UNK up terrible pain
and i was taking a course of antibiotics
and your brains are still a bit dubious
so
let's have a look in and see what you've done to the poor old thing
you're alright still not right still not right
awkward between your
and you you're frightened with your dog all the time
yeah
are you frightened when you're on the phone
that you can hear yourself
i can hear myself talking all the time
quite clearly
what on the phone
aye
i haven't really noticed that
no
you didn't notice any
no
what about when you're lying in bed at night
no it's just a UNK all the time
just a UNK all the time
aye
right
we're gonna get you some special drops to use er there s is there's still a bit of the UNK a wee bit blocked
mhm
looking
and we've got to lift that off
aha
to get a look underneath the er right
i mean i'm finding that you know through it because i'm sort of UNK all the time i'm getting terrible headaches and all of the
that's right
rest of it cos obviously at work you're UNK every minute
that's
of the day
let's get some of the good old fashioned stuff
would it have came off a cold or something
it's probably come off a cold it's er there there's a tube in there and the other side
if you could cut yourself down through the middle there's you're ears on the outside there and there's a wee channel that goes in
aha
and at the bottom of that there's what's called the UNK
aha
now in the inside of that it opens out there's an opening in the bone and that leads down among other things into a tube down here now that is connected up further down to the UNK across
aha
here so if you get a heavy cold some of this UNK that runs down the back of your throat gets into this tube and
right
blocks up this tube comes right up into the back of your UNK blocks
yeah
up that wee bit there and i think this is what i'm seeing
yeah
is this stuff lying in the bottom there
you can see the level
aha
across the bottom of your UNK and it's like standing and you're
aha that's exactly what it feels like you keep sort of thinking aha something like that to help
if you could only stretch or you know turn your head a certain way it would run out
but i'm almost certain that's what i'm seeing
aha
in there
that was the initial feeling that i got it was like a build up of pressure in it but on the inside and not in the outside
mhm
that's right it's a similar to hat you get if you go flying when you've got a cold
i was gonna say that
aha
i'm almost certain that's what's doing it to you so let's see if we can get through to it with that
right
get it broken up for you
aha
now it's a bottle two drops in the morning wee bit cotton wool just to stop it running out don't
put it inside

where was the factory
the factory was in er UNK street factory in street up off road
and he'd er worked himself up from one lace machine until he'd got twelve
and then er the lace trade he worked on when women wore high UNK high UNK and he made the little narrow UNK lace about like that and it was UNK so it made a UNK round the face
and he er he'd made all that lace well then instead of him going in the first world war and making the net which was used you see his lace trade all went
well then he started at in a factory there at with er more modern machines but the factory was too cold a factory has to be a certain heat to work the lace machines properly
and he came back to er and started again and er he'd just er the big manufacturer engineering er people made us lace machines then and they started him off with three and he'd paid off one and part of the other when he died
and it was the first world war that killed him he had a brain damage you know a stroke

until i was old enough to make my own
and er i started er with a UNK my father bought me a UNK and it taught me how to er dress me
and they used to buy me new material to encourage me and i learnt how to UNK from that
was this something you did after school in the evenings
well then i went to a private school on road two maiden ladies kept that and we were taught to er walk properly sit properly dance music learnt the piano there and UNK and erm UNK the educational side of schooling was almost non UNK
what age were you when you went there

where did you go before then

as far as i can remember that
i've never seen i only remember schooling from this school
and i remember going to er road school for a month and we caught UNK there
and er we left and we never went back there that's when i went to the private school
and my brothers both went to er a headmaster from the high school set up on his own and they both went there and that was at the corner of avenue on road
cos we lived at the top of the second hill opposite erm doctor s er house the famous eye surgeon
that photograph that i've got where it's all UNK his house and we lived just opposite
when did you move up there
ooh i don't know what age i'd be when we went up there
you say you were about ten
i should say about ten
and was that a much bigger house than the one in on street
oh yes that was ordinary er row of houses the one at was a detached house stood in it's own grounds
and i remember four stone steps led up to the front door and we'd what they called a parlour then
and then my parents had a big er lean to built at the side of the house and we had a full size UNK table in there
and it they used to entertain ever such a lot my parents did
what did they do
have parties and
enter ooh and we had some marvellous parties
and there was a two friends of theirs who were UNK and he'd got a UNK on the end of his nose
and from that he was king of the UNK
and then we had this man that used to come from india and he was called the UNK of india
and they'd all got er status symbols you see and it was quite a UNK thing that they used to have
and we had marvellous christmas parties too
and we had a house full of people at christmas time
were these people who were staying at the house
we had er they were sleeping all over everywhere at christmas time on the floor seem to remember dozens of people then and we kept two UNK then and a gardener
at that time
and did they all live in the house as well

did they had UNK
they slept in the same bedroom as me because we were er limited to bedroom space but we had girls because we were doing such a lot of entertaining there was a lot of work
what were they like the two the UNK were they young girls
we never thought anything about it you know
they were not er they were old enough to work they were much older than me
in fact when i er periods started it was them that told me all about it not me mother and didn't never think then about st er sex or anything not a thing i was as innocent as day was born when i was eighteen
the difference of children of today
were you quite you were friendly with the UNK then was it like
oh very friendly with them yes

what would she go shopping and things like that
er every night they used to play cards and when i was eighteen my father made me learn cards
he made me play cards i'd played ordinary UNK bridge at that time
but he made me do it i didn't want to do it but he made me do it
so we used to play UNK bridge every night
not as it's played today though
it's played totally different today ours was quite UNK to how it's played today
were you always included in your parents parties even from when you were younger
oh yes
we and we had some marvellous christmas parties because we used to play all sorts of games
and i remember one game in particular it always stuck in me mind
somebody used to sit on the carpet at one end of the room with a walking stick and a chalk mark in front of him and the UNK used to have to come up to him and try to rub the marking out and he used to UNK the hands with his walking stick
i can remember that game ever so well
it must have been a bit painful
well you used to be as UNK as they were you used to watch fingers you didn't get them UNK
yes you were just as UNK as they were
did it have a name that game
if it did i don't remember it
what about any other games

yes you know
and pass them round and everybody used to write differently
y that still is a good game to play today
you can have a real old UNK at that
real fun
but er i don't remember any other games
we used to UNK on the lawn
we'd a full size lawn with a UNK and UNK
we used to UNK on the lawn

so were the classes mixed
did you have subjects together
oh yes we the boys were taught along with the girls yes we were we were all on just in the one room
yes just in the one room
was it near where you lived

and you were at this school till you were fourteen
yes until i left
and what did you have nay thoughts of what you would do when you left school
no didn't go any where at all just stayed at home
and then after about two years when father le realized that the lace trade was going he said must to put to a trade
because er we don't know what's going to happen and she must be able to earn her own living
so they put me to UNK
well we used to start to make hats form a UNK of wire
we built the shapes up and it was the high class shop in was two sisters on gate that er we went to sh er sch er shop and er we used to make these shapes from the UNK of wire UNK be very UNK that i used there and still use them today ever so useful
but those are what i used to make the wire shapes
and erm then we used to have straw and inch wide by the yard
and we used to stitch round and round and round making the shape on this wire
and then we used to trim it and er a hat there made of just the straw with a band and bow was over three pound which was a lot of money in those days
you used to er the UNK fair people always came and bought half a dozen hats
and er they were always er it was never an open shop they were always sold by appointment
and er they used to trade up and down this room miss i'll be wearing such and such a dress and it'll be such and such a colour and er then we used to make the hat for it
and they al always used to order half a dozen hats
and as an apprentice you i was a year there for nothing a ye half a year for half a crown half a year for five shillings and at the end of five years i was earning fourteen shillings
and er in the apprentice we used to have to go round the shops on the town matching their er material in UNK and UNK and UNK for making their hats of as well as the straw we made them from material as well
and i used to trail round all these shops
what exactly did you do when you went round the shops
you had to collect
collect patterns take them back and the head used to pick and then we used to have to go and buy what they wanted you see the amount of material they wanted
can you remember any of the customers who came to the shop
what sort of people apart from the
only the fair people
and used to have a er shop in erm street selling sheet music
they used to er trade
and then this butcher on road i remember they used to trade
so what hours did you work at this hat shop
nothing only making hats
yeah but how long was you working day
when did you start and when did you finish
eight in the morning till eight at night
five days a week

and did you have any breaks for lunch or anything
we used to have an hour and a quarter fro lunch half an hour for tea and we used to er have to get the UNK tea ready and in the UNK they always had tea made of milk
i remember boiling the milk and pouring it on the tea leaves
they always had it
and er the bread and butter for their tea had to be cut UNK thin
i was clever at that
they always had me cutting this er bread and butter
what would you actually do then you said you sat round a table you told me about that the table with the white cloth
yes
there used to be a long table and the head used to sit at the end of this table and so to see that you didn't leave off working she used to get the table cloth and always be pulling this table straight
and be looking round
this and looking round to see that you were working
were you allowed to talk to the other girls or anything
you didn't have time to do much talking you were so busy sewing
it was real UNK
how many other girls worked there round the table

okay sir bye now
hello
i'm david UNK and you can give me a call right now on
good morning
you're listening to dial david UNK on max a m
at long last perhaps the next tale of UNK league football grounds may be about to move on
according today's scotland on sunday newspaper hearts and it's chairman UNK are coming round to the idea of sharing a ground with UNK on the site the council wants at ingleston
as the negotiations grind on and on time is passing quickly towards the deadline set for UNK league grounds to implement the taylor report improvements
UNK reaction to the proposals is still far from clear but with a new report out from the council soon the time is coming for decisions to be taken
this one seems to have been going on for far too long
how about ingleston
it was the UNK when ground share was first UNK but a super league home for edinburgh football in the west of the city handy for the motorways and the bypass might make sense might it not 's the number to dial
the scottish office will issue a consultation paper on the future of local government next week with mr major UNK regions like strathclyde UNK at the tory conference it's perhaps clear the way they're thinking
the government want to replace the UNK of the present arrangements with single UNK councils that's to say one authority providing all the local services
few enough people at the moment know which council does what
in edinburgh the UNK blamed for everything despite the fact it ceased to exist nearly twenty years ago
and the region and district split services between them
do you think your local council does any good
do you want to keep it er keep lothian or UNK regions
or do you not see any point in keeping them at all is the number to dial
we'll be going to the telephone lines in a moment or two to talk about these subjects or anything else you wish to raise this sunday morning
first a break
you're listening to dial david UNK max a m
eyes down look in
here we go again
the first call of the day mr from west UNK good morning
good morning mr UNK
i'd like to talk about scottish homes open space maintenance UNK i e grass cutting etcetera
right
now each UNK or tenant in a scottish homes estate in west lothian has to pay for this service as well their poll tax
i dare say you've heard of that
but
tha that's because the ta the estates are owned by scottish homes and the poll tax obviously goes towards the
yes
the councils then
right
now in west UNK th the charge erm UNK this year to forty pound that's for nineteen ninety one cos they're always a year behind
mhm
now the actual cost of grass cutting amounts to seventy pound forty five erm various UNK work which they um specify comes to eleven pound seventy
but to crown it all they have a administration of four pound thirty seven er all of these plus vat
now and these
what the four pounds thirty UNK to administer sending out the bill for you
yes
so there are a hundred ninety two houses in this particular estate erm which makes a total of eight hundred and forty pound just for sending a bill
right
now incorporated in these charges there's a litter collection so if litter is dumped on district council ground but they won't it at the scottish homes land then the owner have to pay for this service
and this was clearly stated i a scottish homes UNK representatives had a meeting er in west UNK recently and they stated this ridiculous state of affairs
right
so wha what you're saying is it's all just nonsense
or you don't mind paying some of it or what
i don't want to pay any at all
i mean the district council have taken over scottish homes they've been passed to them in UNK and mid lothian recently
mhm
and i believe er at this meeting it was revealed that scottish homes had received a tender from the west lothian district council for this work over a period of ten years for a figure which comes to four hundred thousand pound which apparently was the cheapest tender
but scottish homes have given this job to scottish land on a yearly basis
right
so i mean this is a ridiculous state of affairs
why sho why should we have to pay for this service as well as our poll tax
okay
well thank thanks for your call mr i dare say that er other people in a in a similar position may er may want to er take you up on that
next mr from
UNK good morning
good morning mr UNK
it's about the football ground at ingleston
mhm
erm i don't think it'll ever take off UNK actually because er you've got all the traffic all there already and if you've got say you have got UNK and hearts you got all the traffic going out there at the same time and it's gonna be UNK a block
but i mean UNK well used to handling the UNK show and er ba and er you know the existing airport traffic er and so on
yes but also what about a night time game
you're gonna have the flood lights on right beside a na and international airport
er it could be o off putting for the for the planes
right
but i but i mean basically the er the objections you raised to it there are planning objections which presumably the councils thought about when they UNK ingleston as the home for a new UNK
well i'd just like to think that maybe we have thought about it you know
i would i would like to really think that
because look at i'm not you know i'm not er gonna even talk about the disaster at airport things you know the taking off and landing if you've got a UNK nearby with a lot of people in it and one of these disasters happened to happen i know we're not looking for that but if it does you're gonna have a UNK full of people if a plane comes down well you know
right
i say a plane could come down anywhere right
are you a football fan yourself
yes
er th which team do you support
i support the one at er the east end
right
so it
UNK
o on UNK principles rather than planning principles would you have any objection to
er
to going to ingleston
i mean th this you know they said the
i wou i don't fancy ingleston at all
i would rather stay in leith i'm afraid but
and if you can't stay in the east you want to stay in the east of the city
yeah i would like to stay leith that's where all the football fans are that support UNK
right
er if my choice i'd like to be in the docks but things cannot ha happen that way we've got a lot o a lot of the UNK moving in that area and that seems to be taking over that area so no chance of a football UNK there
things do have to move on
the outside of the town seems to be the best idea
erm you know the old american way where you can take your family park in a car park have a picnic go to the game sort of thing
that
mm
seems to be the thing they're all looking for
erm as i say you know i UNK not to far away it's still far enough
er a as i say leith
it's UNK stretching your loyalty as far as it'll go
is that is that far enough
pardon
is that far enough
what was that again
sa UNK would stretch your loyalty as far as it would go geographically
yes i wo i would i would go for that i'm afraid
but as i say leith is in the preference and it's a preference for a lot of football fans
okay
thanks very much indeed for that
next is the hearts chairman UNK good morning
morning david
david i just wanted to say that there's an article in one of er the newspapers this morning which really is a di UNK of the current heart's board's position and i just wanted to
well that's really what i started the programme off
right
with
i didn't realise that
the er the scotland on sunday piece
right
suggesting tha that you're UNK to the idea
no
of moving
no
to UNK
can i just quite clearly put on record and it's a unanimous decision of the board we wrote to edinburgh district a few weeks ago we've told them that we will use our best UNK david to UNK the application at UNK if we get planning consent and we decide that we can't afford a new UNK in total because of the economic situation we are UNK re looking at the UNK of UNK
only in i in exceptional circumstances and i do mean absolutely exceptional circumstances would we even consider going to ingleston
we've already written lothian region this week worried about the safety aspect
we don't want to be UNK into an arrangement at ingleston which is just a political convenience
and hearts
a political convenience for who
for the politicians
for the council
well i we feel as a club sometimes that our position is being UNK and distorted
i mean i'm UNK again in the newspaper this morning they were having a go at convenor UNK
all he has been trying to do is to trying to ensure that there's been even handed play here on all the UNK sites and it's disgraceful that his name has been dragged into this
hearts will either be at UNK or UNK
ingleston if we were offered a king's UNK we might have to sit down and think about it but it is very much a long shot
but surely the problem is that time's UNK on and you're gonna have to start thinking about the taylor report recommendations
well
well
i'm sure you are already thinking about the
we've already written we've already written last week to the scottish office we've written to our member of parliament and we've asked him to see if we can get a delay on the date because we've taken three years to try and get planning consent
but what i want the hearts mid lothian supporters to know is that if we don't go to UNK it is highly likely we'll be remaining at UNK and we could put together a very attractive proposal there
so when do you as far as your concerned is this going to be sorted out
i mean if the council
we as the board will ha be making a decision david within the next two months
we did a confidential letter to edinburgh district a month ago telling them that
there's no way we can even consider ingleston just now when we're involved at UNK and re looking at UNK
so if the if the region come back to you and knock back UNK er would you appeal
or would you just say well that's it let's press again with UNK
well we'll have to consider that along with land UNK cos we think it's a brilliant site with good road access and we want to work very hard with the people that put the deal together
but UNK is very much a second option that we're really quite keen on now
but wa but surely an honest UNK deal er involving UNK and the district council di at ingleston must be an attractive proposition for
well
football fans
well david i can't speak on behalf of UNK all i can say
mm
is that tom farmer and also the UNK board seem to on numerous occasions say they've no interest in ingleston and they want to go ahead with UNK
i think they should get planning consent and go ahead and develop UNK
but are the troubles er not that you and UNK and pursuing erm financial objectives rather than UNK objectives
no
that's UNK
i mean frankly david if you look at the number of games we've had so far this season it would be totally UNK for both teams to have played on the same pitch
it'll be physically impossible with UNK for with the number of UNK we've had it's just er it's physically no er not possible
the supporters have quite clearly indicated they don't want to share
it will be UNK for hearts to consider that as an option
and if we don't go to UNK we'll stay at UNK
that's the bottom line
now if edinburgh district want to talk to us about ingleston and we don't want to upset them we'll talk to them but it would have to be an in and enormous financial attraction for us even to consider that
okay
so two months time we should know where we're going
i would hope even sooner than that
okay
thanks very much indeed for you call
UNK from edinburgh good morning
yes good morning er mr UNK
erm i would like to talk about er one of the articles that's in the one of the sunday papers this morning
erm it's about the government UNK the pensioners again
erm
this suggestion that the pensions may be frozen on thursday
yes
yes
erm there's an article in one of the papers this morning and er it was i think it's an absolute disgrace
erm i'm a home help and i go you know for a lot of pensions and erm the UNK that these er old men and women have to live on a th i mean i really think it's terrible
and now they're talking about freezing it
i mean it seems to be the pensioners who come in for th the tt you know the same thing all the time
and i mean they're actually living on a UNK as it is
so
erm
who do you think i mean th you know the government's making it pretty clear at the moment mrs that er in these UNK times something's gonna get squeezed because there's so m many people out of work that gi you know they're having to pay more unemployment benefit there's not enough tax money coming and generally the government is hard up so someone's going to get squeezed in the social security system
yeah but what about the unemployed
i mean who do you think should get squeezed
should it be you know single
well
parents or
i mean these old men
people on the dole
these old men and women i mean they've worked all their life and er th there are i mean there was an article last week in one of the papers as well and it said you know all the benefits that we get there was thousands not claiming benefits that they was entitled to
mhm
but it's only for people who are actually on income support
and th and then we have mr UNK saying that there were lots of people at the tory party conference remember he had his little list that he was going to go through and erm chop out all the social security UNK and people who abused the system
yes
but i mean er th yes
well why not why not come down hard on them
i mean why make it the pensioners every time
i mean th there's i mean i think it's an absolute disgrace as i said really
i mean i think it's terrible and i mean if mr UNK himself went into some of the houses that i go into and see the existence that they live because that's all it is you know it's just an existence
and some of their fa i mean if they're lucky enough to have families who do help them that er that that's fine but i mean a lot of them don't have anybody at all and they really have to pay their gas electric rent poll tax off an absolute UNK
and i think it's an absolute disgrace
okay
thanks very much for that
bu erm th but as i say the government were making it perfectly clear this week that something's gonna get squeezed
i wonder if people have any er ideas for who could be squeezed and not cause an UNK and not cause undue suffering and distress
nelly from UNK next good morning
good morning david
how are you
very well thanks
yourself
i fine thank you
it's about the housing department
mhm
er my friend got a house at UNK park eleven months ago and er it was alright at the beginning then she started getting hassle from the kids coming to her door asking for cigarettes and she didn't give them and they were UNK on her door UNK on her windows and everything
so it got worse and worse and
it's similar to a call we had erm a couple of weeks ago nelly about er people being UNK with er with children like this
yes
a and being threatened
so erm however
what sort of threats
erm
enough to frighten her obviously
yes
so she sitting one night er a week past monday watching her television and she had the window open a li little bit for er air and the next thing there's a boy half way through the window
so of course then she UNK
so anyway she decided she was going out UNK to live with this friend of hers
so sa well do sorry just don't le don't leave the boy half way through the window what happened
she just frightened him off and he ran away sort of thing
yeah
okay
right off
ha
however so erm she asked me if i'd go up and give her hand to sort things out so i was up on the friday morning and i said well you better phone the corporation and tell them that you're moving out on saturday morning
so she's phoned and i says ask them if they're coming to board up the windows which were UNK when she went in
mhm
so erm she phoned
she got a new house in UNK no problem
no she got a friend there
oh right
okay
so er she phoned the corporation and she asked the man to say she was leaving on the saturday morning and were they were they gonna come and er ba er what wi er bar up the windows
mhm
and their well their UNK says are they broken
she said no
well nothing we can do
but the point is david they are broken now
so they've had to get men in to board the windows up then if somebody else gets the house they've got to get these men to come and take the boards down again then they UNK has to put the window in
this to me is a waste of money
well but i mean we've identified a problem even if someone was living there nelly th er the person was being UNK by children and was having her house broken into
so
yes
sa so what are you saying that the council should have been straight round to board it up
no
because she's moved now and she doesn't care fo what happens now
and the police can do nothing david because their hands are tied for a simple reason if you name a name which i don't know any erm they gang up on you
now a as i say i was up on there on friday and erm
is this er we UNK drive you say
no UNK park
UNK park i beg your pardon
i was up and i went to the shops and i came and there's a wee boy which used to live in the flats and he says hello nelly
he says can you give my friend a cigarette
i said i've told you already son i've stopped smoking
and the lad he was pointing to had a sling on his arm then there was a bigger boy and i said i'm sorry son
so anyway i went to open the outside door
how old were these children nelly
sorry to in keep UNK
we well the wee boy i think maybe about seven the other one may be about ten and the other one be about fifteen
and as i say the middle one had a sling on his arm so as i was opening the outside door one of them says well if you've not got cigarettes you better give me a UNK or i'll UNK you
and i turned right round and i says the boy with the sling said it wasn't me i says to the big one i said do you want your legs in plaster
and he took off
but this is what the people are going through david
but as i said apart from this hassle you've got to sort it out yourself cos the police can do nothing
but the corporation i think is wasting more money boarding up these windows and then when people take them over again
do you think that's do you think that's what you've experienced there do you think that's UNK or do you think that's a fairly good example of life in that part of UNK
i it's well it's all over
but the point is if you tell them you're leaving why don't they come and board the windows up and save all this money
but why don't why don't why don't
there's still gonna be the ha there's still always gonna be the hassle
it's pretty it's pretty bad that a seven year old if he was seven is
yes
is allowed to run round UNK with all due respect
yes
to you elderly
yes
people
yes
yes
UNK elderly people
david i was
what
they won't UNK
what
ah what
sorry
th i won't they won't UNK me
well not again perhaps but
no
they certainly had a try to
but i mean th i won i won
yes aha david
and exactly
i wonder what his parents thought
alright
he was doing
exactly
you see i well you better give me ten pound or i'll UNK you
yep
and of course but the point is if you'd a been an UNK and older person like myself seventy two which is was frightened and maybe i'd even give them two pound three pound but what
that's it
for nothing
for nothing
that's right
and whe and when sta
i mean if and if i said we'll have if i have the policemen down and they say they can there nothing they can do because we don't know their names
ah
and even if you may name them there'd be a gang on you
okay
and those were all UNK with mud and eggs and everything
okay
thanks very much indeed for your call nelly
i wonder what other people make of that if er if other people have had similar experiences
if other people have had other experiences if they share erm er UNK er belief there that there is nothing that can be done about it 's the number to dial and we'll have some more calls in a moment
you're listening to dial david UNK on max a m
i must say that i find er calls like the one there from nelly particularly shocking and can't help wondering how widespread er this is er across the area
th the thought of elderly people having their er later years UNK by er young UNK like that some of aged apparently only seven
i wonder if that's er the exception rather than the rule
anyway if you want to chip in on that
mr from edinburgh next
good morning
hello mr
mr
i beg your pardon
mr
er just i've been a UNK supporter for forty four years now following them and er i don't think i do nay fancy a move out to ingleston
and they keep saying that surely that would suit everybody
i don't even know hearts fans that would like to go out there
but something's gonna have to be done though isn't it mr
ha aye
okay but UNK not the answer
UNK would suit me if er there's got to be a move
UNK would suit me
like the other gentleman that was UNK er if it cannae be where it is now then UNK for me would be the best option
do but it isn't it a nonsense to embark on two twenty million pound UNK when with a bit of thought and effort you could probably get away with one
well no i think er it's a nonsense for the you to keep pushing this er ingleston one
it's not me it's the council that's doing it
aha
but it's a yo it's not the council that's er putting out to the people on the radio it's yourself
right
okay
thanks for that
jean from er UNK good morning
good morning
it's about the home help
mm
er i agree with them that the elderly do have a bad deal but if e if somebody's got to take money off well surely sho the government should be taking a cut ten to twenty percent off of their UNK wages
they keep on getting extra wages every year for doing nothing
put the government on performance related pay
exactly
yes
because i mean the elderly have got little enough okay there is extra benefit but they don't want people to know how poor they are
i work amongst the elderly and i do know that they are very shy about telling people just how poor they are
so surely if the government er have can't have the money they cut their own throat
okay
but i mean do to be more realistic i mean o if obviously if all the government took a fifty percent pay cut it still wouldn't make a great deal of difference
if benefits are going to be squeezed i is there a is there a UNK way of doing it or is it going to cause suffering whatever happens
well i think cu er cause suffering whatever it happens but surely why i mean the elderly had to suffer through the wars so why should they have to suffer again now
i mean the young ones a lot of them sitting around in edinburgh and begging off the streets and that they could get off their UNK and get a job
and er let's face it there is jobs going if they're wanting them
okay they're poor paid but at least they would have the pride of saying that they've got a job whereas the elderly are having to just sit at home and turning down their fires and turning down their central heating in case they can't afford their bills
but i mean were led to believe that some of the people that you see sitting on the streets of edinburgh begging are actually making a good living out of it
yes
definitely they're making far better living but they're also getting all their benefits they're getting er fringe benefits off the government
mm
so i mean er it's the proof old folks that get it they got it in the war time they had to UNK in war time to feed their children
i mean i er personally i mean my father was killed ten weeks after the war started
my mother had four children she had bring up without anything for the first two years how the hell she managed it i don't know
right
but now tha they're UNK them because they're ancient
they're just they don't want them and yet they're keeping them living longer
they keep on getting them drugs to keep them going longer so why
i mean they can't have it all ways
okay
thanks for that
mr from UNK good morning
good morning david
it's about this scottish homes UNK
mhm
while i UNK with the caller from west UNK i feel we pay poll tax as well to cover all these things but when i bought my house my solicitor had me in for two hours and went through all my obligations under the title deeds part of was that i had to pay one three UNK of keeping the open areas clean and tidy plus grass cutting
is it is that because the th the house you live UNK got a lot of green space round it
mine has none around it that belong ah doesn't belong to it belongs to scottish homes
right
but there are parts in the estate which are maintained by district council district council and are paid by scottish homes
right
and you ar it is part of your obligations when you take the house on
and i feel that many solicitors do not do their job they do not explain fully to the purchaser what they are taking on
right
so yo so you're saying that it should have been explained to the man from west UNK that that's the sort of er level of charges he'd had to pay and if he didn't want to pay it he should have taken a different house
yes
i mean i de i do i agree with what i don't agree scottish homes charging this at all
mhm
but it's there in your title deeds
therefore i know it's in my title deeds and i would assume it's in his title deeds
right
and i mean i fully UNK with the gentleman but i feel his lawyer should explain this to him and also i feel why should he pay such a UNK rate of poll tax and have to pay again for grass cut and street swept
cos that's exactly what it is
okay
thank you very much indeed for that
mrs from edinburgh good morning
er good morning mr UNK
i'm on about the same subject
i stay in the UNK district and i'm in a multi storey flat i bought my house three year ago
now when i started to ba er buy my house we are paying we were paying twenty seven pound a month for the UNK of the building it's now went up to thirty four pound twenty two pence a month
it's UNK
and wha so sorry who have bought your flat from
is that
oh sorry dear
the co edinburgh corporation
edinburgh district council right
yes
er now we are paying thirty four pound twenty two pence a month for the UNK of this building that as far as i know there's twelve tenants in this block has bought their house
now when i moved in here twenty five years ago it was a very nice block
it really was
it's deteriorated and deteriorated something terrible
how many flats are in it altogether do you think
there's er there's nine it's a nine storey building
right
and er we're paying and every time the corporation rents go up what we pay a month also goes up
now as i say it started off with twenty nine pound and it's now up to thirty four pound
so what do you get for the thirty four pounds
the lift
well this is the thing we have a UNK but er fo for his services but i've been at the council and i have got nowhere i have from the corporation there's an awful lot of people complaining but they'll do nothing about it
that
complaining about what
the state the UNK in
right
i mean i have done a lot about it and i'm the only one that has as i say got my mouth going and done something about it
but nobody will back me up
sa so what are you getting
yo you you're getting a UNK
that's all the time that
a door entry system a lift
well we've got the lift yes
but i mean when you think of the amount of people in this block that's bought their house and the state that the UNK in i mean i have told them in the corporation that a UNK of paint would UNK do it any harm
mm
because it is it's deteriorated and deteriorated something terrible
the
yeah
building is really shocking
and i mean we were told it was a first class area but there's if anybody walked into the building just now you would UNK see it was a first class area to look at the state the UNK in
i mean you know when you think of what you're paying as a the other gentleman was saying we are paying the thirty four pound twenty two pence a month then you've also got your poll tax above that and then your mortgage as well
mm
a and so to me i think for what we're paying we should be getting some service and we are not getting it
this is where i am so annoyed
but er i wish some of the other tenants in this block would back me up and do something about it but nobody will
they're all saying and they're all talking but i'm the only one i have been at the council i have been at the councillor i have been at UNK place but nobody will back me up at all
and i think for what we're paying we should be having a wee bit er the UNK the building should be a looking a wee bit more respectable and UNK to what it is
okay
thanks very much indeed for that
mrs from edinburgh good morning
good morning mr UNK
it's actually about where the squeeze should be taking place
mm
it really UNK me when people get on and do the young people down
there are not an awful lot of jobs going about get that straight to the people that you know
now the squeeze should be from the tax at the very top
all these conservatives sit at their conference saying what they're going to do to the unemployed and the fraud and what have you
we had a business man on question time who was saying that five hundred million pound fraud going on in the benefits right
mhm
but he said that is a UNK compared to the tax UNK at the top that's it's UNK
now i really do feel people i i'm amazed at the working class people
they don't stick together
they should see this and they should be pushing it and saying you get your house in order before tackle the young people
i know the fraud goes on and it's wrong but i can understand it in some cases
what because you see th people a at the at the bottom end of society see people at the top end UNK in tax UNK schemes and things like that and off
yes
shore bank accounts and think well if they can get away with it why can't we
yes
well a i didn't say anyone should get away with fraud
no that's wha no i see that
but
you know but i do i can understand if you've got desperate people will try anything especially for the young families
the there's
now i'm a pensioner and i think it's a scandal what we get for a pension after all the years that you fight for you put away for your old age and before you know it you've nothing
and then you become dependant on the state and you have these tory as UNK as you like
white UNK
i mean their morality
they have their own morality i think we all know that
but the morality a and to go on about christianity and again tha i feel ashamed sometimes when i think of myself you know a christian that's not christianity
they i mean th er they're caring and sharing and theirs is UNK and gaining
okay
thank you very much indeed for that
alfie from edinburgh good morning
er good morning yeah
i'd like to talk about er UNK and er i just cannae let him get away with this er in my opinion he's a two faced UNK
he's er he's saying that er the shifting of the UNK political but i'd to remember him that er th it's the council that's doing their job he's not doing his job
they're there to pe to protect our land and that's what they're doing
right
and also he's got a short memory when talks about political things like that
does he not remember when he brought john major to UNK
right
does he not realise that most er hearts fans and i'm a hearts fan are not tories he is but most of the fans are not
right
so er he's got a very short memory
he does nay he does nay think he does nay think before he speaks
so sa so what did what did you make of what he was saying today it's either UNK or he's gonna upgrade UNK
erm no er i'd li i'd like to see er him getting er shifting yeah to a different place but er he's gotta remember the greenbelt comes first
so i hope he's listening
so you'd say that you would want to go to ingleston
er yes i'd i think i would go along with that yeah
yeah
but you think the council should protect the greenbelt from both the development proposals of UNK and hearts
yeah and er certainly
yeah that's what they're there for they're doing their job it's him that's not doing his job
okay
thanks very much indeed for that
mr from UNK good morning
hello
yeah i'd like to speak about the squeeze on the benefits
mhm
er why can't they just look at er do a means test for child benefit
er if those that were earning over a certain amount who certainly don't need this child benefit to same the degree anyway that's those of at the lower end of the pay scale we could they could certainly save a lot of money and they wouldn't have to do the squeeze down on the ones that would have the most
i mean child benefit if erm is a very emotional issue isn't it
and people say it's sometimes the only er money tha that a mother wo gets that she can call her own and use in the way that she wants to
yeah that's possibly true but
and they say you know ev even in apparently wealthy families er you know because the way the money's divided up at the end of the week or the end of the month or whatever that the no the child benefit money's all the woman gets
well th the money's for the child's benefit in the first place
er in double income families certainly in double income families surely the wife's gonna have more control over the money that she UNK and the money that she can use
okay
but i mean er you can see the you can see the point of that and presumably yes there must be lots of very wealthy people who er just get the child benefit and hardly notice it but at the same time couldn't we means test the old age pension
cos presumably there must be an awful lot of wealthy old age pensioners about as well who could do with a bit less er from the state because they've got plenty of their own er and give a bit more to people who don't
well i think that's that is also a possibility
i think every all the benefits should definitely be means tested i know that most of them are to a degree
erm but there comes a point where th the government the line that the government draws for means UNK always very low
whe why to take the UNK out of the issue they could put the line higher up on the earning scale or higher up on the sa the receiving scale for the older ones who have so possibly stopped working
now i know that these people have worked all their life to get their money and their saving savings and things like that but if they're able to manage on wha with less benefit from the government surely they shouldn't have to watch other people who struggling and in dire needs because of that
okay
thank you very much indeed for that
wonder what people make of that
means test all benefits
old age pension family allowance and things like that just to make sure that those that need get a bit extra
you're listening to dial david UNK 's the number to dial
mrs from UNK good morning
good morning mrs UNK
it's about an article by UNK in the evening news
i don't know if you've read it
it's about the new council tax stating that erm people will UNK will not be receive any UNK of the value of their house and of which various bands are just placed
apparently if
are you sure about that
yes
it's a i'm UNK it in it was in the edinburgh evening news october the second
right
i've got the cutting here
mhm
this also states that under the government rules and the lothian regional council can only publish the list in public libraries
and the this will appear by the end of november and people will only have after this first council tax demands in march they've got to appeal if they think they're in the wrong band
now what i would like mr UNK and the rest of the scottish m p's is to bring up in parliament a scotland will have to be UNK every five years as done in the past where england have only been UNK every seventeen years which i think is most unfair
i find it find it hard to believe that you're not gonna be told th the valuation of your house in as
well it
in a in as much as er you know UNK an arbitrary and presumably there must be some right of appeal against the decision taken by the district UNK or whoever carries out the valuation of the house
yeah
i've got the cutting here
right
and it says you can only appeal it will appear in november that's when it's going to be er put into the library
mhm
and any appeals against valuation have to be made soon after the first council tax demands are received at the end of march
right
mr said i advise people to check in case there has been a mistake
they
right
should be told the evaluation personally and given a chance to appeal if they feel it is too high
okay
thanks very much for bringing that to our attention
mr from UNK good morning
good morning
er i just wanted to talk about the cuts er proposed cuts in pensions
yeah
mhm
erm i would go further than erm performance related pay for the cabinet and so on and i would actually put them all on income support erm and see how they could cope
or er or on the dole er level of er of money
erm because i don't think these people er appreciate er what it is to have to count every penny
erm and i didn't get any indication from the tory conference watching it that er that they had any more idea
of course there was that er world in action programme a couple of years ago wasn't there when the tory mp from newcastle i think it was went on the on the dole for two or three week but i
yeah
mean presumably it's quite easy for the first two or three weeks it's after a couple of months that er life gets more difficult
well absolutely
i mean i'd like to see erm i'd like to see how they would like it
that could be the first cut in my opinion
they're on seventy and eighty thousand er a year
er the economic situation is entirely their fault er not that i'm saying that the labour would do any better but erm i'd like to see a bit more er a bit more opposition from the er from the labour party and er not so much direct action but saying you know things do not have to be like this
there do not have to be any homeless people
er and it's er UNK er that there are
erm but er it's quite wrong that pensioners and er the poorest should have to take cuts again erm when there's people on such high salaries
okay
thanks very much er for you call
hilary from edinburgh good morning
hello
i'd just like to disagree with the gentleman that said that er the child benefit should be mean tested for us
aha
but i think it is for your children but erm i've i worked er before i had the children and
listen i tell you i tell you what mrs it's an awfully bad line
put the phone down we'll call you back in just a second because i we can't really make out what you're saying
sorry about that
we'll come back to you in a second
er jim from shots hello
yeah
good morning again david
er can i ask UNK if he's still listening to the programme if he was considered the environment in his plans for the football UNK
er ingleston seems to be the only feasible er site where the wi could be a proposed er rapid rail transit system in operation
you know i'm like the others
yo
i'm like
you like trains don't you
well i do like trains but it's not just a case of liking trains okay yes i like i like trains i like i mean i'm old enough to remember the steam trains it's not just a case of that
i read in the papers last week UNK the UNK is used in UNK petrol
mm
they have found UNK high levels of UNK in glasgow edinburgh and other places and this UNK apparently it can cause cancer
now you take your choice it's either UNK in UNK petrol or lead in UNK petrol
also in today's er scotland on sunday gathered they found it not just edinburgh but britain as whole i think
they found there are higher levels of carbon monoxide carbon monoxide pollution from vehicle UNK has increased by forty two percent
right
over the last ten years
the i mean how long have to be have we to er and i'm UNK with edinburgh that nobody has phoned in on this sort of point
er i they don't seem to ca er do the edinburgh people not care about their environment or
well especially after that survey last year
yeah
tha that showed er UNK
yes
high
yes
levels of er of er
mm
poisonous UNK in various parts of the city
mhm
okay
than thanks for that
tom from edinburgh good morning
good morning david
i didn't intend to come on but i think it's one of the best er sunday mornings i've had in years
er with three ladies and a gentleman come and support the pensioner i mean this is really great
it gives me a the energy to go on and er fight all the harder
now regarding the means testing of the pensioners the means testing with pensioners is UNK for any government
they've got ten million pensioner and yet about two million of them are quite well off
mhm
and er i can assure you if they started means testing pensioners they would any government would go out on their ear
er and by
the way
but i mean surely i if there's not enough to go round then those that need it most should get most
there is enough to go round
we're still one of the UNK countries in the world and a we and er the people they ha there's the wealth is only about er ten percent of the people on and about eighty percent of the wealth
right
but it's unlikely that the conservative party is likely going to embark on a major distribution of wealth programme between now and the next election
yeah
and you know the UNK one that's pressing presumably because
of course it is
because they're running short of cash
well they better start with perhaps the rich
and er by the way pensions are er are taxed
you get all these pensions taxed
and there's loads of people just over er getting a pension and getting a two pensions and tha they're paying tax as well
so your UNK taxed
so that's er really a way of means testing it er more UNK
okay
thanks for that
jim from edinburgh good morning
aye i'd like to speak on this er UNK proposal to sa you know screw down the people on benefit
this present government and it's predecessor has attacked the social security ee system UNK already
th er industrial injuries UNK been virtually abolished er ee along with such things as the reduced earnings allowance
and there's been UNK on housing benefit we've had the withdrawal of the right of students to claim income support and housing benefit and unemployment benefit during UNK time
erm to think that those who are dependant on benefit from public funds are gonna be expected to suffer still more is as i said wholly UNK
bu but i mean what alternative is there if there's not enough money meet the benefit bill
well i mean who says that there isn't enough money to meet the benefit bill
i mean i know the government say that but think of the money that we er must be saving now on our UNK bill
we with the you know UNK and the collapse of the u s r and we'll be saving a fortune now on UNK so surely that could be
but well i don't i don't
UNK back
well i don't think we are though because i mean
well we
we've just we've just ordered the forth UNK er the forth UNK as the er you know the UNK down of the UNK yet to take to effect
presumably they're still you know flying around and all the rest of it
yeah but ne you know nuclear weapons and so forth surely those have been scaled down
we're told that erm you know the ma the massive redundancies in places like
UNK is due to erm you know those resolutions
defence cut backs
yeah
between ea between east and west
so the money and a lot of money must be getting saved ee somewhere so i don't see any reason why that couldn't be UNK back into the th the benefit system
i mean again it's UNK
mm
to say only state retirement pensions payable on an earnings related basis
after all people have contributed to these pensions during their working lives and in order to qualify for a full pension you need to have paid into it for over forty years
are you is someone gonna pay into a insurance scheme for forty years and then suddenly be told well you don't qualify
i mean that's a classic case of changing the rules after the UNK started
right
okay thanks for that jim
er mi mrs back again hopefully on a better line this time
hello mrs
hello
yes it is
er it's just i feel that i've worked all my days and did without and er had put savings away and things like that so that when i stopped working to have children i would have money but if you were means tested and the money is for the children as well anyway and the people who you know i don't mean that all people a lot of people who are supposedly not having money and getting all these things they sell them and things like that
and i mean all people do that but why is it when you've worked you always seem to get UNK
if you're in a UNK sort of wage you always get UNK for everything and you don't seem to get any kind of
but i mean that would just be an argument about where they set the level that you no longer were to qualify for child benefit but i mean bu you know UNK presumably er th the point the man was making that er the child benefit goes equally
aha
to the poorest in society and the UNK
yes
in society
i mean
aha
you know presumably the erm UNK of york UNK for child benefit
aha
if she ever has time to pop down the post office to get it
yeah
i've yeah i know but it's just some days you i know i see what you mean talking about that but at the end it is for your children anyway cos you know that money should be for your children and if you have worked and you put the money away for them anyway you've paid your taxes and things
right
a and we it well that takes us back to er to what i think either er tom or jim was saying there that you know if you're paying into something yo you expect to er to get out of it when and if you need it
well you do
you know and i mean we work you know it's like er i mean i have to pay full poll tax and all these type of things too even though my husband's on a sort of very er basic sort of wage and i pay all these things you know
okay
thanks very much indeed for you call
donald from UNK good morning
good morning
er i've just UNK up sorry
erm just something that came into my head e er cos the alarm switched on with your programme and it was a gentleman talking about the different taxes and what have you
mhm
and i thought come into my head it's probably complete rubbish but it seems logical at the time which was if you got rid of er a lot of the various taxes that they paid and put everything on to vat apart from the fact that you'd be a few just by UNK the rate of vat they would collect the extra monies you'd save a lot of the money you'd pay in administration costs by all the various different departments er
and there's the more money you had the more things you would buy so the more vat you'd pay
that's right
so i mean
but the only trouble
everybody pays vat because you're you pay for the things that you buy
i mean they always get the money through
but th the only trouble the only trouble with that is it might knock the rate of vat and u up an awful lot and the people who only buy very little will be able to even less
but the thing is who at the moment you're paying right er you pa you get your money off your employers you pay your tax you go out and buy your things and pay your taxes on whatever you buy
mhm
oh yes
i see the
whether it's services or goods
theory behind it
then when you've finished with it you're paying again yo to the community tax as it's going to be or whatever
okay
er to get them to take the stuff away
okay
listen thanks for your call
we're right out of time
er thanks to everyone who's called the programme
what a horrible thought
fancy turning on your alarm clock an being UNK up by me UNK on
have a very pleasant sunday
er could you tell me where you were born
i was born in er right in the centre street
and when exactly was that
ah ha august nineteen twenty four a long time ago
and er talking a little bit about your family w what did your father do for a living
er ex UNK sergeant major spent his life in the army
whole life in the army forty years
been every thing
UNK war UNK great war UNK and er air finished up an air warden in the last war
and he was retired when you were born
retired
yeah
and so how did you er how did you manage how did the family
well he had a pension
oh right
pretty good in those days two pounds a week which helped things out and er although we had a big family of eleven of us including mum and dad er UNK contributions from them where well whatever they could make a shilling here and a shilling there
but er they grew up and since i'm the youngest obviously they were earning a little bit of money in some way
and did your father have any jobs at all when he was retired though
the jobs they had
what your father had
oh yes father had jobs besides the army when he finished yes
yes
very up with the county courts with being a UNK ex UNK
so he got the UNK job going around which was very necessary in those days
and i've got to laugh it
anyway he only collected all these things till they got sufficient to UNK them off
yeah
and then they'd have a big UNK for a few pounds where dad used to do the UNK and since he was a sergeant major one could hear his voice
if he said five shillings he meant five shillings and not four and sixpence
his best
times for UNK though was er when shops went bankrupt er especially chocolate shops cos then we had a good time after he'd done because we usually got loads of chocolate which was a luxury
erm how many brothers and sisters did you have
i have er six brothers and two sisters
now talking about your school life erm how old were you when you started school
i'd think four and a half
and th what school was it your first school
you went to
it was a school just at the top of the street school
and what was your first memory of going to school
what did you
what about the teachers for example
oh the teachers were very good they usually UNK you with a big UNK or something if it was the right time of the year which it usually was
right time of the year yes with a big UNK
sometimes they did things to you though it was either that or you were frightened to death i'm not quite sure which
yeah
but you never managed to stay there the first day
not for long
er did you stay at the same school
stayed there er until the education people obviously decided that the junior schools erm infants schools sorry er were going to move in into another area and so i moved up to lane school which was possibly half a mile from my home
and there i stayed until the age of nine probably about nine
and do you have any sort of particular memories about that
about the school that time
and you see doing th er that er junior the junior school in the earlier junior school we were at the church as well which was on the next street st john's church at mansfield
and so me brother and i who was a twin were put into the choir as UNK like today's police force and after twelve months we'd passed all the necessary tests for the vicar and became UNK with the choir and graduated through it
lots of good times with the church and the sunday school
UNK in fact the choir UNK itself that much we were invited to join many others to crystal palace which well known place at that time and er it was quite exciting
didn't start the journey very good like on the train trapped me finger in the door
got a threat from the vicar you're going back home
anyway off we got to london and er first day at the southern hotel
i assume that what it was and then the next day we all gathered at crystal palace UNK ready for their royal UNK to er listen to everybody
there was probably about n a hundred UNK there
and how old were you then
ten i think might o ten year old
seeing london for the first time not very impressed i liked crystal palace but tt
well we enjoyed that outing er we had tea on the roof which was all glass never seen anything like it before and i shan't see it again since it got burnt down anyway
but it's a good memory
and then we stayed a few days in london and we went to the baths and we went to the UNK and we went to all the science by either the old trams or the first of the buses that cos they complete with tram riding and that was rather exciting in london seeing the all the top hats and people in coats tails and things
very nice
got back safe an safe and sound tt was able to tell them all school about too which really must have been an education for those since nobody had left the town very far anyway
except for perhaps a half day UNK to UNK which costs one and threepence and if you'd missed the train they had another one ready for you not like british rail today UNK
er how much did it cost to go to london then
it must have cost a lot of money to go for that amount of time
i believe it was three and sixpence at least for children and about five shilling for adults return
and that started
at mansfield which had two stations then great central and the old london midland scottish which was one of my UNK anyway engines were er they were to me
i spent hours watching those
what train spotting
not exactly since i had a paper round which involved UNK on the station
so they were there for me to see as they came in etc
i even managed to UNK a ride on the engine changing at one end to the other just going out round and coming back on then
he'd say come on UNK enjoy yourself
now er just er coming back to er your lane school erm what about the school UNK y
oh yes the interesting part there in those days was that the majority of the children were in the same boat we were all poor and er m the town council had got this UNK ring at mansfield roller UNK ring near the gas works where they provided a school meal for all the children that could there during the hour lunch
so it was er UNK for three quarters of a mile nearly for your dinner and UNK back and i guess time you'd done it you'd have worn it off anyway
but still it was er one way of getting a good meal everyday
and of course the same thing applied with clothes and shoes they always UNK the UNK and if your shoes had holes in or anything then once in a while there were new ones came in and y you were fitted out
but where that exactly came from i don't know the money i don't know poor charity possibly
i don't really know but er they managed to keep us looking nice and clean and tidy er because one respected teachers and UNK which well i don't think i've ever changed anyway but today they don't
they miss out today
and er where did you go to after lane school
what school did you go to then
yes well UNK to the fact that we moved home from street to road in which was roughly just under a mile from town meant a change of school then
so having settled on road moved to lane which was the nearest school still in the UNK but by then our age would be nearly eleven time to move onto a bigger school
and what school did you go to
and then at that time they'd just opened
and so
have you got any
we were able to move into school which was fantastic as a school being new with UNK and different classes for every subject really enjoyed that
big UNK
w wh
enjoyed that too
what subjects did you enjoy most
art liked art very much reading still a good hobby of mine er arithmetic fairly good stood in good UNK to this day that one don't even need a what do you call it tape recorder but i have one
and a calculator i have one of those but i still do most of it from me head that's the old way
i'm amazed that people can't read and write today but it's true
we had good education and we had good teachers
strict straight to the point the work went on the UNK you were given so long to do it close your book and if you didn't do it you never saw the teacher but you felt his cane on your UNK and he knew you weren't doing your work so you did it
it didn't take you long to learn that
er but if you did your work they were very fair probably ten minutes before time they would say er UNK you can go now
so you had ten UNK free time a type of reward if you like for paying attention and getting on with it
i can't say i was UNK good in the class but neither was i bad pretty average between one and ten and usually got a decent report
now er you mentioned earlier about er about a doing a paper round when you were still at school did you have any other
oh yes
jobs
as i said earlier yes i worked at w
h
smith on the station well that involved a paper round starting round about six o'clock in the morning
well half UNK normally cos because you had to make your own round up mark the papers and then say six o'clock and it lasted possibly three hours you just in time for you to get to school for probably ten past nine
and one was allowed ten minutes UNK because you had that type of job
the pay for that was sixpence a day very good money really
but on a saturday i had another paper round from the same people which involved travelling from to the UNK on road which is probably two and a half mile with a cycle advertising UNK with the carriers on
and from there to which was another two mile all over the estates towards er to all the big houses and then back round again which took s from six o'clock till you'd probably get back about half past ten
and then er that was that till saturday evening especially in the winter then you went back again for the evening rounds
but you had the job of selling the football posts and news the local papers
so you UNK you used to meet the trains that came in you see
and running up and down the platform shouting football post
post
and you did pretty well because you got a penny for every UNK worth you sold
plus cigarette cards if they'd got them in their pockets
whoever tells
you they were bad old days they never were they were good
now did you have any other jobs besides a paper round when you were still at school
tt oh yes on a saturday
yes after the morning paper it was down to the local market er one hour with the butcher a butcher UNK named welsh two stall he had
they were all on the market at mansfield
you'd spend one hour UNK all his big bones they he'd already took the joints off and your job was to bone it right to the bone which he sold separately and today you would call UNK beef
that's what you'd call it
when you'd done with that went across to another UNK that came at nine o'clock selling clothes used to put his lines up on his stall he had lines across his stall and for that you got tuppence or threepence depending on his mood and by then it would be ten o'clock so you'd go to one or two more and collect them UNK up and fetch them tea
the market traders
and ac actually they got to know you
so by the end of the day UNK probably earned three shillings on the local market
tt
you had to eat yourself of course so there was a s you'd run up to the hotel in called the hotel and opposite was a family butcher and he used to sell dripping and bread
his own port dripping
and for a penny you could have a thick slice of bread about one and a half inches loaded with dripping so that was your meal at lunchtime before you UNK back to do other jobs
personally i'm speaking for meself not everybody could have had the jobs
that's the way it is UNK
cos the object of the game was that the end of the day on a saturday which of the brothers could earn the most to bring home to mum
and so usually at the end of the day you reversed your procedure and went back to the stalls and took the lines down and cleared up for the butchers and what have you and then you usually got some meat or perhaps some vegetables and various things
so you went home with enough food etc between you to provide the meal for sunday and monday
and UNK enough it worked
so saturday evening was back to the papers and then back home usually about seven mostly walking because you couldn't afford the penny for the tram no ha'penny fares just a penny w
sunday morning up bright and early for sunday in those days seven o'clock out for a walk and then down to the church for choir
sunday afternoon remembering in between this you had a mile home again for sunday dinner and back again in the afternoon for sunday school
and back for sunday tea which was very little usually bread and jam but er sometimes a little bit of fruit tin of fruit rather a luxury you know
and then back for the evening service
so you your end of sunday came about half past eight when the church closed down cos services didn't start too early in those days at six thirty i think
tt
and the vicar was the reverend k g he was there all the while
the choir and all about it and the church i rather enjoyed because as i were growing up most of the p people that came were the business people and the people that were UNK towards that area st john's
and so as i grew up er they knew me and i knew them and i was to need one or two later on for various reasons but er you couldn't see it at the time
right
well perhaps we could move on
h er to you know from your school days
how old were you when you left school by the way
well i was er the school days from were from er eleven to fourteen and er tt of course during that time we had the opportunity to try and pass for grammar
it's a very stiff exam i must admit when i look back on it and we all had a day off to go to the at or the grammar school sit this exam er and since i never heard anything i'm assuming i failed
but still
and at
no loss
and i suppose they wouldn't have liked it if i'd had to stay till i was sixteen cos th the money was needed to come in so i don't suppose they would have liked it
perhaps i wouldn't too i don't really know
er so when you left school how did you go about looking for a job
well that wasn't difficult you had to be rather UNK you see and push your way through because although you knew there was a job going somewhere you weren't on your own and there's a lot more after it
so it was it was up to mum to make you nice and tidy and smart like they always used to look after you and send you down and say don't come back without it
and so off i went then and me first job was at the UNK works but just at the shop delivering as a delivery boy
tt twelve and six a week plus commission
and what did
you have to do for that then
pardon
what exactly did that mean did you have to do
well i it meant er monday mornings you went out you were given er an area in the town and i was given the money area as i termed it road and that
and you knocked on the doors and you UNK who you were they could hardly miss who you were since you were dressed up in this uniform showing everywhere black and red looked very smart for a little chap
hopefully it was either sympathy or UNK but still they might find you a pair of trousers or a UNK or even a tie
did everything
and so hopefully you came back at the end of the day with quite a UNK bag full on your bike or a box it was fitted in a carrier full
and that happened each day till thursday and then by then you were delivering what had come back from the monday hoping that when you delivered and collected the money of course that you might get something else tt which i weren't too bad a salesman really
but there was only two of us and the firm did not want to keep you on realizing that you could be coming up for fifteen they finished you
not because you were bad but because they didn't want to pay any more money
and that was the top and the bottom of that job
tt
during that time though i still kept contact with the market and the market traders on a saturday and a thursday if possible after i'd finished remembering the market stayed open till nine o'clock at night
in fact they had a job to close them then they didn't want to stop selling you know
so there was always room to run down there and do some work for somebody else and earn a few shillings that road
well more
s
than likely UNK but they mounted up
anyway
finished from and then had to start looking again for a job
tt
the next one was a UNK at
thriving business as a UNK
was it difficult to
get that job
well it was a matter of UNK up amongst sixty or seventy or more lads and er they managed to listen to everybody's tale and then you waited
and i was called back and they said right
you're got the job
and i started on the monday morning dad did the sandwiches since he was head UNK in the morning for the family and off he sent me down the road wasn't too bad it was all down hill early in the morning it was good for you down hill
so i was taken in and the first job i was taken by this young fella UNK big chap to me but he said come on UNK this is what you've gotta do
and i couldn't see anything at first
he said look up there and you'll see a crane he says we're going up that ladder
so being just do as your told did as i was told and up we went onto this crane overhead and the job was running up and down th er picking the boxes up whatever the UNK want the and UNK them and doing exactly what they wanted
i had two days of that with this lad and then off he went
he said right that is yours
and er
well i wasn't that nervous but er i had a go and after an hour or so i got quite confident on me own then
fun and games till the afternoon when we started to blow the UNK and that was the happy time
tap UNK flying everywhere and we were just above it with the cranes waiting to fill the big UNK
so we'd fill them and we couldn't see anyway UNK we couldn't look down and see we had to wait for the foreman shouting all the instructions move left forward or up or down
cos the UNK metal UNK you anyway no glasses or anything then
and then we had to wait while they poured them in the UNK but if the UNK failed and they were rather big they was full of air holes and they used to turn it all into a fine just l UNK of UNK metal straight back up at you and you couldn't move cos if you moved your crane then somebody would have been killed with out the UNK
so it was a matter of keeping calm collective and getting burnt
soon learnt
did you
to overcome that though an old UNK to chuck over me head and just work blind
but it worked
and i quite enjoyed that too
er did you remember any sort of accidents of where anything was dropped or anything like that with UNK metal
did i get burnt
do you remember any accidents at the
no
very fortunate
that was the amazing thing about it all went always worked well
it was the UNK that got the trouble for making a bad mould
no we had no accidents the only one i had was er when i'd been right to the top with the other crane an and it was a long shop and everyone had done with me during the morning so i UNK the crane up pulled it in towards me and set myself going down the shop put it in full speed
i knew exactly where to stop it so that i could get off and go down the ladder UNK a cup of tea or something
so i'm UNK down which i thought must have been fifty mile an hour but it was probably only about five really or ten but er put the brake on for the platform to stop no chance it just kept going
UNK away boom
it hit then end of the shop and the wheels finished up out in the park next door
with this little foreman threatening UNK and everybody running out of the way of the brickwork
didn't get the sack though
no it got repaired
just had to leave because dad says if you're not working there for eight and sixpence a week when you had to leave one job at twelve and six
mm
what kind of hours were you working for that money
and the hours were half past seven to twelve and one till half past five
yeah
and when i t when i got on a friday and paid me wages over to me mum which was natural for you to do i always got th UNK three pennies back
threepence
that's very good really
and what did you do with your spending money
it was that good you daren't do anything it so hide it
i used to hide these three pennies because er not being used to having anything for nothing when i'd got two or three UNK i'd d i'd find a little hiding place outside and this house had an outside wash house in the back and i used to hide them
of course i realize today the place i UNK them in everybody must have known where they were cos i was small and having to reach and the large ones must have seen they were there anyway but er it didn't dawn on me then
but UNK after that he made us leave and says well y there's no jobs
so you can up to the colliery and see if you can get one there
lots of friends were at UNK because they were UNK sons anyway tt and er so we went down about a job
got set on straight away
this is at colliery
no this is at colliery er which is five mile from
get set on but er
how did you manage to get thr to that distance then
walked there for a start
walked through the forest and came out right in the colliery yard
got the job and they said right
start next week
there were no bass there then no bass
and we started they gave you a UNK we had to buy a canteen to put your water in and a metal box to put your sandwiches in and then they took us down
and wh what wages were they
the wages varied on the work
th the work
at when you started
yeah well there was no guaranteed wage you see because er there was no guaranteed work
you g you could get down and just start and with the one hour the UNK would go and knock you off
but it was coming up to thirty UNK and the war breaking out so the one and a half days a week started to change to five days which gave you a w a regular wages of about thirty shillings
and er one was able to travel on the bus then at sixpence a day return which is very good
the buses are that efficient buses that if you miss one within five minutes there was another one cos most of them were UNK and that's where they were going
lots of buses lots of work
now what
never did you any harm but er lots of it
what was your first job then when you went down to the pit
well they always started the lads right at the pit bottom and in those days ev everybody was crackers down there in those days they were all mad UNK about
and when it started to wind they'd bang the coal on they'd bang the UNK off and my job was to er tt push the UNK split them split the UNK
into
so many to one row and so many to another
yeah
couple them up send them off
but being me i couldn't stand that very long may be two or three months and i asked to be moved
and which was termed going down the roads
er because the pit bottom was lit up and it meant going down into the dark an exciting thought for a young fella er and so off i went and i was put down on one of the faces as a lad and said right lad you want to be UNK
we'll show you
you start with him at that gate end and he'll show you how to go on that UNK there
and your job to clean the bells keep them clear while he's UNK his coal out and that and you'll be alright
well i started a clear er the chap came and showed me he says you're alright lad he said this is how you do it ten UNK and it was clear
i thought oh that's not bad at all
so i bent down to clear it and gradually it UNK up me legs to me knees what's the matter lad
i can't keep cope with this
he says i'll show you give me the shovel
again there you are
well ten minutes later it was still up to me knees i said i can't keep this up and he shouted something down to somebody else who shouted to somebody else put your UNK back lads
and apparently these other lads further down to the tune of about a hundred and fifty yards had all lifted the boards up on the belt and so all their UNK and that was coming to me
and since it was the end of the belt i couldn't get i go by anybody with me i had to move it
tt so i chucked the shovel down and UNK out off the face and sat in there and cried and cried and cried
UNK and everything else but the comfort of the UNK that was training me he said come on lad you'll be alright
and he was right i was i UNK it
i'd learnt me lesson with the others they didn't work it on me again like that
so i stayed with him for quite while until i was able to tackle my own half a UNK not a full UNK which was nine yards
four and a half yards which you could tackle as a lad and then they er paid you for what you did
which was interesting at that time since it came out of a tin and not out of an office
er the UNK paid you see out of his tin what he thought fit and he gave me ten shillings for the first one i done first day i done and i told me dad when i got home he says ten shillings
what have you been doing and i explained
and he said right i'll come with you
next friday when you go to get your money cos i wasn't always with the UNK mostly i was on the day work
they were supposed to be doing me a favour giving me that work four and a half yards
but anyway he came up on the monday er sorry on the friday when they was paying out he said which UNK paid you
i said he's down there paying those that's him
so he UNK him on the shoulder and dad being a big chap with big chest just said er s do you know my lad
he said yes i know him
he says did you pay him last week for what he did
he said i paid him
he says how much did you pay him
he said ten shillings
he said how much did you pay the others
he says what's that to you
he said look i'm his dad what did you pay the others
he said two pounds
and he says right pay him two pounds
and i mean it
well he had second thoughts and then he changed his mi he put his hand in and said there you are
unfortunately i lost me job then on the face having done that to the UNK i didn't get back four yards or whatever it was
so then i decided i would like to be that i knew there was a job going on the UNK so i thought well i'll go in for the electrical side
which involved going to evening classes and er then back to work and this involved nights regular so it was a bit a bit of a dash sleeping evening class and then catching a bus which the first one nine o'clock and to the colliery and starting
and what hours were you doing then
well they were nine till seven really six but mostly seven o'clock before you got away and it involved wiring er coal cutting machines
you worked with the electrician as his mate very interesting work
unfortunately it came to a sudden stop got too efficient at it you see and er got done too early
and where the UNK shop was wa was the stables for the horses nice friendly animals they were too
well we came in one morning the electrician and i about five instead of seven because we'd done and er we used to nip in and UNK down with the horses for ten minutes which was UNK to sleep in the colliery
so at seven o'clock we're asleep with the horses when the day shift come on couldn't find us
course one of the problems was you were checked in and checked out and if er you hadn't come out there was a bit of a panic where is the person
where is his er number like
but anyway UNK for that didn't get sack but er had to move on to other things and that meant to me decided
what
to become one of the cutting team
yeah
and w how much were you getting as an electrician then
oh it's a basic wage but it increased to about two pounds fifty or something because of the status of the job
and how long did you actually do that job for
oh it was eighteen months i should imagine i was doing quite well i'd been UNK by the head electrician and everything for further UNK till er that particular incident stopped it
and this is why i choose the UNK because it was UNK and er i was quite with it i was able to sort of get it going if it stopped one road or another
perhaps n not quite UNK but it went
come in hello

cheerio
cheerio
cheerio now
you told me that when you went to work for was the first time you came across abortion really in
yes it was yes
what was your experience there
er well whe er when i first went to i'd already lost two children and er the girls knew that i worked with the t last two children
and i became pregnant again and they were falling over themselves to do an abortion for me
i mean there were several people but m the surprising was the person in charge of the work girls you see
she offered to do one and i was shocked because we wer we wanted a baby you see we wanted the baby
they couldn't understand that
most of the husbands were in the forces and mine was at home and er any way er before i left two different women had babies and had abortions and died
one was er she'd be about thirty six the first one and er she didn't come to work one day and er the girl in the afternoon the girl c her daughter she was fifteen er she came to speak to me and she said er oh i said hello how's your mum is she poorly
she said she's dead
and she'd had an abortion the night before and she'd died that day on the monday
she'd had an abortion on the sunday and she'd died on the monday
course i di i didn't get to know much else but it was obvious you see she'd been going out with a young man her husband was in the forces and er she'd tried to get rid of it
she died
and er the same thing happened about another one
er this was very surprising as well
this person had got one son about twelve and her husband was in the forces as well
and er she was missing and one day i saw her sister in law and i said where how is she
wh is she ill or what
she says i'm afraid she's dead
she died through an a UNK abortion you see
see you couldn't go and have an a an a illegal a legal abortion in those days it was all UNK abortions
and the thing that was said a lot was a slippery elm stick well i still don't really know what it was but er it was a kind of a s bark of the slippery UNK a slippery elm bark or something and they UNK it to a point and inserted that into the womb you see and it was done and then of course i heard a lot about gin sitting in a hot bath with gin
i mean really i er it UNK me because i was extremely naive i'd had two children but i was very naive in those days
and er people was of often off for day or two i mean really nice people they weren't they weren't bad people they were really nice people but they it was nature you see
their husbands were away and they didn't know if they'd come back or not and er one girl er th this wasn't at the near where i used to live at
she became pregnant it was at the ending of the war when the war was ending you know
and er she'd tried to get rid of it and she couldn't so she found out her husband was coming home he was actually in the boat coming back and she didn't know what to do
in the end she sent him a UNK to explain you know that she was pregnant with a another man
about three days after she had er the abortion started to work and she lost the baby
he came back but he UNK her
he was ver you know he was really nice about it
he said well er you know it's just that i mean with nature being what it is you see
she wasn't a bad wife or anything like that it was just that she'd met this man at work where she worked they both worked at a dry cleaning place
and er but of course she did lose the baby
she'd been trying to get rid of it and then suddenly it worked and she lost the baby
so most of the people who were having abortions were people who were having a child by some other man
oh yeah
yes
i wonder i was wondering whether some people were having abortion because they perhaps already had too many children
well i di i didn't kno i never met anybody i in that category
er you see it was all with me it was when i at the time i went to work and er i had to leave work to have my baby you see
and it and this the one the last one was just after i left so i didn't know her i knew her to look at but i didn't know her personally
and er th they were all people whose husbands were in the forces fighting
mm
you know it was UNK terrible times
mhm
really
and as you said it seemed to be erm the norm that people assumed that if you were pregnant that you didn't want to be and therefore
yeah yes
you would be looking for an abortion so people
yeah
it doesn't sound as if people had much UNK about coming up to you and asking you
n no well see what happened to me i mean this person came and she said er if you like i'll do it for you
i said do what
she said i i'll UNK your baby for you
she said i've done lots she said
er you'll be alright you'll be safe
couldn't believe it you just couldn't believe what you was hearing you know
cos i so we so desperately wanted a baby
i mean losing two our last one a mo a month old and one at er two month old
and losing two like that i still wanted a baby
and er of course i was lucky the next time see
but i just couldn't believe that people would be willing to do that kind of thing you know
was there just one lady who used to do the abortions at er or lots of different people
oh no oh i think there was quite a few
i mean she was just in our department you see
er you see you sort of lived in one li small environment where er with us it was er a certain room
we examined these magazines for UNK we examined them to see if they were perfect
but there was big it was a huge place you know and there were a lot of women that did really heavy men's work we weren't doing men's work
we were doing what women could do anytime you know
but in the er in the big shops where women did really heavy work and really mixed with the men
there was quite a lot of it went on
you used to hear about it you know
i could never i never knew anybody personally because er you know you just used to go work and then go home and that was it
i was away from work
er you know you didn't sort of erm you didn't mix a lot you know really
everybody had their own problems and i had mine with losing two the two babies i had mine wondering if i'd lose another you see and that was my particular worry at the time
and tell me about the lady who did abortions erm did you know very much about what sort of people they were
erm
the one in particular in your department
the one in our department
erm well she was quite a very well spoken UNK person you know
but she'd got this little bit of oh i don't know a little bit of UNK about her
you know
er just that little bit th that you felt that i wasn't er you could imagine her doing it you know
i mean to me the boss of our bench there was probably twenty people on the bench to me the boss of that it wasn't what you call a particularly good job but she'd always worked at the and of course when went on war work er th those that were still there they got the better jobs you see to organize us that hadn't been worked there before
and i wouldn't i heard of a s very UNK woman er near where i used to live er i never met her but it was all hearsay how many abortions she did
you know she's er she lived in a very tiny house at
i never met her and it was just talk in the shops the corner shops were in those days were the gossip places you know
and it w not like today the supermarket every corner shop had it's own particular news of the world you know and my mother in law used to go down and she used to come up and tell me all these things about the things that were going on
she was the first to get to get to know about the lady whose husband was coming back from the forces
she was the first to get to know about that you see and she'd come round and tell me
because she lived against this woman
do you think that the ladies who did abortions did it mainly for money or wer was it sort of concern for
er maybe some i think quite a few did it for money because money was short in really
but i think a lot of them were genuinely concerned as in my case i think this person was genuinely worried about me because i'd had it was my third child and i do think she was er worried about me because er you know you don't want to keep having babies and losing them but i wasn't worried about i was worried about myself to say i wasn't worried that's stupid but er we just hoped and hoped and kept hoping
no i think sh i think she was genuinely concerned
she'd she certainly didn't want the money cos she'd got her husband was a er you know she had er money from her husband and she had good wages at the you see with her being in charge er she had quite good wages
but i you know
how much they charged for abortions you've no idea
no i haven't any idea at all about that
i never i never got too familiar to that extent you know
probably a lot of people could tell you know
i couldn't tell you that
but she said you'll be alright you'll be alright i'll do it
you know
quite erm
and how did she go about abortions do you know
well the only thing i've heard that she did was this sounds stupid slippery elm stick
i mean it sounds stupid but a person i knew she was about as stupid as i was as naive as i was because er she was pregnant her husband wasn't away but she'd got how many five four children she'd lost three children and she'd got then she had four and then she found herself pregnant again
and er half UNK she decided she ought she couldn't have any more children you know she'd i don't think it was money so much that she thought she'd got enough and somebody told her about this slippery elm well you could get a slippery elm drink you know you know these UNK foods if you've got a poor tummy that can er she bought a tin of this slippery elm drink and she drunk gallons of it and it was doing her good and she thought er she thought it wouldn't she'd gone wrong you see
it was the slippery elm bark i think that's what it was called
and the people used to UNK it to a point why the slippery elm i don't know i've often wondered about it really but his person i'm telling you about she was delivered of a good healthy boy and everything was alright
yes she's somebody i knew very well indeed
and er every time he was the boy was ill after she said that's through me taking that slippery elm that i've done it
she was very she didn't really want to get rid of the baby not really i think i think perhaps somebody had put the idea into her head you've got enough children you shouldn't have any more
but i think she was like me she didn't really want to get rid of her baby
but er he did the boy did suffer with a bit of stomach trouble in later life and she always blamed herself
but i've never really known about the slippery elm stick wh er didn't get to the bottom of it you know what it was
how did the other women feel about women who had abortions at the at
well there were one or two that was a bit got on their high horse you know and say it's disgusting and that but er i never did because er in cases like that i think there but for the grace of god you know i wouldn't condemn people in those we were living in very UNK times you see
i mean people were dying men were dying my brother died he got killed in the war pe every day you went to work and somebody would tell you so and so's died you remember so and so he's died
and we were living in very a UNK times and women were UNK at a little bit of happiness they could get you know this is what it was
but they were condemned by some people there al there's always UNK aren't there really
mm
but i wouldn't er if i hear of a girl getting pregnant er you know now it's a very common thing i know but sometimes i feel really sorry for the girls because it's tying yourself fifteen sixteen tying yourself down to children
and i so desperately wanted children
but er there were there were some pe our on the bench that we had a really cross section on the bench that i worked on there were very women one woman she'd never been to work in her life
and she liked the idea of going to work you see she'd got a family she'd be about oh she was about ten years older than i was and erm she looked out of place you know
i became a great friend of hers actually er she looked out of place on the bench
she spoke very nicely and she was a very nice person but she was a little bit er you know it's disgusting she used to say
it isn't right you know it's disgusting
but she'd got no problems her husband was at home and er her little world was okay you see
but i mean people lived in those days you know i mean you know where the is don't you
well a lot of those people lived round there and they were UNK
th they were really UNK i mean you know when i hear people talking about the good UNK and that
there was to a certain extent but some of the homes were UNK
back to back
i mean you i went to one person's house and er you went in the door in the terrace there was a room
erm that was the one room
there was a tap in the room there was just one room then one room there and one room there
mm
er where would with er would've been a front room that was another house
you see they were back to back
yes
and it was i mean i was brought up in the country and it i found it really shocking that people had to live like that you know
i mean we weren't er m my dad was a miner
we lived but we had a comfortable home and i er i thought it was a lovely home actually
somebody once said we were erm these are UNK
oh i was UNK i was very proud of my home you know i thought it my home was lovely
i i've always been that way inclined i mean my dad was er he was a miner he was a lovely dad he was lovely man
my mum my mum was the best mum ever
my daughter said i'm UNK
my middle daughter she said very UNK mum
no i said i'm not but i've never been ashamed of er of er of my parents and my background
i think you can always learn a lot from your background and your parents
ca can you tell me another thing about the abortions do you know erm if of course abortion was illegal then do you
oh yes
know if the police ever took any action particularly about these ladies who died did you hear
erm
anything
no actually i don't
i don't know
and i was never one really to ask questions i daren't ask questions i used people told me things that was it
but i think the where we lived er there was this woman that was well known for doing and she lived in a very tiny house
er i think she was in trouble with the police
er i can remember the news going around that er the police had been to visit it was actually it was the next street to where i lived
and er she was in trouble but i didn't know the outcome er you know
i think i was a little bit UNK fairy really i used to live in a world of me own i didn't i wasn't terribly interested you know
if people told me that was all well and good but if they didn't but i did hear about this erm er she did the operation on the girl who er who couldn't get rid of her baby and then it she lo she sent she sent a UNK to her husband or a letter er it took a long while to come from the far east he was in the far east
and it took a long while for the letters to get there but he knew while he was on the boat that his wife was pregnant and er when he got here she'd it'd been UNK
it was a late abortion it didn't work straight away it m probably the baby died but it didn't come away from her you see and er it was a shame but she oh she was called a very bad woman you know because her husband was fighting for his country and er you know
but er he came back and they had er they had two more children actually
cos they didn't live far from me i did know her by sight
can you tell me then another side of this problem of abortion during the war is erm the problem of contraception then erm i wonder do you think that people weren't aware of facilities for contraception then during the war
well
or wh what was happening
well i think a lot of it was erm ignorance
i mean i there was a thing i don't know if anybody's told UNK doctor UNK that you could use
i used them and they worked for me
i was very keen er when i had my daughter erm i was quite happy about it and i used them then after three years i didn't use them
but they worked for me
but you see you've got to know what you're doing you've got to really look after yourself
i mean i it's no good me husbands to look af i this is my second husband but er with my first husband er i sort of erm if it's been left to him god bless him he's dead now but if it'd been left to him i'd have had a UNK of children you know
so i had to look after myself so i had one and then i had the other one just stop at two
er but i used to tell people and they you know people near me that had a lot of children and er they'd UNK and UNK about it i heard one woman say erm she'd had quite a few children and i i'd been in hospital and i said er a certain person that'd had a baby had lost it
she said ooh she's one of the lucky ones she said i couldn't get rid of mine
and now that was the attitude that they had that er a lot of them not everybody of course that just and she had this attitude erm anybody that had lost their baby were lucky you see
and she'd i think she had about eight over a period of years you know
and think this woman that had lost her baby she said she's one of the lucky so and so's you know she lost hers i couldn't get rid of mine
she'd tried and she didn't her husband was at home he wasn't in the forces but th this was the attitude
would people go to their doctors to ask for UNK advice
oh don't think so don't think they'd dare
i daren't have done if i hadn't er oh i know once my doctor came to see me about something and there was erm a lot of people used to use er some pills oh what were they called little round pills when at the monthly periods they used to use them oh doctor UNK doctor somebody's pills now they would have the effect of er your period you would see more than you usually did
but i remember i'd got a box on my UNK erm not only was i using the UNK but i was also taking these when the period was due
and erm i mean they were quite they wouldn't they wouldn't get rid of a baby but a lot of people thought they would
i mean my doctor saw them he said what you taking these for
i said well i take them cos i have a lot i used to have an awful lot of pain every month i did and it i this used to prevent the pain
and er he said you can ask me for anything cos he was a strong catholic you see and he wouldn't he didn't believe in anything to do with birth control
erm i if you want anything to stop the pain i'll give it you
er so i said alright i'll stop taking them which i didn't anyway but a lot of people used to took them but some used to take er when it when the periods were due they'd take about half a box i mean instead of taking two er two one day and two the next they'd take about half a box
well i think you know they could've killed themselves taking all that now i forget what they were called
they were black round like little tiny erm UNK you know little black thing just can't remember the name of them now
they were very well known
you used to buy them from the chemist
yes so you was there any difficulty or embarrassment about getting these things for the UNK and the pills from the chemist
well i was never embarrassed at getting the UNK i used to and ask for them
and i never found any embarrassment there because there was i always saw the UNK woman you could always see a woman chemist
i always saw the woman and there was she knew me and er there was no problem
also the er the erm these doctor something pills er she advised me to take them because of these pains i had and er but a lot of people thought they UNK work wonders you know
that if there's any baby there it'll get rid of it but i don't think it ever would
i don't think it was strong enough for anything like that
mm
i hear that there was a er family planning clinic in the
mm
thirties erm but i don't know a lot about it
i wondered if you ever heard of such a thing
well not in the thirties of course but after the war there was one because i er ah well this no this was much later much because i married my second husband and erm i had two children fairly quick
er we were married three years no children and i began to get desperate again and an anyway along came the first then came the second
and that was enough we decided that was enough
so i went to the birth control clinic on either street or street it was i can't remember which
do you know which it was
well i know it was at street at one time
yes
yes that'd be it
yes that would be it
and it was a doctor er she was in charge
that's the name yes
she was lovely
she was my doctor at the time she was she was oh she was a grand person was doctor
and er very kind very gentle
and i went but it was so embarrassing it made me ill
it was very embarrassing this what you went through you know and all this performance
you know
and i er anyway it did make me ill its it made me UNK
er
with internal UNK and
yes
things like that
yes when i got home at night i was er i had to i was sent to the hospital i was bleeding
and erm you know it was pretty bad
and so i wouldn't use it i wouldn't use the so we er my husband just had to take precautions and that was it
yes so they had did have a variety of different things you could er be
oh yes
fitted with then
yes i heard of a lot of things the UNK er my sister had the UNK and erm and of course the cap which it what i had
and different UNK and that kind of thing but er oh it was you know not very nice
i was messy and i've always said that
severe looking nurses you know and you felt a bit embarrassed
yes
was it a busy place when you went there
oh when i went yes there was a lot there quite a lot there
this would have been what in the late forties or fifties would this be
th yes well my oh no it was in f the early fifties actually
ah yes
yes
my two these two my last two girls were born in the fifties yes
yes in when the youngest one cos i had a very bad UNK over the youngest one and er doctor sa said he said he asked you don't want any more my doctor that was then not doctor because i was i wasn't under doctor then
and she said you don't want to have any more do you
er i said no and she gave me a letter to take down there you see
erm
you told me that you had an abortion in the nineteen thirties
that's right
can you tell me how this all came about
well my husband was out o on strike and i'd erm got two babies a year and ten months and i felt that i had to go and get a job and i was desperate so i'd heard people talking about these things as they did so i thought well i've got to do something
and er what i did i got everything you know the i don't think it was and some warm water and i saw that my hands was well clean and i'd got some very nice little silver UNK only small ones
and er i er UNK it took two or three days in the womb with this UNK and the heard something go pop
and of course not long after that erm i was took ill and er i er had to have the doctor and they sent me to hospital
i can mention mister doctor he's sir john
er he attended to me and i shouldn't have done but i looked at my notes at th bottom of the bed one day and it said interference denied
and of course i had denied cos nobody i think he said has someone UNK with you
nobody had i'd done it myself you see and i didn't want to know and er i didn't want anybody to know you see but er he was marvellous i know and i know there was something else tiny came away it'd only be about six or eight weeks but it was i think anyway what was lost was found and i was in hospital for about fourteen days
and er that's how i performed the but i kept it to myself all these years you know and never told anybody what i'd done because i think it was terrible
cos i
how did you know how to go about it
well when you're a UNK and you mix you know with all sorts and you hear different people talking and what they did and what they didn't do you now and some had doctor pills at that time in the nineteen thirties and some used the indian bark
er what was there
some pink pills or something but there was all sorts you know hat they used to say put your feet in hot in water mustard and er fall down the stairs or go on a bus they used to tell you all sorts of things you know to and er anyway that's what happened to me
but thank goodness it didn't do me no permanent harm
b
er i did have a child for in nineteen forty eight
i did have c a UNK but er because there was a l UNK growth so whether in you know i'd done anything all those years and yet it didn't affect you know it makes you wonder doesn't it
well it makes you wonder but i should think
and ten when you lose a lovely girl you wonder still you know why you if that was punishment
i didn't lose her till she was over twenty but so but i think it was UNK because if i'd had money i should've had a house full of children because i loved them you see i've always loved children
so
do you know if this was something that was happening to a lot of people at that sort of time in nineteen thirties
oh yes but erm on the radio UNK programme i heard someone say there was every street corner these women but they weren't i don't think there was i think it was you know there were a lot of women that used to do it illegal
and er they used to get them to take these pills they said and they used to drink a bottle of gin keep drinking gin
oh dear i couldn't of that
no
did you think of going to anybody like that before you decided to do it yourself
no i wouldn't let anybody else touch me person
i was a bit oh dear no i would never have gone to anybody no
did you tell anybody else that you were pregnant any of your friends or anyone
no i didn't tell anybody when i you know i when i was doing me UNK of course they knew afterwards that er because of me going in the hospital you see
where did you get from in those days
pardon
did you get from a chemist
oh yes oh yes you got it from the chemist
it was what i used today they used it in all hospitals
oh yes
mm so it wasn't as if there was any query when you went to ask for it cos it
oh no but you see that was for UNK
you see that was to see that you know there wasn't any yes
and when they i don't think there was any queries not with er the pills or the or erm indian bark have i said that
indian bark
erm mustard gin oh the things that they you know they used to do
and i and i as i say a lot was done because the poverty
i mean they UNK they don't know today really you know well i think it's wonderful
i don't UNK about me pension i could do with more but i don't
no
what money did you have coming in at that time in fact
oh i don't think we di we'd hardly anything
they wouldn't the miners hardly got anything and there used to be soup kitchens for us and er when it first started in nineteen twenty six and er i was pregnant with my second one and i used to walk right down to pit with a lace great big lace basket they wouldn't let the men fetch the coal and we had to push the coal from there right to the oh they've no idea love no idea
you see there'd been the nineteen fourteen eighteen war then there'd there was the strike and er i started to work and i had to go to work
and i've had to work i worked till i was seventy
so when you were working as a UNK was that the only money that was coming into the house then
yes
because your husband was on strike at the time
yes and i wouldn't pay my rent because er ooh and i can tell you really the exact date when i er was pregnant because i know i UNK at the when it was first opened and er i was a UNK in the room i think it was
but it was beautiful then
and i UNK then of course you daren't go to work those days when once they knew you was pregnant it was a case of out
and also er there was the picture house then there's not any people remember it next to
and er the woman there she wouldn't sign the paper because UNK husband was a miner for me to get a drop of milk for him
that's how much assistance the miners had then
you know they didn't get the you know they've gone too far now
everything is a was a good thing that the unions but they're going too far
they're just taking a bit too much on
well that's my idea and i mean as a then we got the other war
so we haven't had er we'd no chance really to save
so when you were pregnant did your husband know you were pregnant
yes er but i don't think he knew what i did i think he thought i used to take the boiling water upstairs you see int he bedroom and er i think he just thought i was sitting on it to open the womb
no
he didn't er make any suggestion
no
that he knew what you were UNK was going on at all
oh no
i wouldn't let him know that
no
no he wouldn't have agreed with it you know but
you didn't talk about it at all then
no not what i'd actually done cos he was very frightened when i went in the hospital
i was ill but he didn't know actually that i had used that method
yes
can i just ask one thing a another thing about the time you were living in erm did you as a woman know anything about contraception
there was the what they UNK the french letter
but they couldn't afford them
and it's true i've seen my husband get water and wash it out well and er put powder and that because and yet you shouldn't you see they weren't safe really but they was that poor love they had to
mm
i mean it's unbelievable
so was there anything that you could do apart from leaving it to your husband
was there anything you could do via means of contraception rather than just leaving it to your husband
i didn't know anything
i think some people they used to put a i think some used a little UNK and put something on but i didn't
i didn't until that actually happened you know i didn't believe in anything like that
and you didn't know about anything else
no only the UNK and different pills and different things you know that these women used to do to their UNK
oh what sort of UNK an pills were those
oh i think wasn't there pills pink pills and ooh i forget what else
i know they used to put bark in their inside that's right
and then i said they used to have the mustard baths
oh yes
and they used to take the gin and these pills and you know
yes
gin er was that er UNK the old gentleman the older UNK you know he's been dead years now from and erm they were very good
they used to er send a lot of er in erm street is it up at the er you know what i that jus in street was it in street
street
er there used ti be a place there but er no i can never remember knowing or else i should think i should've gone
only i didn't daren't mention it to the doctors you know
you didn't
was it not something people talked about with their doctors then
no
no
why was that
were they er a bit er frightening the doctors then or
well did i don't know things are so open and you know these days
but i still maintain to encourage them at twelve years of age to be ab oh i think it's all wrong
mm
now you had three children within two and a half years
yes two years and four months
mm
yes i did i well i did hear of several things to stop having them but over the first actually
and er the pills all different sorts of pills doctor pills er there was all kinds of pills in those days that you could take to you know to stop you from having them you see
this was after you became pregnant you mean
yes that's right oh yes
mm
mind you if you didn't er lose it up to three months there wasn't much chance after
if you kept it up to three months there's cat in UNK chance you'll lose it after that
but erm if you took these pills UNK some of them you would probably lose it
that all depended on how strong you was internal you see
if you were very strong internal well you wouldn't lose it
but er
and where did people get these pill from
chemist mostly erm chemist and er not health stores there's one on road used to be one not road one on road now
er
UNK you mean
that's it
and there was one in he's packed up cos they've these houses
they
were they sold openly
well yes they was
mm
er only th back counter effort was er slippery elm that was a back of the counter sort of thing slippery elm because it was dangerous practice
slippery elm you see you had to tape it down to a fine point and then insert it you see and if you didn't get the right place well it'd kill you
well everything's dangerous practice really where speaking pills and all the lot
i still i still think they are today and er there was the slippery elm and then of course there was these UNK effort
yes there was one in
she went to prison for seven years when she was caught
now she used to used a UNK hook yeah
but the whole point was my mother in law told me this when i was very young
you see the erm wait a minute the womb is like two UNK together like that wh when you UNK they close like two bones you see they close and they if you want to get rid you've got to open it which is which is UNK hard work and of course terrible pain attached to it
you couldn't open it less with force an it's great force
anyway then as i say they used to have these this back street effort and if you do it yourself you could do it with erm the UNK
could do it with the UNK in the bath
that was another way of doing it
and when did you first know about these kinds of methods of abortion
well i got to know about them when i first got married when i was in the back street you know in the UNK
you get to know from there
then of course at i mean you at you could all sorts of things from there
in factories you hear a lot in factories
everybody talking everybody's giving each other the gen of what to do and where to go and what have you
bit i learnt quite a lot in from the back you know in the terraced
they knew everything bar the kitchen sink what to do and what not to do
everything was a dangerous practice though by the same rule
you were damn lucky if you survived the UNK
but you can well imagine
so if you wanted to end a pregnancy it wouldn't er be a problem finding out about it
oh no there was too many things to be had then
too ma mind you it's easy today with that p i don't think that UNK reliable
it's not anybody with blood trouble
they couldn't take it
no
no they couldn't but in our days in the younger days to keep off it was the french letters
that was the only thing was it
that was actually the only thing and then the UNK after that
the i tell you that place that they had in street used to ins insert the UNK
the clinic we're talking about
yes that's right yes
they inserted the UNK
that's what you went there for then
then of course failing that if you didn't want that doing you'd er try the french letters and they were supposed to be er you know supposed to be UNK and supposed to be the thing
unless they of course there were different sorts of that you know even
and er it had been known for them to split
mm
and the UNK had been known to move and not be right and even today they've when they've had this er what is it this er operation for it they've conceived after haven't they
yes they have
what was the view amongst men and women in those times was preventing having children regarded as a as a woman's job
or was it something men took responsibility for
well i don't know i think well the men u of course we didn't use the french letters did we
so i mean if the man was going to take it on himself i mean er he used the french letter then when that clinic started up as i would say the women would go there you see stop that UNK because they didn't even they didn't even let er take very kindly to the french letters some of them didn't you know the men
but er i should say myself that er it all depended on the man really you know in a way didn't it either one way or th other
it all depended on the man
and then a lot depended on the women as well hand on till death well you what do you expect to be pregnant next morning
don't you
mm
you see that's the trouble you see every individual is different in the make up of life they are so UNK get pregnant by oh you might as well say looking at one another and another one they might perhaps go years and not get pregnant
in my case you get pregnant at every verse end cos i came of a big family you see mm
so after you'd had your three children did you get pregnant again
ooh UNK aye yeah didn't get didn't have any did as well my word
wha yes i did several times but i didn't carry on with them no
no what did you do to stop them
got the pills yeah
did they always work
well most of the time yes doctor pills were very good in those days and then of course gin and loads of UNK salts brought you down to last leg no wonder i've got arthritis
erm it was a load of UNK salts and er and a lot of gin and hot baths that brought it on sometimes
and then again i tell you could use the UNK and that er but er mostly it would you know you would get right again but it took some doing not easy
was there ever a time when you had to go in for more drastic measures
well the UNK a drastic measure
i never went to anybody
no
never
i could never allow anybody to do anything for me can't now
i'm so self UNK that i if i was going o do anything it'd have to be me that would do it for the simple reason i couldn't trust anybody else not in that particular thing anyway
but was this very common amongst people you were living with were they was it very common to stop UNK like this
oh yes it was
oh yes when we were younger it was common
in all these with what you know they'd have children by the UNK in these er terraced houses
all taking stuff first one then another
yeah
then factories as well when the war was on
that's when the war was on you see things got worse they were all in the family way all them as could be in it
mm believe me all trying to get rid
was
i'd got two UNK that tried to get rid they did get rid eventually yeah
do you know anything about erm people who did abortions in back streets
did i know
did you know any
i didn't know the person but i knew of her and i knew a friend of mine went to her this is the one that did seven years
mhm
she was in the back streets
yes she did seven years
so
and you told me that she used to use a UNK hook
ah yeah they used UNK hook they did
mm
fine instruments weren't they UNK
what sort of person would she have been i'm wondering whether she would be doing this for money or was she be doing it because she really cared about people
oh yes money
oh you had to pay her obviously mm yeah did it for money
they all do don't do these things for love do they
no
was it always women
it was a woman that it was a woman that did it
that was a woman
oh i didn't know of any other only knew the one
but she was well known whe was well known all over
yes she was
my friend went to her she didn't get rid
no she went and had the abortion but she had the child eventually
mm
he took her back when he come from the war
oh dear it makes you laugh don't it
the family was against it but still he stuck to her
no i bet the UNK must be getting on now
mm
tried ever so hard to get rid but she couldn't she didn't get rid of it the other two did
mm
they did yes
but you was with it all the war even before the war and then when the war came and of course you've got a fair amount when the war came on you see
mm
yes you've got knowledge all the time with living with people around you
it was the back streets were where a lot of this business was
people had got no money you see having a load of kids and they keep always being in the family way naturally trying to get rid of them you see because they didn't want them obviously
i wouldn't say that's because of money today would you
no
no it's not money today actually is it
not so bad as it was then in those days
it was bad cos there was no money no money about at all nineteen twenty six strike and what have you and no there was no money at all so people didn't want their babies did they
no
mm
erm was this something that you talked about with your husband when you found you were pregnant erm did you discuss it with him at all
he didn't use to like ti never he was always terrified at what i wouldn't do next
mm
yes
mm
no he was always terrified at what i'm going to do next
i remember him being in a pub a while back and a woman saying to him what's your wife going to do
he said madam i never know what my wife's going to do she's so UNK
i was
would he rather you had the children then
well i think he would've he was very fond of children you know
yes he didn't like me to make he liked he didn't like me to anything that was going to upset me
at all any drastic measures what so ever
he'd he never liked it
no never
no
i was wondering whether it was common for women when they were found they were pregnant to talk amongst their women friends and really leave the men out of it as it were
oh ah we used to get together and we used to discuss each other you know what we could take and what we couldn't take
we didn't used to talk to the men about ti obvious
never talked to the men about it
doing it at the back of their at the back
without them knowing most of the time
i can only really remember one occasion when my husband knew that i was i was taking pills at the time i think i took about twenty eight in one night
pills that's the only time he ever knew
and he was UNK
he didn't he didn't approve of it so you we didn't talk to your husband about it
no you go together with the women same in factories they're all talking about different things of what you're doing and what you can do
as i say sometimes it was it was er it worked and sometimes it didn't
if it didn't work well you just made yourself ill for nothing
and it makes you wonder as well if it didn't UNK back onto he children you know
yes
you've got to watch that you see did it UNK back on the children
it's up to thee months i say after three months no good taking anything at all because you'd never lose it not after three months
at three months it is the UNK of the womb that is li that is for everyone if anybody's got a weak inside well UNK lose it UNK be liable to lose it more than anybody else with out taking anything
i tell you one that's got a strong inside you manage up to three month but you're no good after three months
it's a waste of time
what about doctors in those days did they give anybody advice about erm
just tell you not to do it
the doctors were very keen you know very keen and if actually if they had to go anywhere when there was trouble you know say you'd got UNK or anything like that they were supposed to report it you know
mhm
obviously did do a thing
yes the er the doctors were very keen in those days they'd UNK i remember doctor telling me about a case on
and i was very young UNK used slippery elm and she'd died
mhm
yeah
and what would happen when somebody was reported would it then become a police case
well i should say yes they would i should say there was trouble for them obviously when it was reported
yes i think they was had up if they were alive t excuse me to tell the tale
ooh yes they'd be had up
o on the other end did erm doctors give any advice about contraception such contraception as there was at that time
i can't remember him telling me much at all not
no i can't
well perhaps you might have more contact with the nurse erm the district nurse
they didn't tell you anything
didn't know much theirselves any more than these do today
mm
they tell me i know more than them
but you said you when i asked you about the clinic on street you thou you thought had heard of it
i did i felt sure er i probably went there once
i cou i UNK felt i could m when you said the name it struck me very UNK
i felt sure that i went there but i don't think i don't know what happened but i don't think they were ever so successful really
i don't think the men minded really you know having these things inserted it saved them a lot of trouble
mm
it did but er it's a two way switch this business you know you've got to er you've got to be together on the job haven't you really two UNK two way switch
mm
it's what i always think about it
tape number three in conversation with mr john
you were mentioning the old coffin route from
starting at you said
starting at a hundred and ninety
on the one inch map
hundred and ninety
up by that loch
now that's near loch
that's it
watch me now
ah can you mark it in maybe
that's it
i see up to the glen
that's right but it doesn't go as far as the glen
right
it keeps this side of the glen
to the side
and then in like that
mhm
follow me
yes
i'll just have a shot at UNK that in
yes it's a very
its near it anyway
a UNK track
it's a oh yes a UNK track
not the easiest ways
the people who undertook such a
it's more or less the hard ground
aha the ground very much
and there was and there was UNK where they used to rest the coffin UNK here and there along the route
was there
where they used to rest the coffin for a m and have a UNK and a piece of cheese or some biscuits
i'd read about i read erm read in erm some paper or other not so very long ago about erm a funeral and the that was going along the road of course and they came to a to a erm hotel and they were och they were going for miles and miles and miles and they went into this hotel and the they party the funeral party went into the hotel and had a good few drinks and they were well away when they came out and they went away without the coffin for two miles two miles before they discovered that they didn't have the coffin
they had to go back ag go back again for the coffin
the people who undertook er following that route through such a an UNK of UNK and turns would have had to have know their directions very well otherwise
yeah
they could have been lost quite easily
and do you know think that these UNK possibly were there to guide them as mu as much as anything
oh well they knew the road these men knew the road very well and er they knew the
area
area they could tell by the hills they could tell the way
i came from m my from across the hill with my father when i was sixteen at night
at night
at night
but it was a lovely UNK night and we didn't leave it was about eight o'clock at night when we left
we were at there and i went with er with my father er on a friday and we came back that night
now that must be a good what would you say seven miles at least in one direction
well it would be something like that so something like
at least
seven miles
easily
and well it would it was two good hours to walk across the erm
take you two hours anyway
that was well it's wasn't quite a mile and a quarter
and this was just a beaten track
oh just a beaten track
whereas the other one in glen was an actual made track
well i'll tell you a good story about that to s to let you see that it was a well beaten track
and it was just the people were often walking along this track anyway there was a man there was erm was a there was a man and a woman walked over to and walked back again at night well in the even evening anyway
and the woman lost her UNK on the way back and she saw this man next morning he was a policeman in and he was too fond of the drink a and he was on he was a railway policeman and he fell onto the rails when the train was coming nobody knows how he how he how he er he lost one arm er about there and the other one about there both arms but he survived it
nobody knows how he how the how his head wasn't UNK
but anyway this woman that lost the UNK she me she saw this man without the hands going across the hill to she asked him where he was going and he said i'm going to across the hill
are you coming
no she said i've been there yesterday but er i lost a UNK and i wish you would be on the look out for it
did you keep the track all the way he said
yes all the way
anyway this man without the arms he went to and he had er he had er a pocket outside his jacket here and he erm got the UNK and he called on the at the house where this woman was and he says put your hand into that pocket he said and she puts her hand in oh she say she says you've got the UNK
yeah he says i think that'll be yours
but how did the what was UNK a lot of people how did he manage to get it off the ground and into his pocket
by his teeth
he must he must erm UNK down on his knees and caught it in his mouth and got it into his pocket some way or another
mm but both these people came from
yes both of them
and that's a an incredible tale
it is right enough
because it really bears out what you were saying that the there was a track which
well it erm it shows you that there was a track
because no one could have found that UNK if it had just been a wilderness
no
if you had been any where else on the hill you'd have wouldn't have a chance cos you couldn't you couldn't follow the track that they di they followed the day before
and that was the lady's son involved who told you this
that's right
roughly when do you think it happened that incident with the UNK
pardon
when in time did it occur
that's right
aha can you put a date on it though
was it the before the great war during the
oh yes i think so
think
before the
i think it as before the war but i'm not quite sure mind either could have been after the war
that's the first war
i know the lady oh yes first war i know the lady was going to after the war the man could have been
very
possible
do you have any UNK of the great war and the way it affected were many of the men called up to serve from the area
well all the young they were they were either called up or they UNK volunteered
and did you see vessels in the area because you yourself would be too young were you not
n well i was i was erm i would have been called up in another two months after the war was over if the war had continued i would have been eighteen in that in the following january
do you recall seeing any ships that were involved in the war coming by
well the some of the soldiers and sailors used to walk from all the way home to or
the snow was that heavy that no traffic nothing could move
they were walking
er about
all that distance
and there weren't really proper roads
the road
the roads were there alright but they were
UNK
covered over with UNK with a few feet of snow
there was no snow UNK in those days it was all hand cut if they were cutting UNK it was manual labour
spade
spade
were you badly affect in the by UNK
well we had we had a lot of snow in those days far more than there's been since then
the seasons seem to have changed
now how did these people you mentioned before make this track at it was a better made track you said it wasn't just a beaten
well from inside the inside the forest fence
aha
it's there it started and the rest of it was all a beaten track like what was going to
if so from the with loch down towards it was a beaten track
that's right
but from the towards it was a proper track
that's right proper track
now how did they in those days make the track
well there'd be a squad of men working there paid by the estate
and use any materials that were found near by
and they wouldn't be getting the money they're getting today
aha
if they would if there was a UNK there he would be getting a shilling a day and the labourers would be getting UNK or something n UNK a day
and it would be hard work too
perhaps a pound or two of
these were the conditions then
that's how they had so much money all these landlords in those days
there were no taxing
and any servants they had were low were very UNK paid
i'll tell you a story about erm a girl from she was on service in with erm sir john sir john and lady
there was a lodge there in the in the village
and this day lady had some letters to post in the early morning she wanted them away on the UNK in the early morning
and she told this maid to go with the letters to post them
and it was going but she doing something and she the lady seen her going through a corridor and she said to her run annie run
no my lady i never run for d anybody and i'm not going to run for you
she was a good maid though
and she didn't get the sack
and UNK my father's er mother's people were the
UNK was where he was in canada when i was born
and that is over ninety years odd
you see
mm
so what years was that you were born
eighteen ninety three
aye
and do you have any brothers and sisters
i have one sister still alive
i had er two brothers and four sisters
but they er my two brothers one died in nineteen forty
the result of well UNK
the other died at the age of what
oh about ten years ago
eight he was eighty nine when he died and er both of them were in the family tradition journalists
and in fact er one my brother next to n to me i was the middle of them i was the youngest boy
male they call it
his son is a was former UNK for in new york for the guardian
now he's on the UNK and billy my eldest brother he er was he came up in glasgow er getting the scottish express
you see so a branch of the er london paper and at that time he was editor of the paper they came up together found it here
but one was on the daily mail and the other was on the er express
and er at one time they were on the evening papers opposite
they were they never worked on the same paper they were always on
rival ones
yes
ooh
and my sisters three of them were teachers
and er an interesting thing had been coming to our house she comes goes to the same church
and she came up on a wednesday for coffee after the service
and she'd been coming to our house oh about UNK or six years and she said one day to mary that's my wife says you know not strange name there's not many of them about
so i says no when we had the phone first we were the only one in the telephone directory
and i says er you know when i came back from UNK de UNK she'd been out as a UNK then
my teacher was a miss
and mary said yes that would be UNK sister
she was she taught in UNK for quite a while then she went down to birmingham
the other sister was er in high UNK and the other one was in er well she was in UNK for a number of years and then she moved south because she wasn't musical and there was no chance of getting of UNK in scotland if you hadn't got music
so she went down to UNK and was UNK of er school in UNK
until she well not until she till she until she retired
she died a couple of years a er three years ago
so er and ten the other one the one that's alive sh she started off teaching and then went to nurse
she wanted to be a nurse all her life you see
mm
she's a nurse
she's retired now because she's eighty seven
stays in south er no not south
and of course my father he was in he had a local paper
was he editor of the local paper
well he was editor you know in a small time a small of er about five or six thousand
everybody has more or less has a paper it's not like the UNK or the news as regards numbers but then you've got all the local news and you got all the local advertisements
so UNK is one of the family what if i say traditions
mm
and where er UNK were you brought up
UNK
in UNK
and was it a big house or
well it was a reasonable house you know
one two three little rooms downstairs
upstairs there be there was four rooms upstairs
but at that time it wasn't what you'd call modern in so far as you hadn't got hot water from a sort of gas fir electric heating
the bath you had a bath room with a bath on the wall but you had to heat the water on a at the kitchen the kitchen fire
it were a old fashioned kitchen range where you'd got a an oven on one side and a boiler on the other
the boiler didn't fill automatic you had you had to fill it with water
you took a bucket of water out you put a bucket of water in
that's how you heated that's how you got your bath
heating the water well it heated if you'd the fire on it heated the water and then you'd take a couple of buckets out into the bath plug a couple of buckets in
and then er
and there was no such thing as electricity
gas there was a local gas works you see
that made er the gas locally
but i remember quite well when the first UNK gas UNK came in
you know what a UNK it was and the difference in the light between the old single gas lighter and the UNK lighter
but er some of ther some you had no gas up the on the UNK way
the gas the stairs were UNK with a UNK lamp
you know
gas in the bedrooms so as the
the was gas in the bedrooms but not on
but not on the st
not on the UNK
why
i don't know
mhm
there was warm gas er in the hall
you know a gas er light in the hall but the less the UNK you either had to go up by er with a UNK in your hand you see
or you got well er one two three four there were four flights of stairs in the one house
you got a couple of lamps either well in the one case where there was a small landing a hanging lamp and the other bigger you had a table you had a an ordinary table lamp
oh yes
and you'd
and you'd have the fires open fires in your rooms
oh they were all coal fires
there w there were no such thing as gas fires
they were open coal fires
and one well all the bedrooms had er fire places you see
so that in the winter time you put on a coal fire
but there were no such things as central heating and that
and er where did you start school
UNK
UNK
and what was it like
was it a
it was
small school
no it was UNK high school was very good
very good school very good teachers
the headmaster was morgan j known as morgan j or by the boys as too long and too loose
why
because he always had long trousers that went over his boots and they were you know very wide so the boys would call him too long and too loose
yes
ooh there were all there were with one exception they were all male teachers
the on the exception was the art UNK she was a er miss but er morgan all good and by you couldn't you know they were UNK strong UNK there was another chap
left UNK went from UNK down to oxford as professor of latin
and he stayed there for the rest of his life
and morgan j well he was the headmaster when i went to school first and he was there when i left and he retired and he was still here you know going about
there was and another chap
