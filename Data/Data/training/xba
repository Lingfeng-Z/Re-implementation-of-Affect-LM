there were four UNK and they from not from UNK because there was only the one high school but from er UNK and that and the used to meet on a saturday at UNK to play golf
they played golf every saturday if it was at all possible
and was the belt used a lot
pardon
was the belt used a lot
no
because you didn't get the you know
one boy might have had the belt say once in the week or a month at UNK
very seldom there was no need
you know you might get the belt for making a silly mistake over a sum or some exercise or that you see
or coming in coming late
but it very the belt was there now in the classroom the master had a desk and at the side of the desk was the belt
it was always on show but it was seldom used
you know er very seldom
and how did you learn to count can you remember
did you use the UNK
how did you learn to count
to count aha
when you went
you started i forget one you know they'd put them on the bo it was all board and slates there were no books you know no papers
you had a slate like you've got on the roof but it was bound with a wooden frame
and on the board was a one
and you out that one on your slate
and then two and you put the two
then add you'd put a plus sign one and equal two and two plus two UNK four
like that
and the same when it came to er UNK you see it were all done on the board and you copied it onto your plate on to your slate
and from that you learned
and you had a bit of rage or UNK or something you'd got your slate filled you'd just wiped it up and dried it start again
so that literally speaking there were no records of your early
er training in addition UNK and that
when you went into the er higher grade then you got UNK because you had homework so you'd homework to do and you'd therefore books
so that you could er give your translation you see
or all that
you had your latin french if you didn't if you didn't take french you took german
your maths and your science
and your own UNK
and your homework was handed in every er so often you know you may have homework english
and essay write an essay on this that or the next thing at the weekend
it went into your UNK your UNK was handed in on the monday morning or the first time you went to the UNK the english class and the teacher was his name he went over that and if you'd missed out a comma you see or a full stop or anything like that
he corrected them more or less marked in up and you got er four out of ten five out of ten out of ten
and did you stay at the same school through primary and secondary
yes
one school
the on the only difference in were different sizes of the room
you see the primary was in the one side and the high school the secondary was in the other
and were did the classrooms how were the classrooms heated then
they were in UNK you had a long desk that took now some of them they took five on the one the one desk you see
a long desk and a long seat
no individual UNK
and the boys say on the one side and the girls on the other
mm
and how were the classrooms heated
can you remember
well the classrooms were kept clean because the school finished at er twenty past four and half past four the UNK had the cleaners you see
mrs a had somebody mrs b mrs c mrs d
they were always they were swept every day and at the weekends
one room would be the floors would all be UNK and polished next week the next room
the next room then come back
every so often the rooms were UNK
when you sat your qualifying exam to go to the high school er what happened to the people who didn't pass
they were it were divided into to you could go to a high or you could carry on at what they call supplementary
if you didn't get the if you didn't pass the class exam you could stay on and try again
that never happened
if you didn't get it you went in to the supplementary
if you got it you could go in to the higher if you didn't want to go into the higher you leave at er thirteen you went into the supplementary
it was er just er well it was between shall we say the higher grade and the secondary school
continuation of further education on the secondary lines
the only thing in the supplementary you didn't get was languages but you got the UNK the science and all that and english
so did you enjoy school
yes
it was good
and did you have sport
you had you had no organized sport such as you have today but you had a football team because there was no need for what you would call sports ground there was plenty of available open space park
there was the UNK park which practically covered the whole of our the er town you see
you if you lived in UNK park the houses in UNK park looked straight across the green onto the sea
so that you've got football pitches there with cricket pitches but if you wanted if you were a UNK you went across to the golf course
but there wasn't what you'd call an organized sports group
if you wanted to play class four would play class three class three play class two you know
but the teachers didn't organize it
no
you the boys organized it UNK
the boys organized it themselves
and as for girls well er about the only thing they did was skip
you know skipping ropes
and what did you do with your er spare time as a school boy
i spare time as a school boy i used to play either football in the winter or cricket in the summer
when i had spare time but if you'd if it was decent weather you'd have to give a hand in the garden at home you see
you had to help get the garden keep the garden tidy keep the weeds down
it's alright at although i'd two brothers on or two would be away from home from home at the s the same time
i was left
so i had to give me father a hand you know to keep the garden and he had plenty to do
so er they'd find you something to do in the garden in your time
did you find that your father would have odd hours
well er sometimes he made of point of always being in the house not later than we'll say nine o'clock unless there was something special on
you know a meeting of the town council
well if there was a meeting of the town council it would perhaps start at eight o'clock
because quite a l a number of members of the council had businesses and you didn't shut at six o'clock it was seven or eight UNK before they closed
and if there was a town council meeting it might go on till ten o'clock
so if the e you know it was only er exceptional cases when he was late
did the paper er he had out every day
no it was a weekly paper
a weekly paper you see
and er later on when he well he got that he couldn't carry on with it you see
it was absorbed and went in to the UNK herald and the UNK advertiser and now they've all gone
i don't think there's a sort of local paper now
course i haven't been down that way for a while
and when you left school what er age were you
i was between fifteen and sixteen
and what did you go what did you do
i had a relation with a chemist business in UNK
and er i didn't know him you know my mother he was a cousin of my mother's you see and on call now and again
it wasn't like today you could get in the car and nip down
to get to UNK you've got to go into glasgow and get a train from glasgow down to UNK you see
and that was er an express train was two hours journey
so and er i UNK you know and i went by a chemical and i thought oh UNK the UNK you see
and that drew me
the UNK that UNK from the chemist shop in those days like er depends what they'd been using you see
they'd been making er some mixed powder UNK or something like that you see
you get the UNK of it
and er well there were three UNK in UNK w k UNK and UNK
well w k never took an apprentice he wouldn't you know he hadn't time he had a permanent UNK assistants like
he wouldn't he wouldn't take in ion an apprentice it was too much
so i got in to UNK n as an apprentice on the second of august nineteen twelve i think
nineteen and eleven or twelve and er he was a figure in the b in the town when i tell you won't remember the who were members of parliament for orkney and shetland
and if punch were ever stuck he would get a UNK of er one or other of the brothers sitting in parliament knitting
you know UNK and knitting
well this man something wrong and he er had an appointment with a UNK man who was professor of medicine in glasgow he'd gone up the ladder you know and finished
and he made an appointment
well came from bar which is er a matter of six miles six to eight miles out side UNK and you'd got to come in by foot or by trap
in those days he came in with a his UNK brought him in the trap and they got the twenty minutes past seven express train to glasgow
well er he saw the professor and paid the fee and that and then came back six clock at night he came into the shop
and he said he says is er UNK in
well the assistant said no er ah he's upstairs getting his tea
stayed above the shop you see
in the house
but he said wait a minute i hear him coming down the stairs
so the boss came down the stairs and into the shop and he saw oh hello well did you get on with the your examination
ah well he says and he said he's given me this list
if you can't get if you give me something of your own
after he travelled to glasgow he had more faith in the he'd more you know
mhm
if had said oh this isn't worth a damn take this he would have taken it and been happy
mhm
and oh no he said this'll be good you know
so can you remember your f your wage when you went first
when i started first it was five pounds a year
and were you paid at six months or were paid every
no paid every three months
and invariably you got a gold sovereign you see
and er what four the rest i think it was one pound five a twenty five shillings every three months and you got a sovereign and often a five shilling piece
if you didn't get the five shilling piece you got two half UNK
then it gradually went from five pounds to ten
there was a five pound increase every year you see
and what er was your job when you first started
when you first started you had the UNK of an apprentice of black apron with a UNK on it
you know er you see some of them with the apron that just goes round the waist
but this one came up over neck over your neck and then down here and UNK there
and you did two years as an apprentice then another would come in and you dropped the UNK and got a black apron
when your apprenticeship was finished you got a white apron
how long was the apprenticeship
the apprentice varied three years up to some of them were five
and what did you do as an apprentice a at first
i the first thing you were shown taught to do was to wash the bottles
you know empty medicine bottles
you washed them
the er apparatus measures UNK that were used for making compounds or UNK
they were put on the sink and you washed them
and dried them and put them on the UNK again
and gradually dust or you've seen these er chemist shops where you've got lots of er UNK in
well in my day all those UNK had the natural drug
UNK root inside was a small cardboard label you see
giving the whole story UNK britain UNK britain
use root UNK you see
and you had to do all that UNK and keep it and you'd read over all these things every time you UNK until you got to know them
that was
one of the ways of training you or breaking you in to what was UNK m the UNK of the UNK
if he today er you don't hear such thing as UNK
extract of UNK
UNK juice UNK they've been replaced
then you see at certain periods of the years UNK were common UNK which a lot of it was used
you used to go with the boss
the boss would cut the UNK you would put it into the sack bring it back to the shop and dry it
you might go and collect oh er what UNK spotted come up you'd go and cut it you know bring it in get the UNK that would keep you going you know sometimes he would he'd say oh blast you we used two UNK of it
we better get three UNK this year in case
ooh we made three UNK last year we've got two UNK left we'll not bother
but a lot of the UNK were collected and dried and er used
so it was organized collecting of
well the usually collected himself
er we was on the beach you know sea front he'd er gathered some er UNK of UNK for making what they call irish UNK and that would give you a good think UNK you see then in the what was the UNK season UNK fishing you'd go down to the harbour where the er fishing boat came in and where they were cleaning and you'd get the boss would have arranged that you get the UNK
take it back to the shop in you've seen these old milk UNK
well i fill the milk UNK with the UNK and take them up to the shop
go back and get another you see
get another
make your own produce your own UNK liver oil
gosh
and er there were two grades of it
there was the UNK liver what would for animals that well the method that used to be used put it into the copper boiler
a big copper boiler with a little warm water and the heat would separate the oil you see
and then UNK the oil off and drain it
what extra did you have to do for humans
well you were always one thing you were very careful you had to see that the UNK bladder was removed
that it was just the liver
and sometimes you just used pressure you see
put it in and screw it round and round and round so that the pressure would fetch out the oil
i can remember when the er going down to the harbour for salt and we were getting from the manufacturer it was at the time getting UNK liver oil you know ready prepared for us which was a quite a saving
as far as we were concerned
in labour
but er you had all like cold cream special UNK rosemary UNK hair UNK
you made those in the back shop
and having made a couple of UNK that's er the big bottle which was er eighty UNK
they were filled into two ounce four ounce or you know depending on the size you UNK and sold
are they the chemist then would have to buy in all the bottles
oh he bought in the bottles you see
and er y you gave in perhaps say er two gross of three ounce bottles two gross of two ounce bottles four gross of four ounce depends how they were used
and they were stored in the back in the back shop store you see
and er kept there then you had in the front shop you had a range of er hair er UNK with your drugs your drugs at the bottom
you pulled it down ad you got the various size bottles in this we got half and one ounce here two ounce further up three ounce
all the way round
when you got the bottles did they have to be cleaned
yes
cleaned and dried
so it was a lot of work
oh lot of work
i mean the bottles weren't what you'd call dirty from having contained medicine or anything like that
they were dirty from transit you see
and packing
so that they just needed more or less UNK out and put on put into UNK you know just a big piece of wood with holes cut in so that you could fit them in and wouldn't fall off and dry them over the heat
what did you use to heat
there's only source of heat
any of these
the great thing is if you've got faith in the stuff if you haven't got faith you needn't bother with it
that's my opinion
and what do you feel about er the new er
there are some of them that are very useful but in the majority of cases if the human is UNK well it's producing it's own UNK
and those people that take or get extra either their body is not producing or they want an extra bit for something so they can run a hundred yards at er in an extra five minutes
but you don't feel that these things are not really proven are they
no
they have quite disastrous side effects on the
er they have well just the same as er some of these weight UNK they'll take the weight down but look at the side effects
oh yes it's er no i think there if we just bothered there are enough or almost enough UNK to cure any most of the common troubles
and do you feel nationalization was good from the medical point of view or
well yes and no
people UNK running to their doctor cut finger where previous they would have said oh i'll have a an UNK and a cup of tea
i'll put a bit of s UNK plaster around this
i think at times the national health service has been UNK you know oh er i am no going out today i'm no feeling well
i'll go and get the go and see the doctor
a sick thing he's off for a week
if we had some method a l a laser of some kind that could measure the degree of pain that mrs a is supposed to be suffering it would it'd solve a lot of problems
mm
remember what it was like during the nineteen twenty six strike
the nineteen twenty six strike the o the thing that struck me most of all was they were going to out the railway men
and at that time the railway was it was private
and the leading man of the railway union went out and bought all the shares he could get his hands on and off the railway company
and he'll not come out on strike
and that's and er it was the railway men not coming out on strike that caused the collapse of the strike
but there wasn't much interference in edinburgh
as far as i can remember
i mean we could get about we got about alright
there's
there was food and all that available
oh no i the twenty six strike er is just a you know a very big and er you know er railway man leader of the strike buying all the shares because he was but that's one of the things because it was a headline in the
paper
papers
i see so coming back to er making the pills and silver on it and gold was this er sort of UNK the UNK more
no
no
no
no
anybody you know er it sometimes does work very keen on a nice appearance you see that the drug be have a nice appearance and so the had silver UNK
no it wasn't i seen i seen people in the UNK being silver UNK pills
and you wouldn't say that was no
how do you feel the sort of looking back on life sort of the difference now u when you were young
well how do i feel
i'm grateful that i was born when i was rather than being a UNK today
although i have well i've come through two wars and i remember the relief of UNK but i'd sooner that i've was born when i was
why
well today it i may be wrong i hope i am but it seems to me everybody is out you know oh he gets five bob i want seven and six he UNK seven and six i want ten
and there seems to be UNK i dunno what amongst the youngsters today
and what did you do as er your leisure time as a young man and
well you hadn't got a great deal of money now you would go for a walk out in edinburgh out to black UNK because UNK was a village
or you'd go down the er out to barton and down the side of UNK up and back again
y you had a walk saturday morning when saturday morning
i went for a game of golf i had nine holes
i was a member of ra er UNK why
it was very easy i could walk up to UNK nine holes walk back in time
or i got a garden i could occupy myself in the garden
i never felt time hanging
ooh well you got er a l a lecture a couple of lectures every day well you couldn't just er press a button and they came out you got er preparation work
enjoyed UNK
yes
and
i made many of my own students are still friends
now we're a bit off christmas we've we have had christmas cards from norway UNK northern island not to mention the er scotland and england
but these are from students of well past days
so it's very nice
so well er i had students and they left at as friends
if we had overseas students you know er somebody from UNK or what er people UNK or in UNK or something like
well they were they were coloured well it didn't matter to me
my wife kept an open door for them and any time well at the weekend they'd some of them would drop in you know for a chat aye
or drop in for tea or supper
i was much more well i'll not say interested altogether but much more UNK of the condition of er these coloured people
why
well a UNK ago now a UNK came to edinburgh a student went to the regular places
no to let advertising UNK they wouldn't have him well what's that
what impression is that going to have on that UNK
so but er the overseas fellow you know i'll consider just on the same level and UNK well i never saw any er what you'd call UNK and UNK between the black and the white student
and the u a couple of them would come a black and a white would be here and no bother at all
but there you are
did you find that through the years the classes got bigger
that you UNK to
well the classes remained steady
you know we could've we limited they were limited to the intake but we could have er increased i think
we kept a steady increase you see when the two year course UNK first i think we had eight students and then it grew you see
the next year the eight to the final year there's sixteen the next year until we were getting that the two year course was just as big as the old one year course
and you got er eighty four students first year eighty four students second tear that's a hundred and sixty eight students
oh but we got on
oh yes
and did you find that the text book they had to use changed through the years or just the
well
of the same text
no
books
they're they are pretty much the same
the chemistry text books ch and the physics changed they got a bit more what you would call UNK mathematical
but you can't UNK the making of an UNK or the making of an UNK
they're perhaps little er more about the condition of the UNK of a powder used for UNK into tablets and the UNK how shall we coat it so that it washed away at once dissolved slowly or anything like that
yes that was a big change really wasn't it
yes
UNK
UNK
yes
so that you could get the slow and of course UNK the UNK before UNK
mm
so that er you get a slow or a UNK er effect or solution rather UNK
oh yes
have you done much work
i've done some work
i've tried
good
to sort of
good
what the hell i was supposed to do with
what were you doing
there's some i'm totally confused on
you were doing differentiating
and then
yeah
leaving it and then going back to it to see if you could integrate it plus some graphs
some of it
yeah
no i don't know what i've done with the graph
i've been concentrating on trying to
okay
i've gone through these i don't know how many times
right
i done them and then i've took them down and i've gone back
i've g i've got about a half a dozen sheets of paper scattered all over the place and i've decided to do it in this cos then i can just go to here
right
so i've done that
now i can understand that understand that
right
that goes to that two x but i'm not sure why
now is that UNK squared x
yeah
right
and that is goes to two x
UNK squared x
you mean do you mean
no
it's two x in the book
yeah
okay
now he does make mistakes so that's not a
erm
problem
mm
and then there's that i can understand
but that is actually is not like that
that's x squared but when it's differentiated cos you've gotta go back into the bracket it comes out as that
right
and that then goes in
okay
that
so i understand that bit
what you're doing i mean you're coming along very well really
but
aren't you
i'm not doing too bad
i think you're doing very well
but its like that
i don't get y to twelve
i mean i know th i know that you carry the sine on because
mm
it goes to sine squared so you only differentiate one and according to
okay
that goes to sine squared
right where your twelve comes from
well it must be three times four is equal
right
to twelve
okay
but it doesn't always go to the front of them
like here
yeah
well
the use of the two x
so i'm not UNK with all the rules
mm
okay
erm how did you differentiate these
i mean are you learning these as they are or i mean
no
do them
how are you doing it
no i've just all i've done is because erm because that is a function of that
right
i've differentiated that
well i didn't differentiate it but i but i did because i couldn't decide
as i as i was talking about for a new pattern
how much you want to write it in there it's up to you
just show me how you did that one
well all i
that one
did was that i didn't know whether to do three sine squared right
mm
then differentiate the four x because
that's your x value
so that'd be three times the four sine squared
then to differentiate the whole lot because it goes to cos
mm
and that is not what i get cos what i was doing is doing them meself and then
well what yeah
what
going and checking the answer
erm
and then if me answer was wrong trying to
mm
work out
can you describe your methods
how you how you'd do that
sort of writing down as many steps as you can
ah
that's why i couldn't i thought i hadn't got me pen
erm well all
draw a nice picture instead
all i did is i look at what i've got and if it's just a single term like that
right
then you
yeah
know to just differentiate it
when it's two terms like the log erm and what like that
mm
each of the two x multiplied by sine
okay
that brings on another rule
like that
okay
brings another rule
erm differentiate this for me then
er three x squared plus two
and put some brackets round that and raise that to the power five
okay y
equals that
sh show
me all the steps
divide by d x two
that goes at the front right
mm
to begin with
right
now you get erm three x squared plus two and then you differentiate what's in there UNK give you six
so if you multiply it by six and it's still raised to the power
if you differentiate three x squared what do you get
six
differentiate
six x
right
now
okay
right
that's the method
now UNK you doing this
what's the theory behind it
dunno
right
now what you're doing or what you're attempting to do erm if i say y equals p
hmm
find d y by the x
and you can't cos you haven't
got a you haven't got an x in sight
mm
now what you've got here is y equals u to the power five
yeah
right
now there isn't an x in sight
mm
i've only got three x squared plus two there but you can't differentiate UNK respect to three x squared plus two and then say you actually done it with respect to x
so erm you've seen the cha chain rule function and a function
mm
this is this is what you should be doing with it really
erm we've got that
y equals that
yeah
right
let u three x squared plus two
okay
now we've got y equals u to the power five
so we c can't find d y by d x
mhm
but we can find d y by d u
right
which is no problem
mhm
five by d to the four
yes
mhm
well that's found d y by d u but what we're looking for is d y by d x
and d y by d x is what
in terms of u and everything else
remember what that bit
how to work that out
erm isn't it the u
okay
the easy way to remember it
mm
is write it like that
d y by d x equals d y d y over something times something over d x with d u in there cancel out
it isn't quite as simple as that but it works
mm
okay
so d y by d x gives d y by d u times d u by d x
well if u is equal to that
mhm
we can differentiate that with respect to x
we can find d u differentiating this side with respect to x you get d u by d x and
mm
on that side then you'll get six x
mm
okay
so we want to find d y by d x and it's d y by d u then it's d u by d x
well we've found d u by d x and we've found d y by d u
so d y by d u is equal to d y by d x is equal to d y by d u which we've found from here from y equals
yeah
u right four times d u by d x which we found up here
right
now we haven't got x in it yet so we can't give them the answer in that form cos they
didn't tell us anything about u
you invented that so where do you put you place u five times whatever u
was three x squared plus two all to the power four
times six x because normally bring that to the front
three x
right
is one
and you get thirty x
mm
okay
now that's what you should be doing each time with these with that in and that much in sort of
as a minimum
you UNK you've obviously sort of seen the method somewhere and you're trying to do it in your head but cos you're not going through it in a fairly formal way
mm
you're most of the time you're getting it right cos this is just making the right sort of guess and you're seeing the sort of when it gets to the awkward ones y you're just sort of well maybe it's that maybe its something else
does that
yeah
help
it does help i mean that i have seen before but i didn't sort of understand it and you've actually
well the thing is after a while when you've done quite a few it comes it comes fairly easy and you can do it in your head
mm
but when you get to one where you can't do it in your head you've got to go back to this bit
yeah
and sometimes i mean there we sort of let
there might be times when we let you do the whole lot or when you have to have more than one go at it
mm
erm i mean if you've got something like for example erm say we've got the one we've just had
y equals something to the power
to the power five right
mm
but it wasn't three x squared plus two
mm
it was erm sine squared six x plus cos three x
mm
right
now doing that in your head would be a bit awkward
mm
but there you'd do it in three goes i mean you could probably do it in two goes but to be safe you could split it up into three goes so
what rule does that bring out because that
well
is that still the same you just
there's an there's an add in there
mm
right
so lets erm
yeah
l equal seven x okay and m equals d x
right we don't we can probably do these bits in your head quite easily
mm
okay
so we've got here differentiate that we get d l by d x
d m by d x is true
mm
now what were trying to find inside
we haven't done anything about this
it's all to the power five yeah
mm
so we could maybe do what we did last time
let u equal this lot in the brackets
sine squared seven x
three x now we're trying to find d u by d x
mm
at some stage
well you could probably do that one in your head
mm
and what would that come to
erm that'd be fourteen cos squared seven x
so if you differentiate sine squared what do you get
that
cos squared
cos squared
well that's what i wanted to ask you
what happens to them
because i know i asked one of my friends
mm
because i wasn't i said how come it ends up being that and they said you just carry
when you're using the trig function and you're differentiating
mm
it that you do use because it goes
to the front but it stays the same
it carries on right the way through
you don't lose the value of it
good
right
okay
but the squares i wasn't sure what happens to them and i confused him by asking him
okay
let's look at this
erm l is equal to seven x
mm
so
so it'll be about five stages in this
working it out any of them all and then you can miss out the ones we do you feel you don't need
just look at that bit
you're trying differentiate what's inside there with respect to something
well if you've got something like erm that one
tan plus seven x
so we've got y equals sine l what're we having seven x
mm
squared
squared
we write it like that because it's sine squared it is more obvious what the meaning is
mm
now we can't differentiate that with respect to l
mm
because it's not l it's sine l
okay
if that was i if that was l squared y equals x squared you could differentiate that with respect to x
if it's y equals l squared you could differentiate it
mm
to l
it's not
it's sine
so we'll differentiate gonna have another UNK on this one
so it's all just
goes on and on and on until you can get something that's erm a straight forward one letter to the power so you can differentiate it
so let h equal sine l
mhm
now we've got y equals h squared
well that's no problem
d y by d h cos now two h
mm
but now we've got h equals sine l
does that define d h by d l
mm
and if you differentiate sine l you get
five sine l erm cos l
erm well we've got cos
now we're trying to find from this one
let's work out what we're going to do
we're trying to find d y by d x but we can't find that
mm
so we're going for d l d l by d x
mm
times d y by d l
mhm
okay
why isn't that er cos
if you differentiate sine x what do you get
cos x
we don't get cos x or
so because you took the number of x value away
erm
if you UNK l
you've taken that you've squared x so you've got you've made that into another value
right
so
mm
you've made that y equal to h squared
so that becomes h so the value of that
i started off
let h equal sine l
yeah
right
now if all let's say all we've got to differentiate was y equals sine squared x
mm
now i could find d y by d sine x
mm
differentiate that with respect to sine x but not with respect to x
no
right
and if i if i found d y by d sine x that would show me not the gradient of this curve
mm
the gradient of the curve that i would get if i UNK y against sine x
mm
but we're plotting y against x UNK obviously be a very different curve with
mm
lots of different UNK thank you very much sir
thank you
right i'll leave you to it
so for that there's no way of differentiating that with
respect to x
there is eventually because you learn it
you know oh it comes out as cos x
mm
or comes out as whatever it comes out as
right
you can differentiate sine x on its own like that
y plus cos x but we can't differentiate that straight off without changing and doing the UNK
so we'll let er what letter haven't we used yet
q
so if we let q equal sine x we can find d q by d x we can differentiate this side with respect to x and that side q by d x when we differentiate
mm
okay
now we've let q equal sine x so we've got y equals q squared
we'll differentiate that with respect to q
no problem
right
differentiate both sides with respect to q
to q
right
okay
but we're looking for here d y by d x so we have d y by d x is equal to and we just write d y d x
d y by d q
there
d y by d q
two q
is two q times
q by d x
okay
mhm
now we've found d y by d x all we need to do is put back q to what it was
mm
right which is sine squared x
so s two sine squared x
mhm
okay
so you're sort of right in a way that it's two sine squared x but this wrong
are you are you happy with that
yeah
mhm
okay get y equals x squared no problem
two x
mm
y equals log x squared you can't just picture log x
no
very different
we're finding the gradient the gradient on a specific graph when we plot the x against the y the y against the x
right
mm
if we say well that looks a bit awkward so we're going to plot the y against sine x or the y against log x
mm
erm or the y against i mean in this one if you could plot that against x which is the normal way
if you tried to plot that against think of how you'd do it if you had a graph and you UNK y against three x squared plus two
mm
well you'd just get y equals a graph that would look exactly the same as y equals x to the
yeah
which is why the gradient of it would be five times that expression to the power four
yeah
okay
but that would not be the gradient of plotting y against x
a very different graph
mm
so
try and think of what you do when you find d y by d x
it becomes oh well you do some little tricks on numbers and you UNK them about and that's the answer they want
mhm
if you can get it back that's why i say do the graph if you can get it back to erm but it's not just something to the fifth it's really it's something to the tenth
right okay one way differentiating that
mm
is multiply it out
you've got five lots of brackets there
three x squared plus two every one
mm
in the half an hour multiply them all out right
and you get terms in x to the tenth
yeah
everything else all the way down
and you could just differentiate each term quite simply then
once you've done the multiplying the differentiation would be very simple
there'd just these straight powers of x and you could do that and you'd get to the same answer as we get to it's just that this is a quicker way of doing it
mm
but that is a y equals something x to the tenth so it's not going to have a gradient that requires y equals something to the tenth
mm
which is why you must do that sort of that that's probably all you need for that bit
to know what you're doing right
erm i think it would be useful for you do one the same way
erm we'll do a fairly simple one and then use the same one but make it a little bit more complicated
mm
what rule is that
the chain rule
a function of a function
mm
the chain rule
you can't do it in one go so you split it down into bits
because it is a function of a function of x
yeah
right
and then they want the gradient of y against x
not y against the function a sub function of x
mm
so if we get something like
right
have a go at that one
yeah
so we put the or sine squared think it's better leaving it like that because it's sine brackets
well what do you think
well i think
erm think it's probably better if
okay
go on
have a
have a have a go see what happens with that
alright
well i know now that that's not right
good
okay
well okay
fine
if you know it's not right scrub that
think of something more useful to let u be equal to cos this is the main part of it
working out what you're going to put u equal to
well if i put u equal because brackets the bracket there
right
and
okay
and let that equal sine squared
well we've had that already but sine squared doesn't mean anything
no
does it
i'd like you to get your UNK calculator out look up the sine of
some number but i'm not going to tell you what it is and then
square it
mm
but how do you separate that then
that's it
that's it until i know or i know what i'm actually looking for in it i can run around chasing me tail all day which
right
is basically what i do know
right
okay
okay what've we got here
erm if i said y equals sine squared x
mm
you couldn't differentiate that
mm
you'd have to do what we did on the other page
you'd have to do this
mm
so that was sort of on this one
what do we do there
what do we let u equal to
squared
let y equal q squared
mm
yeah so we let the whole thing there that was raised to the power be equal to something
so if we let v not u right we let u be that
mm
and let v if u is zero
mhm
then v will be you can write it as sine squared but i'm just writing this way cos it means more
sine v brackets raised to the power
three equals sine u
squared
okay
right can you take it from there do you think
well i'll have a go
try to sort of keep in mind what you're aiming for but don't rush getting there
see the steps along the way
is that right
right can you see what you're doing
yeah
this isn't a simple two stage one like the other one
you've got to try and work out what this middle UNK going to be
mm
i'll give you i'll give you a clue and see if you can work out how you're going to get towards it
what we're going to do the way we can work it is something like d y by d x is equal to now we've got that
mm
so we can differentiate both sides there with respect to u
mm
and find d v by d x
so we can d v by d u
d v by d u times what do you want
then come across d y by and at the end d x
so what've we got in terms of x
we've got d u
yeah
so we can find d u by d x
so we can find something by d u
mm
what've you got in terms of u
we've got d v in terms of u so we can find d v by d u
so we get d y by d y by d v
mm
right
times d v by d u
mm
times d u by d x
which is simply those and those cancelling out
and
mm
it comes to
d y by d u
that'll come to d y by d x
so that that'll go out with that that'll go out with x
an you get d y by d x
so you've got you've got the v in terms of u
yeah
so you can find d v by d u
okay
we've got u in terms of x so you can find d u by d x
and you've got v now
erm you've got y
where's y gone
you haven't got y in this one
okay
then what's y equal to
what can i do for you today
it's me throat at the back er keep and i try to clear it and i can't
worse i should think
is it a tickle or a pain or a
no it just feels as though you know i can't er can't shift it
right
do you actually cough anything up when you
no
it's this horrible feeling
yeah
right
does it hurt to swallow
no it just feels as though like you know how you get summat stuck in your throat
that's just
aha
how it feels like
yeah
you don't think you have got anything stuck
i dunno
you haven't had any UNK fish
or bits that have gone down the wrong way
or as far as you're aware
no
you've got no problems UNK
no
okay UNK up open really wide really wide
stick your tongue out
ah
oh that's interesting let me have a closer
oh
look
right really wide
stick your keep sticking your keep your tongue out
really wide
yes
okay let's try again
really wide i won't put that in now
hello well my own name's elizabeth of dalvaine glen ayloch is that what you mean
mhm
and er i've been there all my life and that's and that'll be eighty seven years old come may and er i've just worked on the farm all my days and er then of course when my people died i just er stayed myself and then lived with other people here and there just to help them
and then i came down to kerry after my operations because i was er for my feet i had to get them UNK because for the UNK of the arteries
mhm
but they did very they did marvellous things for me down in dundee
mm
so that i can now walk fine with my plastic legs
and then i come down to kerry all winter because it's not good for me to stay up there myself all winter and i have got good UNK here
so you're three years short of your ninetieth birthday
yes i'm that
aha
can you recall much about your young days elizabeth up glen ayloch
oh yes oh well just ordinary country days just you worked on the farm
you got up in the early morning and helped in the farm UNK the cows fed my cows and UNK and looked the pigs and then you'd hens and chickens and the pet UNK and things like that
and then of course at er the time of the UNK time you had to go out and help with the UNK time you know to help the UNK with if he'd a UNK lamb you'd always to bring it in the house and then feed it in a bottle
mm
and keep it warm and then er if you had er then you had the chickens to you had to set the UNK hens and bring out as many chickens as you could
and then after in the winter and then after that when it was near hay time i had to go out and help with the hay
that was gathering it in and if they were putting it into little into tramp coles i had to get up and tramp hay round and round the boss and er i did that
and what exactly were the tramp coles
tramp aha it was tramp coles they called them they were UNK you know and you got into and you put up the hay and you UNK round and round you see
and er helped all you could and then er
you used a boss with the UNK
yes there was a boss in the middle and then they put that up
what was the boss like
oh it was a three UNK pointed thing
i it was er you know three points like this
mm
you see like that and
like the UNK
yes just like that
but it was er we call it the boss
and we called them tramp coles but a lot of them called them tramp UNK
but it was er in er our country district it was er hay coles tramp coles then
and then after the hay time it was er wearing on to harvest time
and i had to help with the harvest too
and when i was younger we hadn't a binder we just had the ordinary mower
and er you went round and his father did er what they called the sheaf
he sat on this mower you see and er as it cut the UNK it off you see and we'd to make bands y you know with pieces of s er and then the UNK put that on the bands and bound them and through the site
so that was a whole days work often
how many sheaves were in your UNK
oh i couldn't say for that
now can you just
there'd be cart there would be two cart loads anyway to
making er the hay to make er that was in the harvest time for the harvest it would be oh nearly three cart loads of sheaves for a for a stack
for a stack
yes for a stack
but how about the UNK
oh the ha that was also you had that for er the harvest you had er to build the sheaves all round it you see too
and how did you make these UNK ones
the you know th the hay UNK
the hay UNK oh they were just er they were the same but they were no pointed like the h hay the like they have er time of the harvest time the hay UNK was just round and round and UNK d UNK up to a point
and then er a and then after they had been in hay UNK for a long time they were brought up to the farm and built into a bigger stack a bigger thing
how were they brought up
brought up with a with a cart
cart and er they put er what we called a big thing over the UNK the hay called that the UNK over the
and then the when they were built sometimes some folk used to build them into what they called a hay UNK it was a square kind of a thing but er and i don't know why they put it into a UNK hay UNK as we say but it seemed to er it seemed to be better to keep the h the wet out i suppose
but in our days at home we just put it into a great big hay stack as we said
did everyone up glen ayloch use the boss
yes everybody used the boss everybody
mhm
and in fact the bigger farms than ours they used to have a circle of stones
round you know to keep it up off the ground and to keep it UNK
and what were they called
er erm what do you call them again
it was the found f o u n d the found you know the foundation
but just ordinary language it was called the found
mm
the found of the stack
you never used the word UNK
no we that's was from no we didn't different mhm
was UNK ever used
no n well yes a lot of it was UNK or the or erm branches of the UNK trees that was that was laid out for that above the stones and then you put that above
now can you tell me in a wee bit more detail how you did that
well it was just their own the found of the thing was just built of big stones round about the size of the bottom of a stack
and then they've got er branches of the from the wood or er or sometimes people did UNK and put it on
mhm
so that's er all that i can say about that you see
and then of course the hay st the hay stack was built in a different style by the harvest stack it was built different
but the UNK the foundation was the same
mm
what was the difference
the it was different because the UNK was r UNK you see
and built er well you was when you was building the hay the harvest you see the sheaves was different you see
they were all built round and round and up until they came to what they called the e the part of the stack where they begin to make it up to the top you see
and it was er they used to great pride in their in their er stacks because they had to make them as neat as they could and er well built so that if the so that w that was good for the to keep the wind keep them dry
and er and then people took great interest in making as bonny as they could in the top to make a fancy top what they called erm c corn UNK
er you've maybe heard of that
now tell me about this
well er they did them they made them f fancy kind of things on the top like a they would maybe UNK and things like that and m make a UNK thing like a just like what some folk has a UNK on their UNK well we made that on the top of the stack
and every farm used to farmer lad used to see where who could make the best looking one
then there was always the harvest home dance and then the school that was the only place we had to dance in that day and they had it UNK with various kinds of the c corn UNK and erm
what type of shapes of corn UNK were there
oh they were they were er UNK and er and r and some of them would be UNK
but most of them were just a UNK kind of a thing and then some would be have a round bit and then this little corn dolly this little n UNK on the top
that was that was you see
mhm
like that
that wasn't the same thing as the maiden
the UNK the we what we called the maiden was the last sheaf it was cut er the last sheaf in the on the er on the fields was called the maiden sheaf
it was great thing to keep it and it was always kept and looked after until the following year
who got the maiden
oh the whoever the whoever the farmer at least the it used the what would i say
the UNK on the farm
we
didn't have a UNK it was just my brothers that was there at the time
but the sheaf was always cut the last sheaf was cut then it was er put in the barn and kept there for the year and
that was called the maiden sheaf
mm
and what was the purpose behind the custom
oh it was just er just i suppose luck just an idea to have the last sheaf it was called the maiden sheaf
mhm
and every farmer up the glen would do this
oh yes everybody had their last sheaf
th looked after it aha
oh great competition it was in my day about who could build the best stack er you know both in the hay coles and the and the harvest time
so and then of course we had our own UNK mill and we did our own UNK but it was great fun down the glen when they got the UNK mill in
it was er you know they came with a big UNK engine and the UNK mill and then they got up early in the morning and there was the man that looked after the UNK mill and UNK from the carts onto the onto the mill
then there was somebody cutting string cutting the sheaves you see
and then there was the man to look after the rest of the straw and another one for the what we called the calf and the corn oh it was a great day the day the UNK mill came to the glen
what was done with the calf
the calf was er the calf was the UNK you know from that
aha that was just went in it was all blown to the side and that was it was kept just for the for the carol beasts for the sheds you see for the that was what the what we saw what they UNK them down with that
mm
the calf mhm
and say your mother and UNK day was it used for UNK at all
er yes they did that
yes the best if there was a dry time a dry stack they kept that very best but for the calf beds both for the UNK and the house
you know there was no downs fancy things in my day when they were i was little you see
mm
going back to the harvest time
mhm
yeah
away back in time or maybe what your
yes
mother told you
yes
did folk come from other parts to help with the harvest
yes the tinkers used to come up from UNK to do that long ago
i remember myself one time we had we had two grand fields and it were they were almost ripe when it came an awful time of rain and they were just a sort of UNK
so father had to get the men up from UNK there was six of them that came
er well there was and their wives
and they just had this the er you know the what was i to say they had their s UNK to cut the what was i to say
they had their UNK to cut them with you see
and then the men cut the like that and then the women s they lifted the and the next lad he stuck them so that it was a very busy time
it was a UNK time for us because we had to feed the six of them w we put them into a big shed and they just slept there but we gave them their dinner they managed to make their own breakfast and their tea whatever they had bread and stuff like that but we had to make their dinner for them
so it took them days but we were very glad to have them because they were it was such a good crop and they were lying flat
mm
so that was did
how did you get word to them at that day
well they just went out and cut the round about you see even though it was damp they cut it though it was wet
i see
they didn't wait till it was dry
but i meant how did you get word down to UNK
oh they just there would always be somebody would be on the road at any time looking for harvest time and my father would say to someone tell the UNK we called them that time so the UNK came up went tell told the others
so the whole camp lot came up and er they oh but it wasn't only our farm they did other farms by
and then of course we had the mower and then we got a binder and now i see they've er a UNK
mm
it was a great thing the other day when i saw the combine UNK coming up the glen
but going back again to the
yes
the tinkers did they come up with their own UNK
yes they come up with their own UNK oh yes they all had that er and oh could fairly UNK too
mhm
and oh it was great to see them mm
th they sometimes brought their own two little boys with them and they would make the bands to cut them bands to do the sheaves so
did your grandmother i don't know if you had
aye i've a grandmother and everything
aha
time to listen much to her when you were younger
oh yes
but did she ever talk about the UNK the UNK
no she never said that no
the men and women that used to go with their own UNK
yes that oh that was a l that was in my great UNK time that they went there
that was the mhm
no there was none of that near in our time
but in my great UNK time i think they did that
where did they come from
from UNK and district that's usually where all those working people came from
mhm
great l vans of them used to go round the UNK doing that
and did some go from the likes of UNK or UNK down to the UNK
no i suppose they had but er i no that i knew of
that was beyond me
mhm
that's away back
that was further back that was in what i would say my great UNK time
mhm
mhm so that's a hundred year ago and more
mm
a hundred year before yourself
yes
mhm
a hundred year before myself yes
now again say before the great war the first war
yes aha
what other types of folk would be coming up glen ayloch
oh they were just all that kind all those working kind of folks going up the glen
a right decent lot of folk they were from UNK
there was the UNK and there was the er the UNK and UNK you called them and UNK that was the four lot
ooh hard working chaps they were too
honest fellows they were
and just last two year ago i met one of the older kind and oh she wasn't pleased where they used to do their put their camps
she somebody has UNK it off she says i could see them far enough she said we always had that bit for our camp and it was further down the glen
UNK in the glen did they camp
they'd camp just beyond the between the hotel and erm the what we call the round house UNK do you know where it is
mhm
well there was a bit there where they always used to camp
but then when they went up when they passed it just two year ago it was UNK off
and did the
mhm
UNK folks er have any things to sell
oh yes any amount any amount of pots and pans and UNK for your boots and what we call UNK that was cotton UNK
and thread and er then there was even great lots of things for your even ordinary pins they had that and anything you could near ask for they had it
tapes and yards of lace and er sometimes some of them would have even pieces of cloth for an apron if you know what an apron is
for a UNK
mhm
they were the better kind that managed that because they didn't have much money to buy them so
and then the men folk used to give them a bit of tobacco and stuff like that mhm
and sometimes if there was just a few of the men maybe two men in the camp they would come and help with even fencing or erm build up a UNK or something like that even drain they would stay for days if they wanted UNK the fields mm it was that
did they do any work in the woods
er no not no in my time no
mm
how about they old style pack man that used to come
oh er he used to come round with that aha
he used to go he came up when he would go from UNK and he would come up our glen and he would maybe walk over the hill to UNK or over the hill to UNK i suppose
he had a big pack on his back i don't know where he stayed he stayed in everybody's UNK or some place like that
there was a place he lived further down the glen and the old farmer said i've no objections to you going in there but give me your pipe
he would never let him smoke
you see he would be afraid for him setting fire to the UNK i suppose
and did the pack man have a name or
i think the only body that i knew was er an old man UNK you called him was a pack man at that time
he was a right old chap him
i think he was an UNK really the way he spoke anyway but he'd been brought up in UNK
mhm
so that was them
and what was this pack like
oh they had it well would just be anything it was just a long roll th great big roll just like it just sort of wrapped in a grey eh a big UNK kind of co covering and he would have er shirts and er things like that for men to buy or er and sometimes er overall or a UNK as we said for mother and the like of that
oh it was a great thing when the old pack man came to undo his rolls of things mhm so
and did he bring the news
oh yes anything that happened down the glen or way was heard that from the pack man so it was bound to be true
mhm
so folk looked forward to the pack man
oh i couldn't say for that
you know they looked forward to him coming round
aye aha
for a crack maybe
no oh he would no he had always his idea coming for to sell something
ah i see
aha
and then that's another thing he always got something to eat which was a great help of those days and especially if there was if mother was baking or anything like that he always got a UNK or something mhm
and er oh and if he if the time of the er tinkers that they came round if they came round about the time of the pig killing they would look for the piece of bacon
they hoped to get a bit of that if you know aha
can you tell me about how the folks long ago used to do the pig
how they killed the pig
oh it was a great day the day the pig was killed
you had to get up in the morning and see that there was plenty of a great pot of hot water boiling water
and then er the man that went round with all these knives and things he went down to the to the UNK if you ken what that is
and he got the pi and then held the pig and i never was at the actual killing but i know they did er then they cut its throat you see
and then they put into what we called the UNK great big round thing like a what we call it
er i suppose a tank now a round one big thing
and then they UNK and UNK and cleaned it and then they hung it up by the legs up pulled it up to the UNK up to the ceiling
and then er did the rest of the UNK and then they er opened it up and took out all the UNK and er the UNK and the lights and tongue and things like that
and it UNK go and it was there and it was left all night and next day erm the man came back again and he cut it down the back with a big saw and divided it up and then it was taken to the house where it was er up and then UNK in a big barrel
and then before that if you if you was to make the UNK the it that always had to be cut into bits and UNK and washed well in cold water and with salt and that and that was they would done that for three days before they were then filled up to make the UNK
but then next day after the s pig was killed up it was the head had to be cut into sections and well cleaned and left overnight in the salt water and to clean any bloody parts on it
and then it was boiled and boiled that it was er tender and that and then it was taken out and cut into bits and this is what a UNK head and then it was that was done and then er where the water what was boiled there was often fat but that was all UNK off and er next day there was as much water in the and er meat from the head was put in and UNK and salt and that and then it was boiled again and then put into little dishes and that was your UNK head
so that er it was good food for weeks on end
we had a fine dairy that we er of stone shelves and that kept cool when everything and it was good for weeks
so that was our UNK head and then the bacon itself was kept in er salt water
mm
and er it was UNK and then for a few days and then it was put in what we called UNK s more salt and covered and it would be there for six weeks
and then it was taken out and er UNK and cleaned and then it was hung up in the kitchen to dry and that was how the UNK were done
mm
and did you ever hear of UNK being used
yes sometimes we didn't use UNK but a lot of people used UNK in it too
i don't know why they did it
whether it was give it a better flavour or no i don't know but we never used the UNK
where did most folk hang the pig
they ha the er when it was cut up like that in the house there was er
UNK
there was UNK there was er UNK in er in most of the kitchens had UNK a lot of them and there was UNK just specially for the hanging the pigs and the er the UNK of the and then you left them until they were fairly dry and then you had to cover them well and truly with a for all summer because the fly would go for them if the weren't properly UNK and dry
and that would have been an awful loss if you had lost a ham
cos if the blue fly went there and UNK got into it would just be a job
mhm
can you tell me about the older type of houses up the glen what they were like inside
oh i don't know
they were just o ordinary little places all the places that ever i was in they were yes the kitchen and that had we'd UNK and then there was er the fireplace a just er generally just like were two stone and there's UNK across
they were like that
and er any bigger kitchen there was nearly always er what we called a box bed in it and er it was er that was where the mother and the father lived
now elizabeth up glen ayloch what types of area where most of the houses built on
was on the heights or was it in the UNK
no they was on well just the side of the hills the most of the houses were that
there was very few there was very few houses built high up
in fact well there was UNK was it was built up high on the hill side
and another one was UNK it was high up it was far above the road
and what were the parts of the glen called
well the place where i was lived up we were called er the we were upper UNK over passed the fence aha
i think my granny used to speak about the UNK at dalvaine when there was er about five or six houses there and the that was the that was upper UNK
and the next lot was UNK and then the next part of the glen was UNK and then there was the UNK and then there was the curtain of glen ayloch er that was where the market used to be held at the curtain of glen ayloch where the hotel is now
there's very few who'll speak about the curtain i think now cos they speak about the hotel but we say the curtain of glen ayloch and then and then further down was UNK ends and that was our lower end of the glen so that was there
mm
in your UNK day were there quite a few folk
oh a great lot of folk even round about m our place there was forty people
at our wee place er you see my grandfather had the meal mill
mhm
er and er so he employed somebody there and then was the little farm at the time
and across the way there was another farm a little one it was called UNK was UNK and there was dalvaine and then there was er dalvaine cottage and then there was another house called the UNK
and another one at the UNK at the UNK was called the UNK dalvaine
mhm
and the people that lived there was were there for the season but they would help with the harvest so they go UNK and fencing and er r and at the time of the shooting season they would be employed with UNK man and dog man or something like that of long ago
and who were these people
er the who came to the be the shooting tenants
oh we had it was the UNK we had at that time
mm
and then they let their big house er at UNK to sir anthony UNK was even there and erm a lot of those kind of people were there
and who else was there
er well a lot of the people was there
and then there was er UNK and UNK and UNK the tobacco people
they were another set of people that had it
mm but who were the people that used to help out with the UNK and
no the men that was work oh the men that was just there was oh those names was the one who came for the shooting season
mhm
but you know you mentioned that people used to help out with the dogs
oh they were helping there
oh there was a lot of them there was UNK and UNK and er UNK and UNK and goodness knows any amount of them
they were glen folks
they were glen folk yes
and UNK he was a grand lad he could do everything near
mm
he was he could plant trees he could er you know he did that and he could see to planting and er and looking after woods and things of that kind
you mentioned there the UNK of dalvaine
yes that was where UNK is aha
that was what my granny used to speak about that place
mhm
we all the little folks round about it
and are many of these houses now in ruins
they're all in ruins yes
and there's a bit a very a very aye one that my father used to tell us about it
long ago the UNK of UNK angus they came up to spend the summer m summer months at dalvaine
and down by the water side it there's a sort of a UNK just you can see it and he said that was where they stayed a little UNK there
and the UNK used to come up and then they would stay and have their meal in UNK down at what they called the UNK or the UNK and then they would walk over the hill of UNK right up until they came to dalvaine
and i suppose it was some of my great UNK or some of them had the looking after of them
they had to see that they were provided with milk and butter and eggs and er UNK and the rabbits and things for their food
this old this old lad he was called james graham of long ago
well
mhm
so that's many hundred years ago now but it is er it's not long ago since i read that in w in museum in ayloch
ah
but er but i've known that story about the er about them coming up that way and they stayed at the UNK at dalvaine
and h you heard it from your father
yes aha my granny too spoke about that this lad he'd to look after them
so not only did you read it you heard about it
mhm
i heard about it and then i read about it mhm
i see
mhm
and you mentioned the UNK where they used to live did that have a name
where the UNK lived
the UNK li the UNK lived at the UNK at dalvaine that's what they call this little place
in fact you could see it near yet the where it is round about dalvaine
it's just i it's just opposite the house the farm house at dalvaine on the right hand side there's the there's the old lime UNK it's there
and then there's UNK of er you know you could see where the old foundations and things were
that's so that's there the UNK used to stay
mhm
lots of long ago
mhm
did your grandparents mention any other parts of the glen that used to used away back in time that are just ruins now
no i don't know anything no
the only thing is another old place that in was UNK there used to be a chapel there and it was called the hunt chapel but it's just a hunt now
and there used to be a little croft there of long ago and it's er it's all planted now with trees all round about it but i suppose they could still see where they used to be a black smith had stayed there
i don't know why they'd ever had a little place UNK but there was UNK near everywhere
mm
long ago
mhm
and then there further up the glen from me from our house there's a place called UNK it's a little place in the beside the water and beyond it there's a great piece of ground on the hill and it was called er UNK reed where UNK where all where UNK men stayed when they came to burn down the bonny house early UNK castle
and where about was that now
that's er you know h have you be did you ever notice the old building at UNK
aha
well that was where the where UNK and them came and they burnt it down
and his people were er UNK roundabout where they were lifting everything they could i suppose to eat and kill or something
but this piece of ground was always called er UNK reed
and that's where
UNK men stayed the
mhm
the soldiers
UNK is the actual
that was opposite er further up the glen from me from
mm
dalvaine
it's up and it's past it's UNK in the UNK i it was to be a UNK of long ago too UNK
mm
and then across from that is er there's UNK
mhm
and the and it's up there
very good
that's ancient history anyway
and were there many er local parts named by the people of the glen
hills and rocks and all sorts of things
there's a place just across the water from us and it's called UNK that's a nice little flat bit and er and UNK was another one and er
they seem to have a gaelic sound to some of these names
mhm there's there all gaelic there with gaelic was spoken in the glen ayloch many years er even though the lower end of the glen didn't
our folk up at dalvaine and that they spoke the gaelic long after it was spoken down the glen
is that so
mhm
my granny could speak it well and my great granny she could speak it and read it
i don't remember her of course but i've heard my father and them speaking about it
and could your mother
oh she never spoke it er she was a lower glen but she didn't speak it
and didn't like it either
mhm
so roughly when do you think the gaelic UNK from the upper part
yes oh
of the glen
yes
it er oh it UNK er none of us oh no just a word here and there some of them spoke it
wait till i see now
when i was at school UNK be eighty year ago the people there er spoke it
the he was the old teacher and he and his sister never spoke anything else but the gaelic
you called them UNK and er he was good
this UNK he was to be a minister and he was a well educated man but unfortunately he'd made a mistake when he UNK his sermon so he gave it up
why i don't know but his sister and him never spoke anything else but the gaelic
mhm
i mind of them when i was little fine we used to go in and see them
so that was them so that's eighty years ago
mhm
and the upper part of the glen had gaelic far longer than down the bottom
oh yes an yes
from our lot yes up that way
but then it just all died out and died out and there was nobody then
my father had quite a lot of gaelic words quite a lot
so that was that
but going back to some of these places you mentioned were there any rocks that were given a name or stones
up w oh i suppose there would be further up the glen aha
you never heard any stories about certain stones having a
no a name no
oh there was the stone i ken the big stones in the road up the glen er what we called the UNK er it's a great huge stone and it has a right story about it
it
aha
it was the th the old man that lived in er u up in mount UNK he didn't like the folk going to the kirk and he lifted this big stone and fell down
so that's one of the stones is called the glen ayloch the UNK the UNK mhm
again going back into your grandmother
time aha
and UNK time did they ever mention to you whether folk use to cross from glen ayloch into other UNK
oh yes there was a there was an er a er a right of way between glen ayloch and glen shee and especially out of what we called our hill
i've walked it myself
you walked out glen UNK into loch UNK and then down into glen shee and er go out that way
that was called glen UNK and there is a stone out there a great huge stone oh that was called UNK i've seen that many and if you went there you if you got the length of UNK you looked right out the hill right out to glen UNK
and who would be using these tracks
oh there was tracks there's is that and the fact er they can go out that way with their land rovers and things
mm
now
but you know in those days
oh no they'd just a pony
mhm
a pony or their feet i walked it myself but er right out that way
what a pony to carry stuff
er yes a lot of folk went out that way with their ponies er in fact that's how they used to take the men when any glen shee person died in glen ayloch they took them out that way to the kirk here in glen shee kirk
mhm
oh the dead er out that way
i think about the last ones that was taken there was an old man UNK that died at er dalvaine and they carried him out that way
and when my father spoke about he got a UNK they got a holiday from the school that day because the teacher came to see this old body going out the glen that's body and they walked out so it'd be two miles out and then maybe another three miles up the er glen shee kirk here so they had a good bit to carry him
that was a glen shee man
yes and it was UNK you called him
he was
mhm
and
he was an old UNK
mhm
and that was that was how he wanted back to glen ayloch back to glen shee
there was other UNK too that lived further up the glen but they were taken round on the road way
they weren't UNK carried over the hill
so that was them
was there ever a custom mentioned to you whereby they used to put a UNK down
oh there's a er there is that there's a UNK there was a man lost on the hill of UNK and there was a UNK put there
i don't know UNK it is now but it was there
yes the and there's a place out glen UNK er at the march between glen shee and glen ayloch and there's a fence er a gate or a steps at just the glen shee folk waited at that side to meet the glen ayloch folk to take the coffin over the UNK
is that so
they would they would never allow our men to go over but they would be there to take it
that's most interesting
and yes it was just an idea that they had they were there waiting to take the coffin over the UNK
they just wouldn't cross over
no our men wouldn't cross over with it but the glen shee folk would be there to receive it
mhm
and they would follow on behind but they wouldn't carry it
oh just funny old stories
now elizabeth who was this UNK you were mentioning
oh the blind UNK
oh he was a great lad what a great big strong looking fine looking man he was when we knew him
and er he go was p partly blind wasn't just quite but he and he'd two dogs with him
and er he went round and i don't know i never heard him playing the fiddle but they said he was very good at UNK but he was a grand one for old stories and er he was just doing farms here and there so then eventually he turned so old he'd only one dog and then er he died down at the d at a place called the UNK and this man d duncan he had just an er one of the er i think one of the tramps from UNK was working to him and he came up and told my father and my father went down to see about him you see him being in the parish council
and that was the poor old man he was just about away so they sent for the ambulance and took him down to UNK to they used to call that the poor house i don't know what they call it now but it was the poor house in those
mm
days and er but and so the father saw that he was safely there and the other then when he came back he went into the house and said to duncan er was you speaking to the old john old john UNK and f he said i was that and he said i'll let you see what my man got and this was the little bag of gold
you know he was that tramp must have been an honest man because father said there was quite a little of UNK in that and so i suppose it had been given to the parish and had seen that the man was properly buried and then they discovered that he was an UNK
but i don't know he was educated and all
cos he when he liked he could speak very well but how he'd taken to the road i don't know but he was well known er as the blind UNK
when did er the blind UNK pass away
oh that would have been i think it was between the wars i think between the time of the world wars
was after world war one anyway i mind of that so say it might have been in the twenties he might have done i wouldn't say proper
mm
but the might been that
and he used to come for years
oh he came r he came round er e everybody and everybody was kind to him just the sake of hearing him speaking
mhm
but his dogs didn't like men folk i don't know why if they d the men folk went near the dogs would UNK
but if any of the women folks which i've gone out with a bowl of soup to him many a time
and er you could even stroke his dogs but er the er i don't know how it is he said but they never say no to you
aha
where did he used to stay when he was up the glen
UNK he used to stay
oh anybody would take him in
he used to stay a lot with the UNK at UNK that was further down the glen
and he UNK with er stayed with the UNK at UNK he stayed er at night so that was oh and he used to walk all over the countryside
everybody knew the blind UNK and he had always his UNK on and but after a while i don't know the next time he came round i mind he had trousers on and we didn't think he was the same man at all no
was it just in the summer he came around
yes in summer times aha
so where do you think he went for the winter
oh it'll likely have been about UNK or UNK or some place just anybody who would have taken him in
but he would never stay except you know it always had to be in respectable kind of a barn or something he would live in least and in fact instead of that he would ra if it was good days he would rather lie at the UNK side
mm
you know he was an UNK man
so
how about the old mole UNK
did you have one of these men
oh we did that a great old lad he was
mhm
and i mean a great UNK he was to us he cried come here and see this and here was among all his little UNK he had a white one a pure white mole
i mind fine we all UNK round to see the old mole UNK with the white mole mhm
and i don't know it was truth he said i'm just collecting all the mole skins for somebody's mo for a coat but that was just a story i think
i don't know but anyway he got the white mole so he was delighted to see it
he didn't live in the glen
oh no he came from where did he come from now
UNK h i think he did
mm
we did have a mole UNK in the glen but he wasn't the regular he just occasionally
it was a man UNK i think was his name but he was the mole UNK
aha
and he but he wasn't so regular
no and we had another man i and i cried to him what do you call him again
i cried will i said there's a mole in this kitchen m mole this there's a mole of this garden will
and he said do you think sh she would need a UNK meaning me
and he cried do you think she would need a UNK and he held up a UNK but he came and put this UNK in the mole you know that's what they did they had er mole er UNK that had UNK with poison you see and then they dropped them in the hole and that was the end of the mole
was there a custom in the glen for folk to go UNK to one another 's houses
oh that was that was always done at new year time or at least it wasn't so much new year day as we called UNK day
that was the fifth of january that was old UNK was the fifth of january was january was y old christmas er chris er UNK day was old christmas day
and oh yeah we went round from one house to the other and you a whole week of it was more or less
you know you went there and there was UNK and singing and dancing and eating and drinking and this to party time all the way
throughout the rest of the year did folk visit one another
oh yes quite a lot
quite a lot of coming and going
yes and then we've UNK or UNK they all m met at each others houses and had great nights
and were there certain men or women that were known for their stories
oh yes and they were great UNK stories some of them too
aye
th what types of stories might be told
oh they would just tell you some extraordinary story they'd seen they'd heard seen a ghost or heard a ghost or a something
mm when he this man told a great load of stories and in fact it began it was really thought true
he always UNK that when he was going over the UNK that's the road between glen ayloch and UNK and glen shee he said i if you were at certain hour of the night he said as sure as anything there was a man on UNK pass you with this horse
he thought he heard the UNK of it in the roads oh it had awful stuff of that kind
but we liked to hear his stories
mhm
i'm sure
you could add a lot of your glen UNK stories to mine
no i didn't know much about the glen at all but no nothing exciting enough to speak about
you've more stories than i do
about
well i was brought up on the story
the two brothers that went away and they were driving a car and one said to the other watch what you're doing and the other said to him but i'm not driving so
that was too that
that's the kind of stories there is about her neighbours
aha
aha
that was er yes two and they were called UNK and one was a e UNK and the other one was will
and it was UNK that was driving and will he said mind where your about UNK you'll er you'll soon be in a ditch but UNK sake he said it's not me so they were both
about the other on be the pony that took him to the wrong house
oh aye that's another lad he was on his road home the pony used to after a drink in UNK in kerry the ponies nearly took the men home
but this lad make a mistake and he come down to the my sisters house and my sister and her husband took him in and he'd fallen and cut his UNK and after he was kind of UNK up he turned down and he said not a story about this now james
and that was to the horse
no it was to my brother in law
what did he s what did he say to the to the pony
UNK no
he that for he said he was that UNK
that they had looked after him and that's how she UNK down and said not a story about this now james
very good
so
were there any stories about UNK
no i don't think so
er i think there was something like that
you know in older times about folk having stored up lots and lots of money
aye well this man that i ke know he had quite a lot of money and he just gave a six pence to the kirk and he had always plenty of money when he died
but to make up for what he didn't pay he left a hundred pound to the kirk
is that so
aye that's so that's a s a long ago story
mhm
aye
you mentioned there about the old market
we'd a curtain market
yes
aha
that was long afore my day but th they used to always come to curtain market aha
it was a great day that day they came from UNK and UNK and the UNK and all met there with their and their or whatever they were to sell a horse the day of the curtain market
mhm
first heard father speak about that
there were a lot of horses
yes er they days oh yes everybody had that
and i've known i've heard of the glen UNK m men would walk out the hill to the market of UNK the UNK market they used to say likely going there for sheep or something i don't know that was beyond my stories
and what way would they take
they would go out glen UNK and past loch and then right over into glen shee and that up over the UNK elbow then
mhm
it was a UNK walk
that walk that i've one that i've walked it twice gone right out glen UNK and right into glen shee and down UNK down to the and come along and round in thirteen mile maybe twelve or thirteen miles
and did any of the glen shee folk come to glen ayloch
oh yes oh there was there was no dance unless the glen shee folk come along to it
oh yes there was great coming and UNK between glen shee and glen ayloch yes
a lot of them
they came to help each other especially at the UNK time the time of the UNK the sheep
whether they came to claim their own or not i'm not very sure sometimes
mhm
tell me about some of the old dances
the dances oh they were just great fun the dances
all met in the we met the school
it was the nearest to us and the next one was the glen ayloch school
but oh we we'd a lot of good UNK in those days and a girl at the piano
and then when things got a wee UNK better we used to have the UNK up from UNK from kerry to dance to the play at the dances
and of course the night of the gathering ball it was just packed tight with people hardly the school would hardly hold them all
and then they put up a big tent in the beside the school where you went out for your supper er it was that
s
and how many folk might be at the dances
oh there was more than a hundred near two hundred folks would turn up
a lot of them that came to the g to the gathering to the sports they would stay over just for the sake of getting the dance
and where was that
that was the tw always the first the second friday of august
it was the friday after the twelfth was always the UNK glen ayloch gathering and is yet and is going on for a hundred and s something year a hundred and what did i we say a hundred and twenty years since it was started i think
and what about for recreation what did the people do er you know away back before the great war
oh for recreation oh they made just er as i said they did er throwing the pudding stone and they di the and the UNK and if the p hammer and er a lot of them used to play UNK
they played that and then in the in the and in the evening there was a great lot of er UNK playing if you ken what that is
UNK you know but always father spoke about his and er they did that and then there was oh great ones for meeting in their own houses to fiddle
they were great UNK of long ago it's not so long ago that i mind there was five UNK in our kitchen in dalvaine just each coming with a just to have a night at the fiddle
who were the great UNK
oh there was the UNK especially
the UNK were always and charlie UNK the last of the f UNK but they were all great UNK there was the UNK and er my brother was a UNK my father and then UNK and their pipes
there was a ma two boys played the pipes and er and the UNK were UNK the
did
father and the son were UNK too
did the UNK have any local UNK
oh i couldn't say for that
you cannae mind some of the names
no
there's only one tune that i know and that was made in honour of my brother
he was about thirty years as erm secretary of the glen ayloch gathering and somebody made up a pipe tune and called it UNK tune
so that's the only one i know
mhm
that's just recently mhm
oh there was UNK and there was UNK and there was UNK and UNK and UNK all musical people of long ago
unfortunately i wasn't blessed with that
the only thing i was blessed with was the music in my feet
aha
for i was very keen on dancing
and what were the dances
oh we UNK all the dances you can think of long ago like UNK the UNK and the UNK and jackie UNK more UNK edinburgh and er oh i think we've near named them all up and down
did you ever dance the UNK
UNK was one of the favourite ones aha
you had to do that
and UNK and UNK more and er UNK edinburgh and jackie UNK and er UNK and UNK especially
UNK and all the and then a UNK and one of those kind of things
mhm
and a one step was another one
before i got my feet off i mean the doctor once said to me what did you do when you were young
i said i worked hard all day and i UNK all night
you well he said well it's done you a lot of good now then because your knees are still good
they're still right enough
i saw mrs granddad that she's got a new bike and i said i wish i could go that
now going back to the maybe
mhm
what your grandparents mentioned to you
mhm
did you ever hear anything about this business of them UNK whisky
oh yes they we were great our folk were great UNK of whisky
my people which is not a nice thing to say but it's true
it was an extra for them to do
and my grandfather and my great grandfather they were UNK you see
so they had every ch opportunity of d UNK the whisky
i don't know how it was done but they ha they apparently they did plenty of it
my father unfortunately he came on one of their little barrels out the glen but it was empty
aye
mhm
it had been they had put it out to the what they call peat UNK
and put it in er in the UNK you see it would UNK it would mature
i think it would make about two gallons of whisky i think he said the little barrel
and he thought he'd landed but it was empty it had likely somebody had got it before him
that wasn't what you called the a pig
no
no
no
was there a name for these whisky barrels
n don't know that i know just the whisky barrels they were a little i believe there was maybe a name for them
there used to be a great line of business up the folder part
yes up that yes
did you ever hear them talk about them UNK the whisky through the glen
yes they did that so my that old great UNK of mine they went fr from here to UNK with theirs over the hill
is that so
three or four of them aha with their ponies they would leave in the night and go over the hill
i've a bigger story about the end of our stories
a er and er it was kept secret for many a year but er the just when they were there the excise men came upon them and this old UNK of mine he was a big lad over six foot and he was quite sure that the man wasn't going to take his whisky
so he fought with him and took his stick from him and gave him a UNK on the head and he dropped and the story goes he says we'll go home now lads
so they made home but whether he killed the man or not we never knew
mhm
so that was the last and i don't think if he went back after that i think it had kind of frightened him least so my father used to tell the story
he took the UNK stick
aye and we have it yet it's in the family
what's it like
oh it's just a beautiful thing really
it's er it's like made of UNK and the upper part of it's all little UNK and a head like a head turned in like a h like the head of an a of a bird
and the door pit is about eighteen inches of steel and that was for them to UNK the thing to UNK their whisky little barrels you see
but old sandy we was sure he wouldn't UNK his
aye well that's fascinating
aye
and oh it was fascinating yes
and that was UNK for many years it had generations
and i came across it in my young day when i had no business but i UNK it out them
that was why it was ever brought to light so it's gone down to the next generation
did you ever hear the way they took the whisky to UNK
they took it on their on their they went with their ponies in their little barrels you see and they went on UNK over it
wh what way did they go
oh they we i do just well i don't know they w just idea over the hills by the map i don't know how they went
but did they have their routes
oh they had their routes yes
and they had to have their secret routes you see the excise men would be looking for them
it'd be some like times
oh i think i've told you about all that i can about the glen
oh no i'm not going to ask you so much about
the glen more
no

oh th the fireplace
ah can you mind some of the old names for some of the things
oh what all things well yes there is the you know there was the UNK there's the UNK and the and this and the
UNK
and the UNK and the and the shovel
and the
aha yes
and the
and then there was the UNK and the and the and the chain and the and the UNK for
the kettle
were there UNK on either side of the UNK
wee UNK that you could put things in
oh aye th yes the older kind has yes
in fact th the older kind i that i mind of there was places you could even sit in the UNK
aha
there was a se er a little seat situated in the great long UNK there was across and then there was the side that
mhm now what was that called
that was the n the UNK
aha
you sat in er the s the side
and you could easy sit in there and in this big place that i speak about there was two UNK
mhm
in each side like that
did you hear the word jam stones ever
that was well that was the jam stones we sat on
was it
aha
some people call it the UNK but you just sat on the jam stones
yes on the front
and what was an UNK
an UNK oh i think it had been a place a sort of built off the fireplace
i think
i ne i don't know i never was in a place where there was one like that
you mentioned the er UNK
aye the UNK aye the UNK
that's or the UNK
aye that's right the UNK
aye
UNK we called it c r a y a UNK
wh what did you call an outside toilet
oh that was just always called the little house
mhm
you never heard UNK
oh i think we did yes
i think we did speak about that the UNK but mostly it was just the little house outside mhm
how about UNK
oh aye i've heard
that
er
and
yes
the UNK jacket
that's right aha
the old men wore that
that's right
just like a UNK
mhm
but a UNK it was made like
aha
you know like you get jeans nowadays
er the very same aye
that was a UNK
a UNK
my grandfather wore that
that's right
that's where i heard the word
mhm
UNK
any of these old words now that you can think of
oh i could think about an awful lot of them i think
mhm
mhm
i may use them on mrs occasionally
a lot of them
say for the you know the UNK on the farm that they have
aha
oh yes there was oh yeah there was all the UNK for that there was the UNK and there was the plough and there was the UNK and there was the UNK and er wh whatever you call the UNK there was the UNK for the for this turnips or the neeps
what did you call the knife for UNK the neeps
neeps was the
UNK
the UNK
and that went in very quick on the end for you shoved it into the UNK
aha
picked
mhm
it up
the UNK you put in that the UNK the thing went in the neeps and then you cut that
mm
way you see the UNK and the UNK
mhm
what was the UNK
the UNK was the well just as you would say er just a hook but we called it the UNK y e u k
and that was used for
the UNK aha the UNK was thing like this and you dig that into the UNK like this and then the you did that to take the UNK off
i see
ah er the UNK
so your UNK was used for
yes for lifting the UNK up
it was thing with two UNK and you tap it in like that and it lifted the neeps then you did that with the UNK
mhm
it was a hard days work when you went up and down a drill like that lift the UNK and UNK lift the UNK and UNK and hope you get
i never ever did it myself like
aye you did that ye d that was why you did and you did your neeps
they had to be done like that and UNK and then throw the UNK in there and then the next day so that when the
laying the neeps is that what they called it
laying the neeps
er no when you laid the neeps that was UNK the neeps
i see
h UNK the neeps
mhm
they did that with the neeps so that when the man came along with a cart they could throw them you see
you had to lay them this way and that way
what did you call UNK the neeps
UNK the neeps was UNK the neeps you see
jim do that
yes aha
UNK the neeps
UNK the neeps and in aberdeen they called them UNK and y we had your UNK as the UNK they called it the UNK the UNK they cleared the did that to the drill
cleared down like that you know this side and that and then you shoved a and you did a f did a d leave one
it was an art er if you look aye all the time you cleared it down with this you see
on either side and then you just looked and shoved that out and then on you went
mhm
was that UNK
that was UNK the neeps
UNK the neeps
aye
UNK them
mhm
mhm
how about the hay was it called anything
the hay UNK well it was that was what i speak about a UNK tramp UNK where the hay r hay was the tramp UNK
we had the little coles that when you just when the hay wasn't just was just as dry as you'd want it they put it into hay coles little coles just little things about four feet that and then you'd put them into the tramp coles and that was where you UNK it
that's where they were well named tramp coles i've
UNK them for my er round and round on them
were the were the coles er would you talk about them being UNK
aye that was UNK aha
had to cut the UNK or the UNK and UNK them that way
is that what you did up at the top of the
yes
aha
you UNK them that way
UNK
mhm
and that's then when you put on the UNK on the top
that was the time when you did the fancy things on the top aye
aye
now did everyone in the glen UNK the
oh everybody UNK their
the coles the same way though
oh i think so
mostly all the same after the same style mhm
they didn't UNK the hay stacks though well yes when er there was the tramp coles and then they broke them into what they called the big hay stacks but they were great big round great big
mm
big round things and
and then what was a stray UNK
a stray UNK was a kind of er like a house
aye and it had a roof on it like a house shaped like a house
er just like aye yes that was a hay UNK aha
stray UNK
what type of roof was that then
well it was er
well just like a hut
it was f just like a house with like a roof
what was it made with
it was made with the s with er UNK of hay
is that so
mhm
you could make a hay UNK now with a with square UNK of hay
they cannae do it now with the rolled UNK great rolled UNK of hay they have now
and going on to the corn the er time when it was ripe was there a test that the farmer would use to see that his corn was ripe for cutting
oh he knew that fine
went round and put his hand in to see if it was dry
in fact if it was dry down to the band they would near take it in by that time you with the bands round the middle
aha
but oh they could UNK it and they'd they just knew by the just did this with it you know they would know
didn't they taste it
oh near about it aha
didn't you they just knew
mm
mhm
now wasn't it supposed to be UNK to be the last in cutting your corn
oh there were never no word about that no
now can you t tell me about how it was bound into sheaves
oh fine it was just all you got this it was an art in making the band
you got the band and you put them like that and you twisted it round did that and then it was a long band you see
now what was the band made of
it was the corn you see
you just took two big UNK of corn
and they were awful thick
and you did that with them and then laid it down you see and then you gathered your sheaf and put it on that and turned it round and gave it a twist like that and then and that was how it was done
UNK
now
the sheaf to the side
was that done on the same day as the corn was cut
oh just as soon as it was cut
mhm
just as soon as it was cut you in fact you'd to go er ev everybody in that day you'd maybe have maybe thirty yards and you'd all those l sheaves y that was your bit
and you did that and then you had to wait until the machine came round again and that was you again you'd a whole day at that
who usually did the band
well you could do your own bands but you were awful lucky if there was only the UNK about and they did your band for you
if you made it and laid down them the man that was doing it he'd only to lift that and give it a UNK and on to the next
mhm
and what size was your sheaf
oh just a good arm full a good arm full of a sheaf you would have to put down
the man that was on the mower they had an eye to that they would just wait until it was off the where it was cut you see
he sat on the cutting machine and then as it come on to the ah but what do you call the long thing
e he just pushed it off with a long thing like that and on they went and did it
mhm
see
well what does a binder do then
oh the binder did that itself
aye wa the binder UNK string
the binder yes the binder could do that itself
and then through off the sheaves
yes
tied up with this string aye
you see
mhm
now
the binder was a great help you see it was on a had the cutting and then it went on to the platform and the it went up
aha
and then it came down and then er
all tied up
the well the cutter UNK down the cutter came out and did that with it
mhm
mhm
the binder UNK was in this thing you see and it went
mm
over and then it tied it and then it was cu then it fell down
and then you wouldn't have to go round the fields doing the sheaves
oh no
aye if it well sometimes if the binder wasn't cutting it
aye
properly you've to go down round and see about it
mhm
now you know at the top of the UNK
aha
were the sheaves bent over
yes
can you tell me about that
oh but er they were they were built round and round and as you come up what they called the UNK of the sheaf the
this is just the wee ones
so
and yes
the wee UNK
er the UNK was aha
aye that was it
it's more the UNK i'm meaning you know with the
oh yes you had er the UNK you had i think ten in a UNK you had five sheaves at each side you put them like that five you
mm
see and that was your UNK
that was like ten sheaves
and was there one came over from the top
no
no
no
just a and you'd to set them right we had to set them that they've stayed like that
now how did you do that
well you just got into the way you lifted them and you just look my UNK are
mhm
you just lifted them you and you just set them like that
mm
was that to let the wind blow through to
yes
dry them or something
and then you just got another pair and you put another pair like that until you had five
mhm
that was like tying UNK
ten sheaves in a UNK
how long would you leave your UNK in the field
oh just until they were dry maybe if it was a grand time of wind maybe say three days
and if it wasn't my goodness it was a job when it come wet weather and it maybe be lying flat and it all had to be set up and we had UNK for days
you didn't weight them in any way
no
no
no
that's more the bigger stacks
aye aha
but what i was going to ask was before they were made into a stack were your UNK made into larger UNK
no the UNK were just UNK all the time
and then made into a stack
yes and then they've were UNK up in the carts what the UNK are nowadays and then they would have made stacks and stack yet
but with they the hay coles that was
oh the hay coles were different they were different altogether
tell me about that again cos that was interesting
well when the hay was dry th it was UNK up it was all er when it was cut it was lying in what we called UNK you see
and then maybe after it'd been cut for two days you were sent out to turn the UNK up all you went along and you turned them and turned them
and maybe next day you would have to turn them again t to dry
and then they were UNK into well we just er if they were dry they were UNK into big UNK to be near where you could build the tramp coles but if they weren't you would put them into little coles and the and then they were the little coles was put up t together to make a bigger one
and how did they do that
well they just er they just UNK them they brought up the side what i said the boss you see
i don't know what you call the boss to be right drag point for
mhm
any way that was it and you st and you f UNK them all round and you after it was er up you was put up to do the UNK round and round and you every UNK you took it and saw that it was laid down and UNK it round like this round and round and round and then the next one till it was up
now why did you tramp them
well to keep it firm
because
mhm
if you didn't the wind would soon blow them down
sometimes it blew them down anyway
but if they was good hay and that and you UNK them down they stayed for ages
did they not did you not tie rope over them or something
mhm
and a brick on the end of it
sometimes a bit stone aye
seen you do that
mhm
and did you UNK our tramp UNK
yes
and then they would er they would the tramp coles then you would er put this rope up over that side and then you'd put one over that side you see and that was that would be safe for a long time
and after the UNK they would take in those big tramp coles and bring them into the big hay stack
mm
this great big round thing the head of the er you've seen pictures of them
great round things like that and up and up
and how was it built
just the same
it was built er it has to be it had to be very well built and firm because then when it was used for the cow for the er sheep usually that best hay was left for the sheep
you got what they called a h hay knife
a great big thing about that length maybe and you cut the hay in great UNK after that and then you see you carried it out to the sheep
it was a great art i in having a good hay stack for the time of the winter time for the sheep
now under the lowest layer of the sheaves were there any stones or branches or UNK ever laid underneath
yes they were yes under that
now what was that for
that was to keep it UNK
that was to keep it UNK you see
grand place for rats too
oh aye
to keep them off the ground
aye
but that didn't keep the rats off the rats went in supposing but er that was to keep the stacks UNK
and the stacks weren't built around a central pole
that's the boss she's speaking about
no the bo
no
no not a central pole no it was just always a boss
mhm
a big boss aha
and
well in our district why i suppose other folk had different ways but i just speak about our lot aha
there wasn't any s customs about the stack that if you went round it er UNK it would cure your UNK
no i never heard that stories no
mm
well that's very good
did you ever hear the word UNK being used for a pole that was placed against a corn stack to keep it from
of course er
UNK
er oh that was er we called the things that supported the we called them UNK
UNK long bits you know t we had them we had maybe four at a stack to keep steady for all winter
mhm
how er long were the UNK
oh they would be ten feet long anyway
mhm
long UNK they were they would be about that
was this local wood
er yes we just oh they were well looked after the er UNK some of them called them UNK
UNK
UNK instead of UNK
aha
very good
mhm
mhm
that was something to stay them you see
mhm
stay them s firm
aye well there's a lot of old words there
i told you that
aha
aye
and did you ever use the expression on a different subject er a burn sticks
a bundle of sticks
aye no
aha
oh i my mother called that now what would you call a bundle of sticks
just a bundle of sticks
aye but there was a way for carrying that
oh no
mm
was that done on the back
mhm
what would you call that again
mother had granny had it anyway
then it was burden but that wasn't the right word either
that might come back
aye come back
i'll mind it sometime mind when your away maybe
mhm
were there any words to do with eggs
my m my memories not nearly so good as it was
mrs
mrs says it not bad for my age but there's lots of things i forget
if i mean to mind a thing i never mind it
mhm
and then it'll come back just like that
on the tip of her tongue quite often
aha
so
but your mother had a lot of the old words
er she had but not so much as father
mhm
but father had a lot of gaelic words
mhm
mother had a lot of good words too i must say but er it was him we learnt a lot of wor and granny especially you learned a lot of words of hers
mhm
mhm
what did you did you have a word for UNK
UNK
UNK
no it was just UNK no
mhm
we didn't use it often but i know what you mean
or cheese
mhm
cheese was a UNK
mhm
what was a UNK
a UNK was a UNK in the door
a UNK
a UNK aha
a UNK was a it was a lo just a line of er a piece
you've got one on your gate at dalvaine
mhm
UNK
was it you lifted
yes
yes
mhm
you lift it with had a thing like that and a UNK like this
and it lifted up and then fell down you see
now a UNK what was the word
a UNK an apron a UNK
you never used UNK
a UNK my UNK used a
aye
UNK that was an apron was a UNK
watch your UNK
that's right
UNK
mhm
how about an UNK
an UNK was just an a flat plate
mhm
UNK shaped
mhm
was an UNK
what you get a UNK on you
mhm
know
UNK
aye mhm
a UNK
a UNK oh that was er a UNK storm was a UNK
aye
what was that name
a UNK storm was the time we were just in from april when the UNK were laying and there'd just a come a UNK of snow
just like what we had the day
aha
like that maybe a UNK worse but anyway that was the UNK storm
UNK storm
and that was always about the fourteenth of april
er today about the sa so if you see one you'll be saying this is the UNK storm
how about if it was UNK
a UNK
mhm
oh just a UNK of rain was just a kind of hardly a UNK
just a UNK
mhm
if you was UNK home you would just get a UNK of rain on your faces
that's just a UNK of rain
like a UNK
if somebody was UNK for UNK legs
aye he was UNK
UNK
aye UNK
UNK
he was a UNK aha
or UNK
UNK
aha
oh well a UNK things always a UNK a UNK thing er
aye
harry had a UNK stick
aye
just like that other guy
i hope get on better with your glen UNK women than me
oh no y your you
your dam boards
tape number one hugh final year student school of scottish studies
UNK hugh my father on UNK practices
fifteenth of november nineteen ninety
is that picking up
aye
it's picking up
but he says it's got this wee arrow here's got to be in the middle of this dial you know
so er well if you want to tell me if i was starting as a riveter boy right if i was wanting to start as a riveter boy what would i do
would i go to the yard or would somebody speak for me
well on a lot of occasions people were spoken for
aye
er by their fathers and UNK and brothers that
right
who had already served their time er
mm
in a yard
er as far as i can remember er you would start as an apprentice riveter and you would do sort of odd jobs within a s a squad rivet
mm
squad
er maybe heating rivets or putting in rivets until such times as er you were deemed fit to become a member in apprentice squad
and again apprentice squads done er lesser jobs than the UNK such as er UNK etcetera that were not on UNK and er filling in the odd er UNK here and there that er were left out while a riveter was progressing with his job
and erm that would carry on until such times as when the foreman or whoever would UNK them fit to be a squad that could carry out er a heavier job if you want put it that way where they would progress on to heavier plates etcetera and do UNK work
but would a erm apprentice squad was it known or was it common or was it known at all for an apprentice squad to start off as apprentices like you start off in maybe four or five years become apprentice squad and work as a squad and do light jobs that you're talking about would
mhm
it be known then for that squad just to go right through the UNK and become a fully UNK squad and work for their days as a squad
or would they inevitably break up and go to work with the experienced squads
well it would be i suppose it would be possible that they could start their time together and work right through for years together but invariably er that didn't happen because people were picked up and laid off as the boat progressed er and if er y you may get a run for the one yard would need say six squads of riveters in a hurry
and you might get a man that was er idle say for two or three month and the foreman would pick him up and say well you know can you put a squad together for tomorrow morning
mm
and he would then go round picking up his mates and say er you know i need a holder on i need a rivet boy etcetera until such time as he got a squad together and that squad would start in the morning as a squad
mm
but it didn't necessarily mean that they would stay together all the time the they may they may even fall out with one another
er and one of them may decide that he was going to another job anyway you know and he would leave and somebody else would be brought in and what have you
so it didn't necessarily mean that you get a squad of riveters that would stayed together all the time erm for various reasons as i say they may have been unfortunately some of them might even die and therefore you had to make up the squad again
mm
so in that sense er very unlikely you would get a an apprentice squad that served their time together and went right on through to retirement age or whatever
mm
er invariably you would find up they broke up somewhere or other
and would an apprentice like somebody who'd say served say five years as their time once their time was out would it be common for them to be kept on
i don't suppose it would be thinking about it now because they would probably have to join the queue like everybody else would that be right
once their time was out they lost their UNK or their UNK
mhm
would be completed so therefore became one of the market type of thing
well unfortunately er it was the practice of UNK for a long number of years er to have maybe two or three squads of riveters that were kept in a yard on a sort of permanent basis but you would invariably find that most of the squads would be sacked when the boat was launched and taken back on again as they were needed
so again an er because of that squads were never or very seldom er kept together throughout their whole working life you know
and they were laid off i mean squads were laid off even before the boat was anywhere near finished
they were
oh aye
just laid off when there was UNK squads and
that's right
sail squads and UNK
there were
squads and
there were there were riveters deemed to be shell men or riveters deemed to be er UNK as you say where they worked on cases etcetera
ah most squads were on piece work but you might find that you had if it wasn't an apprentice squad you might find that you had a squad of riveters who weren't on piece work who simply went round doing any wee odds and ends that had
mm
been missed out here and there or
aye
whatever
mhm
within the radius of er what would you say
a double bottom say for instance you might get rivets that were missed out
an inspector would go in to inspect the tank before it was tested and he would back come out and say you know there's so many rivets missing in there
well there'd be a squad of riveters would go in and put them in before a tank was tested
so you invariably find that they weren't on piece work
they were on a make up system sort of thing where they had a wage but it wasn't the wage that the piece work squad would have
did they di do you think they i was going to say enjoy there but i do i don't think that'd be the right word but d did they like or did they prefer to work piece work or was it something that they UNK or i mean there was more money to be made at it wasn't there
aha
but i mean it was a hell of a way to work at the same time
well it was a system that er wasn't liked but it was operated because in my opinion anyway because the employers er had seen it as a way of getting more work out of you
obviously er if er you came in the morning and you weren't feeling to good for whatever reason then you couldn't UNK back and say och well i'll just take my time with this
you were on piece work you got paid by the rivet sort of thing so you had to go ahead with it
and therefore it was a system the employer encouraged but of course er i don't think you could say that there were many people who were happy with the system
did they see it as working themselves out a job occasionally
oh aye er there was always that in the back of their mind that the more rivets they put in per day although it meant more money at the end of the week possibly er it also meant that the boat was therefore progressing or the ship was progressing that quick that they were getting nearer the gate as the saying went
er and they were actually bringing on there own unemployment
so what would a riveter have done then once they were once their job was completed they were put on the on the street basically
was it easier for them was it easy for them to pick up work or would they have been UNK would they have to face a long time on the dole or
well i would say that erm in my time er when they became unemployed most of them could pick up a job pretty easy because i was speaking about from nineteen forty eight onwards and of course er it was shortly after a war there was plenty of work and therefore most of them could pick up a job in a reasonable space of time and they wouldn't be idle too long
but i UNK if you were speaking to some of the older men in the UNK er who had worked in a UNK before my time that er a lot of riveters a lot of UNK of all kinds found it hard to get employment once they were they were sacked you know
in fact er on many occasions they would have to move out of town to get a job
yet they had this sort of erm this sort of feeling about them that they created themselves that they were sort of cock of the rock within a UNK
was that
mm
based
purely on the money aspect or something else
well it was based er basically on the fact that they could earn more money than most UNK in the yard at that particular time er i would say that
they worked hard for any money they got er but basically this was the idea that they could earn more money than say a joiner or a UNK or whatever and therefore they had a wee bit of pride in themselves
so did they think they were doing themselves a UNK then when they maybe when they amalgamated or when they became part of the UNK or when the UNK started taking in various trades to approach the employers as a as a black squad unit for wage rises and conditions and so on or did they would they have preferred to have done it themselves do you think
as riveters
well again going back to when i started my time etcetera
most people negotiated their own wage
er it wasn't like er you know the employer would meet you and discuss a wage rise for a whole yard
most people done their own negotiating
the riveters done theirs the joiner done his the UNK done his what have you
er and that was the system and of course the thing was that with the riveters being on piece work apart from negotiating a wage you were negotiating what was known as a price list and er whereas you would get x amounts of shillings or pounds for so many hundred rivets or whatever it was then the argument would be that price should be UNK because of the cost of living going up or whatever you know
so how did the work out because as far as i know the riveter got the cash and then he UNK up the money between
mm
the squad
well that practice did go on for a long number of years where the riveter was the was the boss of the squad and on the friday night when er where it came knocking off time he would collect the wages and he would divide that up between the squad which would be a holder on a rivet boy er maybe a UNK in er again in my time that was mostly a squad
other at other times you would have er hand riveters where you had maybe two riveters and a holder on and er a heater as they called a rivet boy
and again the riveter would be the th the charge of the squad sort of thing and he would UNK up the wages at the weekend
so how did they decide who got what
well i couldn't just tell you honestly about that but i think the riveters decided who got what you know
mm
er i never actually had any part in it but i heard UNK about er the rivet boy in particular the they would er they would give him a wage equivalent to what they thought was a was a reasonable wage for him because of the fact that they were on piece work he had to see that the rivets there on time
er in the morning he would be in before any of them sort of thing getting a fire lit getting the rivets heat up before they come on the job and ah the quicker he could the rivets heat up and passed on to the squad then okay the more they could put in so if he were a good rivet boy you could maybe get a good wage but again that was up to the squad up to the riveter
so your wages could UNK week in week out with not really
oh aye
having a great deal of
aha
er balance in t in terms of the amount
mhm
of the work that you done
it might just be a good week or a bad week
and maybe dare i say it
maybe if you were a clever rivet boy you could get more wages
aye
and the fact that it was UNK up in the pubs i
mm
dare say quite a lot of it must have been spent in pubs as well
well aye
er they say that's where most of it went on er they would go into the pub and the riveter would UNK up the sheet for the week and say well okay that's you know the holder on gets so much and the rivet boy gets so much and the riveter got so much and what have you
erm i don't know if i'm right in saying but i think they may have given a tip to other people like er the UNK boy there used to be a UNK boy
his job was to go back and forth to the store from the store to the job etcetera er up to the bin fill the bag up with UNK take the bag up to the rivet boy and er the UNK was used of course was used to heat the rivets
and was this a would this be a man that would do this or would this just be a boy
on most occasions it would be a boy but i have seen men doing it
mm and did they employ like boys from school
or was it did you have to be out of school
oh no you well again er as i say i i'm speaking in my own time er and in my time you were left school before you started in the yard at all aye
mm
what sort of tools did they have tools as such
you know the way a carpenter took various you know trade in his tools
i dare say a
mhm
UNK tools are more sophisticated but they had
aye
tools of a sort
well y most squads had their tools aye
they had er they had UNK they had again y even in my day you had some hand squads as they were called who would have their own er rivet UNK you know and hand UNK
well obviously they would look after them and keep them in good order and what have you so that there was no hold up with them trying to make a wage or whatever
er and when it progressed to automatic tools all these tools were kept in a store at night and you collected them in the morning when you went back onto the job
obviously most of them had them marked or had their name on them so that they would have the same er the same set of tools every day
now whether it made a lot of difference or no i couldn't tell you but they believed it er the set of tools they had were the best in the yard you know so obviously they took a wee bit of pride in them and looked after them
and do you think that the move from the hand UNK to the UNK tools do you think that made the job any easier
well i would say not being a riveter i would think it did make the job a bit easier for them
erm but there again UNK was never easy so it maybe took a wee bit of the hard work out it
but erm
i mean th they looked from the pictures they look fairly heavy like and i've never handled a UNK machine but i've
mhm
handled the UNK machines and they can be if you're working with them for a length of time they can get fairly heavy and UNK you know
oh aye
ah well er UNK machines were a pretty heavy item to be
mm
worked with aye and carry about with you
mm
er but er they devised various ways on their own to help them with these things you know they er i don't know exactly what it was called but you would see a maybe a riveter in below the in below the boat er doing the shell in below the boat and he would have a like a hammer a an arm that was UNK up for him er to give him an assistance with the machine to hold the machine up to you know to let him work with the machine
so they devised a lot of things themselves to give them a helping hand
and what sort of conditions were you working in at that time in the UNK
were they you know in general you know not just talking about riveters but in general for the work the workforce
i mean in terms of hours of work and tea breaks and whatever it is you had you know
time for the toilet and
well again er i would say conditions were terrible as far as i was concerned er a as far as tea breaks and what have you were concerned you didn't have any what we would call official tea breaks you simply took your chances and made a cup of tea and UNK behind a UNK or whatever to drink this er if you got caught by the foreman or the manager or somebody then you were more or less UNK on the spot
er so there was no official tea break
as far as toilets were concerned er the toilets to me were absolutely UNK that nobody should have been asked to use them
but there again er it was the time we lived in and you had certain well yards had their own way of trying to keep track of when a guy was in a toilet etcetera and sometimes you would have to hand in y your er your time ticket to the toilet attendant and you would give him this ticket and he would say right you are you know and mark down your number on a book and say to you well you've got seven minutes or something you know
so you had to be sharp
but in general conditions were pretty bad
they were
aye
they were
there was no doubt about that
what kind of hours were you working
i mean you started in forty eight
er you're working forty five hours aye a forty five hour week
and did UNK get any sort of erm protective clothing or anything that we got when i started in the yards
oh no
did you
no
er all the clothing you had was provided by yourself boiler suits boots er there was no protective clothing at all there were no protection for your hearing er there was no what we called UNK as such for er to save you from getting burned with scales off of the rivets with burning machines etcetera there weren't there was absolutely no er protective clothing at all unless you happened to be able to buy it yourself somewhere
and would that be common
would riveters buy protective clothing for themselves
well they would buy were a breed of men as far as i know used to wear what they called UNK trousers
they were er anybody that knows about UNK and there very heavy material er and apart from being hard wearing i suppose they in the winter time they gave them a wee bit of warmth in their legs etcetera
er and most riveters would try and buy UNK trousers
but again th there was no there was no clothes to be bought in the yard or issued in the yard or anything like that you simply bought them in the shops outside
mm
er and bought you could afford
mm
so the conditions were really very bad
mm
well i think we're running out of tape
mhm
so we'll need to finish there but thank you very much hugh
you're welcome
that's good
right if we could start again then
how many how many can you remember off hand riveters that worked as family riveters
er the brothers the brothers and the as you as you said there and the
then there was the big UNK and his father big wall UNK many more wait i see
big UNK mentioned a couple at me and i can't remember
mhm
what their names are
the there were the brothers too wee UNK and UNK and UNK
they all worked about the one squad you know
and where would the all that the families you mentioned there were they all port families
they were all port aye
they were all families aye
aye
and was it common for UNK squads to accumulate out of families
they were mostly made up of their families
most of the er UNK squads were friends or cousins or all they were all
aye
kind of near related most
aye
of the UNK squads
so a boy coming up through a family that was involved in riveters would sort of more or less
aye
know that he was going to go into UNK squad
he would aye
he would he would go in as a boy but a rivet boy a heater as we called them
would that not cause any UNK families working together
no i don't think it
no
i was thinking maybe when the money was getting split up you know
no well it had to be a fair share out
aye
with a riveter two riveters and a holder on and then the boy got so much to the pound
aye cos if it was like family you could lay it on to family easier than you could lay it on to somebody
no
if it wasn't your family you would need to come up come up with the UNK
the UNK split out right no
mm
every everybody got a fair share
mm
after the boy the boy was paid so much to the pound then the rest was divided three ways by the two riveters and the holder on
big UNK was telling me a story about a couple of riveters that worked together a family brothers or cousins or something and er she says that the guy was a riveter he used to maybe if the guy was on the inside holding on the riveter on the outside this i'm sure she said they were brothers he would shout one of them from outside you know shout his name and the boy would look through the hole you know and he's he would UNK on him he would UNK through the hole
see you had to go out and look through the rivet hole to see who was shouting in you know
there was another famous one and all about the and his fingers
mm
aye
and the thing about fingers was always black now with holding on to the UNK and then putting in UNK and UNK your fingers was get er drift was always on a in a pan a wee pan with oil in it drift was always full of oil and you stuck it in the hole
UNK it in
so sometimes i UNK it in sometime the other one would stick his finger through the hole and the riveter would be dying to be hitting it back he thought it was a drift you know
break your fingers
mhm
see the likes of old UNK talking there about the she was saying that pe people survived of that
who all got a co book
anybody that had money had a book co book
people that could afford to but somebody in the family had a co book
so every family had a co book
no
no
some of them couldn't afford it
some of them couldn't afford i you had i think you had to put something in
i think you had to kind of build up
you mu you had to have so much in the co
shares to get a co book
before you could er a black book you could get a co book
mhm
what they called a pink book you'd a pink
mhm
booklet
mhm
that they marked up your bought a load of messages so many
aye
two or three pounds worth of messages
and you got a wee cheque
this was written in this pink book it was full of wee cheques
and that two pound odd was writ into the this book
and that was put in for your dividend
you UNK
dividend and if your dividend had UNK to so much you would maybe be allowed a black book
you know they called this a black book
and you
could use that for your own family
you could lay you didn't have to pay that black book every week
you could leave that to the end of the quarter
you paid it every quarter
and pay it
and what sort of stuff did you get off the black book that you couldn't get the other way
well you could go into the UNK
well
department
you could go to the UNK the hardware the grocery anywhere gents clothing or anything like that
get everything practically that you needed from a black book
with a black book
but you had to have it paid every quarter
soon as it came to the end of the quarter
you know and if it didn't be paid you at the quarter it meant you di you wouldn't get anything the following quarter
and how long did you get at the end of the quarter to pay this
a couple of days
it was usually up on a tuesday wasn't it
if the co was up on the tuesday you had to have it paid for the saturday at least
on the monday
a UNK a monday or a sa aye well the saturday
you know
it had to be paid before the tuesday
mm
because that's when they UNK up
all the books was er audited
mm
on the tuesday the day that the co was up
and after that your
if you if you paid it the co was up on the tuesday you had to have it paid most people tried to pay it for the thursday and that was the turn of the leaf on the thursday and if you paid that then you could go straight away that day and get your new quarter stuff for the next quarter
you got until the saturday to pay it but if you paid it then that let you get the turn of the leaf and get more stuff for the next quarter
and most people were desperate to get stuff in them days you know they didn't want to wait till the following week so they tried to get it paid as best they could
before the end of the quarter
so that they could get it for the turn of the new leaf of the quarter
that new leaf didn't going into the next quarter and
so
the turn of the leaf didn't go into the next quarter
although you were still in the same quarter
mm
no
but it wasn't everybody that could pay it was very hard for some people
if you let somebody else get stuff on your book and some of them couldn't pay it you know you've no means of paying it
you might pay it yourself
sometimes the people that owned the book had to pay it for them you know
and wait to such times as they could pay it back
mhm
you know
that was why you mostly kept your black book for your own family
aye you didn't hand your book in you couldn't hand your book out to anyone you know
you didn't want to hand it but there was people in the port
that handed their book out to everybody because that way they got a lot of shares
they got a lot of dividend
and UNK all this dividend and they would have a right good black book you know
because a lot of money was going through there
aye
aye
they would get a good dividend of it
they got the good dividend
mhm
they got so much
to the pound
so they would get when would that be paid out
it was paid out
every quarter
every well just shortly after the end of the quarter maybe
the following week
that the they would tell you what dividend they were paying out
mhm
that for that quarter so the
i rem
following week you could go up to collect your dividend
mhm
so er i remember it half a crown to the pound but it was more before i remember that
i UNK i remember three and three and sixpence to the pound
aha
i think that was the biggest
three and sixpence to the pound
so anybody that had a big book UNK all this dividend
maybe three or four hundred pounds worth of stuff out
but they had to take on the worry of people that couldn't pay them
and was it common
very common everybody in port glasgow
mhm
used it
and
everybody we knew used the cooperative
everything was bought you bought everything
th in them days you hadn't got er what is commonly known now as hire purchase nowadays you know that mostly started after the war
that would've been
the only way of maybe not the only way but the easiest way for people to er get debt if you want to call it that was er to use this co book
and of course erm for some people it became a way of living and just
for most people it was a way of living
you mounted up a certain amount of debt you tried to get it paid by the end of the quarter
if you were lucky enough to be able to pay it then you had the dividend that came along with that
aye that was the people that owned the book
er but it took people busy to get it paid you know and in fact there was some people that couldn't er and it became a big worry to people
mm and what would happen if it came to the end of the quarter and you had so much money UNK to pay on your co book for stuff that you'd got over the quarter and you just couldn't pay it
what would've happened
or what did happen
well the person that owned the book
they would take it off your dividend
what have to pay that they would probably have dividend and they would pay that for you and you would have to pay them back
aye
but what if the person i'm talking about i'm not talking about
if you owned the book
the person who owned the book
mhm
if the person who owned the book regardless of who got stuff of the book
mhm
beyond that if they had bought stuff through the co and UNK a debt on that book
aha
and couldn't clear it at the end of the quarter
well they took it off your dividend
if it was like
if you didn't have dividend enough to clear that you would lose your book
you just so you just
you'd lost your book
so the debt would go then
you would
oh no you would still have to pay that
you're liable
no i if it was if it was the likes of a say for instance and i owned the book it was my black book and i ran up a hundred pounds on it
er and at the end of the quarter i couldn't pay that then obviously you got no dividend on it because you still owed them that hundred pounds but they would take the book away so you couldn't get any more
now that was a big UNK to people in them times because if you didn't live within
you were desperate more
no most people used it to get their er their er their weekly ration in
but you were living on credit that was like credit to you
mm
this book
you had no money on the monday morning so you would be in with the book and bought your messages
you see you got you got
you'd no money you just mark it up in the book
mm
you got your messages week to week it worked from thursday to thursday right
and you got a your week's messages every week
but the first week of the quarter you could get messages all that week which you didn't have to pay till the end of the quarter
every other week after that you paid them at the end every week
mhm
but that first weeks messages you didn't have to pay them till the end of the quarter which meant that people went in and bought things that week they never bought you know
mm
like f er dried fruit chocolate biscuits
aha
good polish and things that they couldn't really afford
that was a great week because they felt they were getting it for nothing till it come to the end of the quarter and then they had to pay it
and
so to get this you had to pay this because when it came to the end of the quarter you had to get your shopping out of that cooperative so that had to be paid
otherwise you wouldn't get any more co er cooperative messages so you had to pay that
wh what was it common i mean you were talking there about people would buy things that they never bought before
aha
but was it common for everybody to do that
most people did that it was like er
a wee luxury
a wee luxury a week a of luxury you know
you di you wouldn't maybe go over the score but you bought things that
what sort of things would you have bought
well i would have bought maybe dried fruit and er extra coal token you know you bought your coal tokens and your milk tokens maybe bought an extra coal token and erm maybe went and get a dozen cakes or something like that
what was the idea what was the idea of coal tokens and milk tokens why didn't you just buy why didn't you just pay for the coal and the milk
it was easier for the man that came round with the cooperative lorry to just take tokens
so you
and you didn't have to deal with money
right
you see
the coal man didn't have to deal with money because i think some of them was UNK into their bags you know
well i don't know about that
so that's how they made their coal cheques
well anyway it was coal tokens
coal tokens
i always remember
it was just easier for the men that carried the coal
aye and of course the likes of milk tokens it just like now you know they would come round the door and leave your milk there in the morning
aye
well at that time you didn't leave out money so you just left a couple of tokens
and you weren't up
in the milk bottle
aye
you know and
they came round that early that
that was that
the coal tokens was the milk tokens were all right
aye and of course the same with the
the coal
at that time you could you could trust people
if er if you were going out and you knew the coal man might be round that day so you just left a couple of coal tokens out at the door or whatever
and even left them with a neighbour if they were if your neighbour was going to be in
and as your granddad says there was a lot more trust in them days and you could leave things like that at the door unfortunately you can't do it now
was it common then for did UNK have a did you your family have a co book
your mother and father
aye they did although it takes me a bit of time to think about it but erm they did have a er a black book aye
but like that a lot of families had them and kept them just for the family
mhm
you know there was a lot of people had them and gave them out to neighbours or not total strangers but people that weren't really related to them
er and they were the kind of people that sometimes found UNK in difficulties at the end of this quarter as it's called because well it wasn't everybody that could pay it
er people done it thinking that och well i've got three month to get this sorted out you know and then unfortunately by the time the three months was up they hadn't got it and
mm
it was kind of hard for them to pay it and that's were it came in that the people who actually had the black book would lose out on their dividend because their dividend would be used to pay what was owed by other people
see most people had good intentions whenever they got a whole lot of stuff from the cooperative they would say i'll lay so much by every week and i'll have it at the end of the quarter
but er they would maybe lay it by for two or three weeks and then forget for two or three weeks and then when it came to the end of the quarter they were a whole lot of weeks behind you know they couldn't pay it then
it was it seems a kind of i mean it seems to have gone on quite a bit that people who had a co book would allow other people to draw off of that would go to the shops and buy whatever they needed of the co book
but at
mhm
the same time it seems an awful kind of dangerous way to
mhm
to run your book doesn't it
you know if you didn't think you were
well you see you were trusting people
good possibility of not getting it back you know
aye right
you were trusting people to pay it if you had a black book
you didn't actually let them run up a big bill you would you would go with them
aye
and maybe somebody would come to your door and say their wee boy or their girl was making their first communion and they were in dire UNK and couldn't buy anything for them and you would more or less have to give them your book to help them out but you would go with them so that they didn't go over the score and get just exactly what that UNK needed you know and just hope that they had enough money to pay you at the end of the quarter you know
would was there people who would abuse
oh aye you had to some people would have went mad with getting them
just the same as you know
aye
you had to watch but if people came to your door in a in a state that er you knew it was a genuine case you would probably help them out you know
and did you have to did you have to actually when you went to the shop say to buy some messages or to buy whatever erm in the UNK or whatever
mm
did you have to actually present the book when you went
oh aye
could you just
no you couldn't get
could you just
anything without that book
without the book
oh no i mean there was people went and quoted the number
oh no they didn't allow that you had to have the book
ah but they quoted my number mine
aye well that was a one off you weren't really supposed to go without a book
mm
then
what was what was it happened to you then
somebody went in and quoted my number and was it a suit they got
i don't know how that happened really but erm you weren't really supposed to get anything without
they're supposed to it's supposed to be written down in the in the book
mm
everything that you got out the cooperative was writ down in this book
mhm
in this black book
i think it always was mostly always was you know
mm
that must have been a one off
i never heard of that before really
you had to have your book
and did some people use it like er almost like in a like a money lending scheme then
aye
you know
mhm
mhm
they would allow people that they thought they could trust to accumulate a lot of debt on it
aye
some people had maybe as many as thirty forty people on their book
aye
mhm
but you had to take all that worry that
but there was
somebody wasn't going to pay you know
there was people that actually made money from it oh they made money
you know if you had twenty people using your book
then at the end of the quarter you were getting dividend for twenty people
now if you were getting say in them days maybe two pound a person well you were talking about er get quite a wee bit of money every quarter
and therefore that money would mount up
now maybe the person that ran the book didn't really need to use all that so at the end of a year say for instance they'd quite a bit of money lying on that black book
ah if your getting three and UNK per pound for every pound that was taken out on your book say four hundred pound three and UNK to the pound
quite a bit of money then it was a lot of money
mm
so i if it was up to yourself
you could take the risk and say well okay i'll try it
so how big was a how big a institution or how important a institution was the cooperative then here
well everybody in this town
it was the main thing in this town
bought out the cooperative that's for sure aye
everybody bought more or less everything they needed
mm
everything
after the turn of the leaf the next day when the new quarter began every shop was UNK from eight UNK clock in the morning
and when you got into that shop there's maybe a counter for UNK and a counter for gents a counter for ladies UNK every different kind of thing
every counter was UNK out the door
aye
waiting
mhm
for things at the beginning of the quarter
that's how important it was in the port
mhm
see there wee no big shops in this town at that time
you hadn't UNK or any of these big shops
no
cooperative was the shop in the town
that was the main shop
you would maybe
how did the smaller shops survive then
the likes of shops that sold UNK
ah well that was only wee corner shops you know
it was just wee shops apart from that
maybe UNK and the UNK
aye
aye
UNK and the UNK aye
and the UNK that was the other three shops
what was the UNK
UNK and er john
it's er just another wee store like er the UNK and UNK
and was that
just small grocer nice wee shops
now they were we probably thought at that time that they were er big shops you know
mhm
er because they were bigger than say UNK
erm
they weren't much bigger than
the next the next biggest shop to the
was another
the cooperative was UNK and john
no i don't remember them
mm
where is now
aye
that was a great big shop UNK
and did they do any did they do a trade comparable to the cooperative
no
no because nobody el else give out tick
see you get
you know it had to be ready cash for all these shops the probably did their bit when people had money you know if you had a wee bit extra money
but mostly it was the cooperative
and everybody in the town was in the cooperative you know
everybody went to the cooperative guild all the women went to the co cooperative guild
what was the cooperative guild
well it was just a guild for women who could take their knitting and have a cup of tea and discuss everything that went on in the cooperative you know
you said what was going to happen next quarter somebody who's
well er
maybe on the committee you know two or three on the committee
and you took to do with the things that was happening in the cooperative
said your piece and if you thought things weren't right
so the cooperative was basically run for the people
aye it was run by the people
oh aye up aye
and it had things on for children like UNK classes and
aye
aye
UNK dancing and stuff like that
aye
you went to the cooperative halls for everything like that when we were young
where would these guild meetings be held then
well maybe once a week on a tuesday night think it was a tuesday night
my mother used to go to it
aye
and you would have a co board as they called it
some of these women would be on it
which was made up of local towns people you know and er i mean you didn't have to be a UNK in the town to be on this er co board th you know you could be one of the riveters you were talking about earlier
old andy
too an interest in it
old andy was in neil father he was on that board
mm
and his sister andy 's wife
do have a seat
i'm trying to do eight things at once as usual
only eight
now sorry

oh it feels like yeah UNK going on there builders there now your insurance company have written back saying can we have a report because your investigations have been completed
that's all very well but the hospital haven't written to me yet so
i've not got my appointment through until the fifth of october
oh well they are complete then oh that's okay then
but the insurance company
about this little thing at the back of the eye
yeah
oh well i'll keep the insurance company er i w er we will send them a little note in that case saying look you know this is the case it appears to be an innocent UNK she's just been UNK checked over on the eighth of october do you feel you can now proceed
i mean they they've given
me insurance but it's
oh right so you are covered
sort of they're going to review it
oh right
when they've got the results from the hospital
okay so that'll be what
six weeks off or so
yeah okay
yeah i mean that's not a problem any more
well i'll erm well if you've got the insurance the be the best thing to do is for me to tell them when you've actually been done
a letter to insurance company
yeah
fifth

hospital review over okay
so we'll do that
now
what else can i do for you
i just need a repeat prescription for UNK please

this won't be far off now
six weeks

about seven weeks okay
when you go

and the eye department
are quite good actually it must be said
right
bye
good
thanks very much
that's okay
b
yes that's it
that's about it and i feel very ill prepared tonight
oh well don't worry leaves it to
erm yes
but it's there is no doubt about it this piece of scripture is written for the UNK in the church
it's got nothing to do with people outside the church
UNK and how they er it's really to UNK the false teaching and how they should leave their lives together
so u what everything we're reading in here is to do with UNK not nothing to do with the people who are not of the faith
not
i feel quite certain about that
pardon
switched on now
yes it's switched on so erm as i say i feel very ill prepared
erm let's if we've
have you switched on
yes it's on yes it's on
so chapter verse twelve
well it's a
but w er the verse nine anyone who claims to be in the light but UNK his brother is still in the dark
right
whoever loves his brother lives in the light and there is nothing in him to make him UNK
that's wonderful isn't it
if you're living in the light you won't UNK
if you're wor in other words if you're working with christ keep your eyes on him you'll not go wrong
mm
but whoever UNK his brother and this is talking about another christian you know
but whoever UNK his brother that's another fellow believer is in darkness
now that's a hard word isn't it
that's verse eleven
mhm
and walks around in the darkness he does not know where he is going because the darkness has UNK him
may i ask a question
yes
most of us don't hate anybody but we do dislike some
well that's just about as bad
isn't it
is that the same
i would have thought so
UNK a very
is it
strong word
UNK a strong word but i think it's i think it's er not liking somebody isn't it
did you start
the reading of verse twelve
no
no
i was just building up to it cos it's
oh and no wonder
that's why i'm getting in a UNK
i couldn't recognize it
well you've got to build up to where you are
yeah
mm
er so we'll move on to verse twelve thirteen ad fourteen
i to you dear children because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name
who are the children
the christians
are they little boys and girls
oh jackie
w yeah
we'll go onto that then
i you fathers
because you know him who is from the beginning i to young you young men because you have overcome the evil one
i to you dear children because you have known the father
yes
i to you fathers because you have known him is who is from the beginning
i to you young men because you are strong and the word of god lives in you and you have overcome the evil one
now there's y you can go to town on that one
yes
but i think UNK has the right er interpretation of it
alright but he goes ooh he goes on and on and on
erm UNK says there are UNK in christian experience the child the father the young man
the knot of the father is the glad sense of forgiveness
of the father a deep knowledge of god
i like this
and the young man victory over the power the of evil
but all these is growth
the child through forgiveness also comes to know the father
the father can only go on to know god more UNK and as the young man men become stronger they are more aware of the UNK spirit of power to overcome the UNK
so it's UNK interpreted isn't it
yes
i think so
yes
i think so
mm
er but i think the important thing in verse twelve is on account of his name
the name of jesus isn't it
for h the name sake your sins are forgiven
that's right
his na
you for his name's sake
yeah
the salvation in no other name
mm
and his t his policies there's only one me er UNK between god and man the man christ jesus
does it mean for his name sake that you must confess his name
yes i think so jack
is that what it means
i think so
i think so because if you'll not confess his name we're not one of his are we
mm
surely do we know if we receive him and believe in his name and he gave us the power to become
yeah
be that as it may
it's very well UNK saying we're all children of god
very often UNK say that
but my bible tells me he gave me the power to receive him and to become
mm
it's a you see
mm
yeah
but do some folk UNK say we're e every human being is a child of god
no
well
got
some people would say some people would
the scripture says you don't accept it
that's what my bible says anyway
yeah
this is very important that we
mm
should er and we do already confess the name don't we
yeah
but i mean well
we're not christians if we don't
no but we do we do in this room
e yes
yes
and our intention
y
at the church is to get others to confess the name
that's right
too
isn't it
yes
yes
all
but somebody
have a choice
pardon
we all have the choice to be children of god
we've got the we've go the choice to either to become or not to become
mm
ah could
you look up acts four twelve sarah
i've got that down and i don't know what it says
what does acts four twelve say
salvation in found in no one else for is there is no other name under heaven given to me by which we must be seen
that's right marvellous isn't it
so there you are
so we i to your children because your sins have been UNK forgiven on account of you believing upon his name
that's really what's it's saying isn't it
mm
now my little commentary says what
oh aye
i like you because by extended repetition in these verses extended repetition in these verses this my commentary john UNK his readers that in spite of the ra the UNK test contained in the letter
tests because it is a UNK test i think i think it's tremendous don't you
mm
in the l er in the letter he is confident of the UNK salvation
dear children fathers young men as elsewhere in this letter dear children probably refers to all john's readers including fathers and young men
the term fathers and young men may however describe two different levels of spiritual maturity
mm
some hold that all three terms refer to levels of spiritual maturity
there you are
mm
erm rita what do you think
anything different from what anybody
i went to you first because you have known him who is from the beginning
from the beginning of what
john one
mm
mm
says the says the accepted christ is the saviour is that what it means
verse thirteen
he seems to progress
doesn't he
from children
yeah
and then on to men
yeah and then on to
and then on to father
yeah
so
that's a different
yeah that's right
different
that's it
er
are strong
pardon
oh it's alright i'm just
you've have known him from the beginning
beginning
means from the beginning
yeah
namely from the beginning of the world
yes
from the beginning of time
yes
yes
he'd been there from the beginning that's we know
about him
we fathers
yes
we know that he is eternal
mm
not just that we found him so many years ago
or he found us but it is from the beginning surely
i don't know john i don't know
no
i don't know
er john's chapter one
which is about that
yes it is about that
see one yeah
john one
from the beginning that's what it's all about
and this UNK is all about from the beginning the eternal
yeah well she'd got to
she likes to sit beside
would you like to move over there to the er john and er
can bring that one over here
what does one john one say then
in the beginning
beginning was a word and the word was with god and the word was god
he was with god at the
aye
beginning
yeah
yeah it surely is yes
come in pat
come on pat
come in
right
come in
come in pat
come in pat
this is being recorded the
ah
eh
delete please
right
now where are we now
coming in
fifteen
fifteen
do not love the world or anything in the world if anyone loves the world the love of the father is not in him
for everything in the world the UNK of the sinful man the rest of the eyes and the of what he does comes not from the father but from the world
the world and it's UNK pass away but the man who does the will of god lives forever
i erm i don't know how you feel about that but
when i read that you know this is perhaps a wrong s feeling of to express but yo the lord the god created the world but he's not meaning it in that respect is he
it just means that putting it first
the things of the world
the things of the world
the material
yes
but god still created the world to provide the materials things
not talking about material things we're talking about the sort of fall of nature
i know
that's right this is what i'm saying
so it's misleading
er well it can be but it c er i found it very helpful when i discovered that after i was saved
this spoke to me
mm
it has come to my mind that it is UNK er spiritual
yeah
spiritual life
yeah
yeah
from a natural
naturally
through the
yeah
the world
the material
yeah
world
yeah
it just seems that there's
people
perhaps no another way to put it
hmm
mm
yes
but when you think of er it's not really referring to the beauty of the world
ooh no it's the it's the
oh no
exactly
i it's the far world it's referring to
yeah
it's the what
the far world not the UNK world that we can you see the pride in the eye that with that can be can be another women or it can it can be UNK it can be a dress to women or it could be another man
it could be anything couldn't it
some
the world
ambiguous i've always found it so
anyway
is it is it the world that's created and all the beauty of the world
no
exactly i don't think it can incorporate that though
have you seen about the bit
yeah you read it out sarah
my bible says do not love the world or anything that belongs to the world
yes
then that one really
not the world of people or the created world
but the world or realm of sin which is controlled by UNK and organized against god and righteousness
oh that's entirely
right
that's the answer isn't it
yes that is the answer
mm
that's just the
clear
right reading dear
well we've all loved the world so it's g no good kidding
no
ourselves is there
no
because we love living in the world
yeah but we've all loved
and we love the world
the so called UNK and
yeah
m my translation i think m makes it quite definite
everything the world UNK all that UNK to the UNK or
that's right
UNK the eyes
yeah
all the UNK of its life springs not from the father but from the UNK world
that's right
mm
and that world is UNK away with that he who does god's will stands forever
that's right
mm
but of course
every everything which is not in christ will won't it
yeah
yeah
i
it's only christ is the
is the only thing that's e
is there any ending
eternal thing isn't it
eternal
yes
because we've all course i have layers of
yes exactly
course there's nobody who loved the world more than what i did
the sinful man
goodness gracious me
no but i think as your faith UNK and grows you're more aware of those
yes
aware of it before sarah
because you were yo you were walking in darkness
as i said
it's wonderful when we come in to the light
i know
and walk in the light
so you
yeah
these things don't you
yeah
well the you're
yeah i it's not even a conscious not doing it
it's a it's
no
a desire that's taken away from you
the things i used to do i do them
well you put it in
no more
pardon
if you become aware of what really matters in your
yes
and this is growing isn't it
yeah
yeah
that's spiritual growth
is that spiritual growth
yeah
goodness gracious me
my first love was the UNK
and i really loved them
and don't you love them now
and i was good oh and i and i was a good player as well
a competition player
but i went to a pipe bag UNK in beeston and i myself completely
i says it's even ruined me for
even i mean the bible says once you're in christ you're ruined for the world
it says in somewhere in the king UNK version you're ruined for the world
and although i'm not i enjoyed the UNK i enjoyed but i was not at peace i says i says you've even ruined me for this
pardon
other than the UNK
UNK
but i er but i said to myself god i'm even ruined with this
yeah
no it's which is foremost
you put too much attention on that and not enough on
that was very
yes that's
what you make an
yes it was my religion
yeah
at one stage
yeah
that's right
goodness gracious me
i'm sure the lord's UNK you play the UNK
th that's not what i'm saying
it's written in with this
no i know what you're saying and i don't know why you should
no with this
it doesn't mean the same
no
before god
yes
god come he christ must come first
yeah
yes that's right
n nearly all UNK nearly all UNK
UNK
have their value
yes
but they're UNK because they take the place of god
that's right
that's right
and every interest
yeah
can be can be
e every is interested in an UNK
and we and we're n not as long as it's put in the under god it's alright
you see describes it as what the lack of grace there's no grace you know in the in the there's a person who's UNK by these
they haven't come under grace
hmm mm
when i was converted i lost er a great deal of interest not completely but a great deal of interest in fiction
in fiction
yeah
why
oh yes he would
he yes he would and great deal
as well
yeah
yeah
i'm s i'm
it's void isn't it
i'm sorry that i've lost it like i think it perhaps si has lost the pipes
yeah
but er i understand why because it played too big a part in my
yes
imagination can take charge of it
that's bad
that's bad for you and it's bad
yeah
for him
that's right
there is a life s empty pride
here john's uses a most vivid greek word UNK you know that
yes
UNK
to the ancient UNK the UNK was the man who laid claim to possessions and to achievements which did not belong to him in order to UNK himself more
we've often met people like that who blow their trumpet er pretending they were somebody else
the UNK is the UNK
and c h UNK calls UNK
the man of the world is UNK to disappointment
and the man of god is certain of UNK joy
now you can't beat that can you
no
mm
you can't beat that
so have we got any more comments on these verses
one of the great dangers of today i think is UNK and especially
UNK
now UNK of nature and of the world
yes
and of intellect jack
eh
and of intellect
well yes intellect too
but there's many i was only thinking of the tendency to care for the world and look after it and worship
yeah
it you know
cos it's so beautiful
yeah
mm
people that carried away
true
beauty and the world it's wonderful
that's and it's
mm
i'd also after UNK have gone and they're very good UNK sometimes
yeah
that's where they UNK us
yeah
that's right
you see that y er i mean your chapel could become your UNK can't it
yes
yes
your minister can become your UNK
yes
yes
your home can be your UNK
everything can
oh very much so
yeah
yeah
your congregation can become your UNK
yeah
everything
yes it can
yeah
trap
now what's the next portion verse er verse eighteen
mhm
dear ch
little children
dear children this one says
this is the last hour
and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming even now many UNK have come this is how we know it is the last hour
they went out from us but they did not really belong to us for if they had belonged to us they would have remained with us but their going showed that none of them belong to us
now he's referring there to those er people of false UNK wasn't he
who left UNK from the fellowship i think isn't he
yes
and er but the last hour
see how important fellowship and the church was to this man
yes
mm
if you went outside it you were lost
you were
antichrist
mm
er a aye but er but they but those who'll but is but if we can get lost in our way if we break fellowship can't we
yes
not necessarily but we can
cos it doesn't cos you need fellowship don't you
yes
you need it to feed yourself
even
yes
though even though that it might UNK you t does something for you doesn't it
yeah
yes i fully agree
but er it was the UNK that left wasn't it
i think
surely it just means everybody against christ
the well these are a people who
no
were in the fellowship but they were
they get funny with
they were false
things or they some won't go that far
people are
leaving all the time from the churches
and new
especially
ones coming in
oh es especially the UNK groups
oh we change over like this
oh a terrible
e i only questioned about something on sunday coming home and she said well lady that were bringing me she said well they won't have it
they won't have the hard teaching
no they've got
no
yeah
they won't have the hard teaching
no
so they don't last very long
well
some do but she said the idea i mean she said about i was asked a question about an american we've got that is with us but he doesn't UNK very often and i said well where is he
i said er i imagine cos i've been visiting his wife you see
they said well er i thought perhaps he was away preaching she says oh no they don't want any of m our people used to go out a lot preaching but they don't want any of them now because it's too deep for them to
yes i can understand that
and he's very straight our UNK you know he tells 'em straight you know
ooh aye oh aye yeah
don't mess about and er well i said i never find anything offensive but
i think that's why it's best always to keep it so simple
don't you
well it is a simple gospel
no it is but
well it's not that i mean there's a
there's a you but
ah but
you name what
it
around the m around the mansfield field and these children at school they know far more than i do at my age i think
and things that's going on it's got to the children
evil things it is
oh yes
yes
and saying you get people in you see
perhaps come for the first time
yeah
well there's we don't know what their lives like any k way
e they come unto the word and e well if the want to follow the lord it's different isn't it
but if no good hanging about is it
but he's very straight about everything
whatever the lord tells him to say he does it
and he disciplines her in front of the he'll discipline them
yeah but he'll discipline them
in front of the congregation
and they won't and you see so but understood yesterday they w they weren't they want to take it you see
now
i see here's got such a lot on this but he says erm well i've lost where i was
antichrist can mean either the UNK of christ
exactly
or the one who seeks to put himself in the place of christ
mm
mm
anti
antichrist can be one who UNK tries to take the place of christ from within the church
mm
and the christian community
mm
the one who will be in open an UNK opposition the other a subtle UNK he comes in many UNK doesn't he
yeah
anyway
er we need to choose the meanings for antichrist
it can either way
the simplest way to choose is to think of it is that god is the UNK christ is the UNK of god
which he is
and goodness and the antichrist is the UNK of the enemy UNK himself
oh
yeah
because the antichrist is not merely somebody who comes along and er and ten times the violence and UNK and all that
no
like hitler for example
the antichrist is a very subtle very
oh
much more subtle
mm
very much more subtle
UNK of angels
exactly yes
yes
the antichrist is not so much a person as a principle
the principle which is actively opposed to god
cos you see those people who are working not coming back to your fellowship is a illustration they are really they might be christians but they're walking in the l well th they're allowing the enemy
yes
the there are choice either submission or going their own way the pride of the world
yes and this is it yeah
t to UNK what john was just saying in those previous few verses
yeah
er opposed to god and of which may well be thought of as UNK itself in those men in every generation who have sin to be the UNK of god
well a lot of people have been called the antichrist haven't they
UNK hitler the UNK and plenty others
yes all these all these
yeah
strong people you
yes
see
but er antichrist is often a very much er
and
more UNK looking person
oh yes he is jack
yes he is mm
it can
yes
be the type that's very practical towards life
he can be i er
that has no er psychology or
similar to work miracles he will you know
yes
but it can be a very direct practical
but communism was a form of antichrist
ooh absolutely
n and UNK and UNK according to UNK was very much a human monster
yeah
yeah
but to get antichrist that we've got to d wh where a is the one who might even UNK the gospel to us but you know perfectly well there's something wrong with
that's right
yes
look at wonderful preacher
did you no you never met did you
no
gosh
what does it mean when it says it is the last time
oh well
well it's the end of time
i says since the UNK
looking for the lord's coming aren't they
since the UNK within the last time haven't they
mm
yes
yes
i think
and we should be prepared for the er
for the lord's c
lord's coming last time
yeah
i would have thought so
mm
i would have thought so
see there's two words for time one is UNK and
yes
the other is UNK is time UNK time so that when you say the coming of christ the time of christ is near
it means that it'll come sort of next week or the week after or next year
that's UNK
yes
but UNK has a different and meaning of time all together
time is opportunity it's occasion
it's er it's filled
time
yes
it's filled
yeah
UNK time
there's all the difference between live and being i mean being time and being in god
being in time and being in the eternity
there's a quality of time and then there's just time
you just spend time you waste time you give
yeah i see
time away
but if you're wise you fill up time with what
mm
last
yeah
does anybody not understand what i'm trying to
oh yes
yes fully i think
it's another way work out your salvation with fear and UNK
yes
fits into that doesn't it
because this is the l this is very important time
it's
yeah
a very important
yeah
time
it can make you feel very guilty jack
if you are to
worry too much about that because i often wished deliberately where i could be doing something more productive for the lord
but don't you think you need to sit and be quite
well here again that's one of the arguments
yeah
that's one of the arguments before
yeah
i think
you need to what please
well you need to sit and be quite with the lord as to keep doing for the lord
yes you do yes
in fact it's wisdom comes into that
yes
yes
doesn't it
had er a who used time
of course
of course
he was he's very keen on the use of time
he never wasted any did he
no it's very important is time
the life above when this is past is a ripe fruit of earth below
my favourite hymn
the life above when this is past is the ripe fruit of earth below
aha
the fruit of earth below
yes
er
the fruit of your works
yes
mm
yes
was it used to say keep saying buy up the time buy up the time
yeah
mhm
used to keep saying that
the time
buy the time out of the evil days
yeah
yeah
very challenging
very morally challenging
it is
mhm
right
anything more on this
then we've got the verses well b er verses UNK
verses er
twenty one
twenty you have an UNK
ah but you have of the holy one and all that you know the truth and
all of you know the truth
i do not write to you because you do not know the truth but because you do know that it and because no lie comes from that truth
so there you are there's an interesting one then UNK as a holy ghost
what does it mean when it says you know all things
well the spirit UNK it to you that's what it's really saying isn't it
what does it mean
pardon
i don't know all things
well i suppose i it means that you know the difference between right and wrong cos we've only been we've been talking about it further up haven't we
yes
not being connected with the world and being more spiritual
i suppose he means that
but you know all things i mean
spiritual things
well no not
spiritual kind of life and
mm
what are the full powers he claims to have
what does he claim to UNK
oh well that's what he claims
no don't laugh at that don't laugh at that
there is something UNK that's what they that's what they're saying here that's what he's saying
well yes there's something UNK in i
in the UNK
why in the UNK
yeah
a i it's UNK alan
yes
but that's not the difference of a f that's a different thing to what the p UNK er interpretation is of
yes i'm not defending the UNK at all
no
no
that's an entirely different thing
but i am defending the fact that there is an
ooh definitely
in the church
yes
there's a an
yeah
yes there is
we know in whom we have belief
that's right
we do know
yes
and
that's the truth
that is the that is the last word
yeah
so we have got that er that very important o knowing all things
i think it's wonderful
there's such a lot of er erm extraordinary UNK in this er UNK
acts
ten thirty what does acts ten thirty eight say
say what
acts ten verse thirty eight
there are reference to that for verse twenty
a god for jesus of UNK with the holy spirit and how he went around doing deed and healing all around him power of the devil because god was with him
that's when g wh that's when god and antichrist
yeah well yeah
god went out to jesus
er well he UNK us you see
doing exactly the same thing
second
well i mean really the healing was their faith wasn't it
of the
the healing was done through the spirit
yes but
one
change was
two peter one twelve
two peter one twelve
one twelve
so i will always remind you of those things even though you know them as a firmly established in the truth
you ha UNK of UNK
that's peter
and therefore my brothers be all the more UNK to make your calling an election sure
this is what you were saying about buying up the time john in a way isn't it
yeah
for if you do these things you will never fall
in other words you will not slip up and fall from sin i suppose
and you will receive a rich welcome which 's hymn says doesn't it
hmm
into the eternal kingdom of our lord the saviour jesus christ
so there i will always remind you peter says i will always remind you of this things that if you buy up the time
yes
even though you know even although you know it
and they will e they will establish or continue to build it up
yes
that's what it's really saying isn't it
yes keep on keep on
yeah
keeping on
i think it is right to UNK this is the job of the preacher really isn't it
or the teacher
i think it is right to UNK your memory as long as i live in the tent of his body
because i know that i will soon put it aside as our lord jesus has made clear to me
so he must have been in
yeah aye
and i will make every effort to see that after my departure you will always be able to remember these things
so in other words i'll raise up somebody to fill my shoes i suppose
yeah
marvellous isn't it
yeah
i think it's UNK i any more comments
what verse are we up to now
have we done twenty one yet
yes we have
yes
twenty two
mm
mm
really
yeah we've done that
refer to it
yeah
then we want the verse twenty two
no lie comes from the truth
twenty one
who is the UNK
it is the man who denies that jesus is the is the christ
such a man is the antichrist
he denies the father and the son
now who UNK denies that jesus is the christ today
i'm asking
all sorts of funny religions i should think
quite a few
jehovah's witnesses
i don't know whether they do or they don't
could we before we get today could we say that these are the UNK aren't
yes yeah yes the UNK them
but
are the UNK of their time
yeah
because there was just as much UNK then as there is now jack
yeah
that's the way
yes
yes
that if the enemy wasn't
yes
active wasn't it
well a jehovah's witness came to my door and said er jesus christ was not the son of god
no
i think they said jesus christ is not
is not god
god
that's what they said
oh they believe that jesus christ is the son of god alright
no
not the
oh yes
way he put it
this is the j
he said he was a prophet
they don't they don't accept him they came here for years
yeah
but i've forgotten what the teaching was
what was the teaching
on what he was saying
but that's how he put it
ye er there's
but not equal with god
that's right
that's right
son of god but
er that's right
but the UNK say it's impossible for jesus to be the son of god because didn't have a wife and it's as simple that's ex that's exactly how the UNK view it
how on earth can he be the son of god because god didn't have a wife
and it takes a man and a women to produce a child
that's how the UNK see that
s with the jehovah's witness i don't whether they come under this category or not
no i don't
i read their bible once and it said at the beginning in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was a god
yes
they believe in the UNK god but not in the UNK jesus christ
yes
word
not god but the word was a god it's just that difference between a little g and a capital
yeah
that's right
is the divine christ
and in there's a there's there there's a similar confession in chapter five
what does chapter five say
who is he that UNK the world
but he the UNK that jesus is the son of god
he that UNK the world
but he UNK that jesus is the son of god
well i would doubt if the jehovah's witness UNK the world
having nearly become one
not in the
sense that you and i know it anyway
UNK the world
pardon
they're a religion that
in erm in er organization
they worship their organization
yeah but they're in no as well
they'll the it's a law job isn't it
they try to keep the law
their law
yeah
well they would say it's i but there are old testament type of belief i think
actually the er UNK witnesses were some of the most er s strongly opposed to hitler
oh yes
oh yes they were they were
but they were very much more strongly opposed to him than were many UNK christians
oh yes
aye
the jehovah's witness they're opposed to all sorts of UNK the jehovah's witness
mm
look at dr the leading UNK was UNK to the UNK the jehovah's witness you know
they maybe even murdered them i'm not too sure
yeah
yeah
cos they're against churches generally aren't they
well the antichrist is the church
yes
i used to go up past there believing the that the minister was the represented the antichrist
i did
i did
because that's what they teach
jehovah's witnesses call UNK the UNK of UNK
yeah that's right
yeah
and that's us
yeah
and that's and that's us
yeah
mm
that's what they call
now
us UNK
erm five six this is the one who came by water
this is the part of the what verse were we on
because i've forgotten
we're on twenty two
twenty two
no what verse
twenty two
twenty two aye
two
this is the er jesus the christ such a man is who denies him
and then my study bible suggest that we read this
water UNK b baptism and blood UNK his death
these are mentioned because UNK ministry began at his baptism and ended at his death
who is reaching who is rea john is reacting to the UNK of his day the UNK
who said that jesus was born only a man and remains so until his baptism
i think
jehovah's witness don't say that
ah
at that time they maintained that christ the son of god UNK on jesus but left him before his suffering on the cross
so that it was only the man jesus who died
throughout this letter john has been UNK that jesus christ is god as well as man
he now UNK that it was this god man jesus christ who came into our world was baptized and died
jesus was the son of god not only at his baptism but also at his death
is that thing still going
can you see it going
yeah when it stops let me know cos i'll turn it over
this man this truth is extremely important because if jesus died only as a man his UNK would have been sufficient to take
would not
would not have been sufficient
no
to take away the guilt of man's sin
that's right
the spirit would UNK that is the holy spirit UNK that jesus is the son of god in two ways
the spirit jesus is the son of god the spirit UNK on jesus at his baptism and two he continues to confirm in the hearts of the believer the UNK testimony that UNK baptism and death UNK that he is the christ the son of god
i believe myself that there is no conflict between the human and the divine
none at all
they are they are one
i don't know what you mean jack
the human is divine and the divine is human
the spirit came upon jesus at the baptism upon a man upon a man and it came upon him it raised him from the dead
mm
on the cross as the son of god
and er i am i am a great believer but i feel out of that myself as one of the things i'm feeling out of
mm
the spirit is human and the spirit is divine
there's no con
there's no necessary conflict
we always associate UNK with sin course we do
yes
and we mustn't do that
real UNK before the fall
oh yes
was one with god
yes it was
yes
hmm
and that's what it was with jesus christ it's one with god
absolutely yes
mm
mm
and that's what it should be with us
one with god
yes
yes
but we won't let it a hundred percent till we're there will we
no but we are human which is a good thing
yeah cos i've heard some people stand up pronounce that
a lot of people find religion very artificial and er
they do
and
i do
yes
that's right
speak more about it then brother
mm
say some more about it
what
UNK on it
well i find all religion artificial
yeah
he's talking to the word religion aren't you
yes
word religion
yes
and that's
yes well i never use that word actually myself
that's isn't it
yes
i use the word spirit
mm
spirit
spirit is human and divine
do you believe in the divine
well of course
yeah
i'm a christian
mm
yes
i think what you're saying jack is a is a wonderful UNK feeling
and it gives one a peaceful feeling within
yes
that the UNK that the natural and the divine are linked
that's why i feeling out of it i think
and i think this is er erm a peaceful feeling within us that we need to feel
we don't always want to be testing ourselves all the time do we
no
i don't think christ meant us all the time to
testing UNK
well we are
we don't
we're
are we
we don't
well we are to a point you're saying well they're you feel guilty at times that you're not doing enough
but
i no i know i ca i know i
isn't it
d i don't think i even i don't think i even feel did i say guilty
cos i don't think i do feel guilty
well you did feel guilty i think you said that
but i don't know i er i don't think i do feel guilty
i just say to myself
i s well
that you could be doing more
but i'm quite happy not to
i think
i think so
yes
where the guilt is
yes
yes
verse twenty four now is it
thank you
mm
see that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you
yes now that's dynamic isn't it
if it does you will also remain in the son and in the father and this is what he promised us even eternal life
you see the son and the father and you and all the names
yeah
isn't that lovely
it is
yes
that's it is
that's what i'm talking about really
yeah
seems to me
that john is trying to er establish and pursue the fact that jesus christ is
you see if you think right back
in the in the very beginning of our UNK er the UNK and all such people were wanting to establish the fact of god
god is spirit and then when christ came when he was born people had difficulty great difficulty in accepting him as being of god
yes they did
they did
they did
and this is what i think what john is trying to get over
yes it is
i think so
yeah
yes he's
yes
trying to establish the fact that jesus is god
that's right
mm
a and that and that he was born god and that died on the cross as god
cos there cos there was
yes well of course
those other whatever they called them UNK
were saying that he was only god from his baptism to not on the cross before the cross
you see i jesus all sort man
yes because he was man and spirit wasn't he
yes of course
god and
he must have been
he was the link from both of us
but i think the hardest thing is to accept the fact that he is god
we know
but
that he we've
but
got the record of his birth and his growing up
his development
human form
but yes but e but er but when the spirit UNK you as an individual at least i had no doubt that he was good
immediately
you see the word man is ambiguous
we're all men if the ladies will excuse me saying that we're all men and men are human
we're all human
but are we human really
are we human enough
are we really human right through but jesus
but
jesus was human right through
yeah
yeah
he was a man the man the capital man
we're UNK anyway aren't we
yes
mm
UNK
but the capital man and
god there is nothing to distinguish between
no
them
no
they're one
yeah
i and the father jesus said are one
and er i you are going to be in thee and i going to thee in you
and then he spoke to his disciples wonderful unity
i think it's fantastic that
yes isn't it
very UNK
it is
it's UNK to me
and john says i'm writ
yeah it is to me as well
he says i'm writing these things to you about those who are trying to lead you UNK
mm
mm
yes
now you see i isn't it remarkable that the jehovah's witness tried to lead us UNK but the minute christ came in they were wasting their time
jehovah's witness isn't it
they came for six months after seven day wonder something had happened to us
but er they realized now and every time i she'll ask me and she'll say
er where were we
verse twenty seven is it
yes
ask for you the UNK you receive from him remains in you
and you do not need anyone to teach you
now this is some people would take that literally
and UNK that literally
but it doesn't mean exactly what it's saying does it
no
no
but as his UNK er as his UNK teachers you
all things
about all things and as that UNK is real not UNK just as it has taught you remain in him
we've met people who would say read your bible holy spirit
very quickly
and you don't need u go to church and listen to the preacher
no
oh dear
so
oh dear
that is a real aye
so we're back to the UNK there aren't we
can i read that verse in my bible
yes
but the UNK which ye had received of him UNK in you and ye need not have any man teach you but as the same UNK teachers you all things and is truth and is no lie and even as it have taught you ye shall UNK in him
yes
and that's the secret we should read the word and let the word read us
hmm
that's another way of putting it isn't it
mm
let the words read us cos it's god reading us isn't it
mm
of course god does speak to us through humans beings
he does
yes
people and they're not only UNK or teachers or so on
yeah that's right
but er
you we learn a lot from one another actually
i was going to say
that's the idea of this meeting isn't it
gosh
and also the experiences of life
that's right
yeah
yes
which is more so isn't it
yes
oh gosh aye
we would be we would be still be very UNK if we didn't have
one another wouldn't we
yes indeed
yes
michael when he was at s when he was at school he won a scholarship to university when he got to the university he said as if he'd made a great discovery
he said dad there's a lot of people know a lot more than we do
already the intellectual
very touching tribute to UNK
mm
mm
yes very good
and the
of the natural world
eh
of the natural world
yes that's true of the spiritual world to isn't it
i thought in your case it would be more the natural
now where are we
verses the last two verses innit
mm
and now dear children you see we're back to the children again aren't we
mm
continue in him so that when he appears we may be confident that's good isn't it
confident
and UNK before him at his coming
right
if you know that he is righteous you will know that everything everyone who does what is right has been born of him
that's the test that's the test isn't it
it's very hard
that's the test isn't it
mm
has some interesting comments to make about these two verses
well he's got a comment verse twenty seven the UNK
you have received the UNK of god's holy spirit he is your teacher the spirit of truth who will guide you into all truth
he will teach you everything
jesus promises that
and what does the holy spirit teach you
it teaches you remain in him in other words remain in his word and let it remain in you
live in jesus keep walking in his way looking to him who is the author and UNK of our faith
not looking back or down or in but up to him
and the outcome and now dear children verse twenty eight
yeah
you have been crucified with christ
the old nature has been crucified the new has come
behold all things are new
so that it is no longer you who live but christ
mhm
who lives himself through you
as you live in his righteousness and UNK by his spirit and presence within you so you that's us may be confident and UNK before him at his coming
when he comes back again which he will come to judge the quick and the dead
and the blood of jesus this is marvellous isn't it
the blood of jesus UNK your shame away because
yes
he has accepted and forgiven you
it is marvellous isn't it
yes
mm
that's wonderful
can't loose
can't e you can't loose in this
mm
aye
marvellous isn't it
yeah
so that's completed chapter
two
two
what time did you say you were going jack
oh well it depends on the light
i i'll go about ten to nine five to nine
ten or five to nine
another quarter of an hour
eh
another quarter of an hour
yes got another quarter of an hour
so we move on to chapter three
you needn't stop because i'm gone
chapter three
would somebody like to read the first two verses of chapter three
how great is the lord the father has UNK on us that we should be called children of god
and that is what we are
the reason the world doesn't know us is that it did not know him
dear friends now we are children of god and what we will be has not yet been made known
but we know that when he appears we shall be like him for we shall him as he his
everyone will have this hope in him
yes
UNK himself just as he is pure
that's wonderful
isn't that marvellous isn't it
yes
and i love the word hope there don't you
yeah
yes
good isn't it
see yes yeah
but UNK you can't get away from that about the about the creation can you
it's brought us back to j to john one again hasn't it
the first verse in john goes in the beginning genesis one was the word
the UNK used this term not only of the spoken word but also of the UNK word
the word still in the mind
that's interesting isn't it
the reasoning when they
applied it to the universe they meant the rational the
principle that UNK all things
jews on the other hand used it as a way of referring to god
thus john used the term that was mean meaningful to both jews and UNK with god
the word was distinct from the father was god
jesus was god in the UNK sense
i'm on john twelve the sons of god he gave the right the membership in god's family is by grace alone
cos you remember last week we accounted for er he was in the world and although the world was made through him the world did not recognize him
he came to that which was his own that's in other words that was the jews wasn't it
but the jews did not receive him yet to all that's jews and UNK who received him to those who believed in his name he gave the right to become the children of god
and that was children born not of natural UNK nor of human decision or a husband
but born of god
in other words born this been born again
born again
marvellous isn't it
many shall appear who shall be like him
but we shall see him as he is
do you understand that
verse whe what verse is that
two isn't it
are we a children of god and that we will be as not yet been made known but we but we know that when he appears we shall be like him
in UNK speaking anyway
for we shall see him as yet i should imagine it's a spiritual condition isn't
yeah
it
it's extraordinary isn't it be changed by just looking at it
yes
just by seeing it
now UNK got a er another UNK about verses one and two here
that is the glorious promise of what you shall be
verses one and two
mm
yeah
you can't imagine what it will be like but when the day of the lord comes people don't realize that the lord's coming back and they'll be a day of judgement
they don't do they
they never think about it but when the day of the lord comes you shall be like because you've been born gain in his
yeah
spirit
mhm
that's why we'll be like him
all those things about your soul that you kn know UNK him shall be swept away
we got the rubbish
won't it
you shall be like him because you shall see him as he is
he is
mm
somehow that moment will completely on about wasn't it
mm
will complete the work of UNK that
mm
god has planned for you and me
god's UNK remains in you his spirit teaches you you're to remain in the spirit in other words living in christ
the father has UNK his love upon you my making you his child
you will be confident and UNK before jesus at his coming
when he appears you shall be like him for you shall see him as he is
now that's the promises
mm
yeah
marvellous isn't it
mm
gosh
everyone who has this hope in him UNK himself just as he is pure that's colin goes on to say because you shall be like him does not mean that you are to care little about how much of him can be seen in your life
now far from it because he is pure you are to seek UNK of heart
and now
UNK of mind and thought
yeah
UNK of desire and affection UNK of life and action
living the holy of god's holy people in the power of the holy spirit
yes
mm
marvellous isn't it
hope UNK
yes
yes i
UNK
think that
isn't that marvellous isn't it
i went to listen to him at the methodist church at er newark about oh quite a few years when
oh
i just came as
oh aye colin
you know i only wish i could have heard him
colin at the methodist
yes he was at the methodist
you know that very large church at newark
was he in there
yes he'd
but no at erm
no dennis you've got the wrong place
mansfield
ah
have very large ma er church
street
bridge street
and i was taken to it by friends
yeah
and i heard him and do you know he was powerful the way he
ooh er
who is this
colin
who'd erm
colin
he lives at
who erm
he's an UNK
UNK reading from
and erm but it was most UNK but i would appreciate it even more now
yeah
mm
than ten years ago
mm
and then verses five to six
you know that he appeared so that he might take away our sins
and then in him in him is no sin
no one who lives in heaven keeps on UNK
no one who continues to sin has either seen him or knows him
colin goes on to say there is no sin in jesus you were saying jack
for sin is whatever UNK god
now there's an interpretation of sin
mm
if you live in heaven you live in the UNK it would be totally inconsistent therefore to UNK to persist in your sinful ways opposing god in your life
now the UNK said it was okay to do that
those who claim faith in jesus but do not UNK this is what our friends john
but do not demonstrate a life that is lived for him
yes
do not truly know or love him
faith without deeds
yes that's
mm
right
the power of sin
matt
no longer grips
yeah
our life
even though you can still sin
mm
mm
you no longer have to
mm
no
grace UNK the fate
yeah
grace UNK the faith
no the fate
fate
yes
yeah
verse five is it now
four
is it
f well i did five and six just now
yes well then there's seven isn't it
seven
dear children do not let anyone lead you UNK
he who does what is right is righteous just as he
is
is righteous
just as christ is righteous
yes yeah
he who does what is sinful is of the devil because the devil
has been UNK from the beginning
the reason the son of god appeared was to destroy the works of the devil
verses nine
no one this is a hard one this you know
mm
no one who is born of god will continue to sin
because god's seed remains
in him
he can't go on UNK because his he has been born of god
of god
this what i asked you the other week
when you say when
we do
we do
to be sinners
but we do sin
we're free we should be
free
should be but we do
i think we just
no and we make mistakes matt but we don't UNK sin
i don't know myself
we certainly don't need to sin
no
no
i mean if it's pointed out to us by the lord we try
and overcome that don't we
yes
whatever it is
yes
god has made you righteous
and you
and you can do what is right in his sight
you are no longer a child of the devil in UNK against god
you no longer need to persist in sin
jesus has destroyed the UNK work and delivered you from the power of sin
god lives in you by the power of his spirit and he will guide you into truth life and peace
not sin
if you follow his leading in your life you will not persist in your sin
is that what you're saying janet
mm
not in your head
this
don't understand it
well this
but you don't s persist in sin do you
don't really want to sin
no you don't you don't
but sometimes we slip up pat
yeah we slip
yeah
this does not mean that you will never sin right
mm
this is what you're saying isn't it
mm
but if you if you desire to UNK god then you will not UNK or UNK persist
mm
this is it yeah that's it
that's the way of putting it isn't it
we
know the difference and we are aware
right away doesn't it
but to think that we do it
yes
yeah
when god points out your fault you will come ready to him and UNK in his in
because we get back to the first chapter verse nine
i was never out of that for the first few years i was saved i was always getting in there UNK my sins
nearly wore the carpet our in the bathroom
getting down to
i remember one david said you remember too after he had committed that terrible
yeah
crime and it was with her husband
he said i was born sin
and i said excuse
yeah
presumably god
yeah
accepts
yes i wanted to say that
i was born in sin and UNK in UNK
yeah
yes
that's the excuse he gave
yeah
and it wasn't rejected
i think it's part of our nature
we are born in sin
we are
we are UNK in UNK
yeah we are
mm
and there's a conscience as well as a there's an unconscious as well as a conscious drive in us which often is not very good
there's a force within us
yes
which will lead us on to UNK christ
yes
yes
yes that's right
a and when you're born again that's really we but that power without doubt has been broken
it's destroyed
but it's that it well not entirely
not destroyed broken
it's been broken
it's been broken and that
mm
and that's marvellous isn't it
yes
because i because people will hate you and i because they don't hate us
yes
but they hate christ
yes
that's right
mm
it's a it's tremendous isn't it
it's the UNK isn't it
pardon
it's the UNK
yes
and i've had to believe in the power of the UNK as well as my own responsibilities
yes
but there is a power of the UNK
yes
there's a power of the unconscious i think i think
power of the unconscious
power of the unconscious
i would have thought so
yes
in other words for er si the heart is UNK
yeah
very UNK
but don't you think jack all stress should be taken out of it
all stress
yes because
should be taken out of
yes of ourselves because we should be in a peaceful
surely we should be in a UNK peaceful
yeah if we could if we could be working really in the spirit at all times yes
yes
yes
if we were really working in christ all the time yes
i think yes but i think god's got the pattern for us
yes he has providing we can work really in him all the time
but
this is where we fall short
exactly
we fall short oh we're we are
yes
we are joint we are an equal with christ a joint with him
mm
i know but
i feel we should stress the peace that we're given
yes well we are given peace
we should stress
yeah
the power
yeah
and the power
yeah
and the grace we're given
yes oh yes
and the love we're given
that's right hit again
this is the this is thing we should be
that's the message that's the message
that's right
yeah
and i mean
that's what the preacher should be
this is what you want to say to other people isn't it
that's right
yes
and that's what the preacher should be
oh they say to me
have you seen the sins of the world
have you
that's it
seen what UNK like
that's it go on
have you what this is like
and be positive
that was UNK idea hen henry
always never talk and spoke about sin
he UNK he spoke
i know
about the love of god
exactly and i feel
yes
yeah
yeah
i think we all feel like this don't we
we want to stress the love that he's changed our lives
yeah but how can how do you prove it to somebody else if they don't haven't known it
don't ask me matt i've been sitting talking for many long days
no
it's i
and sometimes i think to myself would i love this person that i'm talking to become a believer of christ
and i say to myself what a long way they've got to go
well it's only it's only a er it's only the journey from the mind to the heart
yeah but it's the growing isn't it
well no it's an UNK journey for many
oh i do hope so cos i've never
yeah
seen it
yeah
really
yeah
i've never seen or witnessed that
you would you would say you were a gradual conversion
mm
i'm still like it now
yeah
yeah
well i wasn't i was an UNK conversion
mm
still making slow progress aren't you
oh yes
but i was an UNK conversion
yes
you're still making
yes
i think everybody UNK
yeah
all their lives
we are whether you're
to your UNK end
suddenly or slowly
yes
yeah you are
more so than what you think
does the lord wind up hill all the way the very end
i must leave now don't stop now please carry on
well i think it's time to stop now
god bless
it does tend to if you

sounds less like hay fever i must say
yeah
now er somewhere we have one of those right let's have a listen then
just undo another do you smoke

good
what job do you do
erm UNK at place

and
mm
it may well be UNK to h UNK or dust or something like that
so it may just be a seasonal thing
but i think the diagnosis is asthma or what ever t whatever's UNK it off
and we need to treat you along those lines
now
the drugs of choice for asthma are UNK drugs
yeah
then you can use very small UNK they go straight to the lungs and
mm
they work without any particular side effects
and you can use UNK like this or you can use UNK like this
mm
you can use UNK like th this UNK type
yeah
okay
and what i suggest we do is seeing UNK here we send you through to see UNK and she can if she's got time we can briefly run through one or two types
see which
mm
suits you best
yeah
er
what i can't understand i can be alright at the day and as
yeah
soon as it comes to night time i
yeah
can feel me eyes getting sore
yeah
and then it comes on and by the time two or three o'clock i i'm a UNK even
yeah
even if i haven't had a UNK even the UNK everything
yeah
seems dead sensitive
yeah that's right
i
is that
as well it i
yeah
asthma tends to UNK up at various times it'll it tends
yeah
to UNK up with UNK i er and it has what's called a UNK rhythm so the body's natural UNK affect it
mm
and so it tends to be worse in the early hours of the morning and you can have another UNK in the sort of er middle to late afternoon as well
when your sort of body's running down anyway you know it's a few hours after dinner time it's not quite time to go home from work
it's a natural time to get tired and you can have a UNK ten as well
mhm
er and things like sort of er midday and a late evening er usually fine and then you have y quite a lot of UNK say they wake up in the night somewhere between two to five
and
mm
it's very common
what i think we'll do to start off with is to just put you on one UNK and see how well you respond and if you only need it ev every now and again we don't need to do anything else
some UNK need to be some on treatment on a in a regular preventative basis
mhm
in the same way we was giving people blood pressure tablets to take every day
whether
mm
they feel well or not
i think to start off with we'll just give you something to UNK the symptoms
yeah
and see what you need so er
i mean it's been r been really bad as i you know i you know as er i don't know what to do with myself you know
yeah
it course no sleep at night
and walking about in
right you've only got a UNK there's no evidence of
yeah
an f an infection at all there
there's no UNK and it's expanding well and it UNK three eight two which is okay but it's quite down on what it should be
