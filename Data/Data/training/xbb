so you're going either UNK or UNK and we're going ask UNK to see if she's free
okay
right thank you
er and then we'll see what device cos the i mean there's a couple more devices apart from those and you know different people are suited to different ones
there's no point in me giving you type a when type b's better for you
yeah
so we'll ask her to run through and see what's what
okay
follow me
right
i know but erm if i don't see i'm gonna crack
ah

right cheerio now
i expect that everyone came to church here this evening because they knew that it was a communion sunday and the sacrament of holy communion would be celebrated here this evening
but there are many of you here also because this is start of the evening services for the winter
and you're most likely here not just for communion but because it's your custom to come to the six thirty service
i do very much hope that i can persuade those of you who have just come for communion to join with us regularly at this service in the weeks that lie ahead
now please don't think that i'm saying this for the benefit of somebody else
if the evening service is to remain a strong service of christian witness then it needs you not just the ministers and the UNK and the choir
it needs you
and i hope that you will commit yourself to come regularly
next sunday at this time we're going to be having a service of UNK for the leaders of our organizations
and UNK for every individual that cares to come along
for the next few months mr and i are going to home in on a theme for these services
and the theme will be aspects of christian living
and we're going to take some perfectly ordinary UNK of life and try to address them in terms of what they should mean to the christian believer
how we should respond to them
we're going to be talking about things like the christian and sin the christian and responsibility
things like our salvation our failures love
topics like that
tonight then it's a communion UNK service but let me just spend a few minutes just UNK a little background on some of life's challenges
the challenges which jesus himself presents to christians and the challenges which life presents in a general sense
in the gospel of saint matthew tonight we read in chapter sixteen at versus twenty four and twenty five these words
jesus told his disciples if any man would come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me
for whoever would save his life will lose it
and who ever loses his life for my sake will find it
now there's a challenge if ever there was one
jesus christ never ever calls people to the little things of life
jesus christ was big himself he came into the world to do big things and he calls us to do big things
but there's something in even the very best of us which would really prefer to take the easy way out if that's at all possible
but jesus so often pints the hard way and challenges us to follow him through that hard way
and so now other course needless to say is worthy of the real christian
it is an attractive thing to follow jesus christ but it's no bed of roses
his call is perhaps the hardest but it's also the highest
now life's full of challenges the business person on this world is challenge to work hard and to make wealth
wealth sometimes for himself
wealth very often on behalf of others
the professional person is challenged to serve well and to make a name for himself or herself
all sorts of challenges but life's biggest challenge is the challenge that jesus christ makes to the christian
so what are the challenges of jesus christ
well one of them is to show that there is something different about us
to show that we do live UNK lives and that we try sincerely however UNK but try sincerely to UNK from the UNK side of life and to concentrate on everything that's UNK
a good example of that i read about it was the UNK who was making a study of UNK
and he took a poisonous UNK and forced its mouth open and inserted a glass under its UNK and drew out a couple of drops of deadly poison
and when the poison was put under the UNK it seemed to contain the most beautiful colours of the UNK
a most attractive thing and yet it was a deadly poison
UNK in life can been seen like that too
it looks so often it looks beautiful and it looks innocent and people are attracted to it christians also
and falling before temptation it's easy to let yourself slide down into things that can be very UNK
UNK to ourselves and UNK to christ
and jesus says come out from among these things come out from among them
and some honest christian people do and some find it very hard to do
and those who find it hard to reject a sinful situation could often argue that they're above it and no way is it UNK them
and maybe that's the case or appear to be the case but it can be UNK the cause of christ
so one of the challenges t is to be ale to show that there is something different about those of us who are christians
something that other people can see something that other people like in us
something that other people can be encouraged to live up to
show jesus christ by your personal example
and following on from that there's the challenge of being faithful to jesus throughout life
not just when we find it suitable
someone once asked a shepherd whether his sheep would follow a stranger and he said
when they're well they won't do that
they won't follow a stranger but when they're sick they'll follow anyone
now if you sort of turn that round there's a lot in it as it applies to christians
when things are going well there doesn't seem quite the same need to be faithful
indeed even if you are faithful to the gospel that's the time that you often go off on your own and experiment with this and that different type of church different type of fellowship something that's perhaps not particularly christ centred at all
but it's different when you're up against it different when you're UNK sick
the history of the whole of the church shows that having been full to UNK in times of crisis in times of war for example
but in peace time people drift away
but jesus christ calls his people to be faithful all the time throughout life
not just when it suits
i wonder whether christ would not rather go to UNK again than to suffer the UNK of some of his friends
surely the cross didn't hurt him as much as our UNK can
and following from that there's the challenge connected with seeking jesus constantly seeking jesus
how do we seek him
we seek him in prayer
over and over again jesus says you pray and i will answer
listen to saint UNK gospel again
ask and it shall be given seek and you'll find knock and it will be opened
for every one who asks receives
he that seeks finds to him that knocks it will be opened
well we read about prayer and we know about its power but you know we often don't UNK ourselves off it and yet it's plainly written
let me give you a UNK example
don't know if you remember in the old testament the book of genesis
a UNK about UNK and UNK
UNK had not seen UNK since he had UNK him out of his UNK twenty years previously
and he knew that UNK hated him and he was afraid to meet him
and because he was afraid to meet him UNK spent the night before meeting him in prayer
and that is like an awful lot of us
we wait until trouble comes until trouble is UNK us in the face before we really feel the need of god and pray
jesus christ challenges us okay
then why should we accept his challenges
why not just ignore them
well we should accept them for the sake of our own spiritual growth for one thing
it's a great inner joy to feel that you're growing in grace
at the end of a year it's good to look back and to feel that you have made some progress in your spiritual life
there are many people and probably a few of you here tonight who have been members of the church for a long time
and although you've grown physically grown mentally grown possibly financially
don't feel that you've grown all that much UNK
you feel perhaps you don't know very much more about the bible than you did say ten years ago
well perhaps this is a good time just to take stock and to say i know that i'm not all that i should be and all that i ought to be but by this time next year i'm going to be a bit better than i am just now in spiritual terms
i'm going to grow UNK
so we can accept that challenge
we can accept UNK challenge for the sake of our own spiritual growth
and we should accept it also for the sake of our sinful world
for the sake of those round about us who don't have whatever commitment we have
just remember that the world is looking at we christians
the world is looking at us
i was reading an article the other day in a theological journal about the church in korea an UNK it was growing and how people were taking their faith seriously
and because they were prepared to go out and speak about their faith people were being converted from UNK to christianity in their thousands
if our faith is just a tiny part of us then nobody is going to notice
but if we act as if we belong to jesus christ then we shall be seen to have that plus and others will be attracted to jesus christ through us
i was speaking a minute ago about UNK and UNK
you remember the time when UNK all night with the angel of the lord
the angel struck UNK on the UNK and UNK for the rest of his life
that experience changed him in every way
christians have had an experience with christ
let us hope that it UNK itself through some outward show
as a christian do you feel that you've been changed
can others see jesus christ in you
or in me for that matter
i'm not sure how many people are led to jesus christ through UNK
i'm sure that feeding people the word regularly is a great help
it encourages our spiritual growth but the initial step the initial step which people make is generally as a UNK result of something much more simple much more basic
it's often more an example of a good life or a special UNK
what we refer to as a good christian action
my friends let's just remember this night that as we've shared bread and wine together we've UNK that jesus christ gave his life so that we might live
for his sake then let us give of our best in every sense of that term
let us accept his challenge let us be better christians and let us begin it now
you find the text this morning in saint matthew chapter seventeen versus twenty and twenty one
for truly i say to you if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed you will say to this mountain move from here to their at it will move
and nothing will be impossible to you
last sunday you may remember i held up something at the start of the service and it was my mail from the previous day and we UNK in on one UNK letter which had h m inspector of taxes in it
can you see what i'm holding up in my and this morning
no of course of you can't because i've got nothing in it
and even if i did have and had a mustard seed here you still wouldn't be able to see it for a mustard seed is no bigger than a pin head
it's not quite the smallest of all the seeds but nevertheless it's small enough to make a UNK point like tall as a house or small as a mouse small as a grain of mustard seed
and as we heard this morning jesus told us a parable about a mustard seed although it's small it grows into quite a large UNK
one with a height of anywhere between six and ten feet
almost a tree in fact
it's big enough for birds to come and make their UNK in it
and jesus said that god's UNK the rule of heaven is something like a mustard seed which starts out tiny and ends up big
and jesus also used the example of the mustard seed to talk about faith
jesus saint peter and james and john had just been on the mountain top at the site of the UNK a high point in the gospel story and right on the UNK of that they UNK into the valley below and there was a crowd with UNK others disciples
and out of the crowd came this man who UNK before jesus and pleaded for mercy for his son an UNK who suffered terribly was a danger to himself and to others
and the disciples had apparently been unable to help the boy
a UNK jesus says oh UNK and UNK generation how long am i to be with you
how long am i to bear with you
bring him here to me
and then UNK the UNK who's presence is assumed to UNK the UNK jesus UNK this healing
and so the stage is set and the disciples came to jesus privately asking why they couldn't cast it out
why could they not heal the boy
well i supposed we'd all like to know the answer to that
jesus said simply that they failed because they had little faith
now i've always taken that to mean that if they had big faith they would have been alright
they should have had greater confidence in their power to heal
and i've always heard what jesus goes on to say in the context of that understanding of the text
for truly i say to you if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed you'll say to this mountain move from here to there and it'll move and UNK be impossible
and the way that the text is translated i've always supposed that jesus must have thought that mustard seeds had a lot of faith
something that starts out so tiny must have a lot of faith to believe that it can become something big
and we're supposed to have faith like that faith that can UNK something big
now matter how small our UNK
we should even be able to move mountains if we have enough faith
well there's only one thing wrong with that interpretation of the text
i don't know about you but i have a hard time believing that
i can't believe that if you have enough faith you can move a mountain from here to there
certainly not a literal mountain
and probably not a UNK mountain either
now there are some people who have UNK believed that they an do such grand things but for the most part they've failed
i find it hard to believe that all you need is a big faith for mountains to be moved
and then when i was reading the text really carefully i came to the conclusion that that's not really what jesus is saying
the problem with UNK disciples and the point here is that it's our problem as well is not that we lack a big faith
the problem is that we lack virtually any faith
the problem is a lack of virtually any faith at all
what we need is not enormous confidence that we can move mountains as if they were UNK
what we need is not that UNK
what the text says is that we are to have faith as a grain of mustard seed
that's what we're to have
that's the size we're to have faith the size of a mustard seed
jesus is calling his disciples to have a little faith
faith as big as this UNK mustard seed that you can't see
and the point of his saying seems to be that with the UNK of faith the great tasks can be UNK
that's what the kingdom of heaven god's UNK over the world is really like
from the very smallest can come something great
this UNK of the mustard seed is not to call us to some great UNK b UNK like ambition
it doesn't require us to believe that anything can and will happen if we believe big enough and hard enough
it's simply calling us to have a little faith
faith no bigger than a mustard seed
and it UNK us than even with minimal faith god's purposes will be UNK beyond all that we can believe
now you see in our day and generation we don't need to be reminded of the importance of little things
the more we learn about the UNK the more we're astonished at its complexity and its UNK power
the more complex and ambitious our technology the more we realize the billion pound difference that there can be in a UNK
the further we research into the UNK of the human genes the closer we come to the possibility of UNK human biological existence
the knowledge that we now have about UNK and development of the human UNK speaks to us of the miracle of our existence
and as we know can greatly UNK the moral and ethical UNK of human sexuality and UNK and abortion
we all know perhaps too well the great consequences that flow nowadays from very little things
none the less in the realm of human events the teaching of jesus still goes against our conventional UNK because we all assume that big outcomes need big inputs
the logic of human effort would say that to UNK great things for god we've got to have great faith
but when jesus says faith the size of a mustard seed will do then we have our doubts
someone once said more people are UNK by believing nothing than by believing too much
and i think jesus would probably agree believing nothing gets us no where we can do nothing without faith
faith we're told is the UNK of the soul
now that's an expression worth remembering
faith is the UNK of the soul
someone without faith has no prospect no promise of salvation no hope of life to come
future is closed
but that does not follow that with a great big faith we can anything
jesus teaching is not so much about our faith it's really about god's power
it's not the amount of faith that we can UNK
what go what jesus is saying is don't cut god out
give god the slightest opportunity open yourselves to the spirit even to the smallest degree and you'll be amazed what can happen
if you're open to the divine power even just a little bit
that's enough for god to go to work in you
that's the miracle of the kingdom of heaven god will take it from there
so we mustn't take ourselves too seriously in this
UNK talk about moving mountains maybe provided a note of humour
it's a ca case of gross UNK in order to make a point and UNK are full of that
the point is that we will never know what god can do with us until we've UNK forward with a little faith
we're probably not the people that we think we are
people of modest faith but not enough for the really big challenges of life
i think jesus is saying don't kid yourself you've hardly got any faith at all
we UNK when it comes to healing the world's UNK and UNK its great sins
far from being only slightly shy of great faith we're almost completely UNK in the art of letting god be god
and of UNK ourselves in to the power of his mercy
how did you get where you are today
what started you off say on the track of your present work
if you're married what are the circumstances under which you and your spouse met
possibly you can't remember
many of the young couples that come here to see about their weddings when asked admit that their relationship had a pretty UNK beginning
most didn't start out with plans to get married
most of us didn't begin our education or our first job with plans to do what we're actually doing today
most of us have lived long enough to know that you can't say with any certainty where you might be in the future
and part of the mystery of our existence is if they we if we give ourselves in faith to god even in the small and UNK ways the consequences of doing that might be enormous
UNK disciples with their little faith were soon to become a small jewish UNK
their leader whose own origins were UNK speaking was going to die a pretty UNK death but those who had gathered around him subsequently discovered that there were depths to experience and power that words can hardly explain
that little faith went on to go right round the world and it's here today
faith my friends is the prospect that all our relationships can be UNK it's UNK towards a movement of grace a path to discover just how little life is of our own making and how much of it comes from a gift which is not our own
if we would have faith only the size of a mustard seed how our lives would be enhanced
many of the UNK would be resolved many of the UNK dissolved
our world would be a different place
because if we did that we would be much more fully in the hands of god
would we not
so have faith as a grain of mustard seed amen
there are two UNK for the sermon this morning which as you know is on god the holy spirit
since we've been thinking these past few weeks about what christians believe the first text would be in the er skeleton outline that we've been taking in the UNK creed which says i believe in the holy ghost
you'd find that in hymn five four six
i believe in the holy ghost
the other text would be saint john chapter three verse eight
the last verse that we read
the wind UNK where it wills and you hear the sound of it but you do not know UNK it comes or UNK it goes
so it is with everyone who is born of the spirit
now one of these UNK speaks about the holy ghost and the other one speaks about the holy spirit
perhaps that we should get rid of all the wrong associations with the word ghost which no longer means what it meant for example when the UNK creed was first translated into english
spirit is much more in the language of today
god the holy spirit that means god's energy or god's power present with us now
and UNK a strange thing because you can't see it as such
you can only see its results
it's been interesting these past few days to watch the energy of the sun through the effect that it's had on the snow
each time i come out of the onto i'm impressed by the fact that the snow has been much more pronounced on our side of the road than on the other which has cleared much more quickly
and of course it's heat of the sun which strikes the other side but which UNK our side
and if you look at the roofs of a row of houses a few days after any snow fall some roofs are free of snow quite quickly and some take much longer even although there's no sun
and the roofs that keep the snow for along time do so either because the house is UNK or it's pretty cold inside or it's got a well UNK loft
in other words there's not much heat rising from the living area
but for the others heat rises through the roof and enables the snow to melt
you can't see the warmth that causes that to happen you can only see the result of it
and the result is snow coming off the roof
in other words you can't see the power you can only see the result of the power
the holy spirit the power of god
god's power resent with us in the here and now we can't see it but we can feel it
we can see though the result of it
this word spirit appears in the very first verse of the bible where it states that the earth was without form and void
and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters
and that's the bible referring to the beginning of life or the movement and the agent of god's activity is the spirit
and the UNK word for spirit is UNK and that really has two meanings
and the first meaning is quite simply the wind
and that's quite helpful
at some time or another most of us will have sat beside the shore of a loch when there's complete calm and not a breath of air
and you know you look at the water and you see in the water a perfect reflection of what there is above
and then almost UNK the calm surface become UNK and the clear images UNK and it becomes UNK
and it does that because a wind has UNK up you can't see it but you can observe its effect
and that illustration offers the same image of an invisible power and with this we can begin to see the spirit of god at work in the world
the UNK word UNK and the other idea of that word is breath and that's not really too different
god formed man from the dust of the ground says the book of genesis and UNK into his UNK the breath of life and man became a living soul
the old testament idea of the spirit of god breathing into human beings something of his own life or sometimes it's something giving a extra quality of living
indeed sometimes this spirit of god comes to specific people to UNK them for a particular task
for example it might perhaps enable a prophet to speak out UNK in god's name
in that and in other ways it's the UNK agency of god's activity
and in the new testament the word for the spirit there is the greek UNK p n e u m a UNK
and that has the same two meanings really wind and breath
and from that word comes UNK which simply refers to a pressure of air
from that word too comes UNK an infection which we can get in our human breathing apparatus
holy spirit the agent of god's activity
as i mentioned a couple of sundays ago the spirit is UNK active at the conception of jesus
conceived by the holy ghost or the holy spirit
and this spirit continues with jesus thereafter it UNK on him at baptism it drove him out into the wilderness to be tempted and so on
the spirit is the agent of god's activity
i believe in the holy spirit
god in three person father son and holy spirit and yet one god
baptism for example is to be in the name of the father the son and the holy spirit
and the UNK at the end of every service speaks of benefits from father son and holy spirit
the third person of the UNK
the holy spirit ranks equally along side the other two
not UNK in any way god's presence with us now
professor james a former professor of church history at the university of aberdeen has a little story which goes like this
he says two men are looking at a UNK one of them is UNK and UNK by the glory of the UNK clouds and his heart is lifted up to god in UNK and wonder
the other one UNK at the UNK and remarks ha it looks like being a wet day tomorrow
a revelation of beauty has entered into the one person but not the other
late afternoon yesterday my family and i were going up to UNK to visit the bible class who about a dozen UNK and one or two UNK high on the hill
shortly after that we UNK a bend and there was sheet ice on the bend and i felt the car beginning to slip away from me
when we reached UNK we could have done two things we could have said to the bible class we had a marvellous journey up and told them all about the glory of god as we saw him in the mountains or we could have said we almost had an accident on our way up here
again it depends on how you look at it
the same with jesus many people looked at jesus and saw a village joiner or saw a wandering preacher or saw a wonder working doctor or a political UNK
but a few looked at him and saw god
the revelation was there but not everybody had eyes to see it
the revelation remained external it remained outside the hearts of the majority of the people
but it did enter the hearts of some
and where it did these people became the power of god unto salvation
and the power which set this realization in motion is the holy spirit
it is the task of the holy spirit to take the revelation god as given to us through jesus christ and to bring it home to us step by step as we're able to grasp it
the spirit points us to christ and UNK what is in christ
and what is revealed in christ is the mystery of god
the god who is above us as UNK and father the god who is beside us as christ our brother the god who is within us as god the holy spirit
it's the one true god who UNK us UNK in each of these three persons he who knows christ knows the father also and he who has the spirit has the father and the son as well
breathe on me breath of god fill me with life UNK that i may love what thou UNK love and do what thou UNK do
some of you here i'm sure will have had the opportunity of visiting UNK falls
and if you've ever been there and taken the trip on the little boat which takes you right in to the base of the falls themselves you'll have seen that there's a hydro electric station which takes power from the water at night when some of the force is diverted and instead of the water going over the falls it goes through the hydro electric station
and power which is generated there goes to heat and light the city of UNK and some of it goes to cook the UNK in the city of UNK and some of it UNK the homes in the city of UNK
and in years gone by i understand that some of it was used to UNK the criminals
and the whole reason for these falls is that lake UNK is a hundred and sixty nine feet below lake UNK
if both of them were on the same level there would be no falls there would be no power
it's something for us all to have power from behind such as our church
power before us such as the UNK or the hope of a coming achievement
power round about us like an organization or a culture but that's somehow power on the level
we all need in a sense power from on high the power from the great UNK of god
the power of the holy spirit
and it's along these power lines from god the holy spirit that comes the power which gives light to those who live in darkness
it's along these spiritual power lines that comes the power that gives warmth and sympathy and UNK
and it's along these power lines that come health and UNK and UNK
and along these power lines also comes death for we recall that little bit of power in UNK which in former days used to rid the state of its criminals
and i UNK that to the power from above which can UNK our sinful UNK
because everything that's in our lives and is UNK to god can surely be put into the chair of judgement ad the power turn on and they're gone
and we're free to live positive and useful and good lives
how does one describe the power of the holy spirit
i'm sure that in itself is one of god's great UNK
because the kind of UNK and human illustrations that i've been trying to use this morning are all bound to fall short
but the spirit UNK the faith by which we know christ and it's surely that which makes all the difference between the a mere interest in an historical jesus and our real living faith in our risen UNK son
today we are celebrating the sacrament of the lord's supper
and in that act we believe that in a spiritual sense that we are lifted up
lifted up to a new level and a new UNK to our lord jesus christ
we're brought close to him in a spiritual sense
god the holy spirit at work
god with us in the here and now
as we draw near to the table in the course of the nest few minutes to meet with our lord in the bread and in the wine let's just remember today that the power that the energy that the spiritual renewal comes to us because god is with us and god is with us now because of the activity of god the holy spirit
amen
let us pray
well now there's a fine text to take on a summer sunday morning
some of us are going on holiday
some of us have been holiday
some of us are on holiday at this very time
in fact holidays was the theme taking by the UNK who were taking the family service at ten o'clock this morning
and there was a lot of little hands were shooting up when they were being asked where were they going on holiday
rejoice in the lord always a great text for UNK days
i don't know about you though it's a text that i have quite often had difficulty with and it's and again i say rejoice and again i say rejoice
and that's virtually all it says but it goes over the words again and again as if it's trying to force you to rejoice through learning the words off by UNK
there are times when some people find it plain hard to rejoice
and they're not help particularly by this text which can consume them with a sense of guilt as far as their faith is concerned
because their faith tells to rejoice but circumstances of life can be such that UNK is the one thing that they cannot do
and paul goes on a couple of verses later to write have no anxiety about anything
and that can seem to rub in this feeling of christian UNK
i suppose that the traditional interpretation of this text would be like saying that the beginning of worry or the beginning of anxiety is the end of faith
where faith ends anxiety takes over
put that the other way round the beginning of true faith means the end of anxiety
no i suppose we've got to admit that that's true if we really had faith we wouldn't be anxious
but there's times in most lives UNK faith is weak and anxiety is strong
there are times when we think that if we really had faith if we really believed if we were true christians then we would have this peace and UNK about us
and because we can't be like that we feel UNK and we feel that we're less than perfect in our faith
and so i suppose we must go back and we must say well is paul serious
does he really mean rejoice at all times
i think that paul could feel UNK because he felt that his life was UNK its end at the time that he wrote
earlier on in the same piece of writing in the same letter to the UNK he had said that for him to die was gain
in his letter to the romans he wrote that whether we live or die we belong to god
in other words paul didn't fear death
more than that he was almost certainly looking forward to it because it meant going home to be with the lord
indeed for paul the lord was at hand the lord was the centre of life
when paul wrote about the source of his joy he didn't say maybe or possibly
he said i am sure i am sure that neither death nor life nor anything else in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord
but here's an interesting point
in the second chapter of UNK a little bit before where we read paul's describing the UNK of the illness of his friend and UNK and even although he had written that the thought of his own death caused him no UNK whatever when he was writing about his friend UNK being at the point of death he said but god had mercy on him and not only upon him but on me also UNK i should have sorrow on sorrow
would the death of UNK have brought joy to paul no it would not
it would have brought sorrow on sorrow
so being a christian then does not UNK us from sorrow or from grief
to love someone means that when that person dies we can suffer sorrow upon sorrow
rejoice in the lord always
probably not
if we do so we may deny our pain it would be to pretend that all is well and that would mean to deny the UNK faith
someone once wrote the UNK and insight of UNK faith is the awareness that only UNK can lead to life
only UNK can lead to joy only UNK permit new UNK
UNK comes out of pain
UNK grief is the gate of UNK
so if we are to think of all of this in terms of christian joy then we must realize that joy does not come from being immune to everything else that's going on
it comes from knowing that no matter how intense a pain might be or our sorrow or our UNK that jesus christ is the ultimate victor
it mean that we may not be able to rejoice in what is happening now
and we may not be able to rejoice in certain things that have happened in our past
but we can always have faith that we will rejoice in what is going to happen in the future
the joy of the christian is that when we express our sorrow and our anxiety we shall receive god's peace and we shall receive god's joy
paul said have no anxiety about anything but he didn't stop there he goes on to explain how to rid our lives of anxiety
he says but in everything by prayer and UNK with UNK let your requests be known to god
and then the piece of god which passes all understanding will keep your hearts and your minds in christ jesus
that's the joy of the christian
and the joy of the christian you know is found in knowing that god's going to sustain us no matter what the future holds
goodness knows you hear somebody saying sometimes goodness knows why he should suffer like that he never did any harm to anyone
well that may indeed be so but the christian faith has never entered into that particular point because the christian faith is never in the business of checks and balances
when we turn to god in prayer and UNK with UNK god will fill us with the peace which passes all understanding nothing in all creation can separate us from the love of god which is expressed in jesus christ his son our lord
god works together for good in all things
some of us here today may not have all that much reason to rejoice right now but god will ultimately lead us all forward in joy
christian joy is found when we hold on to god's hand and when we learn that fabulous certainty with which we can step out into the UNK of the coming day
when we really dare to trust god we find that god is really there
and even those who UNK through life are constantly and UNK surprised by god's presence
whenever we confess our anxiety he helps and as we confess we receive joy and peace
oh what UNK we often UNK oh what needless pain we bear all because we do not carry everything to god in prayer
being anxious is normal the next stage though is to admit the anxiety and to ask for the faith to see it through
rejoice in the lord always and again i will say rejoice
to rejoice in the lord is to have the UNK confidence that he is always at hand and that you and i are always in his hand no matter what happens
that is the blessed assurance
the blessed assurance that god is present in every event that he is present in every circumstance that he is working with us to save to heal to forgive to UNK to restore
UNK in the lord is having the assurance that nothing is ever lost that nothing is ultimately beyond him and his power
in any difficult situation we can know that when we have done what's in our power to do we can place our problem into god's hand and into god's care knowing that he perhaps has other hands to take up our work that we have done all we can do with
so we must take a text like this at face value
let us rejoice in the lord always in the midst of everyday life for the lord is always near
the UNK of jesus promise that the harvest will come and our constant prayer is that the kingdom will come and that all god's children will be free
thy kingdom come say it almost every sunday
it will come maybe not today maybe not tomorrow maybe not next week but UNK it will come
there are times in the life of our soul and the summer season is UNK of it times when we're worried when we hit a difficult patch
times when we all get down in the UNK but god can always reach deep within us and put us back on our feet again
and in any event we rejoice that god is leading us all forward to that day when we shall be with him when we will be with the one who makes all things new
rejoice in the lord always yes for he UNK the broken heart he UNK up the UNK again i say rejoice
there are those of us here today who are happy
there are even a few who i'm sure don't have a care in the world although i'm almost prepared to stick my neck out and say that they're in the minority
but if you are in that fortunate position then rejoice and give thanks
give thanks and do your best to spread your good fortune around as the old song goes spread a little happiness
but if and most of are i'm sure that we've come today with some UNK in our flesh somewhere some worry some difficulty or a disappointment perhaps of some kind then just remember that in all things god works together for good with those who love him and for that rejoice and give thanks and again i say rejoice
let us pray
trying to put it in the bin not my fault
yes
what have you done to this poor wee man
it's his leg doctor
what's she done to you
rash
what've they been doing to you
were they bad to you
were they
were they bad
these women are all the same
you'll
get used you'll used to it
i'd better look under the big light
there we go let's see what's
what did i do
were they bad
were they
were they bad to you
were they
are you just kidding me on
are you
are you just kidding on
are you
are you just kidding on
are you just kidding on
you're just kidding on
aren't you
just kidding me on
oh that's a good boy there now
oh it's only an allergic rash
it's just
yes
or on his body or anything
and she said this afternoon
aha
and she advised to bring
him in to
it looks like an allergic rash
have you changed your soap powder or erm fabric UNK
i don't used it cos my husband's allergic to it
aye that's certainly what it looks like
mhm
you know that type of thing
either a fabric UNK or a soap powder rash
he's not on any UNK
no he got his UNK last thursday
aye i wouldn't do that to you i wouldn't do that
i wouldn't do it to you
right okay up you come and we'll get you something for that
it's not erm anything that's he's going to pass on
it looks much more like erm an allergic rash and he's got an allergic reaction to something
mm
isn't it
who's that sitting there
you like that
you can see everything now
he just loves fun don't you
he loves attention
he would love to walk as well
he would love to walk
wouldn't you
i wish he would walk he's been so heavy for me to carry
why carry you instead is it
i'm not so sure about that
are you
he loves to get thrown up and
do you do you like that
the UNK the better
there we are
now then you go back to your mum i'll write something down on a prescription here for you
if it was an UNK to soap powder would it take a long time to come out
can do it can take several months before it comes out
i had been washing all his hand
his clothes by hand before i went back to work and of course i don't have quite the same time
that's right
so i've been putting them in the washing machine so maybe
it could be something as simple as that
and it would take maybe it could take longer i mean it
yes it takes it could take to get the skin UNK
i see
and then to produce a reaction
so i'd be best to go back to
aye i think so
i'm afraid i'm afraid so
the only other thing i would say is erm
right well it's just two minutes three minutes past eight o'clock and erm i welcome you all to this UNK meeting of greater manchester west liberal democrats
greater manchester west just in case anybody is in any doubt consist of eight parliamentary constituencies
UNK east UNK bolton west bolton northeast bolton UNK north and UNK south
it has erm at the last european election it had five hundred and twenty two thousand voters so picking the candidate is really the first stage on s trying to get amongst five hundred and twenty two thousand voters
er that was bob who's from UNK he's a steward

and er we er UNK through this until tonight and er i think i'm right mr returning officer say that we're the first euro constituency in the UNK to get to this stage
so erm in spite of all the odds of trying to get a candidates a at the beginning and finding that there wasn't one available and it wouldn't isn't one e well not didn't exist
i must say that street er they were a little busy at the time with UNK and UNK and who can blame but them that they were very successful
if er if we can be as successful next june i'd be very happy
erm well what we decided on the procedure was that we'd UNK a coin in front of you all we must be democratic and some either of these two gentleman is going to say heads or tails and whoever wins can choose either to go erm first or second
they have er thirty minutes each er twenty minutes a at least ten minutes have to be given over to you for questions so they speak for a maximum of twenty minutes

so we er we'll time them so we must be terribly fair
and it's er
six minutes seven minutes past
seven minutes past eight
john
l john is first he's from UNK and i'm certain you've all read his er little report
well good evening everybody friends liberal democrats
my name's john and i am indeed from UNK local party in the euro constituency of greater manchester east
and to get one thing out of the way straight away
greater manchester west is my first choice not greater manchester east and when i looked at the vote in the last contest back in nineteen eighty eight when the erm then alliance or the ex alliance vote was split between the social erm liberal democrats as they were then and the s d p and saw the votes i had to beat this time six thousand nine hundred i thought i can look good next to that
erm being more serious erm UNK isn't very far away and it only took me thirty minutes to get from my house in UNK to here tonight and although some of the UNK further away than this and that is actually one of the main considerations and we're local
erm the european UNK next year europe the issue
i think the first thing you're going to need from any candidate is that they're going to have to believe in europe
the public aren't convince if the candidate isn't convinced it's going to be difficult for everybody
and i am convinced about europe and i do believe in europe very much
one of the first books i read as a young adult was a g l UNK history of europe
and it struck me straight away that although the twentieth century as it marched on made us look more and more like americans we are europeans we always have been europeans our roots are there our UNK there and of course in the late twentieth century our economic needs and the geographical links the electronic links mean that we are there whether we like it or not
and i'm proud to be a european and believe in europe as well as accepting the UNK
i believe some of the things we have to share with the europeans and learn from them are very urgent in britain at the moment
there is the little manner of planning
we don't like everything the french do but they plan things like railways
and public transport is in my view one of the most disgraceful aspects in modern britain
and one where if we're not prepared to learn from the europeans whether it's integrated transport in cities or whether it's intercity links or wherever we're going to be in a great deal of trouble
and education
even although spain is not one of the most well off one of the UNK countries they pumped money into education after democracy and e c ownership came to their country
and they've caught up from being one of the most UNK countries in europe to on the edge of the leading group
education
planning for transport things like that
we have to learn form them we have to be in with them we are europeans and that is our UNK
and it's the liberal democrats friends that have got the best policies on these things
we're the one's who UNK say europe has to go forward if it doesn't go backwards
we are going to have europe as an e c since we accepted for example the single market
if we don't move towards some form of federal structure with of course some UNK we will UNK we will go backwards
we're not ashamed to say that
the heart of europe as we mean it is not john major's heart of europe
a sort of erm standing really on the UNK just stopping people from doing things and UNK when other people get into difficulties
our europe is a is a europe which is proud that we are similar and we can share things
we believe in the social contract
i was a bit disappointed that we weren't that warm on it initially
and it is actually now being remembered by one or two of our UNK
but whatever we are keen on it now we should always have been and if you treat people at the work place just like dirt if you continue to turn britain into a sweat shop drive down wages drive down people's rights then you may get some form of external investment come into this country but we will never compete with the dutch and the germans and the UNK and we will never have a happy and united country
i'm proud that we are now fully in line with the social contract
and as i say we believe that we have to have a federal structure and we believe in m democracy throughout europe and throughout britain
and i always find it extremely amusing that the government of this country UNK about brussels wanting to UNK everything when they of course are the most UNK british government the present conservatives that we've ever known
and the idea of local democracy in this country for example is totally UNK next to parts of the UNK republic of germany or italy or indeed many other countries
so we've got the right policies i believe in europe i'm sure you round the room here tonight do it's an issue we've got to raise
now what about the coming campaign
it's all very well believing in things it's all very well being on board for the ideas but this campaign in greater manchester west and elsewhere has got to achieve things
it's not long away the second week in june next year
even though we're first to get going we're not exactly quick to get going
and i view that this campaign as having basically four major and one personal objective
the objectives are surely that we do the liberal democrats some real good both nationally and in this area in the longer term as well as for next june
until we remove the present government from westminster then europe is going to struggle to do us a great deal of good
because the present british government are so totally UNK they're such a dead hand they are doing so much damage that the liberal UNK have got to be seen as a party that can help beat them or indeed entirely on its own beat them
and next june is a great opportunity for the liberal democrats
even if some of the signs of UNK of turn around of better things to come the government are trying to trumpet at the moment
even if they turn out to be right some of them they still have british rail privatization they still have vat on fuel they still have rising water charges they still have the education UNK
they are in a lot of trouble and we have got to benefit from it
i think as i said before the pro the idea of europe the profile of europe is important and although i don't think i should be campaign if i win tonight on things that interest me and don't interest others i'm not afraid to say that i do want to make it to a degree at least a genuine european campaign
i want us to get a thoroughly good vote in this euro constituency by UNK our effectiveness
getting out to vote for us the people who will vote for us
it may be a low UNK but our voters don't have to be part of a low UNK
and there could be a protest vote there will be a protest vote as the UNK knew last time and we to our sadness found out last time
there is a c a protest vote in such elections that can be UNK very successfully
now also knowing that there's only just over five hundred or just six hundred members of the liberal democrats in the eight constituencies that UNK our euro constituency there will be many benefits that can come off a euro campaign in terms of membership in terms of helpers in terms of morale and generally raising our profile just through press contacts and things like that
so i'm hoping to work with you to help the are in terms of the liberal democrat membership and UNK in a general sense that can be used later
and finally i'm obviously hoping to do myself some good
i've been a candidate before i don't like to do things badly since coming into politics i don't think i have done things badly i don't want to fail you and i don't want you to see me as a failure
so i shall be doing my best
we've got to be realistic
time is short resources are short
for my first as i put down in my erm UNK before will be to meet you in small or large groups throughout the euro constituency and see what you can do to help me and to convince you erm that i will be a good campaign leader a good candidate
to get you on board to get you on my side
to start looking at press links very quickly because ah i prospective candidate has always got a lead in and so many issues have a european dimension
erm obviously to look for the start of a campaign team as soon as possible
so that we've got a running organization that can react to things and indeed UNK as well
and clearly anyone from outside UNK manchester has got to start looking at the are and doing some research and finding out where the big firms are who the important people are etcetera to make sure that i know the area that i'm candidate in
very briefly to move on to the further thing now what about myself as your prospective candidate
what can i offer you
apart from believing in it and wanting to do it
well as i said i am a convinced european and i'm perfectly comfortable debating european issues
not just about the e c but about europe and europeans
i speak some french and some italian
my own UNK in europe is italy and er believe you me although italian politics is a terrific mess you can't help finding when you look at it italian the italian scene at the moment some of the UNK and UNK of one party rule in this country
and some of the connections are quite UNK and the actions of the italians in getting very frustrated and angry now and having the christian democrats and the UNK and the and the establishment ruling them for many years i think does them proud and er maybe a little bit of anger here about the same issues would go down quite well
erm er so i am a european i like talking about europe i've travelled extensively in europe erm so it's an interest i'm comfortable
erm as a candidate and as a pre candidate in the period up to the campaign i have been a er a parliamentary candidate twice in nineteen eighty seven in stockport and in nineteen eighty three in UNK and UNK
as i love being a candidate i love talking to voters i like being active and doing things and that's the reason basically that i want to be your euro candidate i'm ready to be a candidate again
but also in the years since the liberal UNK i've been chairman of the metropolitan stockport liberal democrats
that's the team of management that i together with one or two others built up from scratch at the beginning of the liberal democrats and we now in stockport have a highly successful erm m as i say tier of management for training for campaigning for policy development in stockport and as you probably know we do have a good record of winning local council seats
we do things well generally speaking in stockport
and i've been the leader of that party for the last four and half years i am ready to step down from that and ready to take up this challenge and i believe that those experiences and what i've done there will stand me in good UNK
because some of the time the candidate has to be some of the other things as well
you'll want other people to be you campaign manager your agent your press agent and whatever
but sometimes you have to do them yourself
and it's good to know that if you have to you can
and it's good to know if you when you know you've got to have to build teams that you've done it before
i'm a local man i've lived in stockport erm it is of course in the county of greater manchester for twenty five years
erm i have a wife erm pat and a daughter who is eighteen
erm but finally i'm a liberal democrat i'm proud to be one i was in the alliance before an s d p member it turns out i'm a great UNK of the present leader paddy UNK and i think he and all of us have done wonders since the UNK days in late eighty seven when our opinion poll rating was well single figures and not even necessarily that bigger single figure
but finally i'm a citizen
i think britain is in a mess i'm ashamed of some of the things the present government have done
i want the liberal democrats to play a major part both in britain and in europe to turning things round
and for me i want to start here thank you
well that was fourteen minutes so you've got fifteen minutes to ask questions of john and it would help i think if you want to ask a question to stand up and say who you are and where you come from which constituency
so that gentleman there
er
UNK
erm you're a european
i want to know two things from you
your views on training people for their working future
on minimum wages and pension rights
because some of these have been issues in this country this work
you mentioned pension rights you mention er workers
training
mm
training for work
yes
and i was hoping to cos i can quote you instances where people have trained in the health service and they've been told nineteen seventy four seventy five when you complete your training you're not guaranteed a job in this health authority
well training for people for work
i mean t to start off with i don't we as a nation really are
i've got a horrible feeling UNK we're doing too much of getting people ready to do low skill jobs largely from investment from outside
while the real jobs are going elsewhere
the jobs that people need good education to do
but the problem of people be being trained for jobs and then the jobs not being there i'm afraid at the moment is european wide
and my own feeling about this is that we do have to move more to planned expansion
we do have to take a leaf a little bit out of UNK book from the n the late nineteen thirties and afterwards that when things are UNK you don't UNK down the UNK you don't simply close things in
the government has the governments have got to step in to create opportunities
i know what we hear straight away oh that's government UNK that's going to cost a fortune
but UNK economics at times like this has not been a failure
once you've created the jobs for people it has given the economies an UNK and i feel it's rather a shame that the erm the great problems of the of the germans particularly have put that pressure for high interest rates through the er e r m through those UNK and one i think good thing of britain's disaster last year with their position in the e r m is that by UNK interest rates if we only had a government who wanted to use that opportunity probably we could train people for work
now our government of course still UNK completely to UNK whatever just believes that business should just get on and do what it wants and drive wages down and sack people if that's what they UNK best
erm as regards erm pension rights well my understanding is that through the maastricht treaty and the social contract certainly many of the UNK at work er will include those of people who have finished work
i don't know if you're UNK to the fact that pension rights might soon be eroded in this country
that state pension rights are being eroded
mm
whatever it is
mm
but certainly prefer to see that pensions that UNK all working people and from the time that we're men to work until they retire and that something is arrange for the person's when they're senior citizens
well i don't know you know how practical a scheme as wide ranging as that would be so i won't pretend to UNK
erm i d i d i do know that the pension rights generally in e c countries are better than here
we have one of the lowest standard pensions for a for an o a p in the whole of western europe
and certainly part of wanting the social contract is to is to give a level of UNK to our people
erm one has to say though that does mean creating wealth
that does mean balancing the books and it does mean moving away from some of the crazy policies of the present government who have of course encouraged people and companies to avoid paying tax
erm
constituency
erm one local issue which is er considerably importance in the area where i live er is the er proposition to put a very large new motorway through the area er UNK the whole of the existing motorway system in greater manchester
er the er existing euro m p gary
mm
er has done a good job one has to face it in supporting the objectors to that motorway
erm first of all er would you if er if you became euro candidate er the UNK support the objectors to this motorway and secondly would it be an embarrassment to you having to take the same line as gary on the matter
well i can answer the second one first
i e it would not be a problem for me to take the same line as either or any of my er UNK or the UNK mr erm you know if they are frankly right
what i do think is very dangerous for a p for a candidate in any party is to UNK with the big idea of any of your UNK
and i look back to the alliance days and dr UNK with elements of UNK of UNK pardon me
i've managed it
erm i knew i would once that was one
er of UNK er t to UNK with elements of that and completely destroy our credibility with a lot of people whose votes we wanted
he UNK with UNK and i UNK as a result helped to grow
on the issue of a of a particular thing in the constituency if mr is right then i don't have a problem UNK er agreeing with him
whether i would be UNK in favour of the UNK well i'll be guided
i don't live here i'll talk to people that matter yourselves and i'll be guided
you never promise things that you know totally before you've seen the facts but i expect to be reasonable certainly
hello
my name's jeff chair UNK east
buried in the sub text of your speech was the hint of ambiguity about the social chapter
mm
er you know saying that we've UNK up the policy now when erm i think a couple of years we were perhaps somewhere different
mm
what's your explanation
particularly to people who'd through that at you in the campaign
i feel in the early days the social contract wasn't particularly well known and i think our party initially felt that these things were better handled not though a proper set protocol in the maastricht treaty
er mr UNK says er no reason to disagree with him that he was always in favour of the things in the social contract but he didn't want them handled in that kind of manner
he thought it was too UNK
it turns out now that reality is coming to countries all over western europe and although i'm s i'm sorry to see the difficulties that our colleagues and friends in western europe are having erm they are beginning to realize that one or two aspirations of the so social contracts may be extremely expensive
now my own view is that this point in time we all do have to get together and agree
and i think as time's gone on our party had just realized wit the stresses and strains of more and more right wing pressure to destroy workers rights and drive wages down
including for example the UNK of the wages councils which comes up i think later this week doesn't it
erm that the time has now come to accept that we do have to do the same things and it has to be in black and white and it has to be e c wide
because let's face it if we're all one economy it isn't a level playing field if one country is inviting in erm companies er you know UNK the lot on the promise it's cheaper to get our workers to work for you don't have to pay out for this
they can be sacked if it's less than two years they've been working they can be sacked at a weeks notice or whatever it is
i mean that isn't going to create britain as part of the e c of the UNK and belgium and germany
it's going to create erm a sort of sweat shop in the midst of the others where they'll dump off stuff that they don't want some of their own people to do or their own people won't do
so i think time has moved on th the pressure from erm the economic pressure and the right wing pressure has grown and i think we're now doing the right thing
i also feel there was a bit of politics being played and there always will of course in politics
next one anyone
alan
alan erm where do you
i mean by that not
no
i'm in favour poland UNK to be brought in or are we going to remain this tight little club which is not europe if it's just that little
mm
it's a UNK to call it europe
mm
mm
i think the UNK has obviously got to be that the e c can grow
some of the things in the maastricht treaty don't make a lot of sense and some of the things that are not controversial for example don't make a lot of sense unless europe does grow
if we're going to talk about common defence and that sort of thing and common erm aid and erm trouble shooting across europe it's obviously better for as many countries as possible to be within the inner ring of the e c community
i do fear though somewhat about the whole idea of too UNK growth and countries being encouraged to run before they can walk
and i think some of the lessons from eastern europe are that they have tried to go from one old system to a new system at an incredibly UNK pace
and like a big body on small legs i in a away they're sort of rather UNK and UNK
erm the pressures in the e c at the moment i think would be better handled if as nations come en UNK economically erm they come into the e c not perhaps at the right time for those that are inside because that might be too late frankly but they're not pushed into the e c en UNK too early
i think if we're going to be realistic there are practical dangers for that can put in danger erm some of the things we've just been talking about
and we all want an e c for example with UNK rights with th with the social contract erm a UNK e c
if too many UNK countries come into the e c as full members before they're ready then i'm not sure that wouldn't in fact UNK some of the things that the recent legislation and the maastricht treaty to which we're committed would do
so i would i would think we've got to cautious but the UNK obviously have got to be to increase the size
three minutes left
a any of the thirty minutes any question
yes
good evening
erm for the er people in general terms feel given the er UNK that er we're going UNK into europe into this country
and er obviously if you're going to be european properly there has to be a full cooperation in many of the aspects of life how would you answer the these UNK this UNK of loss of UNK
it's a it's a very difficult problem
because people who feel like that feel it very deeply and very sincerely
i think it can be tackled from one or two different ways
i think i think first of all it has to be pointed out that what the maastricht treaty or i would p perhaps wouldn't always use the word maastricht but what the present policies are trying to achieve is not just erm if you like some loss of UNK but some gaining of UNK and in UNK more power for the reason in fact
so it is really a way of getting away from just everything being in westminster
and everything being in westminster UNK frankly almost as many people at the moment as too many things being in brussels
but the other way of looking at it i think is enlightened self interest
we are europeans
do we want them to go ahead without us
and that is although a negative argument a very powerful one
and when people are asked for the alternatives as being in europe they tend to UNK
i mean we're not going to go back to the days of the commonwealth and relying on you know lamb from new UNK all the time
we are not americans even though i do hate the way we sometimes run around them like the little brother
and big brother's got his own wife and family now and doesn't want little brother around any more
but we still insist we've got this special relationship and er still always want to do what they want us to do
i y sometimes i find that a bit embarrassing
but we're not americans we're not part of the UNK or when we're not part of their economic erm er area which of course is being built on e c lines now
their trade zone with central america and canada
so i think we have to push the idea of what is your alternative please
so i think enlightened self interest
a realization that it gives us rights that we don't have as well as some sharing some loss
for example i mean the one thing about the europe that the UNK electorate apparently ah understood erm was i'm sorry the UNK electorate understood was a social contract
that was the one thing that got interest
if the europeans can have it why can't we
that's exactly
and i
thirty minutes
that's good a good
well we now are going to change candidates
we're going to somehow is norman down there
can you get
i'll do it
i will erm retire
right
hopefully not for good
that's mine john
be a bad start wouldn't it
pardon
no
oh i see i'll leave
thanks a lot
you later
john
yeah
no notes
oh yeah
right well we now have our second UNK candidate erm frank
as you noticed we've put er the put how to pronounce it
and he tells me it's quite easy his little boy of three can pronounce it quite easily
erm so you have you have another thirty minutes twenty minutes or less from the candidate
then followed by er questions so frank to address the meeting
thank you mr chairman good evening ladies and gentlemen
i intend for fifteen twenty minutes or so not to get into the issues of policy because you've all got your own particular interests in that particular field and maybe that will come out during the course of the question and answer session
i'm more interested in developing what would be a campaign policy er during the course of tomorrow right through to early june of next year
but first a little bit of background cos i'm sure you've all read through the notice and details about me but i'll just remind you about some highlights
er i'm a thirty four year old accountant work and i work for a pi
social chapter
it is that is was always discussed in the context of cost within the business and cost to industry
well there were two that were UNK about as a cost of national of social chapter in this department
one was eleven billion pounds it was UNK by david hunt the employment secretary
when asked how he came up with this figure he couldn't quite s remember and his department didn't know so if you put that to one side
michael UNK came up with fourteen billion
said this is the cost to british industry
in fact the costs were only two billion in reality
the other twelve was a figure that relating to training
and it needs a government like ours to feel that in training is a cost
they don't realize it's an investment in our economy in individuals and developing erm our ability to create wealth so twelve billion cost in their mind i could tell you from someone who's directly involved in a s er obtained training for my er staff members at work
i see it as an investment in them and the company UNK the reward
you were talking west
erm you were talking about creating a high profile for example as a candidate erm can you tell us how you see the members form the constituencies round here helping you to obtain this high profile
what would you be looking for us to do to help you as the candidate if you win
well there are various ways
i think the most immediate one in that's it's on the control of the party are those er wards that have a focus leaflet
clearly that goes through many doors throughout the er the constituency and it is widely read people look forward to it
er when you UNK oh you're from focus and they come out with those focus speak so frank in the leaflet oh he's one of those he's councillor so and so's friend we'll be able to vote for him
apart from that it's the regular contact i think with local constituency and ward members across the whole of greater manchester west
i will take it upon myself in terms of UNK the press as to what er how i would project er my view
but i would want a constant dialogue through various means of communication to learn about what is going on throughout the whole constituency
er i've been able just this week to set up a little er programme at er at work whereby er i have a list of all the newspapers and t UNK and radio stations on a file and i can tap in a press release press the button and it would fax them all one after the other to the various interested bodies
so i would be able to respond from information received one evening be able to produce the press release press a button and hopefully it will go down the line if the technology will allow that
but this is how i see er establishing that profile it's principally through the press and the media
i'm not asking the same question
geoffrey er do you see the manchester evening news as a problem
erm well as you probably know bolton UNK may be regarded as rather UNK but erm we've always been a little suspicious about manchester and there probably aren't very many UNK you take the manchester evening news regularly because we have our own bolton evening news
i get it from time to time
i know that the manchester evening news from our from the bolton point of view has always has appeared to be rather than have always been appear to want to have stories
cos journalists in general are a of what be described as a lazy breed but they've got tremendous demands on their time
so be able to produce er a press release of some description or some information that is reasonably UNK then and it's reasonable pertinent to the area that they're th associated with then they may lift a good deal of it perhaps not all of it and UNK it into the newspaper
if you're suggesting and i c i wouldn't argue with you cos i really wouldn't know
if you're suggesting that the manchester evening news are UNK against the liberal democrats or that they would UNK erm us in getting a fair crack of the whip you may well be true but i think we've got that UNK overcome perhaps in every stage
because we're not one of the two main parties
we have to be more creative perhaps in the er press releases we put out not UNK one out every single day that would be UNK but whatever we do UNK out as a press release it's got to be relevant and they will find interesting
erm i wonder if you could just explain to us as to manchester public in general benefits of UNK
that's a dirty one
it is rather
well we're all i think UNK and believe that power should UNK from the top to that level of decision making best able to take the decision
erm we can take as an issue UNK employment policy
now is it appropriate for central government to say this policy for UNK for employment should apply across the whole country
i would suggest it's not
at a regional level there are individuals politicians who know that here we've got a declining mining industry
how do you deal with that in those communities
you need people at regional level and at that village level to advise and suggest how money being allocated for that communities benefit can be best spent
so UNK at the end of the day is to ensure that big brother brussels isn't taking power away from us
that would be look at it the wrong end of the telescope effectively
it is power that is going to ensure go down to that level of decision making to those people who know the problems best and would be able to deliver the right solutions
UNK
one gets the impression that two gentlemen concerned are very enthusiastic europeans seem to be looking UNK at europe
one wonders if you know the situation close to us bosnia and the other countries that are suffering in the rest of the world would occupy their thoughts
erm it would be extremely difficult t for them not to occupy our thoughts i'm not sure whether your question is inviting me to consider what the european community should be doing in the context of bosnia
well i think no greater no other individual but paddy UNK has been providing a healthy lead but sadly it's one where he's been UNK a an approach to bosnia one month
the following month the government say oh we can't possibly do that and four or five months later they UNK they happen to do it
the issue as far as i can see and i was told when i was growing it up in school about the UNK and that we must ensure that everybody remembers about the UNK in germany and that it should never ever be allowed to happen again
and that sad fact of the matter is it is happening again throughout the whole of bosnia and the former yugoslavia
it is my contention that we don't sit back and simply allow for peace to develop and we go and keep that peace
i think there is a moral obligation on the e c not necessarily the americans because it is a european problem to intervene at least to the extent of ensuring protection for ordinary civilians and ensuring that they get food and medical s provision
now the political can not be imposed
but until such time as that political solution is arrived at we have to ensure the protection of the people in that particular area of europe
more or less what i asked personal point of view that er one is afraid that europe as it is rather limited
the e c rather inward looking even turkey is knocking on the door what are your poland UNK knocking on the door and coming in
or is europe just west europe
no europe isn't just western europe but i have personal doubts about the pace of UNK things
okay we're taking four new members in the new year
but if you're going to talk about countries like turkey for example one of the provisions about membership is that there is no dispute as to boundaries that there are no conflicts on your border that you have a good humans right re human rights record
i'm afraid turkey falls foul of probably at least two of those
si yes
i've just
that's right
in terms of the other eastern UNK countries what you have to say is what is the long terms UNK and goal of the e c
i see it as having through a united europe a united economy
we're already seeing the strains on UNK european economic mo er union and e r m with the twelve nations we have i don't think it'll get any better or worse with the other four coming in
but you're going to get a wider UNK and difference of i of strength of economy by bringing in the eastern UNK in the short term
maybe in ten fifteen years the situation may change but i don't think UNK for UNK sake is going to be of benefit to the e c
we have a longer term view i think in mind
and that by all means take them in due course but it's when they can fit into the economic UNK that we've actually created
well come on we've another eight minutes
yes
erm bob UNK
erm could we have your views please er about erm transport policies more particularly motorways in the greater manchester west er area
erm the existing er euro mp has been quite active in supporting objections to the greater manchester northern relief
er would you support the objectors and would be an embarrassment to you having to s to sing the same tune as gary
councillor
i have no ob no problems in actually singing the same tune as gary what so ever
there are bound to be occasions and er it's happened a few occasions during my political life where you do er find agreement with people of various parties
because not everything was going to be UNK as an issue exclusively for the liberals or the UNK or the conservatives so there's going to be a degree of cross party support on certain issues and this indeed could be one of them
in terms of the general transport policy we have go to address the issue of the motor car
are we going to allow it to determine our policy or is our policy going to determine the car
and i think it's going to have to be the latter we are going to have to decide and the m twenty five UNK is the critical debate at the moment
are we going to go for fourteen lane high way or motorway on the m twenty five cos if you do all the roads that lead from it are going to have to be fourteen lane
i think we've got to draw the line and say there is going to be a cost to our UNK our UNK if we allow it to run in the way the government have in mind
we have to control it and those who UNK or use the car are going to have to pay the price of using that car
by putting a premium on the use of it then presumably there are going to be fewer people who are going to use it over a period of time
to actually just sit back on the hands as the government are doing is not a policy it's an UNK of responsibility
can you tell us how you specifically in the UNK about this europe in this area what benefits are going to
well they've obviously varied and most of them are economic based
at the moment we don't relating to the transport issue we haven't yet a link from the UNK down through to the UNK in to into the rest of europe
to a certain extent we're isolated up here
i would see through a more UNK involvement in europe and establishing not just the physical link of the UNK but expanding it right up to the UNK a line that goes right the way through that there is a material benefit to this area from that connection
erm by UNK that direct line and that we have training facilities here which are part of the social contract and that we have er investment through regional investment in this particular area then we can create jobs that suit the skills that we've er made available to the general population and that we got through that rail link a direct line access to all the markets within europe which is going to expand er not UNK my objections from the twelve to the sixteen and right the way through to russia
er as a euro candidate it would take a UNK amount of time
i'm wondering how you'll manage to fit it in with your work and family matters er all the time that you'll need to do this
well i think we've all got to make various allowances in terms of various commitments
if you were to say would you compromise your family and work to their UNK then no i wouldn't
anybody who would to s any s anybody saying anything to the contrary i would very much suspect their motives
er but clearly i will commit whatever time i have available and i shall make as much time as available i have the support of ross my wife this is all fully discussed before i even went through the UNK process
there's no point in going this far unless you have the family behind you
and i have a very strong extended family as you might expect of a half italian mother always cooking UNK and what have you at home
very rarely do i eat at home
erm so i i'm confident that the job that's there to be done in greater manchester west i will be able to do er to my satisfaction hopefully to the party's as well
three minutes left
little question
oh right at the back there
alan what do you think is the biggest single problem that's er is taking up time in without giving
i look at this from a point of view UNK
what is the biggest single problem taking up
i suppose it depends on the family but trying to envisage an average family on thing that would immediately come to mind erm is probably security
security in the context not just of law and order but security in terms of can they be sure that they have a job next month in six months time
and part of the reason why we're not really out of the recession is that people are not willing to commit themselves to any further expenditure because they're not quite sure in six months or twelve months time as to whether they're going to have anything in the way of a job
so it's that lack of security lack of confidence about the future and they need to be ins assured that there is hopefully a light at the end of the tunnel
and the liberal democrats can identify that point of light UNK on it and make life hopefully less UNK
well i think l i you've another minute if you want to say anything but er
anybody's got a very UNK that's you know a yes or no i mean
oh
in view of your connection with italy would you be able UNK to push the idea of proportional representation
yes
yes
no problem whatsoever because even their current s the new system they've adopted allows for p r for at least a quarter of the mps that are being returned
you see the italians when they vote in that referendum i've discussed it with quite a few cousins at the time it wasn't they're exactly
against p r they're just against the whole system
it was UNK from top to bottom and they were s they knew that it was going on
i know UNK who've given UNK and bo bottles to the teach to give their sons and daughters a good report so that they can get a place in university
UNK and UNK goes o throughout italy but it's the extent of it and who was involved in it up to the prime minister that was the problem but no i have no problems john i know you're trying to get on
erm
no
i have no problem you were UNK
so i have no problem what so ever er with advocating p r within europe in spite of my er italian background
right that's it
thank you thank you very much
i can't help but think chairman in my career i was never given a bottle of whisky to help with the
no i've never got anything ei
that's right
i've now got the job oh i think you have to go out
oh right
i've now got the job of erm first of all on your er seats were little slips asking if you'd like commit money
but now id the time to vote
and the UNK box is for your votes and the one with the black label on is for your money or your commitment or your promises
so don't anybody say we're all crackers
thank you
it's not for that it's for
ooh yes
yes thank you
neil did
if it if it had been a tie we would have UNK a coin
pardon
you did indeed norman and i'd never thought of it but there we are
s so we have a result and i won't sit down on empty
so there you are john there you are
er can i just say er before erm i announce the result i UNK to frank there in UNK the result i didn't know i couldn't pronounce his name so i has to check it
erm but greater manchester west is the first erm constituency to select and for us as a regional party er the procedures which you have adopted erm have been a model if you like and the way john and his team have conducted the election er deserve our praise and thanks
hear
and yours because he has been he has been UNK in the extreme in keeping me informed and in the way he and bob and norman i'm sorry i don't know the rest of the team i don't know the other five erm
chris
but the way in which was the way in which that group have conducted this election i is as far as we're concerned is a model
er mary i think has gone has she gone
no you
ma m we had a UNK committee last night i'm just doing this so you keep you on your toes until we get to the result you know
erm
we had er we had a UNK committee meeting last night in which we were concerned that a number of the other constituencies throughout the UNK who were not as far progressed as erm er as greater manchester west and we took it upon ourselves to erm when appointing returning officers to those constituencies to recommend to those returning officers that the people UNK manchester central merseyside east merseyside west whoever they may be contact john er for advice on how to how to run the er how to run the election
cos it really has been extremely well managed extremely well run er not by me i've just received the ballot papers
er the work has been done by john er norman bob and the team
and to th for them we're extremely er i give my regards and er the regional party is grateful for their work
erm in counting the ballot papers erm there was a clear winner er both on the postal ballot re votes received and the erm vote this evening
er and that winner was frank
i got it wrong anyway
so congratulations frank and for er from my point of view as regional vice chairman i would like to also thank john er for taking part in this process it's very important
and you clearly had an extremely good choice tonight and a real choice
hear
yes er i'd like to thank everybody for coming along and i've said to john UNK
i said that if he wins
if he wishes er a reference i'd be prepared to give him one any time
hear
i mean i think he put up a very good show and er i know it's very disappointing to lose isn't it
most of lot of us have lost a lot of times but so i thank you again
i just er say one thing er people UNK me of being a money mad er but erm i m
but i must say we're now the great chance one of the great chances that we have next june in my mind is the post office will put the let er our UNK through every letter box in eight constituencies
well i'd think they'd have to be good they er at bolton at the general election they put bolton UNK through a lot of bolton west and northeast but
never mind
and into UNK you got some of b message was taken into UNK south
with our dennis on it
well done dennis
and er but we need the money to put the UNK through all those letter box
three hundred thousand total three hundred thousand
a penny each
we've had a cu we've had a first time they've erm quote at two thousand one hundred and seventy six pounds
that's point seven three two five one or something like that
but er
they're UNK so that's that is the next target
er i'd like to thank now
they've sent we have a bank account the first thing we did was to o this is the steering committee
open a bank account
and er when i went along to certain banks they were asking as much as ninety seven pence a transaction
so that means if mrs old mrs brown down the road gives us a pound we'd get a whole thruppence
er if we put it in
so erm the task is to er is to get the money er and to be able to put one pound er it's to everybody's benefit isn't it
it's part of the high profile that will er will you know you don't have to walk
we n we will need folders and counters to put them all in piles yes the lady volunteered now take her name
er so thank you for coming and don't forget the candidates and thank john personally for being such a very good er candidate in this erm UNK er but don't leave the candidates to you must fee the people in UNK and UNK and in er UNK who get the manchester evening news er it's that they put lo there's local issues isn't there
y i mean local manchester evening news issues that they put out in they put out where we live in UNK there's a lot of people in UNK buy the manchester and er we've got to feed the candidate with all these things so that it gets into the into the your local newspaper the local free paper goes out in every area you must get the name in as from tomorrow
and he said it i heard him say as from tomorrow give them your phone number frank
you'd better have his mother's as well
cos that's where he'll up to about seven o'clock
so thank you for coming
and thank john for being such a good er candidate
and erm oh yes er tt th there's a bye election so would
yeah

or to the church
well that's what they haven't decided
i see
leave a wee note up there or something
i think when
aha
and then coming
i think i think so because if we leave it any
mhm
later than that it's er i mean to go to the UNK at quarter past eleven we wouldn't be back here before twelve o'clock
no the way we was thinking of going we were just gonna go to the church to find out how many
go to the church and then come down
were gonna go to the church and then we would come back down
that would
i thought she was leaving a note or something no
aye
did she leave a note
no
but anybody who wants to go to the UNK
aha cos i've from her
rather than to the cos the church service is long it does take er nearly an hour i believe
well UNK i mean i phoned margaret she said it takes about an hour
an hour but down there there'll
only be a quarter of an hour
mhm
i'm gonna go to the church but i'm just going straight to work
mhm
yes
yes
i don't know that we should do we all do we want to go together
and sit together or are we just go
yes that would be fine
i think it probably would
mhm
down the road or whether it was the one here and wasn't sure either
cos i phoned her this morning
you know what i mean she wasn't sure
no she to she told me on the phone
told me that it's that it's sacred heart
mhm
so i phoned her last UNK phoned me last friday afternoon before she went on holiday to tell me and i phoned i wasn't sure whether just to sort of play it low key or then i thought well i know i really should just give here a wee ring
sympathy to her and er she was alright she was grand
she said that you were been quite shocked though because
mhm
they'd been ca they'd been called so many times you know when he was low
and er she just sort of that it happened so quickly
but at the same time she said well we're pleased because you know he didn't suffer any pain or anything
just the nurse had turned him at half past five in the morning
and when they came to wake him up and get him ready for breakfast to feed him at six o'clock he was gone
ah
could have been a stroke
they thought it was perhaps just that
you know
a fairly big stroke that just
she's been an absolute brick
she has really we're full of UNK for her
she's been ma she's been a really constant the constant UNK that she had
mhm
for him really was really super
great and of course her doing it all with her usual
mhm
wit and good nature that
mhm
however
so anyway no more apologies
flowers no
oh flowers yeah i was going to say i thought we might send flowers to her maybe on thursday or friday
just let you know let it get past and then send her some
some flowers
yes joy has a joy
a friend who's a UNK
mhm
a friend who's a UNK and gives a very you know extremely good value for
twelve pounds
mhm
well i know that er UNK flowers are they're beautifully arranged too and they're you're getting
you'll probably get er a lot more flowers for your money from UNK than you would get from
no guarantee
if you want to use the guy that you normally use fair enough
how old was erm danny
was he about twenty three
twenty four
was he not older than that
i thought he was about twenty eight
i understood he was nearer thirty
i know time has stood still really
been quite a few years she's been
oh aye
well where will where will we
meet
no where will where will we go for the flowers
that's right fair enough then
now do you organize that because you've got the money UNK is
that
well if you don't mind
erm
you might have a slight problem because we use the same i'll try and get out the cash
oh of course
we usually if i want a cheque signed you see or
and it has to be may
you don't have any cash in hand or anything
well at the moment we've got five pounds cash in hand
but i'll make it up i can always square it up later on
yes
books later
yes
yes
right if UNK wouldn't mind doing that we'd be pleased
right now it's your turn UNK for the treasurer's report
right
there's seven hundred and eighty pounds seventy pence in the deposit account
seven hundred
and eighty pounds seventy p
and forty nine pence in the current account
and five pound thirty one cash in hand
which makes it seven hundred and eighty six pence
er now three hundred and forty three pounds of that is for the open day
cos we've had donations we've had t twenty five pound donation from
er and ten pound donation from
oh yes
erm have given us forty pounds worth of holiday UNK
let you know they'll come back from the letters
yes oh that's very good that's quite a good response then
who do you have donations m made payable to
good that's excellent
does anybody know if we've if we've had any more entries
no
perhaps could tell us
do we get the treasurer's thingy
no we
do we need a statement about the outing
i assume we didn't make a loss on it
well we
what do you mean well
oh dear was that the wrong question
we had a lovely outing actually
it's just cos the bus was subsidized that's
we didn't we did there was no loss
oh well in that case a jolly good time was had by all
we had a good subsidized bus
yes
i think er i think everybody enjoyed the outing
there were a few complaints about the rough was too rough and the UNK was too bad and whatnot but i quite liked the fact that it was labelled because it meant that rosemary could and could play the
they wouldn't have managed eighteen holes had it been you know a UNK course
so and we got the benefit of the UNK roundabout
it was good
you do appreciate you own course when you come back
oh
appreciate the UNK
well we played monday and would do anything to have 's UNK
well certainly the UNK were long but the UNK were about
the UNK were good oh aye i got my feet rather wet from being in the UNK
bit steep for us thirty quid a round
so we have the report from you UNK
my UNK no i haven't got my secretary's report here
and we can't er the handicap secretary's not here yet so we don't know
UNK not here so i don't know
pardon
a vice UNK one
i didn't w i didn't win anything
now that was a very good idea actually
mm
giving us a UNK prize of a golf ball
yes
yes it was
mhm very good
i think that was good we'll keep that in mind for next year
mhm
have we decided for next year
well
well i think we are round to any other business i suppose
next year's outing could come u
i wrote down in the book some of the places
there was west lothian and
but i couldn't get a phone number for that one
it's golf course and it's the golf club
the golf course is
i think yes
aye
erm i couldn't get UNK
somebody told me UNK was lovely come to the house
get at weekends
no
no
is thirty pounds thirty pounds a head
edinburgh and it's thirty pounds a day
erm i've just got a phone number to phone them
no sunday
erm what was the other one
west lothian
they're yes it's quite a late
well it's not very
it's UNK but it's not it's not as bad as
it's not UNK
as from what i gather
it's not UNK
and the problem with that is that is like a tiny UNK
it really is very small
but the problem with the ladies room is too small i asked the ladies captain what they did
considering we're going as far what about
no we just no it was just people had said these things and won't take on a sunday
but i just said put them down in the book
were coming back weren't they
west lothian west lothian we've already written to west lothian and it was too early
aha
they don't know the dates
right
mhm
until the UNK list is completed next year
keep the letter and try and contact us
mhm
again in nineteen ninety four
right
mhm
so you're gonna have to gonna start writing letters we're gonna make sure we
west UNK room is half the size of ours
not counting the toilets
mhm
i asked the captain what they did when they did when they had ladies parties
she says oh well we just sort of all move along
but you're all arriving at the one time
i mean
that's right that's right yeah
no it's not m it's not much it's not much further than
these are only names that people have mentioned and i wrote them down i write them down
it's not much further than
and the road has been improved
so you should be well with a decent bus you should get the course
well i enjoyed it
was one of the places that we
the UNK is lovely
aha the UNK is lovely
aha
and the food was very nice you said
i we i went and looked at it i looked at it looked all right and i thought
we went to the opening wondered why it was met everybody
and then we got out on the course and we realized
you knew why
people had been before and
cos i think we've written to them about three or four times
yeah
keeps being on my list
it is very difficult a sunday but it actually although we didn't take a vote on the bus the few people that i did speak to a few people and they were not terrible UNK at the idea of an outing during the week
well for one thing we have got really have quite a few school teachers now who just couldn't get off during how many school teachers do we have UNK
well i don't know i haven't look through the list
bringing it into july or are too many people on holiday in july
even the first week in july
mhm
even the first week
well where's UNK she's away for a start
mm
but she wasn't away till the third or the fourth if you could get it within the very first few days
so at the mo at the moment what
joyce is a school teacher
she knows you and her name's joyce
and know her
what are the what are the possibilities that we have then and west lothian
and west lothian both said it's too early didn't they
's kept us on file and will give us the first date available in june
er is the same
erm
but we weren't interested in were we
er is that all you mentioned
west lothian that was too early and we're to write back to
you're really as well leaving i know
we've had a lot of problems
well you used to be able to book up a over a year in advance
but it's getting now there's no way they're gonna take you
i mean i had the same problem when i was secretary
that UNK having now
mhm
you know every time you go it was too early too early right back
there was very few who were willing to take
mhm
i think it's they're booking
told to put nineteen ninety five on the UNK as well
nineteen ninety five
i like the sound of i like the distance it's away and er
i would think it would be depend on the weather
well that depends the weather depends most courses
and god knows how that UNK get to
even if it's the same bus
you've actually been here just yourself
how did you find it
well i found it difficult because i still cannae play golf well but i could play even less well then
but if you hit when you're going round this hill if you hit to the right the ball always came like too many
enjoyed it
all the rest of them that could play golf enjoyed it because
we're not going to play golf we're going to have a good time
some place where we can enjoy ourselves
but it's you get a terrific view once you've
yes i was going to say that
the views should will be quite nice from parts of that course i would think
just thinking of itself i don't know the course
you're going round clockwise one way and UNK the other
there was a lot of congestion the night we were there
a lot of
mm
hold ups
we could see people you know why that would be i don't know and i thought possibly
times when you couldn't see beyond that hole
aye i though well maybe it's a difficult hole and there's UNK or something
do you think it's worth writing to has anybody else any thoughts about
do you know golf club
mhm
mhm
cos they changed since we were there
it used to be
beautiful
the club house beautiful cos we've got
aha a wee course and a big course
you played there
we went there we went there last easter
mhm
for the weekend
have you any idea what the green fees would be there
it's going to make the cost of the outing very expensive
mhm
and did you get round it alright
we've still got
pam UNK it was thirty pounds
yeah
yeah that's well that's i think that would make our er outing very expensive
maybe too expensive for some of the members
that was one of the advantages of you know
mhm
that's right
as well as being flat it was very cheap
look at then if it's UNK
i think we are UNK we are going to have to face the fact that we are not going to get an outing
is UNK
well
for l for
is it
mhm
for less than thirty pounds
mhm
going to a private club
i thought it was quite expensive the last time we wrote there as well
well this i this i feel that er i think your weekend fees are always UNK than your week
it was not before
it's got wide open UNK
well we played at before but we
but the food we didn't like the food but you could always arrange to eat somewhere place else
i thought was a
it was really it was really a lovely too wasn't it
remember how hot it was
mhm
five minutes
well i didn't enjoy because
every element available was there
well another thing is the fees are quite expensive at weekends
are they
are they
they have gone up considerably
oh yes
now that UNK don't have the UNK and the UNK they've just got that UNK course now more and more people are playing because they realize it's next door
heading down that way is there nothing down there
i don't
what about in east UNK
have you played there
is
yeah
lovely
we played a well we went to the open last year quite a few of us and we're going again er and w it wasn't a particularly nice day but we thought if it's it was a nice day this would really be a lovely course
i've got the number but no price
what their food and everything is like i wonder what
well we could get the bus to take us a long route
no
what to east UNK
aha
mhm
and just pretend we're going far away
it doesn't matter how far you go see the see the time we went to
there was one particular hole and i looked at it and thought in a million years we will never get up there
and i thought you would need a miracle to get up there
and i thought well
there's just no i've just gotta get up
and all of a sudden
as i was climbing the hill i thought oh gosh this trolley seems to be coming up here no problem
it is a miracle
pulled her own trolley
and you know how sod in rain
and she was pulling her trolley pushing mine and there was me UNK up there thinking this UNK become
but er about
what
did you say was very UNK
it's i don't think it's UNK because you're up the hill you're already up the hill
you're right up the top of the hill
i would i would think it'll be very expensive
there is a lot of UNK
visitors welcome UNK only
yes fifteen pounds at weekends
what fifteen pence
pounds
but you can't play at weekends
no
UNK quite a problem
do you think it's worth UNK about even though it's not very far
yes
what about our open day by the way
i don't know there's anything else we need to organize
have parties on sundays
no
it just says on the book UNK only
UNK only
i know they all are though aren't they
well is out then of course
if we're talking sunday
how did you get on
how did you do
seventy five
i think your would be too high at
i don't think they'd take you in on a sunday either
i don't think you would go on a sunday at
i can't imagine we'd get sunday
it was all the names
UNK
well UNK nice
somebody had said something about that earlier
if we're talking about going to the you can go down to play the course there you'd only get one round played
we could also get very wet weather
what's the course like joan
alright
mm
just as long as not a south UNK or a gale
is quite a long course as well
there's no UNK at
yes there are i was seventeen on that
it says that in the book thing there's no UNK
now how is
do you think we should leave it till leave it till after our open day
and then
then by about september we can we might get a few more positive answers
you'll get responses
sunday
fine so we know that they take visitors
except saturdays
visitors welcome except saturdays
mhm
fees
fees are fifteen pounds
i'm positive i didn't really mean yes i was really meaning we might get some answers that aren't
nearer next year
fifteen pounds is a day it's that's at weekends
it's twelve pounds a round or fifteen pounds a day
full facilities available for eating
i think it's where's that
west lothian it's on the side of a hill but how UNK i don't know
sixty eight
well maybe we should leave this till after the open day and then we can really concentrate on it
go through the you take the book home and you come up with ideas for the next meeting
how many people have been through
you're actually better asking people
well i think there are
when you c when you're going up the hills they're long UNK you're not really aware of them
and there's a quite a lot of hills heading down
but we're not sure of facilities
mhm
and doesn't
we were discussing last year
where is it
it's in the address book
how i quite enjoyed it but it's got deep UNK
i think we should study the book further and maybe wait till after the come back to it after our open day
now we need the minutes secretary's report now that she has er arrived
well she wasn't going to come so it wasn't that exciting
right ninety four for the open day now
er from last time
i need to looking for one person someone
who
er that but never says anything positive
so i haven't bought anything
about half eleven thirty six
my mum had tried some but she's
what handicap has this person got
oh that
aye that
she's got a caravan down
i know who you mean
yes
right
er i'll ask if she can find anyone else
what time
about eleven thirty six
well that's when
right eleven thirty six
yes
right
and the only thing is that finally after three months of waiting for the received all their UNK and things for so it can go ahead
they had asked for stationery and the UNK that you know
sent me two sheets for the official UNK two sheets peoples UNK three UNK and two UNK certificates and that was the whole
also i've got to say i've had a letter back from the f l g about the letter about
ample facilities and we've got to use the facilities offered for nothing by members
mm
yes well there you are
i rather UNK the competition
i don't think they'll bother
UNK to play in it will not
people will not go
no
and maybe then they'll get the message
other than that i've got nothing to do
well the other thing about er that involves margaret is the arrangements for this wednesday
mhm
because
yes i was going to say about to try and start later in the morning if that would suit people
well that was well this is the idea because the UNK ten o'clock
i had suggested it yesterday
and it will be eleven before the service is finished so the earliest i think we should
i think quarter to twelve
i thought half past eleven tee off
i assume everybody's just going to come straight round
yeah
there
because i'd sort of said that
it's no i was going to say there are those perhaps who'd h haven't heard and those who don't know about it
if somebody if they turn up at the normal time i assume when though there's you know we could leave a not a not a notice and they could just go out
mhm
i mean that means there's no draw i suppose that those of us who've been could have a quick draw when we
well in my
i mean there's nothing to stop them doing that
who how many people are there
location fourteen miles north of UNK
UNK erm weekends fourteen pounds
eating facilities available except monday
margaret me carol UNK
now i don't know about UNK you know and UNK knows
it's a well e aye
are you playing in the morning
and so you were going as well
so it's just a matter as soon as we come back get out
yes
that's it
mhm
so we don't really need to make a set time actually if we're all there we just all come and we just
right
right so that er well that there really isn't a problem then on wednesday morning
margaret
it's not in the book
right can we go on to the open day
erm
not till i get my pen back
do you want this one then
we should really get organize
i mean UNK be around as of next week
i don't think she'll be staying off for any great length of time with the open day coming up i think she'll be
quite keen to get back so we don't want to go
i think she'll find life UNK enough
do the normal routine she does she'll maybe think
i mean the if she were going to be next week or something she'll maybe want to organize most of it herself
aha
we should put notices up soon ab asking for donations for her UNK
we could start doing that
thank you
maybe as of
open day margaret we were saying that we er we should really put the notices up asking for donations for the UNK
and do you think we start selling UNK tickets any time
is it too soon or is it
having a raffle
the UNK took in
aye
about two hundred pounds
and everybody brings stuff for it
black UNK
no they were
quite sure he hasn't heard of before
i'll tell you about it at the end
did you not realize carol there was
you're on tape you're UNK camera
i didn't know what it was there for
aye well that's recording us
to get everything in the minutes
well this is for UNK purposes
so apart from that do we need do we start do we wait till next week before we start selling raffle tickets
do you know if helen has got the for the
well there are prizes
if anybody says what are the prizes
i'll say see UNK cos she knows
never mind the prizes
and UNK
and all the lady members always either before or on the day come up with bags of stuff for the UNK
oh yes we always
and we've got the two i've got the two
great
yes
eventually
eventually
i want one i want one
they're lovely actually they're nice
we were in town on saturday and i saw two really nice sports bags but we had so many parcels i didn't hadn't the heart to suggest to bill we
aha
buy any more
but i'll go and get them soon
now got two a books this years of that similar to that
two sets of head covers
and other things
we were talking about them we were raising money to buy extra practice
were we
you don't need it then it just goes you know it can go into the
we need raffle tickets
oh we need to get raffle tickets obviously this wednesday till we get more
i suppose so
of course we can start selling raffle tickets
what else do we need
that's a shame
oh listen margaret do you know looking for the UNK in the UNK
no we'll find it
anything else we have to do for the open day
do you want a UNK sheet remember last year you had a UNK sheet
well that's right we don't actually need that
i remember sitting helping to write the cards the night before and we were writing them off a UNK sheet
is the any to compare the entries we have this year with the entries we got last year
and see who's not coming this year that did last year
it just might be somebody we know and UNK them along and say
those lists you did those UNK lists from last year
probably destroyed but they should be on disk
they should still be disk
it might be worth going through them and er anybody we think
aye cos i mean we thought
we should do this for the mixed open as well keep a note of the entries from one year to the other and you can get in touch with people and say are you playing or not
we don't have all that many places left do we
how many can we take all together
is the morning getting full
the morning's just about full
well it might be worth looking through last year's list in the day
right if UNK can manage to find that if she doesn't mind
well and do you want me to do one for this year
yes
who does the notices that go up
we ask to help
i d think we can leave that actually till just nearer
i was told that 's just verbally agreed rather than
aha
officially agreed
yeah
but it is nice if they are asked sometimes it's sometimes they are just expected to do and if they haven't been officially asked
it's nice no to be forgotten about as well
that happens that's happened in the
yeah i think
past
yes cos they've been starting
oh that would be good cos i was going to say normally is er sort of up in that corner in charge of the UNK but er
just don't
this is the some the th one of the things i was going to suggest about i was going to leave it till next meeting is that we try and organize ourselves so that we are not su last year i found myself sitting there UNK writing names on raffle tickets knowing i was going out to play in about ten minutes but there was nobody there to take over
well that's it
you know i should be back when there's somebody going away
well we could maybe leave it till the next committee meeting to organize ourselves to
so we know what sort of times we're expected to be sort of selling raffle tickets and
another thing it's quite easy to get mixed up
and it's better really if one person does it
i don't know if anne wants to do it or not
is putting the numbers on the UNK
on the prizes
well i was going to say
that's quite a lot of work for
it is
yes but on the day people are walking up there with carrier bags full of the stuff and it's got to be done and put out
maybe the week before is all the stuff coming here this time though
was taking it all home
there's nowhere to store it
i took it home last year
well we need maybe i don't know
i had everything in the house any anything that they'd brought up early beforehand
that's right
the stuff down the night before with the
yes
numbers on it
perhaps we should leave that for UNK cos maybe UNK would like to do that herself
if she if she has room at home
right yes i would agree
okay
mhm
we'll just leave that for the meantime and keep we'll remember
we can't just leave it till our next meeting cos it only is
i'll maybe speak to her about it a week a week on wednesday i assume she'll be back then
try and remember to say to her
i might have a problem my daughter's expecting on the twenty first of this month
and i intend to go down to london
mhm
right now i'd hoped but if she's late
yes
problem
well don't worry about it
i can do i can i can sort out
i'm gonna ask moira to do the cheque write the cheque
what cheque
the presentation cheque
now don't worry about it i'll help you with that anyway UNK
already had a list
i don't know whether there'll only be one or not
yes well bill and margaret
usually charlie helps down the
and sam usually
is he going to help
working
oh you're working
how dare you be working
day is it
wednesday
you're working
might be on holiday
it's just so we can send you an official love letter
you can't be on holiday
you can't go away on holiday UNK got to be here on the day
it's UNK place
i don't know when we're starting back i'm not sure
no you start on the thursday you keep wednesday off
funny that isn't it
we just get started we get do you get the raffle tickets too
UNK
is that
i get the raffle tickets
i could probably get cheap ones
as long as they can tear
they're very hard when you're in a hurry
what were you doing
about a fiver or something
so each of those big books with a thousand tickets only cost me a pound
they're over two pounds if you buy them in john UNK
mhm
it's easy to take off the outside when you come to take the inside ones it's quite difficult
sometimes the inside ones depend how carefully the ones on top
that that's right
and it it's easy when you're not busy but if you get a spell of being busy
how much are the raffle tickets going to be
the usual fifty pence a strip
making it clear to them they get they get it's not
they're not going in strips they're g they're getting five chances for their fifty pence
it's very common nowadays
i know but it's only giving you one
i think it's better if you give them fi they'll buy more tickets if they're getting
i think they'll just buy a strip anyway
that's right you don't want just to have four chances you want to have twenty chances
no i was saying if i was saying if i was going to spend that on raffle tickets it wouldn't matter if i was getting
the other thing is we sometimes get children around and they come and they just want to buy
you know two tickets
well their UNK have to give them
i think we just we should stick to er giving them five chances for their
it just means like a person could
more people have the opportunity of winning
it's perfect to we're going to get raffle tickets and hopefully get started selling them
a week on wednesday or so
yes i think
this wednesday
right okay we just we
if you start on those two books and then
oh i see
ju i thought you were talking about the UNK when you were saying fifty pence a strip sorry
something like that yes
is that the usual
so we get more raffle tickets this week
is there anything else that we right those are the most UNK urgent things get the notices up and er who does the by the way who is it
will you please do them this year UNK
no
have you time
probably
thank goodness tomorrow
for wednesday
wednesday
i'll see if i c if i've got any paper lying about the house
can anybody think of anything else
that's no problem
any other er business
i'd like to ask something i don't know if it's got anything to do with it or not but it really annoyed me yesterday
and that was the eighth green not being on
well
and what i was playing was an official competition
it was an official competition
it's because
yes well that's that was UNK yesterday was nothing whatsoever to do with the l g u or the ladies section
but tomorrow we'll be on the green
and we will be playing from the tee which is at the front left hand corner
what sh happened yesterday actually was that the big flag on the new green should have been taken out
but it wasn't
the front corner front left hand corner of that of
the new tee is our official tee and er that's where it will stay a onto the new green
it's a par three and i'm assured that it measures more than the hundred and forty yards required for us to be par three
that was a mistake
the big flag should have been taken off the new green and it wasn't
that green wasn't put on for that competition
well i would agree with you there but that's we weren't running it and we'd nothing to do with er with the organizing of yesterday's
so there should be no problem on wednesday at all on wednesday
but that is we we're going to go we'll on wednesday officially we'll be on the new green
for extra day scores then
it's still a par three
see we're that's what makes us well that's what makes us seventy two now
any other er
any other er business then ladies
i think
next meeting
the next meeting i think we'd already agreed it was going to be the first monday in august which i think is the
well now james what can we do for you
oh
not so bad
not so bad
i feel a bit sad
i'm my daughter's taken me UNK me away for a holiday
erm
mhm
a holiday down in
and
mhm
my UNK not due till the twenty sixth of july
that's alright
twenty six of july it's due doctor
well no problem
so i'll leave it with my other daughter
she can't post it
no
se send it in john
send it in
aye just send it
twenty sixth of july it's due
aye
you know that's a year off now you know
yeah
due on twenty six
twenty six of july yes
july ninety three
ah no terrible worry about that jim
no
no
sometime you know they
och aye it's not
i just send it in there'll be no problem then
no problem no
the thirteenth of the seventh ninety three
there we are
right
you just send that just send that in to
but could you give me some er can you give me some UNK doctor
some UNK
give me a bottle because i during the holidays
well you shouldn't you shouldn't need of that stuff down there
aye well that's
well i don't take you know
yeah
just a wee break
actually
she says
well it's nice it's a nice part of the world
yes it i somewhere it's nice doctor it is
but er UNK
a bit UNK
aye
too UNK for me
not for us not for us
no
no
not for you
no
it's er and it's like it's not a nice place anyway
i think UNK i've a feeling UNK far nicer
UNK far nicer
and
yes i heard that doctor
UNK used to used to be a lovely place
everything was kept absolutely perfect
aha
palm trees and the
yes
the UNK were always painted and all the houses were beautifully kept and now mm
was it
has it
aye
it's a shame
you know i was there in nineteen fifty
were you
and i mean it was absolutely gorgeous
everything the UNK you know when they put when they painted the UNK the burned the old paint off the new paint on
ah yes
now old paint just straight on top
aye
it just it looks terrible
i may go through for a day you know
aye och
it's not it's not worth it
it's not worth that
ah well
even
ah well
can go through
aye they can let them let them go
let them go
there's a good ice cream shop
oh i like ice cream
oh i like ice cream
i'm very partial to ice cream
yes i must say that
i like ice cream
well thank you very much doctor
eh well there's a good ice cream shop there
away you go then
away you go them jimmy
and i'll
aye i'll
okay
thank you then
look after yourself
right jim
bye
cheerio now
see if i can get this in focus for you
can everyone see that
okay
first of all who are we
we are the largest independent manufacturer of high speed diesel engines
and the horsepower range we work from is from seventy six to two thousand horsepower
and that is in fact from four cylinder to twenty four cylinder engines
er you'll see further on in the presentation the product we produce at which is the ten litre and the fourteen litre engine
and this actually goes down to about a hundred and eighty horsepower in some applications
and in fact we're now approaching the five hundred horsepower in the fourteen litre
this is incorporated internationally
sales in nineteen ninety one was three point four billion dollars and in fact the figures for nineteen ninety two are just published in may of this year is four point seven billion dollars
we produce annually two hundred and eight thousand engines in fact that's now approaching two hundred and fifty thousand engines
we employ twenty three thousand people worldwide
our annual research and development UNK two hundred million dollars
in the u k consists of engine company limited and there are three manufacturing sites that manufacture diesel engines
we've got which i'll go on to expand in a minute about
we've got another plant at UNK that produces a smaller series of engines
erm eighty to a hundred and forty horsepower
and a plant at UNK down in the midlands that does the big ones two thousand horsepower
a few years ago we bought a company called who manufacture all the UNK that we use
erm oil UNK air UNK etcetera
we actually bought them over about seven or eight years ago
we now own them
located at actually UNK engines which are ten or fifteen years old
there's also a market there for people who can't afford to buy new product and obviously still the UNK still got life in it
so with UNK and new UNK and new UNK etcetera you get another ten years out of the engine
so you've probably seen them if you've ever been up past
on the motorway heading for
they're on the right hand side
again located in the midlands down at UNK
are actually our UNK
who go out in the field and do field service support for our customers
were a separate independent company up till about three years ago who produced nothing but UNK
erm UNK in diesel engines really came on about ten years ago
it's fairly new
er although most people think it's been there for a long time it hasn't
UNK really only took off about ten years ago
this was a private company set up to produce UNK which again because we were one of their biggest customers we eventually became partners and then bought them over
is a n a new company to us
er i'll go on to explain in the product range one of their new products we're introducing this year
is an electronic engine
and this company u k has developed the new control systems for it
er and UNK i'm sorry i know very little about
i know they UNK components for us but i know very little about them
as far the united UNK concerned nineteen ninety one almost five hundred million pound sterling turnover
producing thirty seven thousand engines
with almost five thousand employees
and as at the end of nineteen ninety one we have almost two hundred million investment in the u k
the first plant that opened outside the main plant in UNK was at
and it opened in nineteen fifty six
er there's various reasons why it was located at
one of the main ones being which we know now as
but er were one of our customers buying engines from our mother company in the states
er the company was also at that time looking to expand anyway into europe
erm and i think margaret had quite a lot to do with it being located at as well
so for various reasons we actually found ourselves at
nineteen fifty six
the plant itself erm now worth thirty million pounds
there was a seventeen million pound extension built in nineteen started in nineteen eighty one finished nineteen eighty five
we currently employ just over six hundred people
although when i joined the company fifteen years ago we had only fifteen hundred people
er six hundred and fifty thousand square feet
almost and as i say we do fourteen litre and ten litre engines
the ten litre engine is actually a UNK engine
er it was introduced in nineteen eighty three
brand new engine introduced in nineteen eighty three and we decided at that time to go UNK
er a hundred and eighty to now we've gone up to about three seventy horsepower with UNK
and in some cases we have a double UNK
there's a photograph of the product
erm this here's the UNK arrangement
the fourteen litre engine is an old imperial engine
and when i say old that was designed and developed in nineteen thirty five in the states
the basic engine has not changed at all
er sure there have been some improvements in the materials that we use
and that's just material technology UNK
but the basic engine design has not changed
on both products what we are now going to is an electronic engine
we currently have a pressure regulated fuel injection system developed by
own UNK design
what we're now going to is electronic fuel injection
it gives a much better fuel economy
and again that's a photograph of the fourteen litre engine
our main markets
well you can see from that the main markets are actually the world
we are very heavily into south korea and china at the moment
erm about ten percent of the product goes to africa and australia
again we're getting heavily into the middle east
and that's mostly for generator sets and pumping station equipment
er the european market is mostly either on or off highway
there are only really two main markets in europe and that's either the trucks or the UNK and the UNK off highway applications
er a typical example of an application an e r f thirty eight tonne tractor unit
erm that one in actual fact has a ten litre pardon me engine in it
e r f currently produce about six trucks per day and they're all UNK
so every time you pass an e r f on the motorway or it passes you it's one of our engines from that's UNK it
er a company called in UNK who are the biggest truck manufacturer in UNK
er and it's mostly fairly heavy lorries that they produce for as you can see UNK work
erm i think that's their principal industry in UNK is the forest
again we are the sole supplier to them
these are various other applications
you'll recognize this one here
this is the local UNK class rail car er diesel rail car which runs on our local railway network
they are all UNK by throughout the u k
er something like four hundred and seventy five of these units running all UNK
these are standby generator sets
for all sorts of applications
hospitals pumping stations whatever
off highway applications in terms of UNK erm and power equipment
and we do some marine not a lot of marine erm for some strange reason our design of engine does not lend itself too well to marine applications
er we there's a lot of cast iron and steel in our engine and marine engines don't like that they prefer brass
er typical example of our technical investment nineteen ninety one we were round about a hundred and fifty million
this year the plans for nineteen ninety three ninety four are two hundred and fifty million
UNK in er in new equipment and research and engineering development
an aerial view of the plant
when we came here in nineteen fifty six this was the original building
and in fact it was an old UNK mill called the
from nineteen eighty one to eighty seven we expanded into this
erm it's a simple flow system raw material comes in at one end and flows through the plant through the UNK areas through the assembly and the new product the finished product comes out the end
the other building you see in the top left here is the UNK
that's the present
er a typical view down the assembly track or the beginning of the assembly track
you can see the engine block
very little built on to it at that stage
and the main things that we point out there are we have a nice natural flow system
we have material feeding in from each particular station at the side
operator doesn't have a lot of movement minimum movement
erm there are twelve stations in that particular piece of assembly track
the track is continuously moving and it UNK every ten point six minutes
so every ten point six minutes another engine comes off the end
er a view of part of the machine shop
just showing the general layout and what we are trying to do in terms of housekeeping and UNK
machine shops and engineering works tend to be regarded as very dirty UNK places
and i'm afraid the nineteen nineties that's not the attitude we want to adopt
er we pride ourselves on our housekeeping it's a selling factor for us and we have customers come round and look at the plant and they always commend us quite highly on our housekeeping
again another general view of a machine shop
you can just imagine this place is cutting cast iron and metal all day every day
so it looks quite good
er the finishing end of the assembly track and you can see the engine is almost in a completed state
sixteen stations on this piece of piece of track
again UNK at ten point six minutes
so again a completed engine every ten minutes
and just a wee some of the achievements we've had in the last ten years
eight occasions we've won the queen's award to industry
so we can't be doing too badly
any questions gentlemen or
yes
yo you mentioned the fact that you had increased your capacity but decreased your er employee
yes
erm in so that it's our fault really that we can't give work to our er people
is there no way you can adopt a more way to utilize the men rather than
there are
there are various ways to that
obviously it's quite an UNK subject when as you say you're reducing putting people out the door
putting people out of work
the counter argument to that is if you don't become more efficient then you will lose the business anyway
and your competitor will take over
and all your people are out the door
so it's a UNK stick
and it's difficult very difficult to strike the balance
erm what we have tried to do at there are you've probably seen or heard in the last five or six years the influence of japanese technology
and you can't UNK totally japanese technology into the western UNK but they have some good ideas
er and you have to pick the ideas that you think can apply to your application
and we've adopted two or three of these
one is what they call UNK or continuous improvement
and as you continuously improve an area the people that UNK up the additional labour go on to do additional improvement work
so you can still support those people and still get the benefit
so you're still reducing the cost of the product all the time er and you can still retain the people
now there's obviously a UNK level
where you have more people that what you have improvement work for them to do
erm how far down the road that is we don't know
but we've been honest with our people we have not paid anyone off in the fifteen years i've been at that didn't want to go
it's all been voluntary redundancy or voluntary UNK
but yes it's a very difficult situation
it's survival on the one hand against moral issues on the other hand
difficult
manufacturing cars you know and it's all these UNK they're doing all the work
could the UNK er take over er diesel engineering
is it not a possibility
well there are some other slides i could have got which we have a UNK line which manufactures the UNK right
and you can imagine the UNK in your car is about this size
four of them in your one in each cylinder goes up and down
the one in the diesel engines like this you can hardly lift it
we have a UNK line that manufactures them
and in fact we manufacture UNK for other plants in the corporation
er the cost is fourteen million pounds for that UNK unit for UNK
and it's six cells of about five or six machines in each cell
and they are fed by a UNK
traditionally we had something like eight five eighty seven people working in UNK manufacture we now have fourteen operators supported by six UNK
and the UNK are doing that
so yes we took on board UNK technology if you like to reduce costs
in terms of engine assembly no
er that will always be done by hand
there are UNK there are always applications that you cannot UNK
erm and we pride ourselves on the skill and the quality that we build into the engine and you can't do that with UNK
UNK do whatever you ask them all the time but they don't think
erm and because of the way of things you don't always get the components the same way every day
you always get one reject
so the UNK would pick that and use it
whereas the man will pick it and UNK it
so there are applications you can use them and some you can't
your continuous improvement in the factory a lot over the years
what is your relationship with the unions in the in the plant
erm initially very bad i have to say that
as i say it's a very UNK subject
but if you are honest and up front with them and tell them exactly what you're doing and why you're trying to do it eventually over time you get them and we started this in nineteen eighty five eighty six
and i would say now we are starting to see the fruits of that
and it's taken that length of time to break down the seventy or eighty year barriers that are in existence between workers and management
erm and i think there will always be for some time yet a wee bit of UNK there on both sides
erm quite a lot you just have to be honest with people and tell i mean we've got it's unfortunate we can threaten people if you like it's the wrong word to use
but you say to them you know look at erm one week they announced i can't remember the figures twenty three million investment
four months later they closed it just like that
again they closed and then UNK
so there're examples in the area where if we don't pull our socks up and actually start working then it could happen to us as well
but no it was very difficult at first
it's still difficult at times erm there is nothing forced into them it's all through mutual discussion
erm there had been one or two occasions where we have to be the management if you like and say no i'm sorry that is what we are doing
erm we've had enough discussion we now need to go that way
but those occasions are very few and far between now
where does the material come from for
for the engines themselves
the UNK
erm we produce about thirty percent in house
and that's from u k sources of raw material
like castings
we do a lot of UNK of castings
er of the other seventy percent er about twenty five percent of that will be from bought in finished material from companies in the u k
pardon me one or two in scotland but not too many unfortunately
the remaining forty five fifty percent is actually bought in from america
remember we have got seven manufacturing site in the states that manufacture the same product for the american market
they therefore have bigger buying power than one company in scotland
so they can buy as seven companies at a much cheaper rate and ship it across to us and the sea freight is still doesn't add to the cost that much
er so unfortunately fifty percent of material comes in from the states
how many of your what percentage of your staff on the shop floor are UNK
erm very few
we have most of our maintenance staff are time served fitters or UNK
in the actual machine shop and the assembly operators themselves
they are i would say ninety percent semi skilled
we have trained them in er in fact in the operations they're doing
you have to remember that was on old coal mining area
and again i think one of the main reasons round about nineteen fifty six that went there was the pits were closing and there was obviously erm government attractions to pull companies in
much more then than there is now
so we have a lot of ex miners
erm but i would say it's mostly maintenance trades
we have gone slightly the other way with obviously UNK and the electronic age and this sort of thing
a lot of our machine tools are c n c so we need to employ the skills there
erm but these are mostly UNK people
i would say in the majority it's semi skilled
and a supplementary question going on from that
do you employ apprentices
yes we do
erm unfortunately not so many
we've taken apprentices every year since i've been there
erm when i started fifteen years ago it was an intake of about twenty five er lads at a time we're now down to about unfortunately eight or nine craft apprentices
and i think about three technical apprentices
we have erm one female apprentice who's time was just out there last year
she's a maintenance UNK and she actually won the scottish whatever it is apprentice award
so we're quite proud of her and she gets on great with the guys
and she's the only female on the floor
we have girls in the offices and women in the offices obviously but she's the only UNK if you like on the floor
but yeah we're still taking them on but not in so many numbers
UNK erm do you have er company UNK
you've got seven or more plants in the states elsewhere er you know on criteria such as erm quality and productivity cost and so on
if so how do make out in the company league table
right
we have we started again nineteen eighty nine we decided taking on board some of the japanese ideas which we felt we could use
and UNK the rest which we felt did not UNK
we erm developed what we call c p s
which is the commons production system
to functional excellence
and there are ten measures within that production system
erm and these measures are criteria for every plant worldwide
now we have plants in india brazil erm we now have one in china we were about to open one in russia but it burned down
part of the deal i don't know if you UNK about it in the paper
six hundred and thirty million we lost
erm and it's the same criteria worldwide
we have corporate headquarters obviously dictate policy
and you have to adjust that policy at local level
because some of the ideas and UNK in america for example don't hold good up in
and vice versa
but the basic top level objective policy is set plan you know worldwide for each plant
and against that these ten measures are measured
erm in fact housekeeping in one of them would you believe
housekeeping is one of the measures
erm out of the ten i would say we have got about seven above target and three below target
and the ones that are below target funnily enough are productivity which is still measured and i don't agree with that
UNK an old fashioned measure
what you could actually measure is delivery to your customer
but we still measure productivity
erm and we are slightly below target on that
we are above target in quality
we are above target in housekeeping
so in a sort of worldwide league table if you like we're well above average
and you're right because these are the things that when your vice president and you president come every year as they do on their annual visit and they go to UNK for their game of golf first
erm they are in the plant i don't know maybe four hours or six hours
two or three of those hours are spent reviewing the financial results
obviously we still need to make money
that's why we're in business
the other two or three hours are on the floor
and it's that three hours that's the impression that they take away with them
that's the only chance you get in that one whole year to impress these people
so when they're sitting in their corporate offices making decisions about well where will we send the work
well last time i was at it was dirty
guys were hanging about standing all over the place not their UNK
that's the impression they have of
and this is the m the message you have to get across to the people
and we are we are getting there
we're getting there
and one of the things we did this year for example
which i find very difficult is we actually went no smoking on the first of january
erm and that was after we put out a referendum around the plant and we got a seventy eight response saying no smoking
so there's a mass UNK to the car park now at lunchtime
anything else
in the you mentioned smoking
what about the standards of UNK and that
i'm not sure i understand your question
er are the toilets kept up to a high standard
well i'll let my son answer that he's actually been in the plant a couple of times and what's your impression of the place
er they're alright
yes it's fine
i mean it's in actual fact the number of people i've had in and one thing i should say if you feel you would like a visit one evening to the plant then i'm more than welcome to try and organize something for you
but the number of people that i've had in erm both customers and visitors like yourselves that have been so impressed by the standards of housekeeping and UNK and UNK for an engineering facility
erm it really is quite outstanding
and we are not the best
there are people better
what about future development
everything seems to be on a big scale there's no question about UNK down
well in fact what happened erm last year is we reduced the size of our machine shop
we lost twenty three thousand square feet last year
and this was mostly because of old machine tools being UNK away
erm for example we have a flexible UNK system of six machines that replaced forty two
so that obviously reduces your floor space
and what we are trying to do is attract other business into that floor space
erm we started a contract a year and a half ago with m o d to produce a power pack for a fighting vehicle
called the a s ninety fighting vehicle built by ship building down at UNK
we're doing a hundred and seventy nine of these for the british army
a big contract worth a lot of money
erm there's a repair programme for south african railways to repair erm all their UNK big things
er again we're hoping to attract that in maybe next year
so no we don't want to scale down
we want to increase we want er we want to be at for as long as we can
provide employment for as long as we can
for as many as we can
what about UNK down the engine size
what about getting into the car market
no
no it's we're not we're not in there's there are people who are more established at that bill better at it and longer at it than we are
we are high speed diesel manufacturers in the big range
in the range that you saw
erm we there's a company called
erm american company who have a big holding in germany who produce combine UNK and this type of stuff agricultural equipment
we got into a partnership with them to develop a small engine a couple of years ago for their application
it was down round about the forty two forty five horsepower mark
but no we just we couldn't get the cost right
we just couldn't compete at that you need to produce thousands and thousands of these things to get the economies of scale
and er we just couldn't do it
and we d actually from that
okay well
what can i do for you this morning
ah it's the UNK it's i ran out two weeks ago so we've been on holiday i had to get those prescription
oh
i made an appointment to se you sort of this week but that's
now it was working well
yeah
is it still working well
yeah it's about the same really
right okay
but you had a bit of UNK up a you UNK up in last time you had came off it didn't you
temporarily
that's right yeah so i thought i'd best get it
yes
rather than run out
yes no you don't want to er UNK up right so
are you growing
no i've stopped growing now
you've stopped growing
y
i've had this all week
oh i
it's alright
do you play UNK
is there a family history of being very tall
no not really my UNK about six foot three
that's quite tall yes
well he's six foot six foot one or six foot t
well you're UNK than him i should think aren't you
yeah
yeah oh yeah
are you well in yourself
yeah fine yeah
but there's no there's no family history of other medical problems at all
no not really
just there are one or two i mean when we see tall thin young people we think of all sorts of interesting medical things but most of them are completely at all you see so
yeah
we always ask
no fine
right okay
i've had a bit of problem with me knee left knee
have you
don't know if it's UNK or not
i just
play football on sundays and i fence as well thursday night
fence
yes i good UNK long
yeah
reach
that's right yeah
football er i thought you might be big for football
UNK definitely
it's there
let's have a
it's just there it after like when i'm resting it UNK
yeah
a bit
right
what about stairs and steps
when you go up and down stairs and
i noticed a bit more lately yeah
yeah
but not so much
UNK
if you've got a
no not really
no you're okay UNK okay just t just turn
it's just sort of there
slightly
er no your whole body
right
get y get your knee in okay
now i'll just UNK it backward and let it go
there's full range of movement
and a stable joint
it doesn't particularly UNK around does it
no
okay
it's just that it's UNK i was wondering if the
just er lift up let it go completely l loose and UNK that's fine
if i move the UNK around it from side to side
no
if i push the UNK up
no
okay
down
no that's alright
you're okay there
okay
just let it UNK again
does it er hurt under there
no not really no
and at the sides of the joint there
no
it was just the front moving that was
okay
i think if you have mainly pain in there it's much more likely to be a little bit of inflammation under the this UNK which goes from the muscle here over the top of the UNK and UNK in there
right
and it's this muscle that makes the whole leg go like that
and it's a huge great big muscle but it can get a little bit er UNK as it passes over the front edge of the UNK there
and that's what gives you the pain right at the front
it's not
ah
UNK it's not actually the knee joint itself it's got nothing to do with the UNK and it's particularly common in people who are growing
or tall
or have grown
well no not particularly tall but certainly growing and it's probably been it's probably just er related to that
right
and you don't need to do anything
keep yourself generally fit
so we'd better make a note of that
UNK left knee perhaps nothing to see
ah and then and you're not getting any side effects from UNK
no
no side effects fine as far as i can tell
okay
now you're now er nineteen aren't you
i'm going to a university
i was going to ask what you're doing
in september
erm
what three times a day aren't you
yeah
yeah
it's dundee and they've asked me to transfer my medical records up to the local g p up there
actually what we'll do is we'll give you er you're probably a bit bigger than you were when we were giving you three er on three times a day
we'll give you twice a day but a slightly bigger dose so that's actually five hundred UNK twice a day
give you a hundred and eighty which is three months worth of those
yes when you go up there you'll have to register but if you i mean i presume the university UNK what ten weeks
yes ten or twelve weeks cos i starting
yeah
in it starts september the twentieth
yeah
so it is a bit earlier
but
so you're going to be there more than you're going to be here
yeah
and er you obviously will need to register there
now there's two important things first thing is your notes will take a long time to get up there maybe up to three months
right
i think some one has to walk from nottingham to dundee
no it's just that they take ages and ages and ages cos dundee will ask nottingham will ask us to bring the notes back then we'll send them to nottingham will send them to dundee will send them to your g p
right okay
UNK isn't it
UNK but that's the way it goes and we can't actually release the notes to anyone but the local people in nottingham
so we can't send them up to your doctor
there's absolutely nothing to tell your doctor fortunately so we don't have to do a summary for you or anything like that
but
right
the important is that he knows what you're on and why you're on it and you can tell him that
but i've got enough you'll write will
erm
you write a prescription
one twice a day i would keep going with three month UNK anyway so that'll keep you going till the end of november no not quite the end of november but you can then see him and say look i've got this is why i'm on these for
yeah right
and er he can introduce that
you'll probably find when you register you're invited to go along for a new patient medical anyway and all sorts of things like that
right
all fun and game just one twice a day
best taken on an empty stomach so half an hour before food
don't interfere with UNK they don't interfere with UNK they don't interfere with alcohol
that's alright then
okay
just to UNK those three points i know i can remember being a student myself
er the other thing of course when you're down here we can carry on treating you with what's called a temporary resident
yes it's like the holidays UNK
yeah no problems seeing you while you're down here as a temporary resident delighted to do so
okay
thanks very much
very good what are you doing up there
it's retail and distribution management
aha
a degree so
aha
but it's a year out as well
so it's four years
four years okay
have a nice holiday
see you bye now
bye
come in come in come in
there you are now young man
hope you cos i can't hear with that ear now
it's
er the
there we are
pardon
this one's still bad
well let's get you away
quite nice
now we're slap this round about
that's fine
er that's just no just slightly round there
that's it just like that
beauty
mm
no wonder i couldn't hear
no wonder you couldn't hear
yeah that looks okay now
right that'll be alright bill
just get a wee look in just check the inside
magic
magic clean as a whistle
bill there there'll be a tiny wee spot of water down at the bottom here bill that'll maybe take today just to dissolve away
mm
that's
and now just you remember what you used to do when you come out the baths
aye yes
do that
swimming yeah
aye
i can hear now
there we are
give yourself a dry off with this
right you are thank you
okay
right you are
and j have you any of the drops left bill
yes
well keep them in the house and maybe once in a while sort of once every two months just put a couple of drops in maybe saturday night or sunday night
you know just to keep it loose keep it from getting UNK up again
right you are
right
thank you
now what shall i do with you this morning
she had her blood test a few weeks ago
ooh that's right yes cos we got we
UNK wasn't working and we're going to do some UNK and provided the blood tests were okay
i remember
make sure we're all behaving ourselves and there's no evidence of UNK infection UNK inflammation anything else
and you've got perfect liver function tests which is what we thought you'd have all so the thing to do is to now get you on UNK yeah
yeah
okay
mhm
for your UNK nails
now you're f fourteen give or take a week or two aren't you
mm
mhm
so what we need to do is to check the dose
two one six
this is getting to be quite widely used nowadays especially from the skin specialists
and we're getting er more now then we need to work out what the dose is that's the wrong one
that's the cream don't want to look at that
one a day for two to six weeks in the feet two to four weeks in the body
three months in UNK nail UNK now which bit is it
i can't it's the nails isn't it
it's nails
mm
nails so six weeks to three months in UNK nail UNK
so probably the sensible thing to do is to give you six weeks worth er one a day si twenty eight y g give you eight weeks worth and then see how you are at the end of two months continuous treatment
okay
see what happens
now one of the problems of course is nails grow very slowly and you can't clear the nail until the nail has actually grown out fully
ah so we will see at the end of three months treatment they'll s they won't look enormously different
but then they should carry on getting better on their own
ooh good
so if i give you fifty six and then we'll see
now obviously if you get problems on them tummy UNK headaches muscle UNK anything odd let us know straight away cos this still a relatively new drug and we've got to report all problems on relatively new drugs
relatively new drugs are st are new as far as that were concern for up to three years which is a real UNK
we send yellow cards on all sorts of UNK bin a UNK it's on a day i'll give you fifty six
so we'll se how you are
if it looks like there's been very little response then we'll probably keep you going for yet another month after that
mm
er provided everything's okay
but we don't need to do any blood tests if you're fine you'll be delighted to hear having checked in the first place
any questions
no
no
okay
you're not on any pills and tablets are you
good
well she's supposed to take UNK but she doesn't take them
taking
UNK
she has this UNK to UNK milk and what have you
she's supposed to take that when she's
ooh what's UNK
UNK that she had for years
mm
but she doesn't take them any but
it's probably an o one of these old fashioned trade names
oh
so let's have a look
she's supposed to take them half an hour before she has any to eat
oh there's a lot of funny trade names that oh it's here no yes it is UNK two oh eight
let's have a look what UNK really is
what by mouth
ooh
for the last ten years you shouldn't have been taking it
no it's UNK with it what it what's it now we know we know all about that cos we a lot of it in UNK and problems with UNK and things like that but er i wasn't aware that it was actually used by mouth for this
well yeah
but if you're not taking it and you're okay you probably don't need it
but i'd say
i mean if you are taking it won't interfere with it
that's the important
that's alright yeah
thing
oh well i've learned something there
er you were going to make some enquiries about erm oh er t b er b c g
yes i have spoken to mrs who is the er the woman involved and what she has said is this the we can't directly we can't directly get hold of it they won't send it out into the community
but if we
mm
if i if i let her know who're the people i who are the people involved who had it
and what school they are at they will do everything to everything required through the school health service
the lot
well that's fine for elizabeth but UNK sort of half left school if she hasn't she's waiting for her g c s es and she's not sure whether she's got to go back or what she's doing
ah
right well in that case i'll get that to mrs then in that on her
well i can let you know more at the end of week actually what she's doing
okay well that'd that'll be better
i mean cos we moved
that'll be better
half way through do we haven't got a clue what the poor girl's doing at the moment
oh right so let me know at the end of the week
so it's elizabeth and cath is catherine with a k or a c
c
catherine with a k
they're both at all UNK at present but whether she goes back or not is
all UNK in catholic
yeah
all UNK r c comprehensive
i keep hearing good reports about that
it's a very good school
school
mm
er so if you let me know about catherine
er now unfortunately i'm away next week so if the message doesn't get to me before i've gone it'll be the week after that i then get back to mrs
mm
in fact it's going to be done through a school anyway it's not desperately relevant
no cos it wer no it's just the fact she wants to go to a UNK nurse you see i wanted t them don't want her be in contact with too many animals in case they have s don't wanna get
UNK yes i mean t b in animals is actually very rare cos of course all the cow
the cows are tested anyway
mm
and the cow testing programme in i think is still very thorough
er human testing and UNK is still going gone in this are and i hope it won't ever stop
they've got no intention of stopping it at
mm
the health authority
and i sit on the UNK su UNK anyway so they better not dare
they won't they won't dare
but i'll make enquiries and if it looks like she has gone out i will have to get in and we i'm sure we can twist an arm
i'm in the right place to twist an arm
that's the important thing
but we can certainly get er you done elizabeth at school
but if you get
back to me about catherine and we'll sort things out
yes okay we'll
is that okay
yes
and i will put b c g
and that'll remind me
slip through the net so far but they've got to be done
yes you'll get
done don't worry
you'll
right
get done
no escape
right thanks very much
okay
i i'm still having trouble with this leg
it UNK and er at nighttime i can't i can't rest with it
right
do you find it's just at night or is it in the day too
er w more at night you know
right
does it make you want is it the sort of UNK that makes you want to UNK it around
yeah
i'm kicking it all the while
yeah
if i lie on UNK i've always got this leg hanging because i
right
can't stand it up
and it's same er when i get in bed
yeah
i always get in bed on me left me right
and then i like to turn over to me right
yeah
but i found out that me UNK been UNK me since i come up before me back
mm
been playing up a bit
so i had to get out of bed and turn over
but i still i can't lie on it i still have to go back cos of that leg you see
okay
now we tried a bit of w a we actually gave you a worth of something last time
yeah
did that help
mm
well not really it
right
er you know
i mean i don't i try to not to take a lot of notice of it you
good
know
okay can you just slip your shoe and UNK off
yeah
and i can have another look check your circulation
i'm always cold
an but me feet are warm now
but i'm always cold
when did we last check your UNK
er was it was it ma er
have we done one this year
i
i had it i've had it may
i had i had three checks UNK
good
me er water and er was it me general
yeah
i'll just check that
yeah
they all came through right i think
oh that's okay then
i mean me hands is ever
yeah
so cold
yeah
that may be
my hands are stone cold
that may just be cos you've got good circulation in fact down here
even if you feel cold it's not bad not at all
okay
can you UNK your b UNK backwards and forwards that's okay
UNK sit UNK much now
no not at the moment no
no okay
i think when i'm knocking
and you haven't really got veins
have UNK veins okay
no
okay and your knee e
yeah all me knees UNK sometimes
i'm told i'd got arthritis in there but that's years ago
okay
well i'm sure this er i think it's certainly nothing serious it
oh that's what you see i'm alright but i thought oh i better come up because i've got to come up
yes
next month about that cream that i use
yeah
it's called this is called UNK leg syndrome
oh is it
i was
yeah
and it's a UNK
it
and it
really is a UNK
yeah
because although it's not serious there really is no brilliant treatment for it
and it comes and goes
yeah well
and it really does make you want oh it
yeah
nasty thing
but i thought well while i i'll ma kill two birds with one stone and i'll er come
yeah
up and see him
and you told me to come september for about the cream
that's right yeah
but i though it's
there
it's nearly here now isn't it
that's r
so i thought if i er but i was beginning to get a bit worried so i thought well i might as well go up because i shall start to worry and things get out of proportion with me you see
yeah
so
who's the artist is its are the children
that's my daughter mainly
mainly UNK
yeah
not all of the two have been done by
mm
mostly UNK
right now
you're on various bits and UNK and you're also on the cream
yeah
if we're going to try anything else for this UNK leg
mm
it may be worth trying UNK which is widely used for night UNK
mm
and sometimes that does help
mm
we don't why it works but it certainly does
and it's worth a go
a
mm
trial of UNK and that may well help
just a what is it
yeah it's one a night
one a night
yeah
well i take me UNK you know at night
that's fine they don't interfere with each other
oh
at all
want to
no
as i should do
now you wouldn't do that but it may that may be worth a go
okay
mm
yeah
now what about the cream how are things going on with that cos you've been
well
on it for a little while now
er a year
yeah
i's a year since well i was a lot better since
yes
twice a week
yes
yeah no discharge bleeding anything like that
no
only i came up before you know when
yeah
er about with me husband you know
aha
and it was just but i don't er i don't seem as though er it was er sometimes i saw i saw a spot of blood but it
yeah
not like the deep red blood you know what i mean
that's right yeah
and i came er i came up before can't you remember
yeah
i come up and
that's right
er that's the only time
i don't have
right
any bleeding in between
good
nothing
good
you know
god
but the first time i did use it i thought me inside were on fire
oh yes it often UNK in the same way when you first start to drink spirits you feel
oh dear
yeah
i whatever am i going
yeah
to do and i rung my daughter next morning
but it goes as you notice it goes off
it went and it sent to UNK
that's right
yeah
my inside and
it does
it really UNK it
yeah it makes a big difference yeah
yes
yeah
right well i'm glad you're okay on that
now you've had er a UNK ooh a long time ago that's right
fif fifteen i were fifty one
it's
yeah
fifteen years and i had a UNK
yeah
repair when i were forty five
and
yeah
i'm sixty six so that's twenty one years and fifteen
yeah
isn't it
yeah
that's right yeah
erm
b so you can continue on that UNK
yeah
so what we'll say trial of UNK yeah
give it a go
yeah
it's not UNK or anything like that is it
oh no
it's not i
cos i'm frightened of
it's not a UNK or UNK
no it's just
UNK
no well
no
i didn't what did they use to take that for
UNK
UNK
yeah
among other things
yeah
having a s
but not at this dose this is a low dose
yeah
a low dose of UNK
but it's worth a go
i mean once i know what a thing is
yeah
that's half my battle
because i stop
good yeah
worrying
UNK legs it's called
ooh
UNK legs and it sums it up because they do get UNK
it's got a posh name i can't remember what it's called now but it has got a posh name too
i know they all have but i mean i'd rather have the ordinary names and then
yeah
well so would i cos i remember them i can't
and then i know
i can't remember the posh names usually
the same with flowers and all them plants and that
i'd much rather have a plain name i know what they're talking about then
yeah
and because i'm not very
yeah we're plain folk aren't we
yeah
i'm not very high up on
no
all these posh words
no
so one a night
won't interfere with anything else and if that's helping so much the better
oh can i have some cream please
i'm all but out of it
ooh squeeze that in at the bottom there
yeah can you manage
yeah
it's right UNK
okay use twice a week
i haven't put that on because i haven't got room
yeah well i know i know what to do with that
okay
thank you very much
we'll give that a go
yes okay
and then we'll see how things go
yeah okay then
okay
mr in there actually last time he was in a while
oh right whatever you say whatever you say
just that UNK
hello well mr well what can we do for you today young lad
i need a few more tablets of the yellow ones the
oh right
and erm some for my work you know i have that UNK in my lap it's breaking out again
is it breaking again
it's er it never was away i'm it's a good indicator as to when how much pressure i can take
mhm
er was it UNK you were taking wasn't it
no you gave me something
the other one
or something
yes that's right
but you can only use it up for a month and then you
yes oh aye just use it for the month charlie and then and then in the bucket don't keep using it after that
aha
it's not safe
cos you just told me to use a wee bit of it
yes oh aye you just need a wee drop of it you don't need a lot
put it on every day is that right for you
are your other tablets
oh they're okay erm just one thing erm i went to the dentist up over there in street and he made a mess of filling two teeth
mhm
and i reckon he broke them but he says he's no broken but i felt the tooth in two side of my mouth so i just stopped the treatment there and i'm going to another dentist some time but my wife i don't want to go there now cos money's tight i was on the d h s i was due to pay the first forty nine pound
mhm
i paid forty pound ninety five right
and i finished my treatment with him
if i go to another dentist do you think it's worth my while writing to d h s saying i've paid forty five forty pound ninety five pence at that dentist and can i transfer the treatment to this other dentist
mhm
and only pay him further eight pound or whatever
whatever yeah
do you think that might be worth my while doing that
yes i think so
because erm
it's a lot of money
aha
so i
when i went first he took one out there and he took it out clean but this one here in actual fact he gave me a stitch and when the stitch wasn't in you could see the tooth UNK a bit
oh right
and erm but when he took the stitch it's covered it up
right
and my teeth are in bad all my teeth are badly in need of repair
but
don't rush at it
i just wish it was all over like now i had to last out until the thirty first of march which i did do
mhm
you did
but then again when i was a small boy the university UNK that were interested in me told my father i'd do what i would have to do in my mid forties
i'm forty nearly forty five in january
mhm
my father had a and he said it would be forty seven say it would likely be forty seven but that's forty seven is two year eight month away which is a long time for me to keep it going
also
no
also some of the things that i've been going on with doing this one with three and i don't know if it they'll stay in the can long enough for that
you know what i mean so what but again some come through with it
my father had another everything was okay if you came out at any time after the thirty first of march look all i'm doing now is i was giving back er taking my position as the company director getting a salary off the rent in my farms and small UNK and my shares in shipping
but now i'm just deciding i'll live off invalidity benefit for a wee while longer leaving that in the hands of my managing director and somebody else and the money that's coming through from the queen and whatever i'm just gonna live on invalidity benefit i'm only drawing invalidity benefit i'm not gonna get any more money than invalidity benefit
okay
let this accrue up or whatever
you know dr when i was a young man this UNK had his had his daughter and son UNK and held in a barn on his farm and they wanted twenty million pound UNK for them
so i was close by and so they sent me in so the way i got dressed up in the minister's UNK and i got in revised the books of genesis like through and i get UNK up to be a minister and i took in a bible and er well anyway i killed five men and they got out alive
but when i was seeing him he offered to write me a check for five million pound i said i couldn't take a check for five million pound because i was a to me
if ever you're needing a million or anything like that write to me and i'll give you it
so with this going on we found our company would get on better if i had UNK so i wrote to this boy and asked him for a million and put it in a trust fund that i would get after his death and we that way so okay
right
so i came back er with a trust fund so what i'd done golf course were having troubles right golf course
and one was going to but it off them for two hundred and fifty thousand so my mate said you make the offer at two hundred and fifty and you'll help me so i says i'm getting it for two hundred if i say an eighteen hole golf course and i'll sell it back to them when they can afford to buy it back off me right
mhm
we're using that trust fund as UNK for a loan of two hundred thousand to buy the golf course and the golf course to make it profit profitable and so the bank are now in the process of now selling it back to them what they're offering
excuse me a wee second charlie
hello
so right okay
one firm offered them forty five four hundred and fifty thousand pounds i said i wanted three hundred thousand cos i done a lot of repair a lot of UNK and i made the bar open and i made my money through selling drink and getting in entertainment
the best place to go like to go for a wee dance the only place you could go for a wee da that's the
we started making a profit
mhm
but erm i UNK what erm i also the hotel we bought that the same way they were selling that back and making quite a fair bit of profit investing the money in UNK land
mhm
cos UNK land pays for itself it's all taken care of
so all i'm saying is i just want i want to finish but again you're in danger cos i just carry on you see that's down there
somebody broke into my house i reckon i recognize person
maybe i mentioned about the UNK coming out on this side of my mouth and at the back so i ca they took it out in my living room and UNK me to forget UNK walking about in my sleep with it to sleep got me in the chair and done it got out of the house UNK me to go to that dentist in which i did do instead of going to mr at
he broke two of my teeth UNK them but he says they're out clean when i told him to take another x ray of it
he only took the one but he didn't take two
so but he thinks i've got away with it but the UNK in my mouth right now
aye
and they can look at this anytime
i must get my other teeth attended to and the cream can deal with
i remember i knocked out a man's teeth in front of witnesses just by using my mi my UNK like that hitting their tooth with a UNK pass and brought the tooth out UNK
one of these away at the back used to what it would be like to have teeth
but i'm the rest of the cream
mhm
i'm under orders
don't do anything
i mean i've even though about if i if i tell you this and you think that's it's going to put you just even if you pass it on to somebody what i'm telling you pass it on but just and i'll try and get the dental treatment where i can get the dental treatment
say no more

and then the last few times it's me son's been UNK me to go into his caravan you know what i mean
oh
and i don't want to go
i'm not one for holidays

i like being in i it's s it's your nature if
that's right
your if your UNK for UNK about
i think that's
okey UNK but if it isn't i mean i like me home
i'm a home bird
that's right
that's
er
right i must admit i'm inclined the same way
yeah
now then
me h me husband's gone he he's gone with UNK with eldest UNK he has
are you happy on your own
i yeah
yeah
a as i say er i it takes a bit of getting used to when you're just making a meal for yourself you know what i mean you're that used to carry 'em about and picking after 'em and
holiday
a holiday at home
i'm holiday at home yeah
i've lit this i've got me dog so i'll be alright
she
now then
she won't let anybody touch me
what do you want to do about these
because
well what you s
do you find they work
well do you think they're alright i mean er
are they h are they helping you when you take them
well the er they they're helping me
yeah
but they're UNK to make me feel a bit i suppose that's what they're for a bit UNK like you know what i mean
yeah well what we c
but er
yeah
i you know i cope with them alright i as you can see doctor how many prescribed
i mean it was october when i come and see you last time
november actually
oh well that's
when i had prescription and er
i think i think we've got er three choices
as i say er i only take them when i've got to take 'em you understand what i mean but i shall sit there and
yeah
UNK just come into me
yeah
mind you know what i mean and i get
yeah
a bit UNK wondering if
yeah
i can think it out
yeah
i know it's daft
might think about a commercial what's happened years ago
yeah
it just seems as though it UNK in my mind i don't know it i think i've always had a had a UNK mind actually you know i've always worked
well
and
we could put you on something on a regular basis to help to damp them down
mm
but you weren't very keen on that la
no as i say doctor i don't same as i was on the valium you know
yeah
what i mean i don't know whether that's a UNK doctor from er being on them i don't know
i think they call them flash backs don't they or something
yes that's right
but as i say i cope alright with them and as i say doctor i always seem as though i wake up with one do you
yeah
understand what i mean so
well
it must be in my dreams or
or what we could do if you say these this dose makes you a bit UNK we could give you the same stuff but in a lower dose
mm
and see if that will help without actually making you
you feel too UNK
feel UNK as you say
is that okay shall we try a lower dose
yes please
now if you find the lower dose isn't working then we can always go back to
well
this dose
describe them again doctor i cope with them i only just take 'em when i've got to do
what this dose again
yes please
y you don't want to try the
no i don't want as
i say i don't take them for sake i mean as you see how many you prescribed for me can't you
okay
but er
well i shall give you thirty
yeah
er and that'll last you about a year
yeah
and that's fine
and this is really the ideal way to use this drug
mm
it's a very good drug when used properly and that's exactly what you're doing
and
yeah
and half the time
as i say i don't want anything on a on a UNK regular
yeah
basis doctor
not same as the valium was
yeah
because you get too independent of 'em you know what
that's right
i mean
yeah
i'm independent not independent
yeah
i getting me words up
just when you need it
and we only give you thirty anyway
yeah
as i same i'm you know to be a bother like but i thought well i'd be best to come up and see you i could have just have asked for an another prescription
well no i think it's sensible
yeah
to see you from time to time
yeah
just to see how you're getting along
yeah
and make sure there's no other
but
problems that have
me heart's alright isn't it
i mean you know me heart

me heart's going nine to
dozen as me UNK say bless her but er

exactly
and i didn't have any bother with this the other night
maybe it's me who's
oh the total amount you have spent in the last year
they must mean on stamps
right
how much of the total amount that you have spent was spent at the main counter

no
now i'd like to discuss stamps more generally
the royal mail produces about nine british special stamp issues a year
do you think that this is too many special issues too few
yes
or about the right number
too many
and why do you think there are too many
er
what are your reasons for saying there are too many
probably because the value of the stamps will not hold as you know time goes on
a lot of the special issues
UNK stamps
yeah
you've obviously been told
that before hen they've got at you
erm thinking now of all the different british UNK and stamp related products that are currently on offer how would you normally get to hear about them
er how would i get to hear about them
mhm
i tend to get to hear about them from seeing the post office
right
mm post office

that's fine
okay
