he UNK records
well i don't actively collect them i just have them around
he must have a c a collection of thousands of records
mm
to me it's a very boring hobby because you can't listen to them what can you do with them
thousands and thousands of records
stamps
i mean w with stamps at least you can look at them and you know go over them
and aye but
i'm now going to read out a number of interests
for each one i'd like you to tell me how interested you are in it by choosing an answer from card twenty four

fairly interested
and gardening
you need the truth don't know
och yes
not very
not very
okay
not when you you've got it's different when you have the time though
it's a UNK different thing altogether when you've got time to do that really
then you can do it when you like
mm
when you're working and you're busy and you've got to do it i mean like this last week because of playing golf mainly and putting UNK down the grass is this high and
mhm
just haven't the time to do it
and when i have
the time it's been wet
you must have noticed our grass at the front on your way in then
i didn't notice no i didn't
no honestly i didn't
it's a nice green colour
yes well there you go
a nice green colour just about four inches long
more in places
aye well mine must be
er have you passed on your interest in stamps to children or grandchildren
no
oh
oh
or encouraged
no
any other children to start a stamp collection
not children
there's a medical condition that i have i can't see dust either
oh what a relief there's somebody like me
er
partial UNK
you haven't passed it on to any children at all
not to children but to several adults
but it's no children
no children no
er
in which ways do you think royal mail could encourage more children to get involved in stamp collecting
no UNK please
do you like milk
no thanks jean just as it comes
you can speak you know
yes you can join in the conversation
course you can
yeah
they won't they won't hear
they will hear
they won't
are you suggesting that jean has nothing interesting to say
no i'm the tape recorder the tape recorder won't hear a thing she says
oh right
even if she does shout at me
the tape recorder might discover new words
oh i very much doubt that jean
okay how do you think the royal mail could encourage mor children to get involved
thank you jean
he UNK think of any way that doesn't involve
i honestly can't think of er any way that they could do that
right
it's a thing
or not
usually they get a teacher at school that's what gets them started
yeah
if you could please now think of all the products available to stamp collectors
which of these items do you think have been produced by royal mail mainly for collectors rather than for the public at large
one
the
mm
four five
presentation packs first day covers
yearly prestige stamp books
year book
yeah
all the issues
can you think of any other products or services connected with stamp collecting which you feel should be introduced by royal mail
margaret did a good piece of work today
what did she do
went to the UNK bank took two UNK
did they phone to say
two lots of and
yes
two
they've they left a message
aha and two
mm
so that was very good
yes the had all
no
these things there
that's alright
somebody to pick them up
i'd now like your help more directly
can you fill in this page yourself
it's nothing fancy you just put a wee circle around the answer you want to give to each statement
oh good
yes
well you can
i've got a wee boy at the scouts and he should be in about half past eight
as long as i'm not i said are you sure it's not going to be too late cos i'll be forty five minutes
he said no that's quite alright
so
oh good that's good
how many have you still to get
i've still got UNK well er that will be two boys a lady UNK cos you have to find people who give stamps as well as
oh yes
now that's quite difficult i would think
and a male collector
so that's me got four and i've got another five to do and i had a telephone call from field controller in edinburgh last night and i really do think i don't know how i managed to keep my tongue still
comments like i suggest instead of wasting time on leads i suggest you try knocking on doors
that is the only way you will find them
i said well anne UNK and i knocked on eighty five doors on thursday evening before we got one contact
i said i can go out and walk the streets for hours and find no one
right
i says i have to follow up leads
yes but i'm not interested in you following up leads i'm interested in nine interviews
i said well i think it'll be a miracle if i get nine interviews because the quota is far too tight
i don't understand what you mean by tight
i says well right
the area's not
right away i said i have three people to find for working class areas who collect stamps who are interested in stamps
i said people generally have more to do with their money
and of course what defeated me was knows this fellow that is an ambulance driver and he's classed as working class
and he stays in a four bedroomed detached house
but his wife's a school teacher and that's why
yes well
so you're not going to get that like i mean that was a one in a million shot finding
yes
him
i would say so
and i w was telling bill about him and as bill said it's a waste driving an ambulance
he d actually designs stamps and first day covers
does he
a work of art jean
absolute work of art
you just couldn't believe what the man has done
mm
it shows
shows the people who go to the
aha
the church
yeah
what's her name again
i don't know
she teaches in
aye she's she does the lot
very nice person
she's a very nice person
just been UNK to
your mother was there
it says here i write a lot of letters to other people
then it how exactly
well do you
do they mean i write i don't write a lot of letters
i dictate a lot of letters to a lot of people
tomorrow i will sign ultimately twenty odd do they want me to sit
aye i think they must it must be talking about UNK as well
down and sit writing long hand
no
no i think they'll mean it's number of stamps
cos i rarely ever do that
i think it's they look for the number of stamps used rather if it's what you
ah well good
aha
okay
i would say that
even though you don't physically write them
even UNK them i think you should count that as writing
do you count that
i think so though
oh
oh well
i think so
right
if you want to change
it you just put a stroke through it
just put a stroke through that one
and circle the one you want to circle
so i agree strongly yes
mhm
ah write a few letters to the hospital forty
oh aye
they said to bill on the telephone
i've been knocking on doors the other night there
i went along to you know the council houses in there
yes
some of the answers i got
big girl was just about to close a door and she opened a big smile and she said ah i just remembered my UNK stamps
i said oh great
she says aha every morning he's a UNK
three doors along a great big UNK lad
er i would say a sixteen or seventeen
i said er none of your UNK collect stamps no
and he says none of my UNK are like that
what sort of answer okay
there was no answer to that
do you know your full postcode
which one
here
yeah
could you give me your full postcode please
and when you write your address down do you quote your full postcode always sometimes or only when asked
if i were to ask you for your address what would you do

any other radio station
what other radio station
well i isn't if you'd asked me last august when we bought the i would have said probably radio UNK or radio UNK
oh right
or something like that
because we couldn't get anything else
yeah
er have you ever bought goods through the post by mail order
er no
i never either i'd have said too
but i sent to for
so i suppose that's mail order you know you've got to
oh aye
we never buy anything
you're probably to
right
buy things through the post
right
and you're a doctor
general UNK
er and i think we're safe to say that you're married and
two adults in the household
one collector
one collector
i depends what you mean by collector
one UNK
one UNK
can i twenty six
twenty five
twenty five
oh sorry
twenty five
twenty UNK old enough i suppose
i know well stupid UNK
still not happy in
oh aye it's okay
oh did i tell you she was thinking of going to do a UNK certificate
she phoned her careers office today they're sending her the information free you're thinking
yes i know
i didn't know that
doing that at college
where's
erm be far side it's right keep going out and out
oh
i mean that used to be a college in
i but colleges
oh right that's
erm that's probably why get into
they're changing places
mhm
well she's quite enjoying it
is it full time
but er aha
mm
but as far as that er i got the information for the UNK foot and then i checked with bill here
mhm
but he hadn't heard of there's another thing which amanda suggested i try
another
er three percent compound
i'm sure but no one 's ever heard of it
mhm
it's a
exactly so
however i try it and i went in the shop and
i got an awful funny feeling that shoes
cos it's a UNK could it not spread from my shoes
erm your socks
quite
why don't you get something to wipe them with or something
i don't know
no idea
so how much is the course did she say
how's she paying it is she just leaving school
erm well she's a grant because she's never had a grant before
are they still getting grants
mhm
oh i thought they'd stopped all these
amanda just back from UNK
but just you
on holiday
twenty six
mhm
erm and she paid for the holiday but she has an UNK
she's got she mustn't eat anything with UNK
well that's
mhm
not easy
so somebody had told her to apply and she would get a grant to help towards her special diet
so she applied and she got five hundred and fifty pounds
so whether that's an annual thing or not i don't know
aha
but it's to help it's cos she's a student and it's to help towards a special diet
was she working
no she's at college
but was she working before she
er no
she was unemployed for how long
she was unemployed
they've got most times i think you'll have to be unemployed for six months
aha
but she had been working er as a
pay for this
mhm
on do you know like the buses or the
aye right
continental equivalent and she was on them
mhm
er but it wasn't steady employment
mhm
s
aye
needs to pay for it
aha
i don't know how much it'll cost
but then if she could get set nights
friday night saturday night then she could pay for it
aha
aha
the national health couldn't train her
she doesn't work for them
of course she doesn't work for them now
er no
but privately private
mhm
aye but the health service
what a very stupid question of course it'll be private
they're taking patients in
so that's how she got her contract of employment her UNK over
mhm
so she's signed that
so i mean if she can get set nights she won't get in this term anyway i presume all the places will have gone
mhm
but she wants to do erm oh god UNK that's just three hundred pounds
just i mean she
but it's just three hundred pound
UNK and
well you see she wants to do the whole lot er cos it's all she said feet are the only part of the human body she can tolerate
in strangers
and folk
spent a lot of money on UNK to see if it would help her sleep
she's still not sleeping at nights
mhm
tried absolutely everything
is she alright during the day or is she absolutely UNK
tired
kn UNK
because she's got a stressful job
mm
margaret thatcher never slept much either
no
apply for prime minister
er
she's er
she's not
mm
she's
it's really all in her mind but
and she's given up her one night a week in the w which
er social science
mm
said that sh she hasn't been eating and she
mhm
went under
erm but to get into the social work department she'll still have to do the that
mm
och aye
i know
er
aha
but she's another two years
for social workers
she's having trouble with it
sh i think she sees a lot of women who have been social workers
erm a drop out centre drop in centre
drop centre
it's not for drop outs it's for drug UNK and glasgow
but there's been a few UNK things UNK and it was getting a wee bit dodgy so she's given that up
really bad for drug UNK and
oh right
a sort of wild west country
and she's got to look after the budget as well
ah
aye
UNK he's still looking for a job
is he
it's two months now i think they're starting to get a wee bit worried
what was he doing
a chartered accountant
in the UNK department of his office too
i mean the one department you would have thought would have been enough
oh i wish
good start
margaret
any whatsit worth their salt any what do you call it what is he
chartered accountant worth their salt would certainly not be working for any health service or trust hospital
why is that dr oh right
mhm
erm he'd dead against it
i just don't er
she's so sick
yes i got this pile of papers on the wednesday
aha
er go and design an UNK suite
you've to design you're making one
who said this
ray
and for your next trick ray
no it wasn't quite as bad as that ray er what do you call it had already done it
i had to quote
i had to look through all the rest and take what i wanted
well that's quite essential cos you should know what's
oh i see right fair enough
i was raging
papers a lot
aye i had to look through the whole lot of them
and get back to the designs and see what could be improved upon and what have you
then that very night i got a phone call from this woman
this UNK saying that the architect w wants to know all about UNK what it involves so that it gives him an idea as to what is about
so i thought what are you asking me for
i said if the architect wants to know he can come and look and see for himself
i says i only work part time you know
she said oh i take it you don't know anything about this
i said no how should i
she said dr was supposed to speak to you about it
i said well he's never mentioned it
mm
i said
well you should have high regard asking for yours
well it's just the architect she said well it doesn't matter if he hasn't said to you
well i said she said surprised
i said oh i'm not surprised
i felt like saying i've got a bloody big pile of rubbish here that i have to go over so i've put in for overtime
why not
i UNK i was raging
i thought right this could take seconds
mhm
if i just knew where he was prepared to stand and then could just sort of do the things round about
mhm
so i UNK him
and he
how big how big is the room
oh it's big
mm
well UNK
it's about that width from there
aha
to there and oh square sort of to here like a four
mm
UNK bay
oh there's four beds in it
i only know about the room
there would have been it's a ward
at the moment they're UNK
oh i see aha
one of the UNK diseases wards
so of course we were there the UNK in there
UNK disease ward
aye well it's over in that unit
mhm
it's UNK i think
right
we've only got the one UNK diseases ward
oh god
so i was saying i UNK him
i said aye
i said it's me i said can you come over
over where
i said oh guess where
i said i'm on ward one or two i don't know which one it is
so you
so i said are you coming over i said this could take minutes if i knew where exactly
so
you were going to stand
now
in casualty day unit is to open it's all to be opened up they're building a new day unit and whether the day unit has access
why are they doing this
to the main building
why are they doing it
why
aha
och i don't know why they're moving it down there it's already got a day unit on fifteen
mhm
och i don't know
i don't know what's going on in the hospital
i don't bother to find out
so he didn't come over
no i'm not coming over
he said just think of the place as four walls
bare walls
i said there's bloody windows the whole length of one wall
mhm
just
so
forget about the windows
forget no forget about the windows
you can't forget about the windows
oh aye they can be UNK up
no sunshine in again
oh no they'll i suggested they leave the window UNK and just left sort of a window that deep along
mhm
for some light
mhm
anyway
i was raging
well i'm not coming over
just like that
i thought you UNK
i said oh well right
and shoved the phone down
so i thought right this is it
so i get the back of something and i UNK cupboards here cupboards here cupboards here cupboards here and i thought right i'll see off duty
i was supposed to be off at four this was six so i thought two hours overtime
right quite right cos you have to work for two
so that was that
so i got home
aha
aha
now i if his computer er had been up and running erm you know i might be able to design something
anyway so and then of course oh that was another thing i said to him no you'll want to sit somewhere you'll want i don't want a desk in there i'm not having my desk in there
i said oh yes and if you think for one minute i'm taking UNK forms to your room i said you must have had
is it far away
i said you'll need to have a desk in there
is it far away
hey
far away
his room
aye
oh i've no idea but it's certainly more than that room and i'm not
so i said you'll need something you'll need somewhere knees under
so the nest day i s as i say i UNK the phone down
hey he used to be your good friend
this oh i was raging at him
oh UNK the next day
mm
he was supposed to go down well he did go to a meeting but in he comes first of all
good morning
i thought hmm
and then he
but jenny she was in UNK she said my god i see a lot of folk get the cold shoulder but that took a bit of beating
erm i'm sorry about yesterday but i just couldn't come
i said oh really
and that
well maybe
so i said here it is
no he came back he came back after he had been at the meeting
i said
oh you should have done it all
i said indeed i have not the top
mm
oh you hadn't time to look at the rest
i said well i haven't time to look at the rest
what's the rest
all this other pile of stuff i never even looked at
so you don't know what's
no i this wee drawing
that was it
mm
i said oh thank you very much
mm
i thought oh aye
i said then tell me i said i don't understand these terms
what the UNK is this
a trolley loading bay
i said what in UNK name are we having
a trolley loading bay
and then it's got these rooms it's like an eight UNK eight UNK bit
mhm
only it's got this separate bit for trolley loading it's got written on it
i thought what the hell is that
i said why don't you just knock the UNK wall down
that's in case the roof falls in
i thought oh don't tell me any more
mm
oh and i just hope he's remembering that i don't want to be the sister in there
you don't want
want to be the sister
you don't
no
i don't want anything to do with the patients
well what would you be then
well i'm not i'm not being a sister in the er UNK room
i'll do the UNK
aha
i'll do the bits that i'm involved in now
aha
but i'm being i'm not UNK the patient or anything after
will you not lose money by doing that
well i don't care
i'm not doing it
i don't know anything about ward work i don't know anything about the forms i don't know anything well obviously you get r t
why didn't you need this in your work
theatre
mm
i haven't been in wards for about twenty two years
oh
and i have i'm completely out of touch
i don't know anything
each of course you'd be about seventeen years
well
right
anyway i haven't about any of the UNK ideas
ah fair enough i didn't know about that
so i'd have no idea
the only thing i know and
and i'll just take an f grade or whatever
mhm
an f grade
other than that i'm gonna do two nights
aye well some of the night shift have been done away
i am told
mm
well from what UNK and margaret have been saying we think probably what'll happen is a lot of the girls who do just do nights a lot of them for pin money
mm
suddenly gonna have a staff shortage
oh this is
mhm
alison gets six pound thirty odd
an hour
mhm
well this is nights
mhm
the twelve hours twenty four hours
mm
oh it is
but she gets
mhm
aye
ah well see how it goes
because i mean this is just the start of the trust i mean UNK change next year
by next year they'll probably issue new contracts and
mhm
i mean i'm just anyway
mm mhm
i'm so valuable to him
gonna go downhill
because he'd the di you're the medical director
yes i know that
mhm
you said that
since you w went on the ward that's been
yeah
you thinking how you used to talk to it was great wasn't it
oh it's still fine
mm
oh we still get on fine
mhm
it was just i thought what they hell do you think he's on here
mhm
hey
who does he think he's talking to
get this want it tomorrow
yeah
wait a minute
i'm not a UNK i'm a nurse UNK off
i should have said
i'd forgotten

there's only about
they haven't got numbers
no
tell me about it
i know
alright
house was looking for
erm is it a big old house is it
no i don't think so i get the impression new house
it's a bungalow
is one of the new UNK then
aha aye it is
yes
what did i do with the car keys
ten they were sitting on top of your bag outside
aye i know
there were about ten
ten twelve new bungalows
well i think i don't think it's all that it's not a recent bungalow by the sounds of it cos he's had to have new UNK
mhm
or a new luxury bathroom suite
aha
it gives me the idea that it's not
you must have put them in your bag
aye likely
no i put them in my pocket
aye erm
och no we got on fine
i was very i was very surprised
i expected to be like a village
mm
but it's not
i've never been
it's not
i was most surprised
and what is it like
it's one street
you come down a steep hill from
on the left hand side is the golf course and then there was
mhm
two four six big old houses
mm
and then on the left hand side the old houses continue and the female i interviewed er i UNK there had been a house there that had been knocked down and they built a wee bungalow
mhm
and then on the other side that's where the wee bungalows start
mm
and there are about ten
they're not big
there's nothing i would say
a lo of land
no
because the sounds of it it's quite a big garden he's got
mm
where was it that UNK stayed that you and
i mean i don't know erm
maybe you went to a an afternoon UNK party or something
a late lunch at dr 's
that was
oh
maybe that's what i was thinking the big house was
both begin with d
mhm
well that's enormous i mean his garage
detached house
yeah

no there's
mm
aye well
hope it's a happy day tomorrow
old ladies section outing on sunday
before sunday
we're going would you believe it to
oh mhm
that's nice
exciting stuff
that's alright
i've never been to
you're jo
i have been to
i lost my good watch last year in
how could i forget that
oh whereabouts is the golf course then
it's up the bank i think
you know when where it's UNK i think it's
oh no
i think
erm we went to for lunch before
er what's the name of the place
oh
don't be silly
aha
hotel
aye
and then we went on to and parked at the start of and walked up one side and back down the other side and that's as much as i saw of it
i
oh no is it a golf club possibly
er before you get to hotels
in the bottom out the bottom
aha
the other end i think they go and round to the right
i thought it was on the right hand side as you went into village
obviously it's not
och i might be wrong
could be wrong
the food is supposed to be good
so that's always something
mm
east UNK has a lovely golf course
nice golf house
mm
and erm
one day we were up at UNK
oh right
my hand
pulled a muscle or something
and i could only play nine holes and i had to
oh dear
give up
but i knew i was going to east UNK i thought this is stupid it's only gonna make it worse
so i don't know
i took two and on tuesday and it's been fine since so god knows what's gone wrong
but er because of that i decided to go into UNK and have a wee wander round
mhm
mhm
it's really nice
i've never been there before
nice new shopping centre and marks and UNK and
oh
oh that's the
aye and the
oh and who took the wrong road going across
and sheila had to start giving me direction
i said no sheila i said i know where i'm going it's all right
so of course she didn't like to say
we're two thirds of the way along i thought sheila i said i'm heading for the wrong bridge
i'm heading for the forth road instead of the bridge
i said well i'm not
i mean
didn't know where we were going
mhm
er cos it's not actually UNK the golf club it's at er
you know where is
it's three miles out of UNK as you leave the town and go towards bridge
anyway it took us an hour and twenty minutes to get there it took us forty minutes to get home
that's the difference
er it's much longer going bridge
er what was i going to say
no
no
for once no
oh no it doesn't matter
no it was just that as i say i went off to town
but i realized i was most surprised
spend a day oh aye that's what i was going to say that was the first time i've actually been through
oh right
mhm
no
no but not a lot
then we carried on out that road
and some person had very kindly turned round the sign for the a nine four or whatever it was
oh no
and that's where we went round
however we stopped and got good directions
mhm
mm
and we found it eventually and it was beautiful day too
started off wet and i thought oh is this going to be miserable
mm
it was cold certainly but the sun UNK
so phones last night but the reception was very bad
where is he
no idea
i was only hearing one word in five
obviously too far away
aha
he'll be using his mobile phone again
the only time that works on the long distances is if there's high pressure
the signal must travel better
yeah
in good weather
erm
he went to look at the window UNK and there was this think it's about time you did something about these
i thought away you go
no my conscience
i did that washing yesterday
and i did that er
but it's doing all this lot
i mean the bottom UNK easy to do it's fun but the cushions and that
oh right
but from a dis if i could just get a good you know one of these really warm days
aha
take them out outside and do them
it's be no bother
yeah
and you really have to see them before and after
i mean
aha
you can't really see what's been done but i know it's been done
all the black corners have all been taken off
but this here reading newspapers and you get a lot
mm
oh well my goodness me in a carpet
mm
UNK alright
i know
that carpet that this house has been the ba best advert for that carpet ever
mhm
since i got it
i mean the first two the first two or three nights after and that's like the sleeping death because it's it'd been so long since i had a complete nights sleep
mhm
aye it's three month short of seventeenth birthday
oh is she
aye bill was talking about UNK licence
and all the kids all round about here seem to be quite upset by it as well
but i'd forgotten that you know when we were wee kids and you used to take them that night you know
oh that's right
of course
you forget about
aye
we tended to think of sandy as a liability because he had been so over the past years
especially married
we kept forgetting he wasn't always like that
mhm
you know he used to go everywhere with us in the car
mhm
so you'll be able to go to sea now
will you not
no
why not
oh
it's a tiny little ship it's a wee UNK thing
oh dear
ah
now you've got the chance to go you'll have to get a decent sized boat now
aye
cos i wouldn't worry about the cats cos i'm sure one of our neighbours would look after them
och aye
makes it look quite big but it's not like
oh right it's one of the new
mm
UNK is it
you can't really see it
erm
erm
and here is a bit with deck
mhm
there's a hole straight down into the sea
oh
where they drop the
oh
little UNK
remote vehicle
i see
okay
aha
and this is a crane thing is it
yeah that's where find the er stores and stuff under
oh
she's nice she's quite good
and well ian he's into computers and things like that i mean the technology the bridge behind the bridge just unbelievable i think it's
mhm
got four or five computers
er taking data from whatever
mhm
lot more the job they have it's a very long it runs from just off the coast of er norway right down
mhm
to great UNK and then across to
so and the foods good
oh that's
tremendous
UNK
there and there
he's inherited i believe
is he quite liking it
it's a job that's all
mm
i think it's too much of the from the you know the contractors
they tell them what to do
mhm
and sometimes he doesn't like it
needles to say
i if they want them to do anything
mhm
mhm
mm
head office
because there was no h p UNK
all the UNK were UNK of UNK
er yeah they actually wanted UNK this and UNK that
oh
and UNK this
aha
petty
mhm
really petty
quite a lot of work in er phone calls over the past two weeks
operators
mm
a lot of work was done
mhm
he was offered a good job on a ship called the and she's purpose built for the north sea after
aha
the alpha piper
mhm
and she is
oh
oh it's the most weird looking thing
mhm
and all sorts of safety equipment on it
er fire UNK and things
mhm
and it would have been good because it was per the only thing was he would have had to have gone up to and do a survival course
oh right
you know like taking you up high and dropping into you know
aha
aha
yes
but i had a funny feeling possibly he's not wanting to do it anyway
doesn't know it but er the lady who er in charge of personnel for
and the course which is a helicopter landing officer
mhm
it's
and they don't have enough people with that so
mhm
you do the courses in
mhm
i don't know if he'll mind
but the second UNK the same they're all straight from navigation college and
no
mm
well they they've got the theory
aha
mhm you know
mm
i think i told you the first
i don't know what this one this one's being called
danish bacon
see the people who own the ship are danish
and i the lady who runs the personnel department it's her husband who on the ship
mhm
mhm

or
what date is it
nineteen twenty one twenty two twenty ninth of june
well i'll phone you anyway

just in case something comes up and i've got to go in or
aye i believe you
i know i should have phoned
all that UNK to do
told you about erm how he's
cafe dinner it was great
oh aye
june the twenty ninth
oh no
and of course UNK home again in july for a week
UNK wedding
mhm
mind you it's daft
imagine paying eight hundred pounds return for a day
mind you i suppose it breaks
i mean that's between april and october she's due back
aha
home for a week
oh UNK applied for her social work course
has she
mhm
UNK that's yes
that's her daughter
the one who's in working in a UNK
and she's a son UNK
aye he's building
mm
he was
mm
aye he's not
well what they drop i d i don't know but you could have applied
mhm
for a job as what was it
control room staff for the police
right
mhm
but that was too much responsibility
somebody's life might depend on him getting information
for the giving it out to
aha
information somebody might die because he'd been too slow or there's been a delay in UNK or there's been a fault in the UNK and he's not prepared to take that responsibility
mm
it's very annoying
yeah
is he married
married and divorced he married oh less than a year
oh of course that's right that's right
aye that's right
we were supposed to go to the wedding my father died
mhm
so there's still not any divorce through yet although margaret now if
she's going to take him to solicitors
that would be
ah but no
i think she
erm och i remember she wasn't i don't know
i think
aye no
i don't think you can do that now anyway
no right
is he going to be up there sort of permanent now
i think he's put in for a
he put in for five
as long as it's not bosnia
oh he would apply for there
oh dear
oh aye he applied to go to the gulf
they need them over here
before they go
erm he put in for cyprus i think but then everybody puts in for cyprus
erm
or germany
och i don't know he put in for something else
mhm
but i mean he's been up there how long
about two years
oh yeah
but he likes it up there
mm
it's doing this he doesn't come back here for leave he'd rather stay up there
does he go away hill walking and
aye
yeah
mhm
no i've given it up
we can play it now we've got that
er no i haven't oh UNK
oh great
that's why he
to get golf clubs
knowing his luck he'll get hit in the nose with a golf ball
oh god aye
break it again
mm
oh and he met this girl they went for a weekend to UNK
mhm
camping but they ran out of money so he wouldn't be able to see her till UNK
so that was i mean he just had been paid so it was
aha
about four weeks i don't know whether how would that went down when he phoned her and told her
aye
he's twenty one
pardon
twenty two in january
he's just twenty one
wait i think
ah it doesn't matter it doesn't matter
twenty two
oh no twenty two
and happy as ever
how long is she in now
sometime this eight nine ten years
and as it goes one she gets more and more permanent
but she's still well i think she'd daft
she's in at the UNK at least an hour before she starts
she likes to sit and cup of coffee
and when the UNK over she sits another
so she's hardly in the house and she'll be back again
you know
wait how UNK this UNK of night duty
well that was at well that was last time it it's normally seven or eight nights
mhm
on the UNK
and then you get two or three days off
mhm
and the it's early
oh that's her back on to days
yes aha
mhm
but she seems to be doing night shift a lot recently
mhm
probably cos of staff UNK
or somebody's not there
UNK will you fi will you take night shift for
she likes being
well we've got x ray staff
mhm
but that is
i can never remember i can never remember
erm four years
oh has she
seem all that long ago
it was
if they're married two years
mind you we've got loads of staff nurses as well and they're not all made up to
aye
ah right
i couldn't tell you what
i'm sure it was a almost two years
eighteen months
she got she qualified july or august
well she sat her UNK
mhm
and she started right away
on the ward
mhm
and that was the that would be a year
that'll be like four years this august
very UNK for anybody to stay in that work for four years
mhm
usually after a couple of years
mhm
but UNK seems to think everything will be very
oh i mean if she likes it that's fine
oh she does
she does
well that's okay
mm
mhm
she's acting up
you tell him she said well why should i tell him
aye
apparently he's quite good UNK
oh
who's brian
jane's son
oh right
er and she's not i think there's a few i'm not sure
and apparently the man was a bit UNK pardon me
so he she always to

what have you done to it
now i don't know if it's my back or my neck
i don't know
i got a prescription last week
mhm
and i don't know where i put it
right so i just stopped at the UNK and i says och i'd better not go back up
where's it sore
between my shoulder UNK it's also at the bottom of my UNK just now and again
it's i'm really busy at work i'm at a warehouse and i don't know if i've maybe caught a muscle
it sounds like it
it sounds like that but
i can feel like a sort of UNK
see that
in the back of my neck
that big muscle from there
right down the back of you
it's i can't sleep at night
oh i know
you appear to enjoy this
i know
from just down about there
aha
aye aha
i know i'm going down and down
it's not as bad as my head but it's sore
what about there
it's
if i do that
aye that's how where i knew it wouldn't wanna go there
ah
right
see when i'm walking i can actually hear something in the back of
aye UNK
my neck
that's right
come on let's turn you into a human being for wee while again
i hope so as long as i get a sleep at night i don't care what you're giving me
there you can still
i know i'm just never been able to call out the doctor
eh now this is strong stuff never take it on an empty stomach
never
right
right
you have been warned you have been warned
don't let your father get these
but he'll want them all
yeah
great
there's a good UNK in those and there's the stuff to UNK the UNK as well
good
take two in the morning before you go out and two before you go bed at night
two in the morning two at night
aye
so i've got to have my breakfast first
aye
right
right
when i says i've got
i hope so
chance to
i hope so
right okay UNK cheerio now
i've come of a new
please
let's have a look
this is the UNK yeah
UNK yeah
everything okay on that
yeah fine yeah
periods behaving
erm sometimes i have a good period like
yeah
i used to on er
yeah
other pill
yeah that's right
but sometimes i don't have one or
yeah
sometimes it's just one
yeah
day
yeah a bit UNK
er yeah
but
right okay
no problem at all
yes that can happen on UNK
bowels
UNK
yeah fine
all behaving
yes
right now what we do need to do today is to get your blood pressure checked
yeah
how are things going on from the other point of view
erm it UNK
mm
a bit off still
yes
yeah
we h we still haven't heard anything
from the UNK
er no go to see him
you've got from them certainly
yeah
yeah
but you're still in UNK as far as the
yeah
the civil action is concerned
erm even no second UNK nothing
oh
but er apparently got a solicitor
er we haven't had to see anybody about that and he sent us a letter saying that he'd like to see us and we went and he says it there might not be a second UNK
oh
might go straight to court
ah
and then we had a phone call from the police about a month ago
oh right good
saying that it had gone straight to court it was in court you know
oh right
but we haven't heard anything
oh well i mean they may have been adjourned or a
even though
it may have been referred to a higher court
you think so
erm
i mean we haven't heard anything directly i'm only glad that the police are actually telling you something
yeah
it was a big shock that day when we had that phone call
mm
but it was i you know to know that you haven't got to fight
that's right yeah
t to take him to court
erm
but it's a long process
i mean we have dealings with solicitors for all sorts of things asking for reports and we send a lot of notes away to have a lot of er medical opinion reports and they take ages to come back
and that's a these are the preliminary things that the solicitor must go through before they get near court so
yeah
the people
yeah
who it's actually they're actually dealing with are waiting months and months and months and er
yeah
it looks like that in your case
we
we may well have to provide the medical report on your behalf yet
god
but n no one has approached me to do so
no
so er but it wouldn't surprise me if some sort of medical report on how you are doesn't reach court
it erm mr who we see UNK erm the first week i went to see him oh
it t d certainly you know erm
yeah
it's very
erm
hard
we do you know when we start doing something we'll do it and even if we do things different gonna say
we thinking well why are we doing it this way
mm
so er everything's pulling at us
yeah
you know
w we seem as though we do something and we w we are absolutely UNK
mm
you get we want to push ourselves
that's right
but do you know once we start doing something w we're just UNK all the while
in some ways you're in UNK cos you've got nothing to aim towards
you've
no
got i mean if even if you had a date to aim towards even if it was six months hence at least that would help you could
yeah
aim towards it and work towards it
yeah
but er and i think it's most unfair on you two really and the whole thing
and you come off worse than anyone else and er but there's no real way of UNK that up they can't give
no
dates and they can't say what's going to happens they have to go through UNK the evidence arrange it all in a certain order
and then go and
rachael she's coming home well she was she was discharged friday from hospital
mm
oh right
and er they thought thursday they'd have to do an operation on her by taking a piece of bone from her hip
mhm
and putting it in the leg
but they said it was knitting together lovely
good
but then they took the pins out
ah
let her go home friday discharged her the day after
she'd put too much weight on it and she's back in hospital she's broke it
well they'll probably have to put at least the bone in there it's a bone UNK
they've put it in plaster at the moment
yeah
but s you know she she's UNK it's erm
she she's coming okay i think
mm
you know to see her as well that's som you know
mm
but we don't go as often now
no
erm
right
lovely and
th the six packets of UNK
yeah
your UNK is due in december
now i'm going to leave that with you
if you really don't feel like coming up for a UNK at that time that's fine and we'll understand why
and w there's an awful lot
yeah
of pressure on you from an awful lot of other sources so don't worry about it
and
yeah
but er you are
actually officially due in december and obviously we'd like
is that me three years
yeah
yeah
we'd like
yeah
to get that done
yeah
don't seem like three years
oh no i'm sure
the UNK of course will continue to see you
and if
yeah
you want to pop in and have a chat with me in between that's fine but i'm not here next week
yeah
so that's that
er and i hope everything goes a UNK as possible
if there are any medical reports to do we'll get them done as soon as possible but you know a is that's very much out of our hands and
yeah
we can only wait on your solicitors their solicitors there's the police the court the entire system
you see we haven't notified any solicitor at all it was
no
just when we got back off holiday we'd got a letter from
well it's if the police are doing the UNK then you may
yeah
not have to bother
well it apparently there is a clause in UNK insurance er that got the solicitor
yeah
and he notified us
right
and he said he would b represent
but then he mentioned when we UNK to see him he says we will deal with this but you must get somebody for civil
yeah
action
yeah
and we asked him if he did civil action
oh right yeah
and he said yes he'd
mm
he would you know he hasn't g the records haven't got to be released then to
no
anybody else
he will be able to get them
but it's just hoping that everything goes right but at least we
haven't got to fight for prosecution
no
that should go through but er it's a question of when it's going to be though
yeah
do they usually take time like this
yes
yeah
yes
things from er data whenever can take ages and ages and ages to and you know doctors get sued every now and again UNK the thought
oh
UNK the thought but when
y w you when you keep hearing reports in the medical UNK about doctors being sued and it can be several years after the event that the case comes to court
now it won't be that long in your case but it just goes to show how lengthy the whole thing can be
UNK yeah
and it's er
but it's so
but
much hurt you know
that's right
but pete he still getting up very early he doesn't sleep
mm
very good
yeah
yeah
i mean in some ways
and
i think he's more UNK by it than you
and
i like erm UNK said erm
there's a lot of anger there isn't there
yeah
he says i'm still with UNK
yeah
and pete knows it's happened
mm
i erm if i try not to give way it leaves so much up here
mm
i can keep thinking it's not happened
yeah
that's right
but
you know
but
wor working through it all it's very painful
yeah
and it's easier in the short term not to have in the long term you get more problems
UNK yeah
i i've found that
you know like i say i try to do some things different and then that don't work sometimes cos i think well why am i doing 'em like that
mm
i wouldn't be doing this if it hadn't happened
do you do you
mhm
do you now what i mean
so like you say it can cause
that few more problems
but erm probably if we wasn't so much and
mm
i think he UNK be
i think sometimes he's still being protective
yeah
he's still being protective
mm
that's right
and erm dunno
the police i know went to see rachael and they still can't understand why he didn't use an UNK you know
no
and it's just unbelievable
mm
but everybody's allowed a mistake but
when you've got a big UNK lorry
bit of drastic mistake to make
you know if you know i can't stop feeling as though that morning he used that lorry as a weapon
mm
you know
er i don't i think as it goes on y you do start and get that anger that anger so bad but erm but i'll leave you to get on doctor
and
right james let's have a look at this finger
thumb
thumb
well it is a finger of sorts
what have you managed to do to it
oh dear oh dear
i don't now what he's done to it
oh dear
it were a bit UNK yesterday and he's been in bed day when he's got up this morning that's how
now that is not very nice is it james
i don't know why doing it
is that very painful in there
yeah
okay sit yourself down
sit down
if you look at the finger if you draw a little picture from the side nail coming out there okay
and in here you've got some bones okay
yeah
so this joint here is this joint here and there's the nail
now what you've got is a really UNK infection
it started around the edge of the nail i should think and that's where they usually go
but this has spread quite rapidly it can't really go beyond here cos the skin is quite tight
it's quite tightly bound round there so it stays in this area here
and instead of just being here round the top this has actually gone round here too by the looks of it
and it's probably actually got an UNK in there which is why it's so UNK on the top sides and at the bottom
now the danger of leaving these is you can get g i is the infection can spread into the bone soon
and if it does that you're in real trouble
so what you need to have done with this is to have all the UNK got out
yeah
okay and it needs to be opened up in UNK which sounds a bit drastic but isn't actually that bad
and sometimes as well as going this way we actually need to go in this way too to actually get it out
if it was simply round the nail we could do it here but it's not
i mean it actually looks like an UNK in there so this really needs to be done in the hospital i'm afraid
it's not an enormous
but
thing
on sunday it looked alright
yeah
there were nothing wrong with it
they spread very quickly
but they don't spread tha out of this way but they can spread in this bit quite quickly cos there's nothing to stop it going around there at all
urgh
it won't go further back in a hurry but it it's these are very nasty
have you had anything stuck in it james
you haven't had a UNK
i don't think he has
or anyone knocked or UNK it
football kicked at it
s
UNK
they kicked at it
right this is his right thumb is he right handed
yeah
will he have to go on the
yes he will he'll have to go on the plug yeah he c you're not fit for work for a little while
now what we really need to do is to get the UNK people to have a look at this
in fact they may recommend they have people see him
and if they recommend that may mean a little bit of trip down to either nottingham or perhaps even derby
but if we start off at kings mill and they'll decide what h the best way of treating this
okay
so we'll get them on the UNK
little letter
now he's otherwise fit and well isn't he
we don't see him very often
no
he weren't very well yesterday at all he were in bed all day
yeah where are we now
twenty fourth is it
twenty four
and it's isn't it
yeah
is he allergic to anything you know of
no
and he's not on any pills and tablets at the moment is he
ooh yes that's a nice cold isn't it
a strange bloke
if you find you go and they see you and you get very little joy can you get back to us
yeah
well he might just have got out of bed that may not help
but if you do have problems do get back and mm
is my nail going to my nail going to come off mum
yeah i'm afraid it may well fall off james yes
it may well fall off but if it does fall off and everything gets back to normal it'll grow back again
i black nail
now what they'll do is they'll have a look and then decide what to do
there's a there's a chance that they will actually refer you on
er they may feel this isn't they can sort it out themselves so we'll see
depends i if er one of the hand specialists is in they'll probably get you done there and then if they're quick
and where do i go then just kings mill casualty
kings mill casualty and the
where's that
UNK people will see you there
j have you been to kings mill since they UNK it
no i haven't been since the c they moved the casualty there
right you go straight up
yeah
the drive
and the block is on the right hand side and you just keep going straight on
okay don't turn right don't turn left go straight on
and the car parks are to the right and the main entrance is on the left and you just keep going straight on straight on straight on straight on and the bottom left hand corner is casualty
now you can't actually park by UNK door you're going to have to park a little bit before that
but
aha
if someone's giving you a lift what you could do is get them to drive straight down drop you off and then they can go and park
okay
and it's you go straight up and it's in that bottom left hand corner
right
okay you can't really miss it it's where all the UNK are
so you're going to see the UNK people there care of casualty b c one
i mean
kings mill hospital ho little joke
right now we better start you off how we mean to go on james with er a sp a special UNK
we don't give you one of those cos they're boring much more interesting one
shall we give you a lion for being brave
would you like a lion for being brave
yeah
would you like a lion
it says i've been good at the doctor today
we'll start you off with one of these okay
that can't be a bad start
one lion s one lion UNK there you go
okay
and they're going to have a good look and you may need to do all sorts of interesting things okay
as i said if you have problems and they don't you don't think they're going to do an awful lot get back to me cos i i'm sure that's going to need some sort of intervention
right
there's certainly no point in just waving antibiotics at it cos that won't make it better
so i can take him now then should
yeah take him straight d
well did you enjoy your holiday

mm
dreadful
yeah
but it but it is typical m e UNK
well that's right a sort of low UNK tired
yeah
and more tired
that's right and i'm very depressed
yeah
are UNK you are i mean obviously you are keeping yourself going cos you're obviously getting out to come here and do bits and UNK but
well this is the first time i've been
yeah
able to come here on my own
yeah
erm and that's not like me i usually
manage to you know
now you're usually okay aren't you
yeah but er it really has knocked me for six this time
mhm
erm i think it's probably that infection that i had er
yes
it may well be
that UNK or whatever it was
yeah
yeah
er it takes very little well you know yourself
mm
don't you
yeah
i mean i found it in the past you know any infection what so ever just knocks you for six
and i'm just you know i think that's probably why jo was
mm
c i think i she'd seen me at my worst on friday
yeah
and
yeah
i think it worried her a bit
yeah
yeah
but er your UNK levels are absolutely fine
they're almost exactly the same as you were four weeks ago
i thought they were actually cos i even at that part of
yeah
it felt
yeah
erm
yeah
yeah
normal
yeah
good
i mean the headaches are i'm reluctant to say better
yeah but not so
but
bad
but they're certainly no not so severe
yeah
do you find they respond better if you take UNK when they're there as well
yes
yeah
yeah
exactly what i's expect and you may find they actually sort of are on a down slope still
and maybe it's a very shallow down slope but still on a down slope
mm
and that's what i'd
i do actually feel better
i eat i don't usually take my first lot of tablets till sort of around dinner time
and i find sort of about an hour or so afterwards i do
actually start to feel
anyhow we're g we're gonna summarize
your UNK in october of course that's
mhm
and that's fine
what i
would apart as far as the levels are concerned i'd check them again in UNK erm no hang on we've just checked them
i'd probably check them in october again
two months cos you seem stable
two months
you seem st unless you get any particular
mhm
to it i would UNK that in october
and then when we see you then we're going to sort of summarize what three months on UNK levels of UNK has done for you
to decide whether to continue
is it a drug that you can stay on
they've got people who've been on it for years and years
mm
you've got to keep checking the level
mm
it it's a funny little drug it's related to sodium old sodium you've got loads of sodium
you take it everyday as with salt
er but i it can replace sodium in certain systems of the body
in fact that's how it seems to work
but because of that you've got to watch it's effect on the UNK on the body UNK
mm
so that's what we have to check from time to time
mm
but it's very safe provided you keep in within the sort of UNK like driving on the motorway
it's safe if you st stick to the speed limit
mm
usually
could you give me some more of that
hormone cream
yes
i was going to ask how you'd gone with that
well it's better but it's not right
yeah
yeah
well you've only
mm
been on it a fortnight
yeah
so er but
find i'm down to using it twice a week now
twice a week
yeah
so i haven't
yeah
used it this week
alright okay
yeah
but it's certainly an improvement
yeah
to what it was
oh good
i mean the advantage of that is you get UNK you get the local benefits without UNK side effects
mm
er and that can be a problem with some folk when you try to UNK the UNK like that
but i'm actually using more and more of this cream as i realize that er if you direct it towards the right part of the body in the right people
mm
it works extremely well
as i say it's just erm overall feeling generally
well i mean
horrible
and you know to some extent it's just time and keeping yourself ticking over that's going to get that aspect of things better
yeah
and that's frustrating for you and it's equally frustrating for me because i know there's absolutely nothing i can do
that's right
to effect that
but it's important we keep other an eye on the other things keep other things ticking over and things like the hormone cream and the UNK will be a help in that
yeah
i mean sometimes just by resting really er you know puts me back again but er it hasn't
yeah
don't UNK the rest
well i were going to say i can't rest
you've got to find a compromise
i mean it's always a com i mean the whole of life is a compromise but especially with this
the compromise between resting when you feel very tired and keeping yourself going so you don't UNK up
mm
but you can't UNK the mobility cos you get very tired
yeah
well i've been you know very conscious of that
and i and when you've had it a long time you
mm
become and i'm not the sort of person to sit around willy UNK any way
but my legs my legs are like UNK my body's like rubber you know
and i sort of UNK
ooh i get so mad
keep other bits of you going
okay
when do you want to see me again
well
all else being equal i would say october with the UNK level and then we're gonna have our review of UNK
okay
if anything UNK up in between that's fine
there should be enough cream there now for four to six weeks on a twice weekly basis but if you run out just give a ring in
right
that's fine
well i'll need my other tablets
yeah
well of course you'll need those anyway
so er
i had UNK last week and i'm just clearing and coughing out
that's all we're doing nothing drastic
now then
that it's his little treat
that that's for you and
ooh
your wife
oh
oh you shouldn't do this all the time
oh dear oh dear oh dear
i i'll tell you i will be i will be popular UNK when i get home
there you are you see
you can't beat that
that will that'll be nice
won't it
they will enjoy that
yeah i actually i'd better put these in the draw cos if i don't i can see someone else helping themselves
aye you never know
and i probably put oh look at this oh that well
oh well that's nice cos my wife will like this cos it's not er
it's very
it's not er it's a sort of medium strength rather than
it's like
yeah
er UNK
yeah ooh i like UNK
well er i you w it's ju it's just
very UNK
the same as UNK
i like UNK this is a this is a real something to have with a pudding
a real light pudding
yeah
summer wine ooh yes
summer pudding
and this
i better put this in the draw as well otherwise my UNK clinic later dad's
oh yeah
er what's he up to
that's right
anyway
now then
nice to see you again
er
twenty fourth
i'm getting a little bit disturbed
now la last there's two people down here last week they said they could hear me breathing
they tell me they told but i don't feel any effects from it at all
now what have they have they said they can hear you breathing more quickly or more deeply or UNK or
but didn't say that
they said they could just hear me didn't they UNK
very quick and loud
mm
but er yet i don't think er don't seem to be i don't feel any
deep UNK or shallow UNK
very small
he does about three now to me one
okay
what are you like at night
actually perhaps i should ask your wife
oh well now i don't ask him at night because is that i is we hardly have any sleep
oh
because
with bloody arm business
with this a arm
oh
this is up this is UNK me more than the breathing job really
yeah
we had one hour the other night
oh dear
now then
we'll come back to that
mm
now
his breathing
yes
n now you know when i went to see dr he said i'd got this UNK heart
that's right yeah
well what er what's what detrimental is that to me anyway
what's the effects on meself
on me er what causes it anyway
how do how do you put this into ho when you get when you get heart strain it's a bit like a pair of UNK okay
who which i which are having to cope with a bigger and bigger body
and the UNK gets stretched and stretched and stretched
and instead of being a UNK fitting pair of UNK they become a big UNK pair of UNK that are really neither use nor UNK
and that's what the heart is like in heart failure
it gets more and more UNK out and it just ca it gets less and less and less good as a pump
and eventually it's a bit UNK useless bag of muscle that really doesn't do anything
and that's right at the end and that's why people die of heart failure
now you're not that bad
but there is some strain on the heart and it is rather large and it isn't working so well
what's what what's caused this
what causes it
well it's usually because the heart itself is getting either old or tired or it's damaged in one way
and it just doesn't work as well
and then what y when it doesn't work so well you get a bit of a backlog of fluid
and you get the bit you get
backlog of fluid both at the UNK you get UNK
but very commonly you get a backlog of fluid on the lungs
mhm
and so your lungs get a bit of fluid on the lungs you get a bit UNK with it and that's often the first sign
now you have had a few UNK but they've been fairly easily sorted out
and you're actually not on anything at the moment are you
just water tablets
yeah just a low dose
get rid os the fluid
that's just one so you're not on much at all
but i don't er how can i put it
i mean yesterday i cut the lawn
no after effects
no ill effects
but you home and you was on with this breathing job
that now i were j i were just er
you don't know that it's there but i do
i see what you mean yeah
well let's have a look to see what we've got
anyhow that's what happens in heart failure
and er if you can clearly identify that in folk it's worth treating very vigorously cos it can make a huge difference
one of the problems in your case is we've never really been able to cos i when we when we've examined you from time to time things come and gone
so erm
i that er
and i think what we ought to do is have another look at you now
dr when i
he said he said i'd got UNK disease didn't he
or did he think or did he think it was UNK
well he said UNK disease
well i thought it was UNK
yeah
well UNK
anyway
disease is a UNK so
and er i went for an x ray and they said i'd got two UNK or
but you know when you went to see dr you went to the park didn't they
that's right
yeah
did they x ray your heart then
ooh aye yes
i had a proper job there
well you've had an e c g and we've done chest x rays and erm the e the electrical UNK of your heart didn't really show an awful lot but so er anyway let's see what we've got today
okay
do you want to UNK pop on the UNK for me
i think
has your builder started yet
the builder started a week last monday
did he
yeah
and they've done ever so well cos they did all cos of course we had fine whether last week they got everything done and then it poured at the weekend but they weren't there and now they're back on site the UNK up again
so it's great perfect timing so they're really getting going
we had a chap who'd come from UNK to do o to do ours
oh o our builders are actually from mansfield UNK
oh
we had a scots UNK
oh yes
i know them yes
very good nice chap
ah that's erm
fellows
they were very nice yeah they came round to give us a quote and my wife actually knows one of their wives very well and er but the produced an UNK quote
really
oh yeah it was you know a order of UNK greater so
oh dear
we had a
but when we UNK when we told us they said oh they'd have come down to match the nearest competitor and we thought oh why did he quote up there in the first place then
mm
oh had
the are very variable they obviously thought we could afford a
yeah
higher
a higher price
it's not it's not
screen the outside world out
fair is it
yeah
well i thought so but we've got a we think the builders we've got are excellent
good
er they're competitive quote and they'll do the kitchen and unlike some you know where they get UNK in for the UNK the UNK
yeah
it's their firm
yeah
and so
yeah
we know where we are all the time which i think is one of the huge advantages
it does
i'm pleased they're getting on
with it for you
they are i mean there's only usually two or three there at a time but you see it's all UNK at the present
yeah
i mean
aye yeah
we can't do anything else yet
not really
when we're away though next week i think they'll do quite a lot of stuff inside and but they're doing some for the same team are doing some friends of ours on main road and of course most of the people are down there
and we'd
mm
rather they'd finished them off anyway before they came to us
oh yeah
cos they're now a week UNK already
this'll squeeze a little bit
your blood pressures fine okay
it's a bit higher than it was last time but it's still well within the normal range now just how far can you walk before you get short of breath would you say
well the UNK no problem it's when i start to run that's when i get
now y you don't run
no but i'm pretty good walking a lo a hell of a way
but he's UNK and UNK all the time
okay just sit forward for me
ta
really deep UNK now
okay
good okay
and once more
yeah that's fine
right okay that's all done
now all your vital signs are absolutely normal
your heart sounds fine but there is evidence that there is a little bit of fluid in your on your lungs
that in itself doesn't matter cos you're coping but i suspect what happens is every now and again you get a little UNK and your breathing starts to alter and you get a little UNK
yeah
and then most of the rest of the time you're fine
but that's UNK enough i think to s that's probably what's causing your UNK even if you don't notice it and you're UNK
it may have become so normal that you don't but i think
mm
we could actually make you a bit a lot better than this and i think the time has come to adjust how we're treating you a little bit
now what we need to do is to change your water tablets and to change your er medication a little bit
and what we're going to do is to say you had your water tablet this morning haven't you
i haven't had one yet no i
oh good
well i don't not yet
brilliant
brilliant
coming out you see
brilliant
he daren't with coming out
it's coming out you s you get out
okay
want to go and can't
yeah i know
they do UNK rather promptly don't they
er let me see what day is it now tuesday so wednesday
so your going to start those on thursday
now what we're going to do is change your water tablets
don't take a water tablet today
don't take one no
don't take a water tablet tomorrow
and you can start on the new water tablets which are called UNK on thursday
now UNK is actually the stuff in UNK that makes you wee
so we're not actually changing your water tablets as such we're just knocking a little bit off and leaving you just on the UNK bit of your water tablet okay
so you'll still
yeah
be in the same way
what we need to do is to add a drug called UNK which is otherwise known as UNK and somewhere but somewhere we have a brilliant it's gone again
this thing keeps moving around it's not here
right
we're going to put you on what's called a starter pack now start this tomorrow night okay
start on wednesday evening
so you don't take a water tablet today you don't take anything tonight
you don't take a water tablet tomorrow and then you start this UNK stuff and the first dose should be taken at night because the main potential side effect with the very first tablet and it's the first tablet only is your blood pressure can go oh down a bit
so the best thing to do is to have it last thing at night as you UNK your head on the UNK
and then if your blood pressure does go down a bit it doesn't matter cos you're lying down
the important thing is that if you get up at night to have a wee you beware that you may feel a little bit UNK so you get up slowly sit on the edge of the bed you stand up slowly and when you're happy you're off you go
okay
now if you don't get any problems with the first dose then you're fine and then you can carry on
and it's one in the morning okay
and you'll find for half the pack it's one a day and then for the second half of the pack it's two a day
and what i would quite like to do is to see you as you come to the end of the starter pack and i think the starter pack is oh i can't remember how many days treatment is in it
i can't remember if it's two weeks or four weeks let me just check
cos it's important when we've got you that we have a look at you we listen to your chest we check your blood pressure and we make sure there's no side effect
but this drug works in a very different way and it actually helps to take the strain off your heart er and it actually makes a huge difference
one eleven
we maybe actually go on like three weeks
but if i see you at towards the end of the and the packs are all labelled it's very
yeah
ah so you start off start on wednesday evening and then it's usually a daily dose and thursday you can UNK your water tablets once again one in the morning okay
does that make sense
so if that
wednesday night i take the tablets
yeah
wednesday night you start the starter pack
yeah
and he's got some different water tablets
yes
different water tablets yeah
and if you're okay overnight then you can carry on with the pack as directed on thursday morning
yeah
and you start your water tablets at the same time
yeah
mhm
okay
yeah
now you may find you actually get a slightly more out of breath over the next thirty six hours cos you haven't taken your water tablets
er i'm afraid we can't do anything about that
if you're going to start
this stuff you really need to ha the people off the water tablets before you start
yeah
er otherwise people's blood pressure does go UNK into their boots
mm
and you have trouble so we can't do that
er we'll play it safe
i can take i can take it easy
well he easy
he won't he you won't come to any harm stopping the water tablets for forty eight hours
and then hopefully you'll actually get a lot better
s you'll find there's a lot less strain on the heart you may find you can do more without getting short of breath
and even your wife should be happier
i know that she's worried that's the trouble
i am and
is there is some fluid on your lungs
she does
she does worry about it
and i and i think it's quite right to have you back and alter your treatment at this stage so
mm
er
and we'll sleep with this arm as well will we
that's right as far as the arm is concerned we've got to be cautious there
if we start waving a lot of anti
mm
UNK pain UNK we can actually give you we can actually make the fluid on the lungs worse
and i would recommend we just stick with something very basic to start off with like UNK two four times a day something so very simple like that
well actually what i've been i've been taking two before i go to bed at night
yeah that's fine
UNK
doesn't interfere with any of these
yeah
and it won't make any difference to your chest either
so i would actually do that but if you're having pain in the day i would treat that as well
mhm
and you may find treating the pain in the day means it's not so bad at night so you actually get more sleep anyway
it's not often it comes on during the day but now and again
yeah
it does
yeah
i it does and i've told you
now yesterday was
yeah i mean we've looked
was
at your arm and there's nothing
yeah
yes yeah
we'll see
so that's that
and
yeah
it makes it important i see you before you run out of these
yes
tablets
yes
okay which i think is
okay
going to be round about three weeks time
yeah
you'll have to count up
i can't it doesn't actually tell me how many days it is
yeah well we'll make the appointment when we've got the tablets and sorted it out
yeah the chemist may not have those in stock but they'll be able to get you for them within twenty four hours you're
yes
not starting them until tomorrow
oh
yes
very kind
oh he'll be able to get them in twenty four hours yes
oh aye yes know them very well
if he has any queries he can give me a ring but
i mean
yeah
know me very well
yeah
so
yeah
you're blood UNK okay
your heart sounds fine so add UNK and we'll have you on the starter pack
er start on that on a wednesday beware of first does
so just watch it after the first dose that evening if you g especially if you get out of bed to have a wee
and then UNK for your water tablet and that's to start on thursday and then review at end of pack
yeah
okay
yes
okay
and that should make a huge difference i hope
er and a even though most sometimes you're okay sometimes you're not
and there is some fluid on your lungs
aren't any of those in middle of the night like i use to
no we don't want those
no we don't want those
but if
i'm
we start this now then it'll prevent a lot of further problems
yeah
right then
good
okay and that's one of
okay
the reasons i think for doing it
erm thank you very
see you in a second

right
dr
now
cheerio now
come in
that's you finished now
i don't know if you want to mark up something in mr
i take it he was in at eight o'clock
i saw him at eight o'clock
aha
i wouldn't say he was in at eight o'clock
what can i do for you this morning
well i'm still getting myself in a UNK like i was when i came
right
but i didn't take those tablets i tried not to do
that's the low dose UNK
yeah whatever it is
yeah
and also i keep getting a pain in my arm just here it's a
mm
bit of a
right in there
as if i press it
yeah
and if i put any weight on it
aha
any idea what's brought that on
i don't really know i've had it for about three week
i keep trying one of those lamps
yeah
okay let's have a closer look at that arm
but it's er it's noting you know i can move it alright there's
yeah
no problem want to go
ah
are you UNK
no
just normal summer UNK
i'd thought you'd been getting exercise in
no just casual UNK this summer
it's too hot otherwise
it's hot enough as it is in this place
i've got three internal walls and the UNK about eighteen inches thick with a double UNK window
i mean there's you know what
what's it like up the fore arm
is that er
i it's alright but it seems if i if i press in there
yeah
somewhere
okay
you okay in this area here
yeah
no problems there
nothing at all
nothing on the
no
UNK of the elbow
you're okay there
now let me just is that okay
mm
okay just pull your hand in towards your face a bit
okay you haven't UNK the UNK
is that tender
not really no
in there
under there
no
so it is really is on and off cos there's nothing much there now is there
no
it's funny that isn't it
i don't know it's
okay
comes on and it
push out for me push that
to you
yeah
well that's okay when you do that
nothing
hmm feel a little bit nothing at the back
yeah
it seems if it's
okay
just hold my hand and turn as if you were turning a door handle
okay
and the other way
does that hurt there
no
er not sure what's causing that
but i mean it's
well yes i mean it's more likely to have been a muscle than anything else with pain that comes and goes
certainly won't be a bone that's causing it
but what's UNK the muscle in the first place is your guess is as good as mine cos it all works perfectly
now
is it stress related
well can make anything worse and will often make a lot of things carry on longer than they otherwise would normally
i don't think stress would cause this sort of pain but it'll certainly make it feel worse there's no doubt about that
what i'm think if i do get
yeah
a little bit up tight it
yeah
seems as if that
yeah
oh it'll make it worse
so i don't know but er
mm
how are you managing er things when you get up tight
well i'm doing things you know i'm not
yeah
so you're keeping yourself occupied
avoiding th i've never had i mean me i'm
but if you i mean if you do get very anxious what do you do
i just carry on
you just carry on
and it UNK off
mm
well that's probably a good a way of managing it as anything really
i mean i'm not the sort of person who can sit down and watch telly all day you know
i didn't think so
erm
er and you haven't been taking any of those UNK at all
i didn't take them because
no
i know
well
i tried to i probably made myself a bit of a nuisance when i came in last time but
no
as i told you before i'd been like it before and it
yeah
it's er
the advantage of those UNK is they're there if you need them
you've still got them there if you need them
er it's a very low dose if you just take them every now and again you'll have no problems with them at all
and if you do feel things are overwhelming you then they may just help to bring you down again
yeah
and that's what they're there for
sometimes just knowing you've got something else you can turn to is all you need cos you don't need
yeah
to take to anything
mm
you just know they're there
i mean i it's funny thing this i it's a thing what seems to creep up on you isn't it
yeah
yeah
it's very common
i really know i mean it it's not that i'm no where near like i was before i know because i was you know UNK treatment before but er
yeah
doc er dr colin he
yeah
would call men a silly bugger he did
i know him i know him well yeah
well he would say that yes
he's alright though i mean
oh yes he was a
not meant offensive or anything like that
yeah he were a great bloke
yeah
not taking UNK
well i th i UNK i suspect you will ma co continue to manage yourself
and i think for you that may be the best way of doing things
mm
and i've got
this one
yeah
ta
but this pain i'm not sure what that is i mean your arm seems to be in perfect working order so
er
keep an open mind on that
it'll probably go now i've had a look at it
like it does
this'll squeeze your arm a bit okay
still smoking
mm
drinking
no
UNK bad for you of course but i mean
you r you really think i ought to stop
be honest give me a real
well
professional
smoking will help stress but smoking is much more likely to cause serious physical problems than stress is
that's the catch
er and it it's UNK a hundred and sixty thousand people die a year of smoking related diseases
er i don't know how many people die of stress related diseases but it's probably under a hundredth
er and i think that puts it into context
overall your health would be a lot better off your cigarette
and if you find then things like stress and anxiety come through there are other ways of treating that and sorting that out
i can't think of any case where people are better off smoking than none smoking
really
what about a pipe
well pipes are better than cigarettes because you don't UNK so much
mm
fact if you don't UNK at all you're doing yourself a big favour but you nearly always get some down ion to the system and really the o the only thing i could UNK recommend as a doctor is stopping
difficult to be UNK safe this is safer than that you know
i mean the decision is yours and you may find you may wish to sort of take things very slowly and very gradually
mm
i'm not going to tell you to do anything that's not what i'm here for but er
well i mean er we have to take notice of you don't we
yeah
well no you don't actually i mean y you are free to ignore our advice and yeah i know that
yeah but i mean
but i mean that would be my advice as a doctor to stop smoking in the long term
mm
certainly
your blood UNK absolutely fine
impressive it's better than mine
bet you tell everybody
no it's true
it's true
mine is er it's not high but it's higher than i would like but er
so what am i going to do
just carry on
yes i think so
do you think i ought to take anything or
no i don't think you need to take anything at all
you've got the UNK if you need them
no i haven't got it
oh you haven't oh
oh you never got it
oh well the p oh yes well it's now seven months old that prescription so that that'll now be UNK so UNK in left arm
i don't know what this is whether it's something with work or
yeah
comes and goes y and sometimes
wait and see would be the right approach for that
cos it certainly isn't anything obviously serious so i think we'll just see how things go
yeah prescription
no not unless you want one
i think that's the answer to that one isn't it
you don't really want i'm certainly not going to give you something you don't want so
well let me put it to you like this i feel sometimes that i need something
yeah
to settle me down
yeah
er but sometimes i'm alright
right well what i could do is i could give you another prescription now that you can go and get if you feel you are going to need something
l let me let me do that
yeah
let me let me do that
and if it UNK
that's alright
yeah if it UNK like the last one that's okay just chuck it on the fire
i think what i'll do i'll er i'll get the prescription
okay
you can have one up to three times a day er you're never going to take that i'm sure
as required
yeah
okay
and i think what you'll find is you just need one you know perhaps even one every three or four months that's okay
it's just there to take the edge off things when it's not settling on it's own
and that is entirely the appropriate way to use these and they really can make a huge difference like that
okay thank you for your time
there you go
that's okay
nice to see you again
well it's nice to see you but i hate it's not personal but i
i know i know i know
i really do it
you don't like coming to doctors
cos it makes a fun funny UNK or UNK noise because it picks up the UNK through the table otherwise
now then pen and pencil would be a useful idea
now what did we do before
erm we've done time signatures compound time signatures
erm
yeah didn't we
UNK all that sort of stuff diminished augmented
we did some intervals
intervals
yes
right
now can you tell me about time signatures
what are the two types of time signatures
compound
mhm
and erm what's the other one
simple
simple
yeah
just ordinary simple and compound
and there's
simple and compound
yeah
UNK things like six nine six nine erm
nine twelve
yeah
that sort of stuff
at the top
that's the top number
erm
and compound is three four
tha that's comp that's compound
now compound is always six
oh
simple is just ordinary three beats a bar
yeah
four beats in a bar two beats in a bar
it's the UNK think of compound as being the one that's more difficult to think about
six eight times nine eight times
yeah
right
still leaves three two three or four beats in a bar but they're compound times
they're dotted beats
that's really all that compound means
it means dotted beats
erm what would twelve four
think about twelve four cos that's a compound time
it's got twelve at the top
erm it may help to look at it
cos you can't think about it straight away
think twelve and it'll be twelve what
dotted semi quavers
no
what does four stand for in an ordinary time signature
oh UNK
right so
so
if there are twelve of those
twelve UNK
one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
think of them in groups of threes and that gives you four dotted
quavers
no
semi quavers
you're going small
yes
and you've got to go the other way
oh yeah
it's erm
if there are tw if there are twelve UNK and each of those are in groups of three
dotted UNK
so you've got four dotted UNK
so twelve i mean if you can remember them twelve stands for four beats in a bar anyway
yeah
and if you just think what twelve UNK are going to be divided up into
mm
it's going to dotted UNK
cos you know it's going to be dotted something or other
and if you were to see er an extract of music for example here's a twelve eight one
this one actually tells you it's in twelve eight time
and it's asking you to put in the bar lines
where would you put those bar lines do you think
it would al i think it probably also asks you to group them properly
but just for the moment we won't worry about the grouping aspect
i think assume everything starts on the first beat of the bar as well
okay
it'll tell you if it doesn't
erm
eight stands for
quavers
right
one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
so obviously the first one would be there
and probably if it's going to be a whole one
one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
so in fact there are just two bars
now how would you actually group those notes
erm it'd be groups of three again wouldn't it
in groups of three
those UNK got to be grouped together
one two three four
er it'd be sort of half of that
half of the erm UNK
i don't know how you do that
can we go backwards
one two three four five
you can only do it if you miss out that
one two three
one two three
and that leaves you with a little bit
right
yes
it actually explains it
exactly what they want you to do
er where you've got a note that obviously goes over a beat as in that one there
yeah
you're going to have to write two quavers and tie them
is that what you said
yeah
it might have been what you said
so those two okay
that one will be joined to a UNK beat so that you'll have a group of three
and another UNK those two will be tied the join taking them onto the next group of three and so on
so basically you're splitting this in compound time
yes
so it it'd still sound
cos that actually looks as though it's the half way part of the bar too doesn't it
so and you don't actually go over the half
yeah
way part of the bar with one single note
if you've got a note it's got to be held
you actually split into two an and use a tie
if you're in two time or four time which you are
you're in four dotted UNK beats there aren't they
you will sometimes be asked to er look at something like that and then put the time signature in
these have got the time signature in but you're they're asking you to put in the bar lines and then grouping the notes properly
as in that one you've go you've got to alter what they actually put there
not going to alter the sound of it
the sound must still be the same but you've got to alter the notes for grouping purposes
that may happen in any of those
i wonder if they've got any here now that haven't got any time signatures because that's the other thing that they like to give you
down here
add time signatures
alright
let's see what you can make of first of all that one
and whether they're all compound they may not all be compound
some may be some may not
i don't know
find the simplest bar in each one
this one
looking through it that is the simplest one cos you can see
yes
at a glance there are two
it's all it's all
groups of three aren't there
yeah
so that's obviously going to be in compound time
what though
erm
fairly easy to put in a time signature
six twelve
six er now wait a minute
what's four is for UNK
eight is for quavers
double it again sixteen
six sixteen
it's gonna be sixteen
so six sixteen
and that actually means two dotted UNK two dotted quavers i mean doesn't it
cos each group adds up to a dotted UNK
mm
so it
yeah
as you've got here
that's right
in fact if anything which is the easiest way round of doing it
to be if you're asked to put in a time signature
it's not always so easy to group notes
i think people find that more difficult than actually saying what a time signature is
mhm
what about that one
erm
take the simplest bar
three quavers
so the time signature is
erm three eight
three eight
now
and it's grouped in a dotted UNK
yes it is
now is that compound or is that simple
three eight is simple
it's simple because it's just got three at the top
mm
it looks as if it ought to be with the compound ones but it's not
it's just an ordinary simple one
but it's UNK beats instead of UNK beats that's all
so that was a simple one that one was a compound one
we'll do one more
what about this one
is there an easy
no they're all virtually all exactly the same
erm
timing aren't they
they're not quite the same
two three four five six
yeah
six erm six four
yes
six four which is dotted
UNK
two dotted UNK
yes
two dotted UNK in a bar
that's one of them
and that in fact that's probably the simplest bar isn't it
because
mm
that's a group of three
much the same as a dotted UNK
erm simple or compound time then
it's
six
six four
four
that's simple
no compound
compound
two three four or five would be simple times
six twelve they sound more complicated
mm
so think of them as being compound
right
that way round then isn't so difficult
that i think you i think most people find it more difficult having to group the notes in the right in exactly the right way
so i think
this is actually a grade four one
we'll lead up gradually to grade five
yeah
i'm not going to go all the way back through grades two and three
you started on two i think
or you've got book two
we'll go we'll go from
i think
here
and anything that you find you don't know then we can perhaps go back on just the bits that you don't know
because you're not going to have to go back on many of the things
this book these books are quite good because they do give you a little bit of explanation
you've also got er other books or another book at home which you can refer to if you need any extra
erm it might be an idea to go back
you won't find you're going to take much time doing some of these
if you do exercise one for the time being don't worry about that one exercise three
shall i write it down
yes it would be a good idea wouldn't it
mm
do you want to write on the back of
it would be because you've already got some in here haven't you
i think i probably
yeah
actually i'll UNK i'll carry on
and the date today is the
the twenty eighth i think
ah the twenty eighth
it's the next thing on isn't it
so if you're looking in the grade four book put down page four exercise one
if you have a look at each one of those
rather than write them in the book just put the answers down either on a on a piece of paper
as long as you put clearly what it is you're putting in
then i can just use these books over and over again
it's a bit UNK writing in them
when it comes to exercise three that's on page five exercise three
when it says add bar lines it won it won't hurt you to actually write those out
because
okay
you really need to group the notes
well the notes are grouped but you're gonna add the
write it out because it's all good practice for
for you actually
at er writing out notes as well
so you can do exercise three
not that one for now because that's doing something different
now which are the ones that you've got to group
so far over here
right
page eight starts exercise six
in fact do all of those
do a through to f
and that's grouping notes plus the bar lines
the later ones are always quite hard
and they've given you they've actually given you not in this one but they do give you the UNK here
they've given you the UNK
did we look at those before
alto UNK and tenor UNK
er don't think so
have you come across those before
come across these
you've come across the treble and the bass right
and the bass not these alto or whatever
erm if just take just think of singers at the moment
UNK is the highest then an alto
UNK then an alto tenor bass
tenor and bass
UNK is the highest voice
then comes the alto
then the tenor and then the bass at the
oh right
so is
so
that's alto
so is that one up from
it's one down from
the treble
think of it as being the next lot down if you like
then there would be a tenor clef and then a bass clef
the only reason that you're using a different clef is that it's actually putting middle c in a different place
on the UNK
so that for example an alto doesn't need so many notes high notes but needs a few more lower notes
so if you just kept your treble clef you'd have a lot of lines possibly that you weren't using at all
and having to add a lot of low UNK line notes
that saves doing that
because they position middle c
middle c's actually UNK between those bits there so the middle line there becomes middle c
which means that you're unlikely to have to have quite so many UNK line notes
although this has got one or two
but not as many as you would have if you were using the treble clef because you'd probably end up with a lot of lower this is wha that isn't a particularly good example really because it hasn't given a lot of lower notes but normally you'd expect to see more notes down on these lines
UNK wouldn't go down that far
a UNK would only go down to about erm oh about what
middle c is probably a bit too low for most UNK
but an alto would go a lot lower would go down probably to an f or a g
so that these notes would be low
if that's middle c you can te what would the bottom line actually be
bottom line
that's c
er it would
it's here
er g
c a f you're right yes
erm so that in fact a true alto would be using most of the notes there
and just a few UNK lines above
unlikely to be using whereas if they were using the treble clef for most of the time
f g
yes
and then the other one the tenor clef
have they given you a tenor clef
no
they'll give you a tenor clef a little bit further on
they may not actually put the tenor clef in till grade five now i come to think about that
but there's no point in
not learning it
about it now because it's just as easy really
tenor clef looks exactly the same but middle c is now there
next line up in fact
so because a tenor UNK a little bit lower you've got more of the lower notes and fewer of the higher notes before you need to add start adding UNK line notes
sometimes of course you'll they'll still need UNK line notes up there
and perhaps one down there but not very likely
so it's just to make it much more comfortable to look at
just means you have to get used to thinking right if that's if that's er a tenor clef then that note won't be it would be an a in a bass clef and f in a treble clef
what will it be for that clef
in this erm oh
going downwards going backwards is more difficult isn't it
yeah
much easier working upwards from c
that UNK c
so that line
c
would be
c a f d
er c a e you go one below it
oh yeah
you know f is next in fact c yes
that's a that's f that would be d so it's between the two which is an e
and if you were going above of course that note would be
e
e and remember that it's the e just above middle c
and that's the e
does the middle c
always come up on a line
well it's yes it does in fact
mm
i hadn't actually thought of that before
but yes it does seem to
i suppose UNK theoretically you could actually move middle c to wherever you wanted to have it
but generally speaking they us they use just the four UNK
now certain instruments use the alto clef
just a minute
hello
oh hello
alright
right i'll fetch him i'll fetch him
yes he's here
oh somewhere he is
he's jus just UNK he's just upstairs so i shan't be a moment i'll go and call him
gosh she's going to have fun with this tape
go on out you go
right yes
so middle c then can be almost anywhere
yeah
what instrument do you know about do you think that uses something other than the treble clef and a bass clef
or have you come across the one that
erm instrument that i know
well that you might know
it's not actually a UNK one but it's er in fact i don't i think most of the UNK ones tend to use a bass clef don't they
yeah
if you see one at all
yeah or erm UNK and UNK and those
except they use treble and bass
they use the treble don't they
yes
er bass or whatever
yeah
UNK
yes it's a treble
and a UNK
just i've got one of those nice little
yes
it's just like a small sort of piano
doesn't have a very long
key keyboard
it doesn't i don't think
quite an
it's a piano and it's
odd range
it's very high
because in fact although it's written from there all the way up to there erm that is it starts at the c above middle c and goes up
yeah
to very high the unfortunate thing
UNK
i think that's played on the bass what would be on the piano an a
yes
it they
use UNK certain lines don't they
they use yeah erm
so that you get to know what is
i think it's er
what is what
a is the bass UNK
yeah
er
i think it's g they use as the high hat and there's all sorts of things
yeah
i don't thing they one thing they don't give in this book is a complete score
yeah
which oh do they
no they don't
no
which of course i'll ask yeah i've got plenty of those sort
mm
of things anyway
you have to know an awful lot you know for grade five
you you've gotta have quite a wide knowledge
you don't have to need to know anything in depth but you've got to know
but you've got to know shallow a wider range
yes that's right which means in a way that you've got to know quite a lot
there's erm an alto no yes an alto clef isn't it
for UNK no it's not it's for yes it's for one of the UNK isn't it
UNK
oh i erm found out what that brass instrument we couldn't think of
what was it
UNK
UNK yes
you're erm isn't it silly
mm
i've
because you see i could see wh exactly what you were talking about in my mind
mm
but i could not think of its name
yeah
i got into the car and i was still erm thinking all about this
it's yeah
and my mother said straight away oh you're thinking of a UNK
yeah
that's the one
yes
it's so silly isn't it when er you know that you knew it all the time
now then
the one i'm looking for is what have i got to the UNK yet
no i haven't got back to the UNK
these just use the bass or the treble clef
and when you get back to the there we are
the UNK
it's the UNK that we're actually looking for
sort of bass UNK
sort of bass UNK yes
there we are
that's the one that uses it
so that you see even in a score it would be written like that
so that's the only instrument that you generally see actually see using it in most schools
unless you're going into some of the tenor erm and alto
good evening
are we ready
can i say two minutes for what i think might happen and where we've derived some of the authority from
then maybe we could introduce ourselves seeing as there's some folk here who haven't met everybody before
and after that er we shall be taking the running order which is then a sketch next which is not cast yet
because we didn't know who was coming and who wasn't
but i'm sure we'll man we'll manage that okay
the there's five organizations which justice and peace comes across quite a lot
these are UNK christian aid oxfam traidcraft and world development movement
comes a comes across some others as well but it comes across these five very frequently
and at the moment all five of them have joined together on a single campaign which is about trade
this UNK action is pretty unusual
so i was wanting to mention why it looks like it's happened just now
an erm i'm looking at a christian aid produced brochure called trade for change which is the name of christian UNK campaign
e each of the organizations has got th s slightly different version o of the same campaign
the front cover says how would you feel if you were working just as hard today as ten years ago but earning a third less
and it says that's what's happening to the poorest communities the poorest countries in the third world
and wh why that's happening is really what we're going to be spending the evening on and it's related to international trade
historically poor countries were introduced to international trade by rich ones like ours because they were introduced as UNK
their role was to pro to provide raw materials to countries like britain and france UNK
and they were also markets for manufactured goods
goods we cou which were manufactured in our countries
now the UNK era has gone at least in name but things haven't changed
the poorest countries still produce the raw materials
but the rich countries ourselves do the rest
they provide the shipping the processing and the selling
the processing is done over here by and large which is where the profit is and in the selling
and sometimes it's all done by the same company
and when we get onto coffee that's will come alive
anyway this is all heavy stuff
so we were going to have a sketch
what about then
oh i'm sorry dear
cos i've put it up
yes
i know
but we haven't introduced each other have we
no
the UNK been
so i i'll move back a bit
having said we would introduce ourselves perhaps we should
if i start with me
i'm called charlie
i'm married to moira over there
and we're two of the people in york erm who work for traidcraft
there are o others as well
we're involved in some other organizations as well would you mind s going next
yes
erm my name is richard
UNK husband
margaret
are we really supposed to say something about ourselves as well is it
if you wish
well i'm rachel
i'm sheila and i'm
i'm theresa but i'm not any relation to sheila
i'm UNK
and i'm UNK
missionary
and
i'm UNK and i attend the UNK meeting here
only just moved to york so i haven't erm kind of got affiliation with anything
i'm denise and i come here occasionally
i'm mary and i usually come to the meetings
erm my name's derek and i'm UNK the meeting as most of you know so far
erm
i'm UNK and this is the first time i've come to one of these meetings
i'm living and working in derbyshire and just back in york for the school holidays
anne
erm i'm part of the justice and peace group
margaret
sister
i'm david
david
i'm history
i'm moira and i'm a friend of david's
i'm a friend of a friend
right we're going to have a sketch now
which hopefully will work out okay
there is a script but erm we haven't cast the players except anne who's going to play UNK
anne said she worked in a factory at one time
i was a student
UNK factory
so the it says it's a short story
it's called just links in a chain
it's produced by christian aid and it's part of its christian aid week's activity
it's about the experiences of a cocoa worker in north east of brazil and a chocolate factory worker in birmingham
these roles two people the cocoa UNK called UNK the chocolate factory worker is UNK
it says they're based on actual interviews with the women involved and that some additional parts have been written to show how they are in fact involved in a global chain
producing chocolate
now some people have already been passed these by me while they were still getting ourselves together
if they had time to have had a look er if someone could take the part of UNK
would that be helpful
and after that we have a man called UNK who i presume is a man anyway it looks like a man's name
would that be okay for you david
yeah
then there's a man called joe
richard
and probably a man called UNK
if that's a man's name
and would anyone who's got a paper already like to take the part of UNK
denise
and carol
yes i if everyone has read the final paragraph who's involved before we begin
the final paragraph on
erm i erm on the first page i'm sorry
thank you
is that yesterday's now
hello i'm UNK
it's eleven a m here in the cocoa UNK of UNK in north east brazil and it's already ninety degrees in the shade
oh
what am i supposed to do
yeah
i see right
i'm sorry
what are we supposed to do
i should go back into the chair
i'm UNK
it's two p m here and i'm in the UNK chocolate factory in birmingham concentrating on the next batch of UNK
it's freezing cold about ninety degrees in the open but i'm glad of the rain for the garden
my job is to slice open the tough cocoa UNK with a sharp knife and UNK out the beans
i need my four oldest children to help
we UNK on the ground eating our lunch as we go and work as fast as we can for eleven hours every day
the beans are dried and UNK all over the world we don't know where
we are just links in a chain
i've worked here in the factory for twenty three years
my father worked here and my brothers work here now
as a result of my union work i've come to understand how i am linked to a chain too
even when we all work it is difficult to earn even the minimum wage for one which is about nine pounds a month
it's not enough to feed the family
what's more my husband is ill and i can't afford to buy his medicine
i'm angry
i need a living wage
a few years ago members of our union who were UNK cocoa beans when they arrived in the u k began getting sick
we had no idea why and took the matter up
we were angry as well
around that time we heard about a network which could link us up to other cocoa workers around the world
we became a link and joined the chain
i'm UNK a member of the network
it's called the UNK information exchange or t i e for short
our office is in holland
we told UNK about UNK and her friends in brazil because we were links and had joined the chocolate chain
when UNK told us about UNK contacts in brazil we wrote to them
UNK letter told us about the UNK sickness
we discovered that it was because of the pills put between the cocoa UNK to kill UNK
the pills were highly poisonous
we protested
we protested
when we heard about the problem from UNK we protested
i'm joe a member of the cocoa workers' union in UNK
we were worried about the poisonous pills too
we became the we became a link and joined the chain
i'm UNK a cocoa worker in UNK
when we learned of the UNK sickness we protested became a link and joined the chain
as a result the cocoa UNK cut down the use of the toxic pills
in nineteen eighty nine two hundred cocoa workers in UNK were threatened with the sack
some said it was because we had UNK too many beans but it was because our union was getting stronger
we protested
we protested
we protested
we protested
and we protested writing letters to everyone we could think of
to the company the union even the president
our employers took notice of the letters
they learnt of the links who had but they learnt of the links who had joined the chain
they backed down
our jobs were saved
then the next year we heard from england that one of our friends at the chocolate factory was facing dismissal
we protested
we protested
we protested
we protested
and we protested
when we heard about when we heard about the UNK that had come in from all around the world
the company was UNK
they learned of the links that had joined the chain
i was UNK
now we are all links in a stronger chain
when we hear of problems facing chocolate workers anywhere we take action remembering how links in the chain have helped us
all this talk of chocolate is making me feel hungry and chocolate is my special passion
i'll be a link and join the chain
this week is christian aid week and we must ensure that people earn a fair return for their labour
i'll be a link and join the chain too
for us life before death means
sufficient food for my children
a living wage
healthy working conditions
medicine for my husband
the freedom to join a union
enjoying a bar of chocolate without UNK others
secure jobs for all
the chance to work together in search of a fair deal for all
why not join us
become a link and join the chain
thank you everyone
this is from a christian aid week publication called god of the fair measure which is UNK from christian aid if people want
there's an order form on the back of this photocopy
and that's free
right
next bit information and figures wh erm we erm it's a bit of a background as to what world trade is and how big it is
erm i'd like to start by saying we are all links in a chain we are all consumers
we're all part of the world trade system
we all eat and drink things every day that have come from overseas third world countries
unless we're extremely green i suppose there's some people who don't
er i think probably all of us here today have eaten something or drunk something that's wasn't grown in this country
erm i was looking through some of the books for some of the UNK figures and things that happen in world trade
one of the things that came across was that the average sixteen year old leaving school this year in the u k will spend a million pounds in their lifetime
they will all have enormous consumer power
and how they choose to spend it can affect things that happen in the world
there's a couple of UNK pages from christian aid book raw deal trade and the world's poor which came out last year
i think as the first part of their trade campaign
erm this one here is about how very large companies control an enormous part of the world trade
UNK which is wheat UNK corn
five companies control seventy seven percent of the trade
bananas three companies control eighty percent of world trade
cocoa another three companies control eighty three percent of the world trade
tea is eighty five percent by three companies
and tobacco is eighty seven percent by four companies
and some of these companies are in such as er nestle appear in cocoa and they also appear as very big players in other commodities
nestle are the biggest UNK traders in the world trade for cocoa milk and coffee
and after oil coffee is the biggest UNK single product in world trade
and nestle control eleven percent of that world trade
they're the biggest single company
and er a couple of quotes from nestle
they had a report in nineteen seventy six called nestle in developing countries where they said the volume of our purchases of cocoa and coffee is so vast that it influences the market of those commodities
they actually said then that they UNK that they had an influence on how on the cost and where they bought it from
but when new consumer was writing this book global consumer a couple of years ago they sent a questionnaire to nestle
and erm the reply was is the new consumer seriously suggesting that nestle pay in excess of market prices
so they er they agree that they have an influence on market prices but they won't are not prepared to pay any more than they have to
allied UNK who is also a major part of the british coffee trade replied to the global consumer that the fairness of trading was the responsibility of governments and gatt it'd got nothing to do with them
they only buy things they're only part of the trading system but how fair that is has nothing to do with them
can i do you want figures on commodities i think quite a lot of us are aware that coffee prices have gone down in the last ten years
certainly as far as we're concerned at traidcraft when we started eight years ago a packet of coffee was two pound twenty five
it's now one pound sixty
and traidcraft have tried to keep the price up to people
the world price has gone down below that
in brazil there are all sorts of commodities whose price has gone down over the last ten years
a kilo of in brazil now brings in a fifth of what it did in eighty nineteen eighty three
and in UNK one pound of coffee beans is actually a quarter of what it was in nineteen seventy seven
and g to go back to brazil and the coffee workers there the mo minimum statutory monthly wage for a cocoa UNK worker in brazil is nine pounds for the month
many people don't earn that anyway
and it cost sixty pence in this country to buy a small bar of chocolate
but the workers have only been paid nine pounds for the month
united kingdom UNK trade is worth two point six billion pounds billion and two years ago a figure that really astonished me when i saw it was that the total of all money that was given to development charities in the united kingdom including UNK christian aid and oxfam was equal to what britain spent on one product made in york and that's UNK
pound for pound it's the same
money given by who to
everyone to oxfam christ the total income of oxfam christian aid save the children UNK was the same as what we spent on one product
do you know what the product was
UNK
which really brought it home that it was you know
another thing i found out today was do we know where our m main supplier of our coffee is
any UNK
which country
mm
which country is er the biggest single supplier of coffee to this country
kenya
UNK
brazil
it's UNK
UNK
it relies on its coffee for ninety seven percent of its exports
terribly dependent on coffee
another thing that surprised me more than anything was our main supplier of tea which we get over half our tea from now is kenya
and the amount of it we get from india and sri UNK ha has gone down quite a lot
do they send to somebody else or is their total production down
part of it as far as i could see was in india that i india UNK actually got it's quite a success story for development in a lot of ways
and as people in india have got UNK they're just drinking more tea
there's a huge domestic market for tea in india
sri UNK part of the trouble is the civil war
but also there's a the soviet union used to grow a lot of its own tea but it grew it round chernobyl and it had to start UNK a lot of tea
the soviet union's a big oh ex soviet union now was a big UNK of tea so you
i thought UNK was their main tea area
there's a apparently a lot of it has been affected by UNK not that far away is it
well it's a fair distance yes
th that's what th the books are saying that it's that production of tea in the soviet union has gone down
would it have been affected by UNK from chernobyl
i have no idea how i it went around a up in the northern UNK over UNK and UNK in the south so you'd have think it'd have been weak by the time it got down i'm not a scientist i have no idea what
maybe they're more UNK cautious than we have been in this country about the effect of chernobyl
erm of the total of goods that are sold in UNK countries such as that have been manufactured only three percent of them are made in developing countries
which comes on really to the second thing
we in the north and in the e c in particular have a policy of encouraging or UNK third world countries from doing anything to the commodities at all apart from exporting them raw as far as possible
and we do that by UNK
into the e c raw coffee has an import UNK of nine percent
but if it's an extract or instant coffee made into instant coffee the UNK is double it's eighteen percent on it
for cocoa beans it's three per cent for cocoa beans that we were talking about in the in the sketch
by the time it's become cocoa powder or chocolate it's sixteen percent UNK on it
and dried fruit tropical fruit eight percent when it's fresh or dry but if people if third world countries prepare it into fruit UNK then it's twenty three percent UNK that they put on it
ninety s percent of the coffee that er is drunk in the u k is instant coffee
which is the most processed form of coffee you can get
and erm forty percent of that is one coffee
or UNK
and another sixteen percent is the other ne nestle coffee erm UNK thirty seven which i used to drink a long time ago and others and twenty two percent is er
maxwell
maxwell house which has become the other local brand now seeing as how maxwell house is owned by UNK and UNK now own terry's
when you start looking at fair trade we always say that traidcraft is a fair trade company
when people ask us in the street what it is
and normally the short cut to tell people fair trade company and it tries to give pay people a fair price for what they've made
but fair trade as we saw from that sketch involves a lot more than just fair wages
and for the next part we're going to divide hopefully into groups and what i'd like you to consider is when you're thinking about buying a product what questions you ask
that you know if it's been traded fairly
i think we've all got used to with some products at least asking questions about how green it is whether it's recycled paper whether it's going to destroy the UNK layer as well as asking questions like what price is it but if we're going to decide whether one jar of coffee is fair traded as opposed to another one what questions do we need to kn know the answers to decide that
so if we could get into groups of maybe about four
and perhaps come up with four or five answers four or five questions not answers
that erm you think you might need to ask to find out
how long have we got to
erm about ten minutes
piece of paper
yes but that wouldn't tell us would it
would it tell us
would it
what questions do you think we need to know
and you want to know whether it would be more expensive
mhm
yes ah
no it's the questions are what questions do you need to know the answer to when finding if something was fairly traded
not when you were buying it
well it might if it was more expensive but i mean it might just be more expensive anyway
i say has it got the fair trade mark on it
the fair trade mark like erm a UNK mark
i didn't even know there was one
i think there's going to be i don't know whether there is so i sh i should ask fair trade mark
where the money goes
i mean don't know wh how to word that
i mean i've always been
i never bought things from south africa for many years because of what was happening in south africa
er
there's so many people in between i
i'm putting your question down is it a lot more expensive than it would be in the in the UNK country which is what you said really isn't it
if we know the answer to it
er
i'd want to know how much the people who are working on it at all stages are paid if they're paid a living wage
mm
and i would want to know what the health effects were on them of the conditions in which they had to work
there was something happened to nestle with regarding erm the mothers and the milk in africa i'm not quite sure what it was
i think nestle have had to change their policy because they were selling it and advertising it and it was obviously doing harm to the children
i mean nestle had to abandon that
mhm
yes
yes that's not quite the same thing as fairly traded though
well it is in a way because it affects involves the person's health so it's important
but those that was the consumer wasn't it
it was i think because the powder was er pushed by the er company in third world hospitals and when the mothers went out they hadn't got safe water to mix it with
it's not quite what UNK asking
no so therefore i don't want to buy nestle because of that
yeah but i think that's something different isn't it to fair trading
er i think you know
what is what concerns fair trade you know you've got to think
denise said she wouldn't buy erm the UNK because of the baby milk you see so i thought that was slightly a different topic t er to the one we were asking about fair trade
well yes i suppose one of the questions you could ask is there a UNK against the company
right
but yeah i think that'll do because the UNK is because of their unfair trading
i mean i would never buy it but i would try not to buy anything
and they went and bought it in brazil instead imported from brazil where people are working for nothing
i mean i am not that involved with this but i've been following that
it's difficult to know which country the cocoa comes from because you don't know where they buy it
they buy it from one country one time another country another time
they used to buy from UNK a lot and er at one time they stopped it and this very nearly brought down UNK economy right down
that was about twenty years ago almost twenty years ago so where they buy it now i don't know
one just doesn't know
what was that last question
where do they buy their cocoa
so shall i put where is the r where is the raw material from
cos it's not just cocoa is it all sorts of things erm
they change from one country to another and that lets some countries down on their economy
they've been doing that for a they take it from and they put it in cheap labour
the whole thing is it's
they moved the UNK factory from france to
yes
britain because they get cheaper labour
britain's become a third world country
well it is almost a third world country actually
in some respects
only for some
are they still enough
no we've done very well
i know
we've done very well cos there's four we've got five questions and we were only asked for four
so we've got a spare one
so i'll just read them out
has it got a fair trade mark
is it a lot more expensive than it would be in the UNK country
i put in brackets middle men
and what do they do with the money as well i'd like to know
do they buy arms and things like this er
erm what are the health risks to producers or UNK
is there a UNK against the product
er where do the raw materials for the product come from
ch cheap labour in certain countries
interesting to hear about india about tea because er my daughter is working in india quite a lot and it is very high poverty for people
so you know some of the tea some of the workers population is working in india
i mean the poverty is greater than in africa or anywhere ah in the world
you know
well it's er the same idea as UNK that some of the people are going to become very wealthy
and the others are going to be the same rather less
any more ideas
did you put down
i'd go along with most of those
it's really a question of finding out where the material is coming from and knowing what the conditions are like there
mm
it's really a question of knowing where the raw materials are coming from where the product comes from and what the conditions are like there but of course it's all very well saying it's a question of what but er how many people involved are going to know that
if you go into a shop there aren't very many shops besides somewhere like traidcraft who will know so
o only for fruit really
UNK about the only thing you can ask which country
some things they're obliged to tell you where those come from aren't they
yes
yes at the moment another time i wasn't going to buy anything from UNK and er i was asking the young man who was is this from UNK oh i don't want them
he said i don't buy them either
tell management
but the green consumer UNK guide i have two daughters buying them for christmas presents for friends when they came out so that people should be very aware of what
i have thought of a question
good
erm because as moira said that UNK is erm now what was she saying what was she saying UNK is the same as
craft
traidcraft
no
maxwell
maxwell house
maxwell house is UNK
oh yes they're owned by UNK yes
which is terry's isn't it
so erm is the company erm part of er a bigger company
part of a UNK
under these new european trade regulations they seem not to tell where the things UNK
now got to trying to decide is that made in england or was it made in germany or
put in brackets terry's equals er maxwell house or UNK
oh well we've got six so that's quite how have you come to join us tonight
what how did you
i saw charlie at church on good friday
oh
how did you come to know about the group
it was er advertised in the er it's advertised in the paper and when i saw it there well i er recordings from as many places as possible and it's an ideal opportunity
could we come back into the group now
i'm an ex student
right can we
we came upon the idea of asking this question as the result of going to a for change conference
the reason i went last year it was birmingham may
and one of the workshops i went to was by someone called richard
and he's involved in launching the fair trade mark of which a little bit more later
he wrote this book he started traidcraft off he was the person who was i his UNK he was the driving force behind it for a long time
then he went on to the global the new consumer looking at ways and how consumer power could be used for ethical purposes
er and the global consumer was one of the fruits of that
his others are shopping for a better world and a few other books that were produced
is it richard
not richard who wrote UNK down
UNK down no
altogether
that was his brother
he's probably coming up to about forty six now but he was quite young when he started off with traidcraft and everything
and he asked us to er at that time in may they were looking at what criteria they were going to judge products to award a fair trade mark to them
and he asked us in a group to suggest some things that we might think of as being important
and he had a list which i've got there and er i think he got two things suggested that were on his list from the group of people who were supposed to be aware and er about twenty things which he thought maybe they should have thought about and hadn't
our first question is has it got the fair trade mark
mm
right i'll put that up
and the UNK be no cos nothing has at the moment
now we know why we haven't seen it
mm yeah
yes
could something be done about fair trade
what's the name of the company
and with that goes who owns the company as well i think
mm
mm
for instance we buy UNK and that's owned by nestle
really who owns things
UNK as well
nestle have actually started putting their labels on the pro the company on quite a lot and the logo on
but not everything has it
we discovered UNK water last week
we don't buy nestle now at all
UNK
yes
erm we'd want to know erm how the crop was produced
erm whether it was you know produced on a UNK
or
small farmers and what producing it would represent
er grown as a cash crop or er or erm
we were thinking about coffee at the time in particular and quite a few of the people wanted to know that
you want to write
eh
you want to write
no
er oh erm oh right oh
er well right back here again i think er
yeah
erm how many middle persons it might have passed through
mary
erm is there a UNK against the product in force
such as the one against erm n now nestle then erm baby milk thing
erm what is the price
is it being charged enough for it you mean
the opposite
so it's fair trade
you wouldn't have got want it honest thing
if it is an important consideration of the price tells whether people buy it fairly or not but you know if the price is very high then
even though we know that comparatively we're all UNK
mhm
yeah
erm we would like to know whether the UNK been produced UNK say UNK
erm or at least UNK without UNK chemicals
for example i can remember erm hearing that erm spanish some spanish UNK orange UNK who grow their oranges under UNK er were getting very depressed because of the erm chemicals they were UNK on them had a harmful effect on their nervous systems
er this is sort of thing we you know might want to know
erm the amount of packaging
very UNK i would imagine with the
mm
yes
the packaging they use is illegal
you know that could be linked to how clean it's been grown
environmental
mm
why have there been
we've er we've got two th already put together
erm what's the obvious appearance of the product and i and what's the contents of the product like UNK and things
we particularly mentioned UNK
mm
do the workers have any erm powers of negotiation over the price paid and what they're going to be paid
wages
what were you saying about packaging
well yeah well it's just very UNK
it's just so UNK right
whether it's unnecessary packaging
you would think it'd be more UNK
i could see that would be more green but i just didn't know how it was more fair
well it just sort of
it would indicate more middle people for one thing
yeah there'd be
yeah
likely that
more processed
you know
part of the price of the packaging would be taken off the wages
somebody might be paid then to do packaging
one packaging is important
mm
we were influenced by media coverage
have there had been any stories in the media or er television programmes
for example er
what were the sausages
there was a lot of erm UNK after a world in act was it a world in action on tea estates in india and sri UNK
and er that was quite a few years ago about the conditions and on tea estates and er that was partly why we switched mostly to UNK tea i think after that
there must have been something
i can't remember exactly what it was but there was i've got a very strong memory of
there was a there was a big campaign against UNK bond because of their conditions and
and they're supposed to have improved a lot through pressure
someone
yeah
jean
erm well we'd got something on trying to ascertain if things had been produced by a UNK which i suppose ties in with probably with three down
yeah
why would you say something wouldn't be fairly traded
well if i could see that
the european association of fair trade companies they're getting towards it
mm
well
we also thought perhaps erm looking at things like workers' UNK as well
workers' right to negotiate in UNK mm
any more
i also think on er sort of workers' rights i mean if you know the person that's made it like a local butcher i would trust more to make i would trust more than
mhm
you're in a better position to ask the questions if you know who's actually made the aren't you
yeah
yeah
mm
so there's no question
they can better
ah
that would identify the UNK or the manufacturer
right
erm there's a couple of examples from two statements of fair trade
one is UNK purchasing policy which is slightly different to how it decides whether it's going to buy from a particular group people who're producing something
this is some of the questions it asks them
when somebody approaches traidcraft to sell their products for them they get a detailed four page i think questionnaire to fill in about the company and how they run and what they do
and the five main points that are covered is whether it's organized for the benefit of its members which partly comes into that but it goes a bit beyond that i think
the workers' rights
not just the right to negotiate but to but the organization should actually be organized to benefit the people who are part of it
are they concerned for the personal welfare of individual producers
which i suppose is in
does it pay wages and provide working conditions which are or above the average of its locality
i think we haven't got here that fair wages
whether people have actually been paid a fair wage for what they've made
mhm
yeah
well record of country of origin i think that definitely
mhm
and workers' rights
i mean it's practically impossible to know that
yes but we definitely talked about that
just by looking at the product
yes
but that is part of the question that they need to know the answers
i mean what is the wage policy for that country
i know india has got a wage minimum for the tea workers now
and tea estates in india have now got to be owned by indians or by the indian government
it's for making products which are now or are potentially viable UNK
that is something to do with traidcraft that they erm they quite often work with groups who have been set up by UNK from europe
so they've actually got to be making something that's that can be sold or can be sold in the near future if they
and it must pay no more than a reasonable service fee to agents
middle persons
oh yes
if they are involved at all
and sometimes it's quite difficult i think to get away from middle persons because that is it's part of the structure of the c the country you're dealing with and so to cut down on exploitation from the mi but as to how far you can actually impose your culture as well
there's a fair trade mark
this was set up by the fair trade foundation which you were asking about
and it was set up by UNK christian aid the new consumer oxfam traidcraft exchange which is the charity side of traidcraft and the world development movement
and it was to look at basic supermarket products really that are UNK from the third world and to try and have a standard that you could say yes that's been traded fairly
and the idea is that points will be awarded th for which they will pay a licence fee
and they will actually be looked at quite closely will individual products
and it won't be for the whole of a c of a company's range it'll just be for one specific product at a time
so i know when the ne the negotiations were originally going on was with UNK coffee for one of their UNK which came from a particular known estate not for the whole range of UNK
and er they set out this basic charter of the things that they thought erm were important to fair trade
and part of that is them buying from responsible producers or suppliers which is looking at the record of the company
whether there's a UNK against them
have we had that
yes
oh
erm whether there's fair wages are paid as part of the and the conditions of employment including the right to organize
that's something that erm a great many of the UNK will er try to get round very er and the other thing they'll have to pay fair price which reflects the cost of production and the quality of the product plus a margin for investment and development
er this was partly because some products multi er go through from plant to supermarket shelf with one company such as bananas quite often are produced on a company's UNK
and they grow the bananas export them and wholesale them in this country
other products are bought on the UNK like to a large extent tea cocoa and a few other things like UNK buying cocoa from UNK but now they seem to buy it anywhere that they can get it cheaply
and erm so if they're buying it on the on the market th the company should pay a fair price for what they've bought
there's also providing financial credit where necessary to protect the UNK against production UNK and financial exploitation
if you plant a crop it's quite a long time before it
it comes to UNK
if you plant coffee it's about five years before you can harvest any coffee
and erm for a small coffee UNK i it's quite vital that they have some financial credit
and to be a fair traded product the charter says that erm the company who are selling the products should have an input at that level
there's another one that we haven't got as well
which equal rewards for men and women
mm
encouraging them
one of the things we didn't mention deliberately which i know richard said they had a long debate about was child labour
and they deliberately haven't said that it shouldn't be produced by child labour
which is recognizing that children play a vital r role in a lot of UNK in a lot of families
and perhaps only at certain times of the year especially in agricultural communities
but erm they haven't put a UNK on about them
the other one identifying and encouraging environmentally UNK sustainable production which is how it's being
how's it been grown
what were the farming methods
and establishing stable trading relationships on the basis of quality continuity mutual support
for what for anyone who is a small UNK or even a medium sized basic produced UNK having a stable market is extremely important
to know that there's someone going to buy your crop over a long period of time or part of your crop ideally over a long period of time does help people to plan ahead
and that's everything really
just there'll now be a short reflection
is that what time is it please
quarter to nine
expecting there would be lots of talk about economics i was wanting to talk about morality which are nearer to the gospel
traidcraft itself describes its activities as bringing love and justice into international trade
i think that's the words traidcraft uses
which is recognizing that it's not there to start with
er the first letter of john chapter four
my dear friends let us love one another
all love comes from god
if love is the character of god laid down through the gospel
it's older translation it's translated as charity in the prayer book which gives the idea of giving immediate assistance to me not a theoretical future when we're talking about trade but an immediate
and charity does seem to be relevant when we're hearing that people now in our own time are really in a an awful state in parts of the world
but if the reason this has occurred is because of a poverty amongst rich countries rich people which is causing poverty amongst poor people which is material
maybe this rich people's poverty is a moral poverty
when we think of love when we try to do something about it the word that comes into mind then is justice
that takes on from charity
but it's not really us in britain who are saying this people in britain are saying this anyway
in brazil the archbishop now in his late eighties i should think was UNK everywhere said that there's a quote here from him on the traidcraft leaflet
if the UNK countries east and west europe and the u s are willing to pay fair prices to the developing countries for their natural resources they can keep their aid and relief plans
so whereas aid at present is vital cos there's people starving to actually put the situation right i it's not a question of aid at all not a question of relief
it's because the situation is
a person called UNK who was another man from another part of the world a man from brazil along with and who are two sisters two UNK i mean have UNK the world promoting base christian communities
when i heard him speak he had a lot to say about this
a lot to say about UNK
we don't talk about UNK very much in britain
he's saying that the material of the west is an UNK
and we cause the UNK and poverty we as the west not necessarily as individuals because we insist on a lifestyle that UNK things and in doing that er we've UNK god
there's another book here which is th the book we've had the most difficulty in selling
i don't think we've ever sold a copy of this one
it's called the road to UNK and conversion and it's a document signed by christians from all sorts of countries they all agree with the contents of this
clause forty nine UNK
UNK is a sin of UNK or being UNK to someone or something which is not god
treating some created thing as if it were god
it seems people in other countries can see ourselves much better than we are
and it's more than that mainly because the people in africa and UNK and latin america particularly a are being UNK to the UNK
generation after generation really but the pace is UNK
with the fall of the world UNK prices really
i've only UNK up to this in the later part of my life but even then it's difficult to put it all together but er these three of them had it more UNK than i could
about a fortnight ago the a UNK bishop another person from brazil came to speak in york
he was secretary of the UNK conference so he had clearly been in a position like UNK this bloke to test the feeling of people in a wide area
himself travelled throughout his country
i this was bishop 's that was the man's name second visit to britain
in discussion he said he'd been here once before and he'd gone to visit the government
and the minister asked him what is the UNK attitude towards third world debts
bishop said it's a moral it's a moral problem
the minister said no it isn't it's an economic problem
he was very UNK about that th there was no more to be said really
as ou our western societies morality is an individual one
there's a traidcraft leaflet here which is a bible study and has some discussion mo morality
our individual morality is particularly a section on morality and that's what concerns us
we don't think of the collective morality the collective responsibility in our society for other people's distress
and that's all the heavy stuff
in the words of the easter gospel according to john when that other UNK went into the UNK after peter he saw and believed
and it's the same for us also
i think we can overcome it in the immediate sense
that fair trading will make an immediate impact in a small way because of the reasons we're discussing
and i its actual direct consequence it's not a theoretical thing
that we're really talking about the re the UNK of god and how in fact god's plan is not in operation with people starving and people having not a future they c they can anticipate
th i think the fair trading idea is in two ways
in the immediate it's actually a sign of it a UNK of the kingdom of god breaking out
and at the same time it's the achievement of it it's how i how it will come everywhere
because it's an idea of solidarity
lastly i'd like to go back to UNK again
the team when i met them had some UNK made by base christian communities in all parts of the world
this is an appeal for solidarity
they had one from northern UNK
UNK probably the poorest country in latin america
i it's not a it's not something that anyone should look for that sort of comparison
and on this banner i it had what the country produced
i'm afraid i forgot to write it down except th there was minerals that was part of its wealth there's o obviously some other parts of its wealth as well
but what the people who had made the banner were aware of was that they were UNK the wealth didn't go to them
and also on the banner was w were some UNK
UNK explained that the UNK weren't for UNK the tree cos that would just make it stronger
they were to cut at the roots
and it was a belief that to cut at the roots with small UNK would make a difference because it would have a cumulative effect and that's why i think we can do it in our own society
that er this group wanted to work with other groups which hadn't come to an understanding
and UNK in fact talked er in terms of the poor UNK the rich
that was how he put it in his theological terms
and that was probably why i think he showed us that banner
