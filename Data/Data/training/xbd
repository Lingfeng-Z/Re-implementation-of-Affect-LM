the next stage of what we're doing is trying to take things a stage further on to what action can you take for fair trade
i in britain we're saying
yeah
wh what things could happen now in nineteen ninety three which would make fair trade better
yeah
m more likely
yeah
but at an individual le level as well if you want but no not kind of just it's not a commitment to have to go away and do something next week
so if we go back just for five minutes
which quite often it's what people want
because that that's going to give us something
but if they actually put that the ca they do
indicative of things back in the eighteen
we seem to be gathering all sorts of things we don't need
mm
UNK
try to buy more from traidcraft
that's very important
more regularly not just
we need more traidcraft UNK
yes we do yes
if every supermarket had traidcraft UNK people wouldn't be forced to buy it but at least it would be there
yes and i think the prices should be in par
you know so that they don't make other produce cheaper so that
but the prices have got to be more haven't they if our aim is
yes
to give the money where it's
yes but they don't put their price
if they have traidcraft they don't have something which is cheaper beside it
no it would have to be a se a separate traidcraft stall i think not the traidcraft coffee next to the nestle coffee
yes
and even so i think it's a thing
actually it probably would be erm comparative
moira said it'd dropped down two twenty five to one sixty a packet
so i think it is quite competitive now
mm
i it is competitive because people are not kind of getting the money that we pay
they are getting less than we are paying
no i'm saying traidcraft is more competitive now
yes but it is different don't you see because we are not paying import
well i would have thought traidcraft would be paying people wouldn't you
well they are but it's overall
things overall in the world are cheaper
you can buy more for your money than ten years ago
ah but is this only because people are suffering at the other end
exactly
if we could all be persuaded to have a little less tea coffee chocolate and spend and pay more for it
and it's the same with clothing erm
i don't think the problem is quite so great with clothing is it
th it's been UNK for us that all these lovely tea coffee and chocolate which we all UNK is one of the things which is causing the greatest distress and UNK in the world
i think it's also
i mean cotton and things like this come from the third world doesn't it
some of the clothes i mean are definitely cheaper than they were fifteen years ago so i
some of the things that come from china er
and also indian cotton
which are in fact manufactured by indians who sell them here very cheaply
i mean i used to go to london to buy things erm and you have oh they are even in england
not to the extent they are in india they are
so we've got one question so far
ask supermarkets to stock fair traded products
of course if there's some section on coffee how are you going to get them to look at traidcraft
i think it has to be alongside the other
in other words you won't make a separate section
you'll mix it all up
mm
mm
so any other actions suggested
make sure that you ask those questions before you buy any of the products
if you don't like the answers that you get don't buy the products
in the market
you go to the market and i've been to the market and i've said where do your UNK come from
and sometimes they said i don't know
and well you can keep them
in france they have to say
they can't tell me where it comes pardon
in france they have to say where they've come from
well whether they have to in france or not but i want to know as a person whether i am french english or whatever i want to know that kind of
as i said UNK
right
we've got ask supermarkets to stock the products ask the questions before buying the products anywhere
lobby our mps to get this fair trade mark legislation through
yes
that's very important
pressure on the on the mp is
pressure on the mp to actually get the fair trade mark
well i should think it's more perhaps the erm civil servants than one's own individual m p
the government
moira was saying the minister was saying oh the it's an economic question not a moral question
how does one put pressure on civil servants
they're all so anonymous
i mean it's all a isn't it
the government
erm yes er denise right
the government
lobby the government yes
if it's the erm it's the ministers isn't it not the civil servants
it's very difficult sometimes i can get butter from denmark or holland or ireland and i don't know which one to get so i just don't know how to go about it
i've no idea
i mean the conditions of labour are they better in denmark than in holland or
mm
it sounded very
they want a few more minutes
i just don't know
at the end of the explanation will we be getting coffee
yes
coffee and cocoa
where do you have to put the cocoa on there isn't an oven down there
there's no cooker
the UNK
don't do it in the UNK
it's a fair trade
don't you er know how to work them moira
no
i don't
no i
i always thought there was always thought of y you know there was nothing that you couldn't work
i've only got a metal jug as well and that's no use for a UNK
to talk about
whether it's on the subject i don't know
erm something they tell you throughout the it takes quite a long time
but erm if we could sort of shout out a few of the brilliant ideas
share them with people
would you like to start
erm well we decided that we would have to erm try and live more simply erm that was the only way that er erm this would work
i if the producing countries are going to get more for their products we're going to have to take less
we're going to have to eat less
erm we'll have to consider our own UNK and erm try and set a good example
and er be willing to share what we feel about that with other people
er
i'd like to erm agree with that but we
er to ask more questions of people and not
erm and try and become better informed about what we are buying
and talk to our friends about our purchasing techniques and explain to christian people about why we purchase certain things or don't purchase certain things
well i think it's absolutely necessary to do this in supermarkets but erm you know that maybe fair trading in our country supermarkets erm are not the only way to shop
and are not a desirable way to shop in the long run
for anybody i don't think
and erm i've found out in our area in south bank the local hardware shop has just shut down
and the bloke told me that twenty five corner shops have closed down in south bank which is a tiny area in ten years
and when we're all finally forced to go to you know UNK for our shopping i don't think us or third world countries are going to get much benefit from it
can i say so from a similar point of view i knew somebody who used to be a butcher
and erm there are now only twenty five percent of butchers that there were ten years ago as well
mhm
and we and people don't go to butchers any more
they buy things from the packet UNK stuff
mhm
i it really UNK
th there are no UNK at all
i can't remember whose daughter reminded me market used to be UNK all over the place
and we've seen as well detrimental impact on the community
could i make a suggestion
which is that if we take these cards instead of dropping in one at here there and everywhere and i doubt if anyone will take much notice of one maybe i'm a bit personally interested in if i say could we all drop them in at UNK in UNK street
well i don't mean all but you know those who w would do that
i think it would have more impact don't you
mhm
and it is th one of the few shops in town where you can buy food where people who haven't got cars don't go out to clifton moor or somewhere and it so just a suggestion please that
it strikes me if we were to use these cards i forget what the wording is on patterns but er if we dear supermarket manager we would like you
dear store manager
sorry
dear store manager
right
mhm
mhm
very good
yes
er please consider stocking fair traded products
if it says something like that
i mean it would be possible to specify
it seems far too vague to me does that
yes
yeah
but like by saying fair traded products like
mhm
well whatever we want to say
yeah
i think we'd have more effect if we'd erm gave them in at the shop where we're known by sight
i mean i think i'm kno known quite well at b by sight at sainsburys
i mean i know various people by sight in the you know who are always UNK around when you go to sometimes for an exchange or a something or say you've lost your glasses and haven't found them
you know i should think somewhere where you are
yeah where you are story
they say oh we've seen that woman before you know in the last five years
and i'm afraid i do shop at sainsburys i'm very fond of sainsburys and i always find them very good and very UNK and very fair and all the rest of that
it's not like
we're combining these two ideas in fact this would make a very good campaign for a local church wouldn't it where people would then be doing both all directing at one supermarket
yeah
mm
you know perhaps there's another way of UNK it
just er write an article for a local newspaper
on the back of a postcard it says you know write for further information from your does it give any indication as to what fair trading means
i think it's a pity
erm
mhm
because there are going to be some people who won't take any further steps and erm
er it says to the customer if you support fair trading and would like to see third world farmers having decent wages and working conditions please sign this UNK
give it to the manager or assistant or the person on the UNK
mhm
well i think we should add a line because otherwise we're going to be left with
i know quite a few people who would do that
just you know
yeah
there's something else that
d did you ask a question
i don't know were you er UNK at me or richard
you
there's something else erm
well we w were just erm w wondering we were UNK over was h how the poor in this country erm could help
because it seems that erm it's a luxury for the middle class really to be able to afford traidcraft erm prices
erm the poor are only too glad to go to sainsburys or UNK where erm tea is half the price
and
no but the poor can't go to UNK stores
yes exactly UNK is not cheap
you have to have cars
also it's not cheap
a few things are cheaper
they d it's they're not cheap it's an illusion
well er coffee is but nothing else is
it makes me wonder if one of the things we're
traidcraft is s is quite a lot more
it is yeah
but you see neither are corner shop i mean we've got a lovely corner shop at the roundabout but the prices packing small cos they're for the elderly and single people and that and the prices just rocket you know so high
i go because i feel i must support the shop but i couldn't possibly do my family shopping there
sort of
you know you only
in UNK save UNK is UNK than traidcraft coffee
oh
really
well traidcraft UNK very cheap at the moment
and i know that the UNK and p g tips tea bags are UNK as well
yes i don't think anything could be cheaper than traidcraft coffee no
i it seems that somebody who's keen maybe could do a bit of price comparison
m me and moira n never have done
UNK save sort of dropped out of the sky
cos it landed on our corner shop
right
my impression is that the cocoa from traidcraft is very much the same price as when i last bought it from the supermarket when you first started stocking
mhm
it up
sorry cocoa
cocoa
yeah that's good
in the market
so why are things so cheap in the supermarkets
very reasonable as well
things why are things cheaper in the supermarket in comparison to traidcraft
it's because the UNK are buying so much er quantity
and that is
well there's quantity
really what the crunch is the price should be they shouldn't be able to be cheaper
and that's really what is needed for the concept of size you know
they wouldn't be able to buy things so cheaply
yes
when they can't buy cheaply here they
yes
they go somewhere else where it is cheaper
yes
i mean they've been doing that for half a century or more only now it's getting more and they can't
so even when we buy traidcraft unless it is cheaper than it was ten years ago it shouldn't really be should it
no it shouldn't
it means that people are given less money than ever
that's true
you said traidcraft was trying to keep its prices up
do you mean what it paid the coffee UNK
mm
mhm
i mean
because we're definitely paying less i'm paying thirty five p less for a packet of instant than i was even eighteen months ago
well in theory up to an extent you are the answer which means that we have to buy less things eat less and because we are you know that i mean i mean n i don't want to i mean i'm not talking to anyone in particular but we have a lot of very big people and
i was about to say seventy percent of women and forty six percent of men are UNK
yes
er we are eating much more than we need
i mean what about apparently we eat more chocolate than any other country
mhm
do we need this chocolate
and if we are not spending that money on all this er extra we could buy the food at the price we should be buying it
t to some extent i'm sure that's true
that is where the UNK erm it applies to clothes it applies to all sorts
we are all so UNK society you know
mm
yes that
so you know in time of crisis i mean if it goes any cheaper they'll get less and less money
erm
d does this take us to cafe direct
mhm
you were saying that the reason why the UNK sell coffee very cheaply is that they buy in bulk
and cafe direct which is this one which is the great hope of lots of people
it's a very nice coffee
very good coffee
mhm
very good
er is an attempt to follow some of the same processes bulk buying and erm to reduce the costs wh which are there no matter who gets paid for what the there are some costs
and it's considered th that they would be able to put in larger orders by buying in bulk
and the excess then wou would go to the producers so's it wouldn't be a another UNK
so how do you deal with the middle people with fair trading and with the third world goods
erm why i am saying this because i have erm i know young people work with UNK
and er so she goes to UNK and she goes for my er one of my daughters a wedding present and she er a lovely dress and she bought it in UNK for thirty pounds she
er if you go to UNK in london the very same thing is ninety pounds ninety five
so who is getting all that extra money in between
so what happens in the profit stage
w with cafe direct i it goes the direct contact with the producers which are in fact groups of UNK erm i think that's right isn't it
yes
and that's part of the direct in the cafe direct
th the there are there are of people
ah
so it's UNK to traidcraft
mhm
well it's not only traidcraft
cafe direct is a consortium of four different organizations one of which is traidcraft another is oxfam and th there're two other fair trading organizations as well called equal exchange and twin trading
mhm
and so i it's the four organizations together a and they have in fact come together in order to be able to put larger orders and to pay in advance so that people are able to budget
which is completely different to how the UNK carry on
mm
er a at present the coffee is all latin american or central american but i it's intended and it's all ground coffee at present it's intended it will include african coffee as well
mhm
and it's also intended it will become instant maybe at the year end and then be UNK but that is more in the distance because of the unit cost in the process
er it costs so much nobody's got enough money to put the money up for it to erm be at a price which would be affordable unfortunately
i think that's what it amounts to
but th there's a s a strong campaign to have cafe direct taken by supermarkets and there's a lot of people putting a lot of energy into this and at present it's showing those results
if you don't like supermarkets maybe the results aren't so wealthy
a and i don't
but leaving that aside i it started off with the co op in scotland and also UNK
now it's been extended to UNK which are a large chain in the south of england
now UNK are taking it
UNK i think are taking it in other parts of the country
i'm not sure it's got to the york area yet
they were making a decision at the end of march
but
and th there's a lot of for sainsburys the feeling being that if sainsburys also agreed to take it that lots of other if there are any others would follow suit cos everybody seems to look at sainsburys and see what they're doing
as far as i know sainsburys haven't yet taken that decision they've hung on the UNK for more than six months now
nine months
oh well all the more reason for the postcards
mhm
because they they've shown they are susceptible to encouragement
with UNK down south and sainsburys round the corner they have to
well wa UNK have taken it like all the supermarkets they've taken it on trial
and if they think they aren't going to get anything out of it th this is their morality it's the morality of economics
absolutely
absolutely
and they'll ditch it
is there any point taking it to a local sainsburys
don't they all have to follow national policy
i think so
then would it be better to send it to some central
well i think the local manager would pass it on if he or she got lots
well they do sell for instance they sell organic stuff depending on the area and they
mhm
get they get it from er
yes that's true
some things are sold that aren't called
charlie is it UNK and packed in south america
that's a bit of a hard question
is it
UNK
no but the instant coffee will be
they're looking to have freeze dried from
er UNK other coffee which we haven't got any of here it's ground coffee is processed in germany wh which isn't anything to write home about
there's only about one percent of coffee i is UNK in its country of origin
mhm
but i know you said there was a big erm UNK against it but on the other hand they do get a lot of more benefits from it like er well the erm the price that's paid for a lot more and it gives a lot more employment
mhm
i it's part of the reason i is that the processing just doesn't exist in countries
that i it exists in the western world
mm
so the instant coffee the only two fair traded instant UNK i haven't put them out tonight i say here
the these are the only two i think processing
UNK
companies wh which are not of the western world that we've ever come across
th this is
UNK
UNK
t UNK which is a good cause and UNK is produced in UNK although th er whether th whether it's still being produced i'm not absolutely certain
yes
because er some of this quite old
it is still
it is
UNK still produces its own coffee
and the reason why there aren't any others is because i don't think there's any other processing equipment
i don't know what oxfam does for africa
the there
there is erm so there is processing equipment
it tends to be to be for local production rather than for export
mhm
or it goes into the very cheap UNK here and erm and no er what do you call it UNK save sell some coffee and UNK mixture which is forty four pence for a jar
and that must have some extremely dubious coffee in it
w we forgot the notices at the beginning
h have we got a any other business then
yes
so if there's any other business then we could it's going to have to be fairly quick
before that
next er a fortnight from now dave and talking about
ah
yes
erm they are two americans who've who are involved with working in urban er UNK and provision for UNK
and they both work in their own part of the world i've forgotten exactly where in the united states they work erm a fair bit with support groups within america and they they're coming to talk
er two weeks tonight
peter and UNK
right okay so th that's a fortnight
i do we haven't got a programme out because i haven't yet
erm i tried to ring this lady
were you going to contact
er y no i'm not saying you did
erm
but did you say you would
i don't remember saying i would but i will do if you like
erm yeah
erm
she wouldn't be there next no not next week
it's the week after
and you said that on twenty first of june UNK was
yeah erm i haven't had a reply from stan yet
he's probably been away over easter
oh i see
i thought we'd you know
and his particular thing would be erm things especially like bananas and the erm barriers to trade when the e c becomes united
you know single european act or whatever
he he's going to talk about UNK you say
well about the UNK er but with particular reference to what the new european unity law will what effect it'll have on trade in that part of the world
so that means until we've heard from one of them we can't sort of ascertain finally the programme for the next few weeks
but best to remind you that on the tenth of may we've got jerry coming
i've written to him i've not heard from him yet suggesting you know er say that we'd like to have a seminar afternoon
but what i would like to know is any of you know for certain that you want to come to either of the parts of those that day in the evening or the afternoon
i'd be glad if you'd let me know because we want to know yet the numbers and how many we're going to get
i'll be erm i'll be absolutely i'm sorry but the UNK so erm i'll do my best
erm can i just go shapes and colours
and that's effort we're going to do them tonight
so first of all i'm going to do a triangle of mixed and erm and the red UNK it
and this is the UNK the purple UNK as you know
wouldn't stand up would it
it's been awfully hot to try to keep decent flowers and UNK grey and i've UNK it with water and i don't think it's entirely satisfactory
now do our best
ooh these were lovely just now gardens
if you want us to answer any questions perhaps you'll er you'll tell us plant somewhere
right now when i've cut it all UNK the right way
all these bits it's having to go the other erm i'm so glad you asked us this evening because we do need some practice
we've been in flowers most of our lives but not demonstrating which we're finding a bit a little bit er different
erm you know the don't you
er i had this in UNK all night because it UNK up quickly
and er then it seems to keep quite a long time if er if you do that
this has a lovely but er i think i'm going to put it in the back because my er arrangement is rather heavy and i don't want it to fall over
we had er quite a few UNK today with the flowers
and er coming here i found that i hadn't er put any of my UNK in so i had to go back again
this is one of the purple
it's tree really
but it's so lovely just to have
how could you condition that
you mean the bath
just in the bath
it's in the bath
yes i if it's too young it won't er keep
this
but just now i think it's just about right for er just about right for er using
and here's a bit we want
i'm not going to need any flowers am i
i have some er there's some more UNK
i don't know what they're called these just UNK
i er thought they were a bit bigger than
yes i think so
mm i think they're
just give me some cos we can't go without can we
er flowers i bought at an UNK
erm it was
and it wasn't too expensive
but it i find it useful for large arrangements
i can just put them down but i don't awfully like UNK when they down i don't think they look like
some more
yes
now these aren't coming out very well but they er whoever wins it will very UNK
do you want
always remind me of spain
mm
where we er went in the summer and erm lots of lovely UNK and all the
compliment the sunshine don't they
now want an outline don't we
lovely colour aren't they
which one's this annie
well it's hazel wood
UNK grows UNK and but she usually knows the names of all of them
i think you'll find the UNK one it's stiff and horrible
whereas if you buy it from
yes
you know the flower stalls
that's right
left in an UNK for all these i can show you it's also having i've some nice red UNK which i shall they're er not fringe UNK are they
not very well UNK
i keep this all the ti got some you see i'm trying to group the flowers together because i think they give more effect that way
and er when you have a er a UNK you get all sorts of shapes together don't you
it's difficult to get a UNK nowadays
toy ones anyway
what about those
oh i didn't tell you who they were
i don't that i hadn't forgotten that i gave a
i wrote it down
UNK
they look like UNK don't they been so hot today if you don't mi er and it makes you feel you know your age when er it's this hot weather
my er my friend you'll ask how old she is anyway
mind you she's ninety two
she er she says i can't UNK my UNK
i can't er UNK my shoes
i can't UNK my UNK unless i turn it round
an but she says it's
what a sensible person
think that's through
what's the name of that UNK please
erm UNK
UNK
yes
it's a lovely one isn't it
we don't want much more in there do we the red one sorry
we don't know the name of that one either do we
oh UNK the names
there's so many aren't there
well that i can remember belongs to mary but i'm afraid they're not very strong
are they
i just put those in
and that will do till have you got a triangle
and just to er UNK your UNK and i'm a basket of UNK there
i'll just in
i'm just going to start this evening with chase an object round the UNK
a piece of oak which my husband has mounted so it's UNK
some stones which are very good for texture a piece of sheep shoe wood from UNK park i picked up
try saying that after a few UNK
and some which gives a effect
that'll have to move
i sort of go UNK when you know when we're out anywhere seeing what i can find
much to my husband's UNK
so i'm going to start an outline hopefully UNK
this erm silver UNK
UNK
it has some lovely UNK on it just now
this i have boiled to condition it
it has been standing in water all day and it has been well UNK before it came out this evening
so this is a tree stump we have here and we found some mice on the way as well
did y did you notice the mice on the
yes
i didn't make them i er i've had a little go but i'm not very good at it
okay
they are yes
i got them at a craft fair at farm
colour this is not going to go where i want it to go
but it will
so that should freeze them and this is the new shoots round from the bottom
if it looks rather large we encourage you to do them large
cos we're still trainee UNK
we take it again erm i think we start in october time at oxford
we never know when to keep quiet do we
you know we say yes go on handy
we'll go
are you coming to UNK
yes
yes we are
yes
yes
well we well we do a different one at UNK
sorry
we do a different demonstration at UNK
i think it is it this month or is it next
yes
erm
yes i thought it was
yes it is this month
yeah
to go there
see what we can do with a UNK
put it down a little bit we have an UNK
may be a bit laid back but
get rid of mice
it's not very big is it
it doesn't like the
no it doesn't like something
sit
the UNK nest out there i have some UNK
they might not grow round here very well in the UNK but er if you go down to cornwall or UNK they're lovely down there
my husband will never stop so i can go and get some you know car keeps going
it comes from an old cottage garden just round where i
but i think i'm supposed to say having
the meaning many
and the are the UNK on the back of the UNK
which are the seeds of them
and they condition quite well
you know i mean they've got the turn around the UNK on the back
i've also boiled them just you know to be sure of them
now as was saying earlier on that she's been with flowers all her life well i haven't
i started about twelve years ago
and a lady you know very well she's not here tonight
i was going to say i won't mention her name in case she's run out of
but er of course pam i went to her classes er about ten years ago
i started flower arranging about twelve years ago
i had two years with pam
then i moved to a different teacher to get some more you know experience
because you do learn more from different teachers as you go along
and then i've worked at
i did the city and guilds at
these are er long stick leaves
it's true
it's where i've er formed its centre
again aren't they a size
mm
i thought they would sort of er pass as UNK leaves
and that's er how and i have demonstrated because she hasn't got transport of her own
she finds it a little bit difficult
so er we demonstrate together
you know
and er so we travel to and er UNK the ordinary one
yeah
from the UNK again
they last quite well
i did get some seed from UNK gardens of their UNK
but er i didn't manage to grow it
oh lovely you know some nice big leaves for flower arranging
my husband puts these on the UNK heap when he gets his eye on them
i UNK one last year for newark show
i thought oh you know you're always short of large leaves
for the base
so i was UNK this one in the greenhouse
and i went down one day
it's supposed to be my greenhouse
and it was missing
i said what's happened to the UNK
he said ooh do you mean that UNK
it's on the UNK heap
it was it was coming on lovely
i said i was going to have
and that's what happened to that
some UNK
i've only got two
and i'm UNK in the garden with them
you know
they to start with
at least that's where i think they come from
and this year i've got them they're a good seven foot tall in the garden
they've been marvellous haven't they
to say they're a wild flower or classed as a wild flower
and the markings inside are you know they're
so i'll put those in there
get good keep of the time here don't we
erm some UNK
another shape i think you'll find in UNK
alice
mine are just starting to come out
they're a big red UNK this one
mine are the UNK one
these are you know really UNK red
the mice get into those they'll be a bit UNK
won't they
some UNK
lovely markings haven't they
think you might find some of those in a UNK
different texture again
you can never find any going can you
oops
you sort of learn as you go on
you don't put too much stuff in till you get your flowers in
come out as i tell you
single UNK
they're the flowers UNK and i say they come from holland
the ones i grow at home er well they are named
they are mostly UNK from moor
that i had and i show them
although lately if i'm flower UNK er showing at the yeah flower arranging at shows i've then got time to show the flowers
i'm caught you know UNK and between which do i like the best
we've put enough in this UNK
i don't know whether we'll get a you know any places or not
but we put in to go anyway
someone once told me aim high she says
so we have a go
which
so you you're not supposed to get it you know it's er we'll take the leaves off
we've put in for the club entry and we're just waiting to hear you know if we've been lucky or not
or rather
well we've been on to and they don't seem to do an awful lot
you know i was rather surprised
i'm going to UNK these a little bit
in the UNK in the centre
we haven't had a lately have we
these i've boiled again to you know it brings the head down and i think it does make th the flowers last longer
put about stem in boiling water and er let it stand for about thirty seconds
now this is for the dog UNK that you get in er UNK
i haven't said that have i yet
as i grow UNK we have to do erm i'm not getting the right word
a survey it's a at the college you know and er and they did er UNK and i've done the UNK about growing them
so i thought well i might as well do something i know a little about
so we did that
and you've got er i've got some notes here and i've got them covered up with something else
that's clever isn't it
nice and cool the white and green isn't it
mm
now for the that out and i'll see what i've written down for this oh yeah er see sue lost it erm well it's a UNK meaning you know the rose erm the dog rose
but instead of that UNK a little but because i didn't think you'd like the dog roses
so
no
i've taken the UNK off and i've UNK them
and i've also boiled the ends as you can see there
it's that one
now i had a right job with them
i was trying to tell them it wasn't so hot yesterday and then coming out and out you know
so me and got the ice packs out of the UNK
and i drop kept dropping into the buckets to cool the water down
it was terrible hot yesterday
it was
yes
and i haven't got an awful lot of shade at home you know
no
so er i was having a rare old time
we were dropping the ice packs in to try and keep the
are they hot
i sometimes if i can get the new UNK roses but er there's none in the market and we got these
yes
yes
i've got an introduction to the wholesale market
but you can't buy an awful lot you know
erm because that you want more than your bits and pieces
right
for function roses you're okay but er a lot of things real go to erm a place well it it's
it's just on the UNK of
er it used to be called joe but he's died and woods have got it now
and they're very helpful
now you say you like your gardens open
i was going to bring a poster for you and i've forgot it
what with anna running me up and down the countryside
they they've got gardens open in calverton on the twenty fifth of july
there's six gardens open for a pound
it's er a garden UNK
and it's open two o'clock till six
if UNK be interested
it's for the preservation society
and the last one going in
now goes missing we'll have to give her a shout
ooh she's there
what she thought she was missing
so you shapes and UNK from the UNK
is there anything quick and easy
i hope
it hasn't been so far because i'm left right behind a background
erm right then
erm the lovely with the UNK aren't they
er
yes
but it er do you want this
er i got this
and i used them this year and they er i've got quite a lot of right UNK i was er hoping to get i don't think UNK come out somehow
the lady in the shop was very good
i looked right through them all and er however
this is er a quick thing you can do
when you get home
we use this for all the egyptian things we do
it's very good
that's a lovely one
look at that
i think it's UNK
but it's quite pink for UNK isn't it
if it is UNK
where did your pot come from
sorry
the pot
where did the pot come from
er
yes it was
i've got one or two that came from abroad but no this was liverpool
yeah
on the road er they've got quite a good selection now
haven't they
now we'll just give it a little bit of lift
i'm going to add these UNK
UNK
put that one
and put that one in the top
these were bought at er i think you can get some in the in the UNK
i'll just do a i don't know if any more UNK will last
there i think that's
now
my daughter's looking for a actually
so
i've had to this UNK because it's got UNK and the plates and that so i've just put a piece of er material over it
to hide them
and i'm going to put two pieces of garden cane in
just hold the basket for me
i think
small garden cane it's made it rather heavy with er the material on it as well
that's better
just stay there
mm
so this is going to be an a back UNK
triangle
i've got a plastic container here to raise the UNK on the UNK up a little bit because it's quite deep inside
so er it makes it easier to find the UNK if it's raised
i'm going to start with the outline of from the garden
which has again been boiled
i think it's a lovely light UNK isn't is
mm
so UNK
and i thought well i i'll do this with all summer flowers
i've got this
it's grown on a north facing wall so bit more now i think if it got more sun
you know
the golden UNK need a lot of sun
or the UNK
do you make UNK wine or UNK
mm
yes
have you
i've done it for my grandchildren this year
oh
i was going to say have you got any with you
well i made some ooh a few years ago
and my husband at the time was making er wine you know
and he said you've put far too much sugar in that
you've put far i said i'm just following this recipe
you know
and he was right
i did put far too much sugar in it cos it all UNK
UNK kept my busy you know
that's another one gone mum and that's another one gone
they were in the garden shed
and i was just saying i'm going to have to go down there
what happened then
erm
oh i had then
i've told you about grandchildren
i've just had two presented to me in the last eight months
i've got a UNK and a UNK
the UNK i look after because my UNK youngest daughter's gone back to work
and she's called UNK
spelt j o r d a n
and she she's eight months old now
you forget how many hands a baby has don't you
you know you get out of practice and there it starts
she's found that my glasses didn't seem to be right
so her hands were up and they were off before i knew where they were
and then she's you're trying to feed her and the UNK all over the place
so now we wrap her in a tea UNK so you know her hands are under cover
erm it's erm i think
i got it given to me so er if you think it's a different one you can tell me
so when you get a lot of things given you know i never say no
but you don't always get the right name do you
do she really did it on me well it was yesterday i had her
i was changing her UNK for her
well she started UNK along the floor on her back
and you know she can go at some pace
so i started changing her UNK for her and she decided she was going to take off
it was like hanging on to a UNK
you know
she was trying to move
so the next time i thought no madam you're on the UNK on your changing UNK and er i've got you
and the other one UNK
a little boy
he lives in london
my eldest daughter she works down there
and when she said she was going to have a baby rather a surprise at the new year time
so we said well what would you know can we get something
well they're living away
what can we get you for the baby
so she said oh two UNK cabinets and a drop leaf table
so
i says to her well what you know what can you do with that
well you can help me to cope with him she said you know
so she's got the two UNK cabinets but not the drop leaf table
er now this is grown in calverton
we have a small nursery there
and he grows them in wind UNK
he hadn't got a big selection but i went down er i was going to use stocks
was going to use stocks and er oh UNK that was it
and when we went to the market they didn't have any on as i say anna went to and got her UNK
so UNK and i had a walk down to the mark the nursery yesterday morning
before it got too hot
seven UNK at calverton
did you know that we have one there now
quite UNK
if we get packets sent the butchers if you get one thing set in your mind what you're going to do and you know you go off to get it and then er if you don't manage it then you have to start again
this is erm the UNK the UNK
this is the rose and i've also got hidden in the box somewhere
you might be able to some of it because it grows ever so easily you know
if anybody wants some i've got quite a good UNK
there's quite a few at the back now isn't there
the really deep UNK one as well
yeah
oh UNK the pink and UNK
this is a UNK one a bit pink
this
i've left a shoot on there
take all the flower heads off if you want it to grow
if you don't all the strength goes into the flowers
these have got or haven't you
and i've got some
got this in the garden as well
it came down from scotland
my mother had it in her garden
so it think it likes the water very much
give you a little chance to talk and get catch up with all your news or something i hope you're not i find it isn't it sweet peas
mm
i'm going to put these in some because like anna says you know if you flowers you have more impact with them
now these are grown on my neighbours fence
i did ask
they're grown on my neighbours fence and it comes on to my path
and she doesn't like them
for her to have them in the house
so i ooh you know could i have some
and i did have some of the as well so
i will be short of a little bit of blue so you have your UNK
there
blue
well they say the more you pick them the more they come isn't it
so let's hope they're right
and this you know sort of more flowers on as well
i bought some of them er from the show last year
entered show last year
i got second prize
i was quite pleased with that you know because it's er
good show mm
it is yes
i think you have to round all your friends and family you know nice yorkshire flowers
nice there's some of them that look as though they're double
i've had the UNK cough as well haven't you had it in southwell yet
if you get it if you get it everyone has it i think i'm doing a little bit what we did last night excuse me
bit short of colour
and just to give it a centre
it's
i've had it thirty years in my garden
think could have been done with tree but er so a pretty basket of summer flowers
for a different i'm going to that's right
i've got some UNK just to give it some height
erm i'll tell you about the er while i'm doing some
erm we call it the cherry UNK
erm because when i was a little girl my brother and i we used to flowers because my mother sold flowers and we would have to deliver them
to our regular customers
and er we didn't always remember where they lived
and er oh this is the
lovely green
and er and so explaining to my brother where or trying to get out of him where the customer lived
erm he'd say you know the row of houses where er where they have all things in the bay windows that i er i er an UNK dog or a an UNK or a cherry UNK
and the ch the cherry UNK the ones with little girls holding
oh yes
UNK in them
ever since then all these kind of er
so it's now a family joke
it's lovely
this room is so fresh looking
and the you know the white and that's just nice just now isn't it
and of course we've got this i have a little dog and she loves to roll in this
so i have to tie it up
and the cat
day we had a cat in our garden and er my dog isn't as big as a cat
it's a yorkshire terrier
and the dog UNK through th the cat UNK through the hedge
and i thought i hope the dog doesn't follow because it's a main road
and it sat at the other side of the gate
as if to say you can't get me now
and er luckily she didn't follow it but the cat did get and go away
and er a car came by at that moment
i shut my eyes
but it was er it was fine
i think i a bit put it in the back now
lovely shape this is for UNK and this is the UNK that comes with them which is quite useful
how do you condition the
oh i just boiled the ends a bit and erm and then put it in deep water
and i have UNK it this week because it's been so hot
so i UNK it with a fine spray and it's kept very well hadn't it
but er i think this sun will brown it don't you
brown it quite a lot
i'd just like one i've er UNK
i think they employ little men to twist them together
i was in UNK some years ago and erm when we well when we landed all the ladies were given a an UNK
it was rather nice
and erm when i came away again i brought some UNK with me
and for an UNK i paid thirty shillings
i thought that was very to have turned round
lovely colours in these
some of them are
it was lovely to see them growing in er UNK
and we had some friends there and one day one of them rang me up and she said could we come quickly we've got a monitor UNK in the garden
well i'd never seen a UNK she didn't know how to
i said alright we'll come and on the way
i said what have you done about it
she said i've hit with a sweeping brush
so i said alright shut the door and we'll come
and er when we got there was a little UNK chat about that
it was a tiny UNK but not er not that you would want to hit with a sweeping brush
and while we were while we were there we had some UNK to UNK out with well it was my daughter's and we went and had a meal with them and they were quite taken back by er they lived in this little which originally i had thought was a was a er a poultry house
it looked like a poultry house
and er when we got inside it was UNK clean and shiny
it was lovely
and er all the children went out while we had a meal
i couldn't see any clothes about anywhere
just a lot of furniture in there but there was nothing hung about you know
and so er we had this meal which was UNK
chicken UNK
and er it was lovely and we were enjoying it until i pulled out the whole UNK head
knife in it
so i'm afraid that did put me off
yes that did put me off
so i stuck to all the side dishes which were they were very nice
UNK and all sorts of UNK things that er
however it was lovely staying there and it was lovely weather
here's a tip rather nice
shame to cut them down now isn't it
i've got one or two UNK
these are the UNK
they smell gorgeous too
just to fill in
quite high
last year we were going to er a show at er and i was doing a modern arrangement and er we were in UNK van
and one of my er had a just a tiny UNK in it
and i said to norman have you got anything in here that would cover it up
he said i've got a UNK
i said i don't think
so er as we was going along this UNK flew on to my hand didn't it
well i thought about it
i looked at it
i thought how do you kill a UNK
so i didn't
so i went off to the er at the show
i just er put the one loose into er into the top where the judge wouldn't see it i hoped
and i won a first prize so i said
so it shows you never should kill a UNK
make a bad saint wouldn't i pretty
more UNK
quite nice and in the at
because they go in a caravan
a secret but i don't know whether i dare tell you
but er i was with a gentleman friend
i don't know whether
she said let me know
you might as well go to bed with a mills and UNK
i don't mind who knows you know i think i'm old flames isn't it
it's got a star
look
i think everyone's finding er alright
i think i might put those in
somebody told me i had
i don't i
mrs always does the most clever
oh yes
i've forgotten
oh
oh yes
yes
yes
and er there'll be white while
someone hanging up their UNK
yes
i should say well thank goodness for that
you're the twelfth one
i know
but we weren't the twelfth choice
no doubt we were the next day
now there we have our
now you have to have what a european style
so we're going to finish this evening with a european style
i have two UNK in here
and a UNK which is called UNK
i just plant some people own
and it just fills it in
i think a plant rather than UNK or whatever
so
we're going to do a european UNK style
but for the height
and the purple
and it's a little bit different from other flowers
this has the from the top down doesn't it
i think the UNK got to the UNK
well it's it looks like it's been cooking
i'll UNK it
i just have to this UNK there
buy flowers you know
by the time she gets to the UNK she's always got another ready
you think where's she got those from
you know she didn't buy those while we were out
football
and this you know like this style you can make it small or large as you like and you can come out to the sides as well
give it extra length
it's based on the high and the UNK and you don't have a point
where all your flowers come from the same point
while we were at we went down to er UNK
to a day school
with two UNK come over from belgium
to show us how to do the UNK and the european round table design as well
well we thought well you know we c we can do a bit
i'm just thinking i've got these on the wrong horizontal scale
i think this is the UNK king i'm going to have to make a corner there
now it's very easy to do this you know
don't be frightened to have a go at it
i did er a day school
taught it myself you know
at er UNK
i started doing the teacher's cause because i thought i'd like to teach
and of course they closed all the night classes didn't they
erm i think that one will
now what i want to do is er i have to set this you know and find a venue to go to
but with all these grandchildren and what have you i don't seem to have any time
and camping we've just come back from cornwall and it was very wet
UNK
you've got the atlantic on both sides and er it's lovely if you've got the weather you know
really lovely
but we didn't have the weather
and in fact one nine o'clock back to the tent
got a tent that we sit in and cook in
and erm we got there and i says to my husband i says oh i says er are you sure that UNK safe
you know it's UNK about a bit
so erm blue again because i er a bit short on blue for the UNK
er it's not the is it
yes
i didn't want to say that
this is from the cottage garden again
from you know round
oh short of blue could i have a little bit
erm and now getting back to cornwall
UNK saying to my husband says well i don't think the tent sounds very safe you know
it keeps flapping about and that
i thought oh dear so we got to bed by this time and we lay and we just couldn't get to sleep for the noise the tent was making
so he says might be a good idea t to you know put the van in front of the tent to break the wind
so i was laid out in the back of the van on the bed and he's driving down this field to put the tent because it had little er bits you know where it's marked out for you to camp and i'm driving around in the back saying yes you've just missed the fence there and you know
i can't see where we're going because i didn't have my glasses on
so it was quite there you know
erm
yes
i got it from i bought it at er UNK
in norfolk
so i'll keep the UNK together
and another theme of the european is the grouping of the colours
i don't know how i'm going to because i've got some peculiar colours
but i'm having the yellow
i think that is the nearest i could get to the orange
you know to be the opposite to the purple
if you get what i mean
as it's opposite in the on the colour wheel isn't it
now these are little ones i've grown in the greenhouse myself
they haven't been fed properly so they're not very big
but it's a sort of UNK pink so they'll go down here
and you know to cut between the on these
yes
we'll start to take the water out
anna didn't tell you and she's the expert on flower arrangement
and i think that ties in nicely with the pink in the
some more yellow
it's
and i like these you know you still want to come in
i don't want to go out to much to the side there
i always later
now as i was picking the UNK for this i've got a cherry a standard cherry tree and the UNK get on my fence and they queue up to get on that cherry tree you know you can hear them UNK away
if you go out UNK them off they go up on to the roof of the house and as soon as you turn your back they're back again
well these had got these UNK had been growing where they couldn't see them you know
nice of UNK this morning
but i don't think they were quite ready yet
you know they were nice and red but er these birds and i've got them covered but it's quite tall so i can't keep it all covered
but they can beat me to it every time
and they weren't the least bit frightened
i'll just put a little bit UNK in the back because when i was in UNK class the best triangle i ever did was lovely really pleased with it and it collapsed didn't it
because i hadn't put in the back
a little bit of the UNK shape and texture
going into there
the only UNK the blue you know but it's er i always make so noise with anybody's paper
isn't it
something else you don't see much of these days isn't it
i was brought up in the country on a farm you know so i'll try and sort of make you know equal amount of flowers in each and then er it can be UNK
in the raffle
if you want to it's up to you
i'm pleased you haven't got UNK here
last year we went to er UNK to a UNK all day
it was a it was just a lecture theatre
and they had these UNK on and we were UNK
and you know like we'll sit down and one take turn from the other
i went through the back to sit on the chair
very posh theatre it was
sat down and i fell through the whole of the chair
the back went you know the seat of the chair went the back
i said didn't you hear anything
she said no never heard a thing
landscape
have you got some red roses for me anna
UNK you know
lovely colour aren't they
they're just starting you see them more it would be nice to have them but you know
lovely
erm so a little bit of and this is
i'll put it in there
then i'll have the red roses
it's rather you know
putting the links in
this is er
there's a little erm piece in there you might want to
lay it on top of the UNK peat down a little bit
oh i'm that aren't you
i always find small plants you know to watch them grow
much entertainment
it is nice down where the UNK are isn't it
now this hasn't really got going yet
and it's the bloody dog
the
so if i can get it going you know it's er there you can see look what
go
yes
couldn't you can you not air off the UNK
this isn't the ideal
UNK
yeah
i was surprised the size the UNK are getting
oh yes
and some of the older ones are even bigger
thanks very much
this is sandra i hope
the person i got it from
sandra i don't know if you have it here have you
demonstrating
i got that from sandra
i went in her class as well at mansfield
and then i decided that was to do with again
that was when i decided to go to do the city and guilds course
but we'll have a go
er the UNK one
as opposed to the one that grows tall
i've got them both
i thought it was a very good point
yes
and they'll dry nice but i think you'd need to put a stiff wire in them now while they're st you know young
but they will dry nicely and you can either keep them green or you can spray them you know at christmas time
if you wrap them in newspaper you keep the green better
keep
the UNK we had last night i UNK
he said he puts his dry material er into UNK or er UNK
for a day
so it you know it's not so UNK
now i've got some roses to put in somewhere haven't i
yeah
they'll have to go that side
erm we thought we should try and do something as a UNK
so we have a round shape of a UNK
hopefully it UNK itself
trying to make it balance all afternoon so i had to start it yesterday to make it balance
yes i'm coming
and it's not going to do it
isn't it
put it down a little bit more
got girls
who was the UNK you had last night then
er
yes
yes
he's off to g UNK today he says
he's got a UNK you know he's doing something there
he grows all his own material
well he at the moment he says he's self sufficient
which i suppose we all should be really shouldn't we
he had an UNK which he grows his material on
you know at home
he said you've got all these men straight lines with the vegetables and that and er he's got his you know rows and rows of different stuff he has in
i straight in to yellow or yellow to orange
oh i've got some
and wrap a little bit of your autumn joy been quite UNK into flower which as i say i think looks a little bit like UNK doesn't it
you know it does
good rough texture
i'll just put it back a little bit there
it all works out differently you know it looks very nice with er spring flowers as well
got a nice bright green UNK
well they did have when i bought them
that's always a sign of UNK in the UNK
but they had all sorts of virtually now don't they
that's why i didn't want to go to the edge because i wanted to try and do my own
i might have to hold on to it you'll have to get people to you know
put it on the table now
don't come
thank you ladies for UNK for er inviting us here
we've enjoyed the evening
as we say we need all the practice we can get
and we wish you a safe journey home
thank you
it's a pleasure to say thank you to mrs and mrs for your UNK of colour
we've really enjoyed it
now presumably you're doing this er personality analysis as part of trying to work out who you are and where you're going
is that right
that's right
yeah
okay
well that's fine
that's what we normally use it for and erm what i'm going to do if that's okay is i i'll describe the erm the actual theory to you
mm
and get you to self estimate er where you come on it
mm
you see
and i've got a little chart that i'll give you to do that on
mm
and then erm we'll have three readings really of erm where you come
mm
on the chart
one of which is this erm estimate that you'll do now
mm
and then you've filled in a works situations
mm
questionnaire and that gives us another reading
mm
and then there's the proper questionnaire and i've scored that up
right
so we get three readings
okay
and then erm we work out erm a best fit
right
er you know so far as we can get that erm and i'll then give you a description of how the theory er UNK your er preferences for behaving in particular ways would work out
mhm
and you can read that and we can have a bit of a discussion about that
mhm
to see if you think it's appropriate and
mm
accurate or not
erm and basically er the reason for doing it that way is that erm i don't want to set up a situation where erm i'm some sort of expert and i er this is not a matching process okay
no
no
it it's really to give you er whatever UNK you can get from this particular theory erm about the way in which your personality works
right
so that then you can use that er to make er a better career decision
mm
and indeed actually it's quite interesting anyway for all sorts of
mm
er applications
erm but the idea is that it should be very much be something which you erm er you know the estimate and so on is something which you've contributed to
yeah
rather than have imposed on you by somebody else
because th the key thing is that you should be more in charge not that you should be receiving erm some statement from an expert which then determines what happens you know
right
so it's that sort of process
mm
does that sound okay
that's fine
that's fine
good
okay
well erm i'll give you the er little chart here
now erm oh you've got a pen
excellent
erm if you if you if we just er look at that for a moment
mm
the way it works is that the theory the theory actually erm er has four dimensions
mm
that's why there are four of those
and what we'll do is i'll tell you er what each dimension consists of
and the idea is that that's the UNK and there's a one to ten scale going each way
mm
and erm you work out whether your preference is very strongly this way or a bit this way or a bit that way
mm
and just put a mark on the line to indicate the strength of the preference
does that sound okay
mm
right
well let me explain briefly th the overall structure of the theory
all personality theories divide personality up into dimensions
mm
erm this one has four dimensions
sometimes they have about twenty
mm
erm and the theories differ in terms of what the dimensions are called and what it consists of
and erm this theory has four dimensions and each dimension consists of two UNK opposite types of behaviour
and the theory is that every individual has an innate UNK preference for behaving at one end or the other
mm
okay
er now it's important to get the idea of what preference means in this context
it is not an exclusive UNK
mm
so it doesn't mean to say that you only behave at one end or the other
erm in fact life requires everybody to behave at both ends
mm
but the theory is that there's a UNK inherited preference
right
mm
now the ex the analogy which is used to sort of explain this a bit further is with UNK
are you right or left handed
right handed
okay
so that means in the analogy that your right hand is your preferred hand
okay
erm have you ever tried to write your name and address with your left hand
yes and i was hopeless at it
hopeless
how did you feel while you were trying
er really strange actually
mm
i felt that i was using a part of me that wasn't used to UNK and i've just recently started UNK
oh really
yes
and er i have a real problem with using my left hand
oh interesting
because erm the erm what usually people say is that erm if you use your non preferred area in the psychological sense then it's very hard work because you haven't got the same degree of control as you have in the other
mm
areas
so to achieve a sort of given result you have to work much harder
erm and usually it feels very awkward
mm
it doesn't feel comfortable at all
erm but if you persist you get better
mm
and you know normally with the UNK you don't use your left hand unless you break your right wrist or something
mm
but in the psychological area you do have to use it you know quite a lot of the time
mm
erm but you should be able to improve
er you know but none the less there is this preference
that's the idea really
mm
okay so that's the idea of preference
mm
now there are there's one preference on each of the four dimensions
er and that means that there are sixteen different preference UNK y you know that
mm
are possible
erm and er the other thing about it is that although we have to look at in order to discover the preference we have to look at each dimension as a UNK entity once you've found the preferences they actually have a dynamic relationship with each other
right
yeah
and the description which i'll give you allows for that
and also when we when we've worked out the best fit preference i'll explain a bit more about how the dynamic relationship
mm
works
okay
okay
right
so that's the end of the overview
so shall we start trying to work out what the preferences
mm
are
now the first dimension is extrovert and UNK
ca
yeah
can you write on this erm extrovert on the left hand end where the dots are and UNK on the other end
right
now i'm sure you've heard of these terms before
mm
erm but i think the important thing is that UNK on whom this er particular theory it's based on his
mm
theories
erm he was the person who invented those terms
and of course he meant something probably rather different from what the popular meaning is
so it's important to define it really
this dimension is about er where you prefer to focus your attention and where you get your psychological energy from
okay
oh right
yes
and that's what this UNK about
and the erm UNK are people who prefer to focus outside themselves on the world of people and things
the UNK prefer to focus on their own inner world of hopes dreams fears aspirations ideas
whatever's inside
now if i give you an example of a bit of behaviour where erm a situation and er give you an idea of how UNK and UNK would behave in that area that may help you to work out which you think you are
say you're with a group of students and erm you're sitting round drinking coffee one morning and the UNK shining
and somebody says let's go to scarborough for the day
you know it's a terrific day let's go to the UNK
erm now the UNK preferred response to that is an UNK reaction which they share
oh terrific idea
yes
i'll go and get my fishing rod
mm
or oh no
i can't stand the UNK
couldn't we go to the north york UNK
mm
instead
right so UNK
now UNK people hate being asked to make UNK reactions
they actually want to think about it
whatever it is they want to think about it
erm and then they may share
right
or they may not
erm now what they say about erm UNK is that if you don't know what an extrovert thinks you haven't listened
she will have told you
er if you don't know what an UNK thinks it's because you haven't asked her
yeah
okay so there is a difference in that way
erm and i told you how the UNK would behave
now an extreme UNK might be er sort of case you know you're erm er cutting up the sandwiches or whatever UNK you've got to do and so on
er and you then you get to the time when you're all going to get in the car and go off
and erm the er this particular person just isn't there
mm
well they've decided they're not gonna go
they haven't actually told anybody
er and they've just disappeared
mm
erm a less UNK erm er response would be half way through the UNK to say well you know actually i'm i don't really think i can come
i mean i've got this person to see or this essay
mm
to write or something to buy in town or whatever you know
mm
they thought it over and they've worked out and they're not gonna come
right
now of course these sort of situations do cause a few problems because or can do because erm the UNK expect everybody to share you see
erm and of course if you had half a dozen students and two of them were UNK and they both wanted to go and they both said yeah
terrific idea
and maybe the other four wouldn't like it at all
but if
mm
they weren't actually saying anything then probably the plan would sort of go ahead and then you might find that you know half of you didn't actually go
erm the other thing about UNK and UNK is that erm UNK really like to do their thinking er by er putting out their point of view and getting everybody else's point of view out and looking at it
but for UNK really thinking is done in here you know
and they don't they're not so keen on the sharing really
erm i mean does that give you an idea of which
yeah
way you go
okay
yeah
sorry do you wanna stick down
right
mm
you were gonna say something
is it just well i was j er i mean i find it hard cos i suppose everybody to some extent in the extent to which they live in their own house
mm
are UNK
if you see
right
what i mean
yeah
i mean i am just as much as anybody else
but i think naturally with
mm
the sort of analogy with going to
yes
scarborough i think i'm much more extrovert
okay
yeah right
and i think i will have come out that way on the thing
do i put a cross
yes
a cross would do fine
right okay the next one is UNK and UNK
UNK on the left and UNK on the right
okay
right
now this one is about erm how you prefer to take in information how you prefer to understand things
it's about perception
mm
now the UNK person UNK to use her five senses to perceive what's going on about her
and UNK to concentrate on present concrete reality
what she can actually see touch smell hear taste
mm
if she can't see it touch it smell it hear it taste it doesn't exist
that's a bit extreme but it gives you the idea
now the intuitive person on the other hand UNK to use her sixth sense
and erm UNK to focus on future possibilities rather on present reality
mm
so it's not erm what exactly is the nature of this relationship it's how might it develop what might it become
or not exactly what is this thing i've got here and what can i use it for now
how might it be changed
what other uses might it have
erm intuitive people have UNK and UNK which they trust whereas UNK people are pretty UNK of UNK
and they don't like intuitive UNK which intuitive people make
sometimes they won't intuitive people can't actually tell you exactly how they've arrived at this perception they've just got it
er and UNK people find that ex extremely odd
mm
and erm really very unsatisfactory
mm
erm and the UNK people want a step by step logical statement of how somebody has reached erm
mm
you know a particular conclusion
erm i once talking to somebody about this and er he said erm well he said i think i must be an intuitive because i've never let the facts get in the way of a good idea
mm
now for er UNK people it's probably the other way round
mm
the ideas have to come from the facts
mm
do you do you have a
yeah
okay right
fine
jolly good
next one
erm next one is thinking on the left
mm
right
and no sorry just thinking
oh
and erm feeling on the right
feeling
yeah feeling
now those terms are a bit peculiar
you always get trouble with them in psychological tests cos you either use terms which nobody knows what they mean or you use terms which people have meanings for and that's not what you actually mean by them
and feeling doesn't refer to emotion as such
this dimension is about erm how you prefer to make decisions
you've perceived something you've now got to decide what you're going to do or whether you're going to do anything
and the difference between the two is in terms of the material you prefer to work with
and the er it's all rational so it's what sort of material do you prefer to exercise your UNK on
and the thinking people prefer to use UNK objective material
mm
whereas the feeling people prefer subjective personal
mm
material
so you've go got a situation where if somebody wants to change something they're actually you know maybe it's something you do in a job or something like this and somebody says we really ought to change this
or it might be something sort of domestic like maybe you go shopping every same day every week or something
erm and somebody says well you know you should change that
erm then the thinking person's sort of preferred response is to erm seek a tight definition of what the change actually is
erm so they'd wanna know well you know if it's a shopping change then erm do you want me to change the day
do you want me to change what i buy do you want me to change the time i do it
do you want me to change the place i go to
what exactly is it that
mm
you're saying that i've got to do
erm and UNK that effect what went on before
it may be there's some sort of sequence to these this activity
erm and how does it effect what comes after
so it's a very logical UNK sort of approach
mm
okay
now the feeling person on the other hand faced with this sort of suggestion would immediately start saying well erm why are we going to do this
er who for whom is it a benefit
or who sees meaning in this change
for whom is it of value
is it going to benefit the shop keeper
me the customer
or you some of the other people maybe on whose behalf i buy things
mm
or you know who is going to benefit from it
and how are the people in it
so really you're looking at the values in it you see
mm
which are essentially subjective and also the people how are the people who are affected by this actually going to feel about it
you know are they actually going to erm er see it as a positive er step
or are they gonna see it as negative and UNK
and maybe some people will see one way and some people see it another way
but er concentrating on the personal the subjective
mm
yeah
do you do you get an idea
yeah
okay stick something down there
right
good
and the now last one is judging on the left and UNK on the right
and this is really about your erm your lifestyle your pre preferred lifestyle
how much planning you actually like to have in your life
now the erm judging people want everything to be well they prefer to have everything cut and dried sorted out closed off decided
they don't like ambiguity or loose ends
at all
the UNK people on the other hand want to be flexible spontaneous and responsive
mm
so if they if everything's planned out it's a real UNK for them
and they don't like it
yeah
erm now if you think of organizing a party is quite a useful example of this
now judging people don't like loose ends and get worried if things are not being organized
okay
so usually they do the organizing
er the UNK people don't it doesn't worry them very much they'll do it all at the last minute and get it sorted out somehow
erm so if you've got a judging person and they're having a party then they will they will organize it a fortnight in advance
and they will erm work out the guest list in a balanced way according to whatever they want to happen
and erm er they will s think about whether they've got enough be enough room for the number of people
whether they've got enough chairs
where the UNK coming from how much it's gonna be
same thing for the food
if there are gonna be any activities then if you got a really extreme judging person on the day there'll be you know UNK and sheets of paper and rules for whatever games are going to be paid
now the UNK person on the other hand would erm say about midday well i think i'll have a party tonight shall we
erm how are you gonna get everybody there
well we'll see whose around and tell them and they can invite a few of their friends and we'll see how it goes
what about the drink
oh tell everybody to bring a bottle
er what are we actually gonna do
well we'll see
i mean when people come see who knows any good games and they can organize them
you know
er so it's all UNK open ended and flexible and so on and
mm
quite different
and the judging person UNK a lot of effort in the actual organization
and they get actually pretty upset if only half the people come
because you know there's all this stuff ready and so on
or if twice as many people come they get upset too because they haven't got enough
whereas the UNK person is much mm less UNK by this and says oh well there are lots of people that's nice
i don't know half of these people
i've lots of new people i can meet
or erm if only half the people come well that's fine we can have a much more sort of UNK evening and erm actually there'll be lots of food for everybody won't there
you know
mm
so they're much more flexible about
yeah
things
and the judging people their ideal event is one which goes exactly to plan
whereas for the UNK people that's probably pretty boring
mm
okay
yeah
i can work
oh pretty far down that
track
okay
right
let's have a look
erm now you get erm a letter for each of the preferences
that's the way erm they do it
and you can't have i
it's usually the first letter but
mm
you can't have i because i for UNK
mm
so it's n for intuitive
n p for perceive
right
now we'll have a look at the erm the work situations one
you may remember you can see what's going on now
that's extrovert UNK thinking and judging
yes
and so on you see
an and i simply add the UNK and see which comes out
yeah
and it comes out the same
yeah
so that's fairly straightforward
erm this is not very accurate
mm
and it's not a fine UNK
erm but in fact certainly those three you've got a very clear you know
mm
sort of six difference is not much on the other side
mm
anything on that
now this one is a bit closer
mm
erm but it's still reasonably clear and then we've got this which is erm it's all er constructed so that there's a UNK score
mm
you see so you actually get that
er and that's the same again so we haven't got any problems i don't think about the fit
that's from the questionnaire
yes it is
mm
and in fact it's interesting that the erm the extrovert is actually quite high
mm
on that
peop people say that in fact all your scores are quite high while p is the actually that's rather
that's yeah
different from that isn't it
and those are the same
well i think it yeah because when i was filling in th
yeah
i mean there were a lot of questions like you know does
the idea of making
yeah
a list for things
oh yes
appeal to you
those sorts of questions
and it doesn't appeal to me but i know that i should do it
and i know that i'm forced to do it
an and s so sometimes i think my sense of obligation
yes ah
carries me so
but whereas when you were talking about it then i mean when i think about it
it's quite obvious that's what you're most comfortable doing
i resist it
but yeah
yes
well you see what happens is that erm you may have a preference but you learn that you've got to use this other behaviour
mm
yeah
an and so you do
yeah
you know
but that doesn't alter th the fact that your preference is the other way
yeah
and in fact it's quite interesting sort of analysis this because erm i actually think that the erm the best er well it helps you if you know where your preference is because if then you're behaving in the other area then you know that that's not re your preference
mm
and therefore if it's a bit difficult
well you know it's a bit difficult and you know why it's difficult
mm
but you can do it because you know you can go back home as it were in to the other area
whereas if you think well you know this is i'm doing this but i don't know whether this is me and i don't feel very comfortable with it and all that
mm
it it's actually much more difficult to do it
mm
erm so in a way knowing your preference doesn't mean that you can't do this
mm
or that you don't
er and perhaps er you know you can have a role where maybe you've gotta make decisions and alright you do it
you know
erm but it makes it easier in some
mm
ways
erm and it sort of explains to you what's happening
mm
which can be quite useful
yeah
erm
okay
so i'll give you the description
erm
is that quite a high score there
i mean
oh yes
some of them are quite
definitely in one
well the thing is the interesting thing about this is of course is what we're actually dealing with is not erm well in a sense er not erm your actual preference which according to the erm theory is UNK
you
mm
know it's sort of in you
sort of UNK inherited
erm but whether it actually erm is realized in practical behaviour
mm
is another matter
just like the sort of nature UNK argument
mm
in biology
you know you might have a gene which says well you'll grow to be six foot but if you're not fed properly
yeah
then it won't happen
mm
so and it's the same thing with the preferences
mm
so in fact a high score is quite good because it means that you recognize what your preferences actually are
mm
you know
so it doesn't mean you know a higher score on UNK doesn't mean that you er necessarily very seldom er UNK judging behaviour
you might UNK quite a lot of judging behaviour but it feels peculiar to you an and you know it's an effort
and so you're quite clear that your preference is UNK
mm
it doesn't actually mean necessarily erm how you behave
mm
if you see what i mean
cos UNK had this idea that the whole the whole of life was a journey towards the discovery of what he called the real self
mm
now that's a bit of an UNK concept really but none the less i think people have er a sort of idea that there is a real them
mm
somewhere and that this probably gets pulled about
mm
by relationships by external events by roles which they take on
and erm therefore it's quite a real thing to a lot of people
and what the this preference thing is after is describing the real self
mm
there's also er i mean i think there are well there are probably lots of UNK but erm er there's the real self
the sort of inner self if you like erm although that's expressed in behaviour quite often
and then there is how you behave which may not be the same thing as the real self
and then there's an UNK self
the sort of
mm
person you might like to be but actually unfortunately aren't
you know
mm
and the real UNK probably somewhere between the behaving self and the UNK
mm
self you know
erm well let me find this fish this out for you and er you can er have a look at this and see what you think
okay
thanks
read that and see whether you think it's er accurate or which bits of it click and which bits of it don't
mm
most of it's true
yeah
okay
well let me explain the erm oh that's a description on the back
can i have that back for a minute and i'll just explain one of the erm a bit more of the structure of it
e n f p
now the theory erm is that there are four mental functions in the middle here
and the extrovert and UNK and judging and UNK are sort of UNK
so if you imagine that erm you're a motor vehicle alright
and the e i and the j and the p are if you like sort of part of the UNK which decides whether you're a sports car or a heavy goods
mm
vehicle or whatever
but the engine that actually drives you
mm
is these four mental UNK okay
erm or mental functions
now one of these is dominant okay
and that's in your case that's that one
and then the other one you then have an UNK or second one
and those are the two preferences
mm
okay
and then the other two erm less preferred areas erm the least preferred is opposite the erm number one the most preferred and the third one is opposite the second one
now thi this has some implications for decision making
mm
if you actually an and a career decision is one type of decision
erm if you want a good decision you've gotta use all four mental functions
mm
but the preference theory suggests that erm you will use them in order of preference
so er if you've got a er a problem say the career what are you going to do with yourself
well the first thing you do is start thinking of lots of possibilities you see
and erm you get all these possibilities erm set out and then you use your feeling judgement to er cut them down
mm
er you say well you know alright there are all these things i could do but erm er what where do i think i re really want to work
i mean where would it be worthwhile for me to work
you know
what do i what is so important to me that i want to spend all this time on it
you know how does this fit with my value system
so you'd use
mm
your value system to actually erm fine down the number of possibilities
now the danger is for n f people that they don't use the s and the t
and according to the theory you would then after you'd used the n and the f you'd then start to use the t which is the sort of logical thing
you'd say well what am i trained to do
what sort of background have i got
what skills have i got
do i need training to do this
mm
and then the s the senses the last
erm is really about erm well are there any jobs in this
an and do people actually get paid to do it
and what sort of activities do they actually engage in
mm
what is the nature of the experience of somebody who actually does this
mm
and if n UNK are not careful they've got this terrific sort of value UNK possibilities idea
mm
which is a bit vague and erm you know er an and they never get to well what are the skills
and where are the jobs
and what actually do you do day to day
i mean it may fit your values and it may have lots of possibilities but what are actually gonna be doing and will you actually be capable of it or enjoy it or whatever
so you need all four an and it's not a criticism to start with the n and the f
that's how you are and that's how you have to start
i mean it's no good you starting on the s and the t
you'd get bored with it before you'd you know so but you need to bring the others in
mm
that's the thing
mm
so erm you know that's th what i'm really talking about is more a question of the process of erm career choice than it is saying what you should do
mm
erm the there is something which i suppose can be said about what you should do if you're an n f and a and a an a dominant intuitive
by the way this tells you what your you see your dominant is UNK and then with feeling
mm
erm now er if UNK is the dominant thing and you're an extrovert then you erm really need situations er where you can change things
where you can actually erm make things change
mm
erm and if you're a er an intuitive feeling person then really it's crucial that your value system is accommodated in what you do
mm
you know that makes a huge difference really
mm
erm so that's very important
erm hmm yeah
well that's about it i think
erm what are you actually thinking about doing anyway
erm or haven't you got that far yet
well i think i've got a bit stuck on the n and the f actually
i see
so we want some s and t
we do yeah
no well i've just had erm an interview and erm really just exploring the things that i myself thought of trying
yeah
probably erm i think i'll do on the
oh yeah
yeah mm
and do that for a while as well as some voluntary work
that what i was thinking of doing for next year
it's really i mean next year i was sort of quite co i'm quite committed to not having a year off so much as just exploring things and that's what
right
what erm heather
yes heather yeah
yes that's what she said
she said you jus
mm
cos i haven't like she perceived that i was very kind of lost really
and you know didn't know enough about the different areas of work that i was interested in
and she said oh the best thing to do is just sort of travel for a bit an
mm
not travel UNK but travel with a purpose
mm
an and find out as much as possible an and then erm try and get on to something for the year after
for nineteen ninety
yes well you'll need to do some s and t you see erm before you go off on your travels
that's it
other otherwise you really won't know what you're coming back to so
well exactly
no i couldn't face that i don't think
i've got to do something
right
well that's what i'm doing here and
yes
trying to work
yeah
things out
yes
cos it it's true that i resist it
you know i mean i didn't want to come today
i resist
no
the sort of process
yes
you know i just think that i should be able to get a job just like that and
yes
well of course erm sometimes you can
but it is it is dangerous because of course maybe it doesn't work
erm and especially
in the current climate you see it's also erm interesting because of course this sort of theory depends who's interviewing you
i if they're erm an intuitive feeling person then they may think that's okay
er but if they're a UNK thinking person they will find it almost totally UNK that you've been so UNK as not to have actually worked out in detail erm you know what their job is
and erm why you want it
and why you why it fits
you know why they should employ you given you know what are your skills
yeah
and what are your this and what are your that
an and really even the n f UNK will er want some of that
well i think for them to be in management top management positions a lot of them they'd have to be pretty UNK and thinking before well i do i mean i think there's
yeah
room for my sort of personality in most careers but to some extent it's got to be you know balanced and
yes you've got to do the lot you see
so you need to get
on to the s t bit
i mean have you done the erm any of these other things
i mean you've done the personality thing
er if you've seen have you seen this wherever it is
erm oh it's over there
the erm planning your future thing or not
no
well it doesn't matter anyway
erm
this thing
oh yes
i've got that
you've got that
mm
you've got that you've got that
right you've got that
yeah
now i'm i am trying to work through it UNK actually
yeah
yeah
okay
well erm
this has been quite helpful though
i do feel that
cos what you've done then is that
mm
i've done the i'm just in the middle of the skills one
oh are you
yes oh jolly good
yes
yes
that's quite interesting
well it is because that actually does with the pie chart lead you into sort of UNK of work area
mm
which you know then you can explore a bit
what comes across in both my interests and any skills which isn't really UNK with this i don't think is that erm i've got sort of because of i think it's cos of my academic experience cos i did an arts degree with a lot of research and stuff is that i like UNK data collecting processing information
which isn't really i mean i don't think
not an n UNK thing
not really no
no it isn't
erm well you have to sort of decide i suppose erm which way you wanna go
mm
you know
although you see erm as we've been suggesting any project requires that
you know you need to be doing some of that
it it's just a question of i suppose whether you do it or you get other people to do it or what
you know but probably to start with whatever you're gonna have to do you're gonna have to do
and i think the s and t thing is erm it's very good to have developed skills in those areas
UNK it's a question of where you sort of UNK them really though isn't it
well it's erm i mean helen suggested
mm
UNK an and it was
mm
something which that interested me but i do think i'll find it boring or something
yes well no this wouldn't necessarily
support that
erm it would depend i suppose erm well the n f people they want to be able to change things you see
you can't change things much in a library
no
erm er if they're if they're UNK then it's alright changing things just by changing people's perception
so erm you know you i mean i'm i n f j and so it's alright for me to think i've changed your thinking
whether you actually do anything about it is up to you know
mm
so i mean i suppose in a sense it would be good if you did actually change something but that's not entirely necessary for me
if it's given you a slightly different UNK on it and you're thinking has changed
in some way
then that's okay for me
now if i was an extrovert it wouldn't actually be enough
i would want actually to see real results you see from erm the change
that you had actually shifted from this to that and you went off and did whatever it was
mm
you know
i th i think you probably need a bit more er in terms of results
erm although you see you could get that in UNK
if erm you might erm in time er you know become er the UNK or something
well then you're managing the thing and you're actually responsible for trying to work out which way it's going
mm
you see
so in a sense that might come later on
so you might find that er a and in some ways it's rather interesting because your s and t skills might get you the job
in a sense you know you wouldn't get it without them
erm but what's needed for later on might be the n and the f
because erm you know you can't manage people without some consideration for er for their views and how things affect them and so on
erm and you need to look at the big picture
mm
yeah it's no good getting UNK down in the detail
so i suppose whatever area you went into erm you might find it a bit frustrating to start with because you weren't looking at the big picture
well i think that my problem is you know like cos i did do the p g c s
oh of course you did
you came and talked to me
yeah
about it then didn't you once
and that was my problem with it was that i was in much in terms of being able to go into the classroom an and talk to the kids and have a really good relationship with the teachers and things
and i discovered that
and it didn't work out
to actually create the right learning environment for them there were a thousand little details that i had to attend to like had i planned my lesson right was i progressing in the right way round the classroom had i remembered to chase up certain people's homework and stuff
and that i find incredibly difficult
you know it was a real effort for me to remember all those things
because i am so kind of you know i've got ideas coming in and out of my head all the time
but you know i still think that i'm drawn towards that sort of teaching performing that kind of role erm and that wouldn't be fulfilled by UNK at all
no
but i don't think it would do me any harm to develop some more UNK skills because UNK most jobs require them
yes
you know i don't think you can get by without them really
you know i mean you have to have time management skills to have a reasonably
well you do don't you
yes
successful life don't you
i mean it's no use being
yes that's right that's right
i mean as i said when i was filling in the questionnaire i was thinking well this really this is my preference and you know i'd much rather be in a job that allowed me some flexibility
you know rather than down to the line planning for every single moment of the day
but having said that i can't see a job where you can just kind of swan in and you know and think about a million different things in one day or whatever
so you know i mean i su i suppose a lo the questionnaire seemed to concentrate very much on how you were outside work
and i mean i su everyone has to resign themselves i think to some extent but the fact that they are playing a role within their work situation
right
and they can't allow their personality free expression
i mean that's what another thing i found very hard about teaching
and the teachers commented on it
they said that i was too much of myself
you know i had to assume this more detached role
from the kids
yeah
yeah
well it teaching has a lot of er problems with that really because it's playing a role
i mean it's acting teaching more or less
yeah
and you know and you got to have gotta get you know you have to get cross with them if they UNK or whatever because otherwise there isn't any order in the place
mm
an and you know those sorts of things have to go on
erm i'm just trying to think what other sorts of jobs you might be interested in
i think anything with writing
i mean that's come up again and again
UNK and that kind of thing
yes
yeah
but there's a lot of s t in UNK isn't there
quite a lot of s
you've gotta do your you know go out and sit in the county court and wait for something exciting to happen
well especially again when you're when you're training
well that's the thing you see i think you're you know that's gonna be the problem that you're
just thinking what we'll start off with
i think i'll give you some homework that you could do for the week
so it'll be
right
based on what we do today will be based on
okay
technical names of notes and intervals
things like that
don't can't remember whether we actually any of the technical names of the of the scale before
no
how many notes are there in a scale
eight
right
so each one of those is going to have a name of its own
yeah
with the first and last of course are gonna be called the same thing
and it's the tonic
you you've probably heard that name before
tonic
because i think we've probably
yeah
talked about tonic UNK and things like that
tonic is the first degree of the scale
so in the key of c major c will be the tonic
er now the next note second is called the UNK
it's immediately above the tonic
and so would that be like d
that would be d
or in the key of g it would be a
a
and so on
the UNK is the third degree of the scale
yeah
and it's called UNK because it lies exactly half way between the first note and the fifth note which is also a very important note in the scale which we'll come to in a minute
so UNK is the third and it lies between it's in the middle in other words
UNK again is the fourth
and i'll explain why in a moment
fifth is the dominant
it's a very important note
dominant means that it's important doesn't it
yeah
er and then the UNK because it lies halfway between the upper tonic the eighth note of the scale and the UNK
so that that's called the UNK
and then the UNK is called the UNK the UNK because it lies halfway between the tonic and the dominant
so you've got the UNK between one and five
UNK between
between
eight and four
and that actually shows you slightly better
that little diagram
if c is the tonic g is the dominant so in the middle comes the UNK
and think of that as the upper tonic
and that would be f would be the fourth degree
so that becomes UNK
right
and seventh note is the leading note because it's leading you up to the tonic again
tonic UNK
the lower dominant in other words and it's
yeah
called UNK because it's five notes below the upper tonic
so the dominant is five notes above the tonic and the UNK is five notes below the tonic
right
yeah
if you like underneath the lower one
mhm
that jus if you can keep the th the descriptions in your mind as well it just helps you to remember why each one is called that
yeah
okay and in fact i've given you part of your homework is to write out the technical names
with a very brief explanation of why
and you can use this little book for now
i think i think we've got one of those
you may have one of these
at home certainly
so you can use that
can't you
i'll put the page numbers so you'll be okay there
the other thing i'm going to talk about are intervals
i can't remember whether in grade it was three you did wasn't it
yes you've had to do intervals in oral tests
haven't you
so you know things like major second major thirds
erm perfect fourths and perfect fifths
did you have to go as far as that
no
no
no we didn't
right
okay
let's refer back to c major scale because it's the nice easy one
it's all white notes
so there's nothing to worry about as far as UNK or flats go
there's ei the eight notes of the c major scale
c to d is a second
there are two notes involved so we call it a second
and that's a major second because it comes in a major scale
so it's c to d a major second
c to e
c to e major third
major third
miss out fourth and fifth for a moment
go t to a
c to a
major sixth
and c to b
b major seventh
is a seventh
and then we've got an UNK
right
the fourths and fifths aren't called major
they're called per perfect fourth perfect fifth
right
yeah
the reason for that is because those two notes also come in the minor scale
alright
i know the d does as well but the fourths and the fifths always remain perfect
okay
so you say major second major third perfect fourth and fifth major sixth major seventh and UNK
it's actually called a perfect UNK but they never worry about the perfect when you're talking about an UNK
but it is actually called a perfect UNK as well
okay
besides the major intervals you've got minor intervals
if you think about c minor scale
you'd have c d e flat f g
f g a flat
a flat
the key signature actually has a b flat in it but because in a harmonic minor if you remember you raise that
a UNK that's a b natural going to c
now you still have a major second but you have a minor third which makes it minor scale doesn't it
yeah
and a minor sixth
but you've still got the perfect fourth and fifth
you've still got the perfect fourth and the perfect fifth
right
now with all the oth other intervals you can also have minor seconds minor sixths and minor UNK
which is why they're not called UNK
you can't have minor fourths and fifths
so fourths and fifths just remain UNK
any idea what you do to make all of these other intervals in to a minor interval apart from those two
what happened to the third to make it a minor
UNK a UNK
right
so if you do the same thing with a d
erm
you have c to
d flat
d flat
that becomes a minor second
right
there's the minor third with e flat
fourths and fifths you don't have UNK
you don't have
right
now
that's the sixth
minor sixth
the seventh to make it minor you would
b flat
put a b flat in
and that gives you the other minor interval
so you've then got a minor second a third a sixth and a seventh
right
now all of the intervals also have what is called an augmented interval and a diminished interval
what do you think a diminished interval will do
to a minor interval
erm
what happens if you UNK something
you put it down
right so it gets smaller
yes
and if you UNK
something
it gets bigger
it gets bigger
right
so
you've taken that down a UNK to make it minor
to make it diminished you just take it down another UNK
take it down another UNK
in fact you
so
wouldn't hear any difference between that
so
yes it's c
and but you must call it d double flat
because it
oh right
must have if it hasn't got another letter name then it's not a second is it
yeah
so c to d double flat
it'll sound the same note
so you can only see it on paper
you can only you wouldn't know that it you were hearing a c to a c you wouldn't know you were actually hearing a diminished second would you
because it's the same note
right
what about
would they would they write it like that in the music
it would be written like that sometimes if
it would
yo if they're changing key
yeah
they might put a double sharp or a double flat that but would be the same note
but that's just a way of changing key
it will actually show up though once you've
what about the what do you think a diminished third is going be
a diminished third will be a d
but you've gotta call it e something otherwise it's a second
e double flat
isn't it
yeah
okay
so if you want it to UNK to be a third you've still got to make it an e and call it a double flat
now you can also have diminished intervals for the fifths and fourths
fourths and fifths
alright
so what do you think a diminished fourth will be from c
a diminished fourth would be diminished f double flat which would be played as an e flat
now will it
remember there's no minor interval so you can just go
oh yes
straight to an f flat
f flat
yeah
it'll be it'll be played as an e but of course it's actually an f flat
okay
as you don't have to go through a minor interval just go one UNK lower and
yeah
it becomes diminished for the fourths
same thing for a fifth
yeah
it'd be a g flat
just an ordinary g flat and that becomes a diminished fifth
erm and a c to a
c to a would be a double flat which would on a keyboard be a g
g
right
and what about a diminished seventh
diminished seventh would be played as an a
and it would be called
be b double flat
a b double flat
that's it
fine
that's those are the diminished intervals
what about the augmented intervals
go up a UNK
right
so an augmented second
second
will be
do you have to go through the minor
no
because you're getting
no
bigger
oh yeah
so it's going the other way
right
so that would be a d sharp
a d sharp
a second
and a third will be
it'll be an e sharp
which will of course just be played as an f
yeah
must be called an e sharp
then we come to the fourth
that's the f sharp
and fifth
g sharp
and the sixth
a sharp
they're much easier this way round because you haven't got to go through the minor at all to reach them
what about a b
that'd be a b sharp
which of course is played as c
played as c
so again you wouldn't know you weren't playing an UNK
but on paper you can see that you're intending it as a an augmented interval
then of course you don't have to worry about the UNK
you could actually have an augmented first
which would be the c sharp
mm
that's a bit silly
it's an interval you'd never see but i mean theoretically you could have that
the augmented intervals are quite easy because you're only going one UNK greater than what than the note that appears in the major scale aren't you
but to get a diminished interval you've got to remember that if you can have a minor interval you've got to go one UNK less than that minor interval
right
which is two whole UNK less than the major interval
yeah
isn't it
aha
except for the fourth and fifth which is easy cos that's just one UNK less
mm
they're not really so complicated as perhaps they might look in the first place
if you
just keep it clearly in your mind that you can have erm major intervals
anything that appears in the major scale is a major interval or a perfect fourth and fifth
okay
and then you're gonna have a minor interval from each of the major intervals
a diminished interval from any of the intervals
yeah
and an augmented from any of the intervals as well
right
so if you're in the key of f major
what's the key signature of f major
f major it's a b flat
nice easy one to start with
so there is the tonic
let's call it by its proper name tonic
tonic
what would a perfect fourth be
perfect fourth it's erm
first of all letter names
it's a c
that's a fifth
remember you have
oh is it
yeah
to include the first note
it's er it's er a b flat
so it's b flat
so a perfect fourth is that
right
i'll put the flat in front of the note so that you can see it
what about an augmented fifth
augmented fifth would be a c sharp
right
what about a diminished fifth
diminished fifth would be a c flat a b
that's right but don't forget it must be
yeah
called
c flat
c flat
so that's a diminished one
minor seventh
minor seventh is a b flat
no a erm a
that's a fourth
oh yeah
well an a
would be a third but b flat would be a fourth
b flat
now you want a seventh remember
oh you're going from the other
it's erm e flat
e flat that's right
what about an augmented seventh
augmented is erm e sharp
which would be played as an f
e sharp
what about a let's have one more a minor sixth
a minor sixth
that's erm d flat
a d flat
right you just have to remember that whatever key you're in you've got to remember the UNK or flats from that key
cos those will be the major or perfect
yeah
intervals won't they
and then you've got to add or take away
er if you er if you had to have an augmented fourth what would you do
augmented fourth
it would put it up a UNK so it would be a normal b
a normal b
if you had a key signature you would have to remember to make that a natural wouldn't you
yeah
but if it's got no key signature you wouldn't need to bother to put anything in at all
cos inevitably it would just be a diminished fourth
right
the other part of your homework i've given you to do is to write down all of the intervals that you can possibly have
but based on the key of g
i gave them all to you based on the key of c now
c
but if you write them all down first of all starting with c
and then going to d which would be the major second
and so on
i've put major second minor second diminished second augmented second
and so on
and then the third and then the third and a fourth and a fifth and so on all the way through
erm
if you get used to writing those out
and then the next time i'll probably give you some intervals and ask you what they are
i'll actually start writing out things for you to do as homework
and i've also got a book that we can use
i've got grade four and grade five which are quite useful
but i find it more useful actually to write out the things i want you to actually do
er
and then i shall find out quite quickly what you don't understand
so what we've got to spend more time on
what you do understand so we won't bother to spend as much time on
cos there are quite a lot of other things as well that we've gotta deal with
in fact we've got to deal with everything that comes in this particular book
and there's quite a lot of it
the other one of the one of the things that people find very difficult the learning all the words they expect you to know
the italian terms
and the french terms now they've added
and some german ones
and there are pages of them
quite a number of pages
what sort of things
like erm UNK a UNK all those different speeds
yes
erm
UNK everything
and they do actually now add they only used to give you italian terms they've now add added quite a lot of the french ones and the german ones
i can never remember the german ones
french ones i don't have any trouble with
most of the italian ones i don't have any trouble with
but i can not remember the german ones
but i've never had to use them
you might find those easier
do you do german at school
yeah i do
i do french and german
you'll probably find you won't have quite as much trouble as i do with them
but i've never had to worry about them so i i've never really got on and learnt them
that's what it boils down to
and there are a lot of them
you know they're all things that you they d expect you to know
and they do ask you questions on quite a lot of them
and there are pages of them to learn
er
you've got to know quite a lot about rhythm
all the different time signatures that there are which will include everything
two four three four
two four three four
four
yes
which is the UNK
then you've got erm six eight things like that where it's quavers
six eight you've got to be careful with because you're in to a different type of time
erm
and you go one two three four five six
and those are comp what we call compound time
yes
erm
it's the same time as three four
you have t you have two types of time
but you count the quavers rather than the UNK
it's not quite like that actually
six eight time is actually two time
but the beats are divided or shared out into three
oh it's in UNK
er they're not actually UNK no
oh
they're six to tell you have six quavers in a bar
it's true
but they're in two groups of three
like that
and what it actually means if you see them like that it actually means that there are two beats in a bar and they're dotted beats
oh right
er as opposed to two beats in a bar that are not dotted
just writ
and that's just called two four
that's two time two dotted beats in a bar
it's called compound time because they're not beats that can be divided into two
they go into three you see
if you have nine eight it's the same thing as saying three beats in a bar
three beats in a bar
but they're three dotted UNK beats or nine quavers in a bar
and they're grouped in threes
the compound time is grouped in threes
the ordinary simple time grouped in twos or the beats can be divided into twos
what's divide actually means in twos is that you share it
mm
equally if you divide something
erm you can also have six four time
what do you think six four time might mean
six four
erm it's
well there are gonna be six UNK
yeah
in the bar
it's
six what
what does the four stand for
it's UNK
six UNK
right
so
let's write it down and you can see six there are six UNK in a bar
now remember if it's got six at the top it means it's in two time
so divide that bar into two and then make each one of those into a dotted beat
and what do you get
erm
you could make a dotted something out of that group of three notes
mm
yeah
erm you have what is it
a dotted now that was a dotted those three notes were a dotted UNK
yeah
so three do so three UNK will become one dotted
UNK
UNK
so six four time means two dotted UNK beats in every bar
right
so it's two time
what about nine eight or nine four
nine four we'd better do hadn't we
nine four
it's erm nine it's nine
for UNK
nine UNK
or three
or three dotted UNK
dotted UNK in a bar
these are the things people get very confused about
that there are two basic different types of time
compound time
simple time
these are the compound ones the six UNK nine UNK six fours nine fours twelve
you can have twelve as well
twelve is four beats in a bar
you can also get it with twos can't you
so you'd have like four two which would be
you could yes you could do
UNK
do you get it with UNK
no
it's unlikely
no
i suppose theoretically again you could have but it's not a
yeah
not a usual one cos that would make a very
yeah
very long bar and
eight
er but you can definitely have you can have six sixteen if you wanted
nine sixteen
six sixteen would be what
erm it would be
six what
UNK
six UNK
in other words two dotted quavers
yeah
in a bar
what would be the equivalent simple time signature to that
the equivalent simple erm
remember six means
yeah
it's two
two beats in a bar
so we know the top UNK gotta be two
two
it's two four
erm
erm no
oh
just two quavers in a bar
two quavers
which is two
two eight
eight
instead of having two dotted quavers two ordinary quavers would be eight
it's not a time signature you see very often but again you can you could have it
right
or that one would be three four wouldn't it
and that one would be three two
three UNK in a bar
three over two
we'll go into those in a lot more detail when the time comes
but if you can if you can understand the difference between simple time and the compound time and er try not to UNK the fact that six eight does not mean that there are six UNK beats in a bar but it means that there are two dotted beats and two dotted UNK beats in a bar and try and get that into your head as soon as you can you're gonna find it a lot easier
so many people find it very difficult to sort out the difference between simple times and compound times
if you could basically thr remember to that there are two beats three beats in a bar four beats in a bar five beats in a bar whatever
but even in compound time you still have two beats in a bar three beats in a bar four beats in a bar
but they're dotted beats
as opposed to simple time which is ordinary single beats
erm you'll hav have plenty of opportunity of writing them down and erm you'll be given a lot of UNK of music like you probably were in that book
mm
and asked to put the time signature in
of course they get more complicated don't they once you've got compound times and as well as simple times
and that one had bar lines
which is the same sort of thing
you've got to know what the time
yeah
signature means haven't you
i do have a seat
thank you
what can i do for you today
oh yes
i clinic on this blood test
we did some blood tests that's right
we did
that's right because you had sugar in your wee and we thought we really must have a look at what we've got your UNK blood sugar was absolutely fine so that looks normal
had you had your breakfast that morning
yeah erm
good
spot of er when
for the blood test you mean
yeah
oh yeah no i had
so you'd had a big breakfast and it's still normal which implies you're going to be fine now
what we really need to do is keep an eye if it looks like you keep UNK sugar out
mhm
we may have to do what's called a UNK test
right
i hope not it's a real hassle to do so
mm
erm er and it involves going to the lab and sitting around for about a couple of hours while they feed you a bit of sugar and then take some blood tests every half hour
but we've done er a completely normal random sample and that should be fine
so if it UNK down and you don't have any more next time keep an eye on you as we normally do every few well we'll be seeing you fairly soon won't we
we'll be seeing you in another two weeks anyway won't we
yeah
two weeks yeah
okay
well we'll have a chat about what you're like then
okay
nice fresh sample of wee not the first wee of the morning
no
okay
but a nice fresh sample
okay
okay
have you got a bottle
i have yes thanks
you've got your bottle
yes
yes i have
make sure you wash it out
and then we'll see if take things from there is that okay
that's fine thanks
great
great news thanks
okay
very much
and everything else
yes
i'm a bit bum but er
well
you're going to get bigger i'm afraid
i've finished work now so
oh right
okay
right then
right
very much
see you
bye
bye
a new a new a new a new toy
i'm glad somebody's got something in
i'm the only one working now they've all packed up for the day
do have a seat anyway
er i've been doing a been writing a book now for about ten years
aha
erm i was on the railway for thirty years as a driver on the railway at wouldn't remember
er no
bit before my time i'm afraid
and erm anyway it was a wonderful place wonderful relationship with the men and erm about the only odd thing about it i've come up against a UNK which i didn't think i've had a ghost writer i've got UNK and as i can't get er permission for all the photos that i want
oh dear that's a shame
because there's a ten year
oh
er one thing or another i must have spent a couple of thousand pounds on these photos
anyway
you're just interested
no
but er well what it is i've got a mouth problem
mhm
now when i came to see you i think it were earlier on in the year and i've been to see er the other doctors
yeah
er we had a UNK now i've still got this sore tongue that keeps coming back very badly
now the other day when i rung for appointment
what can i do for you this mor oh well shall i do jade first
yeah
well i've been up practically the best part of the night with her just crying
oh jade
pulling at her ears
but she the last couple of days she's hardly eaten a thing
right
and she's i notice she's got a rash coming round here
yeah any sickness or diarrhoea
none at all
she's
had a little bit of diarrhoea well it's not diarrhoea it's such a i know
UNK
when she's UNK cos
yeah
she fills nearly every UNK
right
but she's just been crying UNK
mm
well she seems quite content sitting there
the common problems are the n the throat and ears in kids
mm
and that'd go along both with
yeah
ears
i suppose
and not eating of course
couple of weeks back she got a throat infection i just wondered whether it had come back
now then
shall we have a look at dolly first
shall we look at dolly
shall we look at UNK ears
look at dolly
ooh UNK got nice ears
oh yes
UNK okay isn't she
mm
shall we look at jade next
well she's certainly got a few UNK coming up
right jade i'm going to have a look in your ears and this is going to tickle a little bit
okay
you your UNK
very good
there's that one
yeah now they're both okay
yeah
they both look UNK but not UNK at all
so let's have a look down her throat and that's likely to be the source of the problem
and there's no spots anywhere else
mm no
okey doke
shall we have a little look open your
open your mouth
open your mouth
ooh let's have a little look then let's have a little look at these UNK
oh good grief what great big teeth you've got
what great big teeth you've got
you got the great big you've got some great big UNK too to go along with your great big UNK
have a look at your great big UNK
come on UNK open your mouth
she will in a minute
oh look
have little look
come on
good girl
you hit the back of the tongue they UNK and you can
yes
see everything
good girl
just a UNK
she's got a very nasty looking throat
it really is extremely UNK
and that i should think is a source of this
she only had one a few weeks a go as well
yeah i know
well children of this age are UNK to them
yeah
they haven't met all the bugs that you and i have so they keep coming down
come on UNK
once they hit them
yeah
so
well i used to suffer with them
yes
my UNK
now
what we'll do is we'll give her penicillin
yeah
i would an for two reasons i i'm going to give her quite a long course
the first one is you need to give longer courses of antibiotics to clear throat UNK
yeah
as a rule
come here UNK
and secondly she's actually recently had one so we need to make sure we completely UNK it
i suppose this could be a UNK up of the last one
which occasionally happens some of them are difficult to get rid of
yeah
so it's four times a day for ten days it's not UNK
right
it's ordinary penicillin
and it must be taken on an empty stomach
yeah
but this is the drug of choice for this sort of throat infection
mm
oh come on
hello
hello erm it's a mr brian from the for you
a workload survey that the are doing and er they they're trying to get loads of UNK to do it and of course they want me to do it next week and i'm not here next week
so that makes it very easy to fill in so i don't mind doing that at all
so four times a day for ten days on an
yeah
empty stomach stacks to drink UNK if necessary
yeah
and that'll hopefully do the trick
right
okay
right
you're next
well i just keep when i sit down i'm tired all the while and i've got no UNK whatsoever
mm
interesting
weight okay
well i have been UNK constantly since i had jade cos
mm
i put nearly four stone on
yeah
and er
you must be down somewhere near your target weight i should think
well i'm about i UNK now between eight stone ten and
yeah
nine stone
are you still actually UNK
well i just yeah i suppose i am
mm
because i'm not eating anything if i think to myself it's UNK i'll
yeah
yeah okay
UNK bowels okay
er UNK yeah
yeah
bowels
well occasionally
i don't think i'm eating enough to actually make myself go
mm
yeah
mm okay
have you had problems before
no
ears
throat
nose
yeah i'm fine
all bits and pieces okay
periods
er yeah they've been fine
mm
you've not really had anything wrong with you in the past have you
no
just looking back through your notes
you've had babies
one
baby or appendix in ninety eighty three
yeah
jade
and then not an awful lot has really happened to you
is there any family history of UNK disease or liver disease or anything exciting
oh
not that i can
no
think of no
mood okay
mood
mood
well when the week before i'm due for my period i'm really nasty in
mm
fact i'm vicious
and er
do you feel more er active with that
sort of is it an active anger or do you still feel tired and
erm no not really i feel alright it's just that i'm so nasty all the while and
mm
i can't seem to help it
as soon as he come through the door i go for his UNK and take everything out on him and it it's not fair
this is a familiar story
now i try to avoid chocolate and i UNK it when i
UNK
yeah
yeah
yeah
which you what er are you on the pill
yeah
u
which one are you on
UNK thirty
mm
you see in theory you shouldn't really get pe UNK problems on the pill but people do
it's the week before and the week while i'm on
so it's
yeah
for two weeks
okay
right
how would you say you if what are you like after that
are you normal
yeah
but still tired and a bit
UNK
or are you a fairly normal
no i normally UNK straight back
yeah
and i'm alright
yeah
it's just this time i'm tired all the while
yeah
okay
let me check your blood pressure
it's a more importantly to make sure it's normal rather than to look for a problem with it but now you're not trying to escape are you jade
come on get your
you can go in the other cupboard if you want that's a UNK cupboard
that's very exciting in there it's got a table in it
and a pair of weighing scales
nothing wrong with your blood pressure
mm
i want to you look up for me
mm stick your tongue out
er yes
mm
it's difficult to tell with your make up on but i think you look a bit pale
yes
the eyes your tongue and your finger nails both look
mm
rather washed out to me
and that might go along with er diet
mm
fairly strict diet and periods cos women tend to lose iron and certainly women who are actively UNK can actually become iron UNK
and that will really UNK everything
yeah
that i'm w now so what i suggest we do is before we say we must make your UNK tension better with various UNK various bits and UNK and there are quite a few things we can do to help
we really ought to do some UNK blood tests and say
yeah
are you UNK
check your body UNK check your UNK
cos these are the things that upset women and
mm
creep in
and if you are UNK or short of iron that may be the clue to why this has happened now rather than happening before
mm
so if we arrange those
now it's too late to do them this morning cos the UNK already gone
but if we get you an appointment to see UNK one morning at your convenience so we can UNK those off
mm
and then do those
is that okay
yeah
no that's fine
you've done very well with the diet of course
i was getting a bit UNK at one point
no
and
you're fine
you must be round your ideal weight really
so i mean you don't want to go di down to a size eight or a size ten cos i think you'd feel
mm
worse if you did
mm
now then have you found something interesting
i've got something interesting here it's called a teddy bear UNK and it says no not a thing full of UNK tablets no
they belong on the shelves knock them off
this says i was good at the doctor's today
would you like one of those
jade
would you like one of these stickers
shall i give you a UNK
ah
look at that
i bet there's no one else out there with a UNK today i certainly haven't given any out so
come on
pick your baby up
pick your baby up
where you teddy bear look
okay so we'll UNK if we do those and then we'll have a chat
yeah
see what happens
i mean if it turns out you're not UNK and your sort of UNK is normal for you
yeah
then we can go ahead and get UNK straight away
right
but i suspect that may be something we need to address as well
okay
right
have we got some er stuff for stuff for jade
come on get your dolly
can i pick dolly up
come on
i'll pick her up
come on
right see you then

always
yeah
a and always will be
but we've been involved with two specific projects that we've worked on in conjunction with the tenants' association
aha
yeah
erm a and that has that has led us from the group back to the individual tenants and one
mhm
one of those projects erm was an advice er advice project for tenants who were being moved out as part of the as part of the programme of moving o of moving the tenants out
yeah
and was to do with what the rights would be erm in terms of benefits and in terms of compensation from the council when they moved out
mhm
the other the other thing that we worked w we've been working with and are still working with erm to take up campaign for tenants in who're on supplementary benefit or housing benefit supplement erm to claim the higher rate heating addition for their flat
mhm
and i think the tenants UNK the tenants in the low rise flats the UNK
yeah
are also erm being involved in take up campaign for the s for the same thing
mhm
and we've had one or two appeals so far
you've had one or two appeals actually go out
and how the UNK they gone
erm it seems to be pe
depend very much on individual circumstances
mhm
so the heating addition that you that you that you erm been talking about that's the extra heating m money you can get if you can prove that y that your erm
accommodation is hard to he
is exceptionally hard to heat yeah
that's it
that's right yeah
mhm
yeah
and the main thrust of our campaign was to try and get the d to get the d h s to accept that as an entity as a tower block was hard to heat so that the tenants would automatically get it
but they've refused to do that and they insist on taking each case individually
mhm
erm because although they accept that there are certain conditions within the within the tower block which affect the block as a whole they would say that they would affect each individual flat to a greater or lesser degree and that they would have to be taken on individual merit
mhm
and it's the same with the low rise flats as well with the UNK
and that's am i right in saying that in terms of the erm move to try and get erm heating additions it's actually started er in and that but now there's been a spin off affect and increasingly people are trying
yes
to get the same thin trying to get the heating additions in erm flats themselves
yeah
and also am i am i right in saying that the preliminary interview you said something about erm having erm sessions you had for a time you were actually erm situated in the flats UNK
yes we were
erm it was early last year nineteen eighty five
yeah
erm people were starting to move out and i think that i think quite a lot of people well although they'd had a lot of information from the local authority were still very unsure about how that would affect other benefits in particular supplementary benefits and single payments and that grants for the furniture that kind of thing
erm and i think the tenants' group came to us and asked us if we would set up an advice session for tenants moving out which could be situated in the flats and could be run on a regular basis
and we agreed to do that and we put out quite a lot of publicity
w we put leaflets through the doors of all the flats we put posters in the local post office and the library and the boys' club and one or two local shops arts and UNK
mhm
and an advert went out on caroline radio trent
and t x r x b c radio nottingham to the effect that there were going to be these regular advice sessions at which is the ac the tenants' action group office
erm a and f at first we had one or two people coming in but then it dr it dropped off very quickly and after about three months i think we decided we weren't getting enough take up w that we would not have the sessions in the flats any more but that we would encourage people to come to the law centre if they had any problems
erm we had lots of theories about the reason the reasons why people weren't coming to us
one might be that for people who are on a fairly low income or on benefits the home loss compensation which the council was offering did i would in fact seem like quite a lot of money erm and for any tenants who weren't in arrears then they would receive the full amount
er it did seem it did seem it would seem to a quite a lot of people that they were getting a good deal and they would accept that and they would relatively speaking they were getting a good deal
erm the other the other factor would might be that the kind of k er decrease and loss of morale within the within the within the complex
the fact that quite a lot of effort had actually gone into actually going int having negotiations with the local authority to UNK all the tenants
having achieved that big UNK of relief and nothing else kind of thing
mhm
erm
you t you said about morale being but why and the having met quite a few tenants from the flats who in terms of individuals that have come in here you know to seek advice
you know what g how do you feel morale is in the flats at the moment
at the moment
erm
n er when you've been here what
for about three and a half years
yeah
i mean has it ch is it is it's changed during that period
or is it
erm i w i can't really say whether i feel it's changed a great deal because before i before i wasn't really very closely involved
mhm
with it with it before i actually got involved after negotiations had gone through for the UNK for the moving of the tenants
so although i met individual tenants at prior to that was on a much more kind of ad hoc basis they w when they were coming into the law centre maybe about something completely different
so i wouldn't necessarily talk to them about conditions in the flats
i feel now erm just from talking to people that there's very much a feeling of er a UNK erm a kind of UNK of waiting for something to happen waiting to be moved out looking forward to that
although having said that there w there are of course other people who are probably quite very happy in their flat
depending
mm
on
have you met m any who specifically said you know they were happy
it doesn't
i've met people who've said they've enjoyed living in the flats but all the people i've known who've said that have since moved out
and i think
the people most of the people i knew who said they were happy living in their flat
yeah
are people who had a choice about where they would live
erm so they would have ch they chose to live there and they chose to move out
this was before the actual move
the actual big move that the because of the shutting
mhm
down of the complex
mhm
but you s so there's a you there was a basically a minority of those people that were happy
on
er
the basis of your knowledge of t s e
yes on the basis of my knowledge i would say i would say so
mhm
what about other people who has anyone on the basis of individuals that have come in here do many individuals come in and actually have problems related to living in the flats
directly or not
or they what kind of problems do problems tend to come with from the flats
erm well as you well
generally i mean i would obviously
i wouldn't want you to
ye yeah
individuals
no
oh no
erm we er well as you know i mean the there's a very high rate of unemployment amongst tenants in the flats
mhm
and that obviously affects the kinds of problems they have with regard to income benefits debt problems erm and with regards the kind of things they come in to see us about things like single payments f for things
erm
that's the that's the payments that you can get erm
the grants that you can get on top of your basic your basic supplementary benefit rate
at the moment yeah
at the moment yeah
yeah
mhm
so in t erm with your regard to you were saying about the fact that there's a lot of unemployment in the flats
mhm
erm what impact do you think it has when you have a complex in which there is such a is such a high level of unemployment in which so few people are working i mean the ar the area itself do you think it has certain implications or not
i think it i cer i certainly feel myself that it UNK
mhm
it UNK an UNK the individual problem
it UNK the possibility of getting out of that situation because you've got so many other people against whom you're competing for work
and also it UNK the erm demand on housing stock because none of those people are gonna be in a position to have very much choice when it come when it comes to finding somewhere to live
and g m quite a lot of them are going to be dependent on rented accommodation and in particular well both council cou both council rented accommodation and private rented accommodation
erm so you're going to get a lot of kind of landlord tenant type problems
erm
what about your own
you've got what you know in terms of when you've got say that you have a very high percentage of people all in the same position living in one area
i mean what does that doing to how does that what impact do you think that in terms of the c on the community do you think that
on the basis of your experience with tenants here and the fact that there's so many people in the same position i mean does that act is that
i don't er
erm i don't think it i mean we all know that you know er the unemployed are the least UNK group of people in as a group that
mhm
the fact that there might be a lot of unemployed people doesn't UNK around doesn't necessarily mean that they feel that they feel that they have a lot in common with each other in terms of
yeah
er it's not like if you had a lot of people in the flats who were all working up at for example you'd have a lot more kind of community spirit going and a lot and a lot more common erm feeling i think between people
mhm
and of course this whole area i mean this whole area was built at a time when those factories were at their height in the sort of late nineteenth century
and all
mhm
these all these terraced houses and a quite a lot of them were actually built by and
erm and this whole area is was built on that kind of industrial expansion at the end of the nineteenth century
a and i think i mean that has that itself has had an effect on the on the on the f on UNK feelings for this area
i mean there are a lot of people of people in who have lived here for a long time and lived here ever since they were born
a lot of old people we're talking about who have a very strong feeling of community within the area erm so i think that community spirit exists but i think but i think it exists despite the condition of unemployment that exists in the area
mhm
and y am i right am i right in saying that you'd say that e even though it may exist in itself that it may even be in fact be less in the flats than it is in the in the wi in that in the wider area
right in saying that you and that the fact that the fact
i wouldn't i the fact
there's such unemployment that the UNK even higher that i mean it's pretty high in the area
i what i'm saying is i'm saying that unemployment as a as a as a condition
and if it especially
d
high levels of unemployment exist in the flats
and erm er erm doesn't necessarily bring people together in fact because it's a it it's a very UNK condition to be in
because you're not because you're inside a lot you don't have to go out every day you don't you don't have anything very specific to do at different times during the day
erm it doesn't it does it doesn't bind people together
mhm
erm it's a very hard thing for people in that situation to organize a as a group er so what i'm saying is that the level of unemployment in itself doesn't bind people together but given that is a long established kind of traditional working class area there is that tradition of community that exists anyway
mhm
over and above the conditions that kind of UNK now
mhm
if you like
i feel that very strongly i mean a lot of people have said a lot of people in the flats have said well i don't want to move out of the area i don't like living in the flats but i don't want to move out of the
so is that kind of identification with the with the area itself
yeah
even if people may be quite UNK
from the flats
to from the flats themselves
that's right
absolutely
mhm
in te er in UNK in terms of erm the flats themselves and the tenants you've met have they what kind o have they complained very much about the flats
have you have you had much contact in terms of that
related to the problems in with
yeah
with regard to say repairs or the
yeah
complex itself
erm people don't actually complain that much about the complex itself surprisingly
mhm
enough
they'll complain about an individual flat
yeah what are their con
and i mean things like UNK erm inadequate heating erm noise from other tenants erm
but noise in what sense what kind of noise are they talking about
are they talking about
well it would depend but i mean there are various of nuisance from noise in the flats or anywhere where you've got a lot of people put together all living in a s fairly small area
but erm but they don't they don't really complain about the complex as a whole
they'll complain about their own i individual bit of it
does the er yeah
if they complain at all
mhm
and i think it's the tenants' group which got together the sum of all those complaints m erm which er and put them together to find what those common complaints were
which was then highlighted in the c in the structural report which went before the council which was the basis of their decision to UNK all the tenants
mhm
and what do you feel what are your feelings and with regard to the fact the flats are coming down
i just wonder what they're going to do with that space
mhm
about that what are your feelings with in terms with regard to the tenants themselves
i mean do you think it's a good thing that the flats are coming down for the people who are actually living there
or not
i think it i think it's a good thing that the problems have been acknowledged
yeah
and that the existing tenants are being UNK
but i worry about whether that amount of housing stock is going to be replaced in the area cos that is obviously very important
mhm
so what you're s so what you're saying is that erm one of the consequences could be that even as people are being UNK from one of the risks is that other people who are on the h waiting list
and also
may suffer may well suffer
and also that there might be there might be fewer houses in the
mhm
so that it would have the affect of decreasing the population in the and decreasing the amount of housing that's available to people in the
mhm
cos i don't i believe there's been there've been no firm proposals for that site yet
is that right
that's right yeah
yeah
mm
you're telling me erm prior to the interview about erm compensation about work that the erm law centre are doing with regard to compensation
yes
erm can you tell us a bit about that
erm yes
erm
that's compensation is it for the tenants living in the flats
right
could you explain that
i know that the tenants are getting s get so will be getting so much money
er when they leave
on moving yeah th
that's right well each tenant each tenant on when they move are given
yeah
a home loss and
yeah
UNK payment erm to compensate them for the cost of UNK cost of moving and
yeah
and kind of UNK themselves elsewhere and setting up home elsewhere
mhm
erm now one of the things that the tenants' action group asked us about initially when they asked us to get in involved in the in the advice sessions in the flats was whether or not the tenants would be able to claim additional compensation over and above what was already being offered
we're still waiting for a green form extension to grant t to be granted
yeah
to the tenants erm for an independent environmental health officer to come along and do an independent environmental report on the flats
erm a green form is a it's gr green form money is money which is given by the law society erm depending on how much work how much time is spent on each case
mm
and in this case as we we're working for a group of tenants we can ask for an extension on one form to cover so
mm
many tenants
yeah
and kind of use a test case for that
erm if we get the extension and if we can get the report done we can then use that report with a view to either one taking an action for compensation by a test case for breach of the UNK repairing obligations
mhm
and or two with a view to proposing to r reduce the UNK value of the flats
erm
so would th would that s i mean if that in terms of the UNK value would that mean the rents would fall
no it would mean the rates would fall
the rates would fall
yes so th so therefore as a consequence the rent that people are paying each week would
yeah presumably yeah
yeah
mhm
it would have a it would have a knock on effect
two was that element sorry and the in terms of the so that the rates would fall and what's the other the sorry t that's is that related to them erm
well i mean we don't think we it's i think it's unlikely that this is going to have any effect until possibly all the f all the tenants are moved out anyway
yeah
in which case it won't have any effect on the on the rent
so what could it am i right in saying that it's related to the work that you're doing is related to the particular circumstances the particular problems that people living in flats have had
yes
over and above the compensation which people would get anyway i in this situation
that's right
by saying that
that's right
yeah
and the hope is to actually be able to get some recognition of that
that's right
and hence erm
i
compensation to c some kind of
right
compensation to cover that
basically er the broad overall description would be to compensate for the conditions that the tenants had been living in prior to the move
and
mhm
i think that's covered by my first point
erm the possible action for compensation for breach of UNK repairing obligations
mhm
and we'd be talking about the kinds of things which were brought out in the structural report i think there
mhm that's the report that erm yeah
you know to do with con the construction of the flats
mhm
so how l in terms of this how long for this
how long could this go on for
it go on for quite a while
it could go on for years possibly
it might go on f it could take two or three years
mhm
and how many of you working on that
right carrying on erm for the subject of erm compensation over and above erm that which is normally given to people who move from one place to another when they're f h have to be
UNK
yeah
erm you've said kind o you said erm the k you've ba told me the kind of case that one would try and present related to the fa the you know the erm the structure the lack of repair of the flats
erm so how many of you are actually involved you know in the in erm the law centre
is there a few of you who are actually involved in that kind of work
well this is been
yeah
th this is been in this particular aspect of the work is being done by john who's a solicitor
yeah
mhm
yeah
and erm what kind of what kind of support are you getting er from
what kind of response are you getting from tenants towards this work that you're doing
were they are they aware of it
to be to be to be honest to be honest i don't know what the what what's actually happening on a day to day basis with this
yeah
erm it's a very long term thing and john's been working through the tenants' action group on it so i personally don't know what the kind of take up is on that er
mhm
and wh and what the response of the tenants has been
so you'd have to ask him
so ba but what you are but what you are telling what you have told me is that erm there is there is erm work being done to try and get people compensation in addition to what they would normally get
i i'm say i'm
as result of
saying that there's a been an application for more money
yeah
to enable us to have a UNK have another report done which would then be used as part of the evidence in conjunction with a test case to
where would the case actually s where would it go to i mean say when you've got all the evidence
what do you do with it then
th well then we'd have to we'd have to present it
to
to the council
yeah
and so it would be a case of actually negotiating with the council hopefully
well it'd be it mi it might have to it mi it might have to go
go
through the courts
yeah
but er i you know i don't really know what where john's got to on that
so i can't really say
mhm
erm i can only talk very generally about that
mhm
er and on the basis of your knowledge i mean in terms of the flats when you've s you've been there f er and also you've erm worked with some of the tenants that have been down here i mean how what do you think er in terms of the living conditions i mean how er in the flats i mean how do they how do you see them
it's the it's the typical concrete jungle
it's erm anonymous and UNK and empty
erm once you go ins into the into the complex the UNK the kind of squares which o occupy the space between each erm block of flats are usually fairly empty
erm there have been attempts to UNK them up at various times
there's a tenants hall which is very UNK painted
and there's a children's playground
erm but on the o on the whole these are areas which belong to no one
they erm there's less there's less a feeling of community in there than there would be on the average street
erm and in a sense that might be because the flats the area within the flat isn't a UNK
it's like a dead end
you only go into the flats if you're visiting someone or if you live there so there's no there's none of that UNK and UNK that you get on a on a regular street
erm so i think possibly people don't really feel responsible for that for those that space within the flats which isn't actually right outside their front door
mhm
do you think
and
that's yeah and
and it does have it has a very bleak aspect to it to me
even on the UNK day it's erm it's it it's very grey and very bleak
mhm
so what do you think you know when people if people don't feel that the area outside their door is a an area s you know that's part of their area it's an area that they've got responsibility what consequences does do you think that has
if they're i
i think it gives it an air of UNK
erm it isn't necessarily UNK than the average street it doesn't necessarily have more dog shit or more paper UNK around it but neither does it have a any sense of activity within it
i th i think i think that's the key i think e i think there there's n there's no activity there's no UNK activity
and you get the feeling that people kind of beat a way through to their particular flat and out again without looking either to left or right really
and that's a very extreme view and it's c but er it's the impression that i've got of the flats
it's a very personal impression
mhm
erm
do you have you had much contact erm with anyone who with erm any parents at the flats that ha have been bringing up kids there
and any of their experiences
or not
erm well i kn i've known i've i know tenants in the flats who have got children
yeah
and
yeah
how do they how do they feel
you know about having t how do they feel in terms of bringing up kids in the flats
i mean do they have do they have any views or
well as i say i had i don't i haven't really had any involvement really with talking to people about their experience of living in the flats until people knew that they were going to be moved out eventually
yeah
and that does tend to colour people's what people say and what people think about it
erm i don't know if i said this already in this interview but there does seem at the moment to be a general air of people waiting to move
yeah i think i have said that haven't i
mhm
yeah
which kind of UNK their immediate problems
they kind of UNK their immediate problems as they wait to move out
to some extent
i think the last point we've we were we were er mentioning about erm bringing up erm young people in the flats
erm in terms of bringing up young people in the flats how do you s how do you see the do you think it's a good area or a or a or erm a bad area to bring up kids
cos quite a g quite a few young people have actually been brought up in the flats haven't they
i mean
yeah
there's quite a lot have moved out now but erm still are some there i think
and how do you see it as being an area to bring up kids
in the flats themselves
yeah in the flats themselves living in the flats i mean s have to look at the actual local facilities as well i mean they're i mean i suppose that's a factor as well to take into account
yeah
the flats themselves are quite big i think and
yeah
quite big enough for fa for a small family
small depending on how many bedrooms there are
erm but i think the problems to do with the flats are the kind of overall problems of access to the flats and er the actual structural condition of conditions of the flats
the UNK which is very bad for young babies for example elderly people erm and the condition of the of the of the space between the flats erm which
so you're talking about wh the condition of the space between the flats aren't you
i'm talking about i'm talking about the s the open spaces between the flats
yeah
and the problem of access to the flats and sometimes the necessity to walk quite a long way before you can get out onto the street which would be a problem for young mothers with small children as equally it would be a problem for elderly people or disabled people
mhm
er and that is that is one of the problems within the flats that having got once got into the complex you might have quite a long way to go before you actually find where you're going
equally erm and this is a kind of aside there's the problem for the UNK of not knowing how the flats where you know where each flat where each block is so you get in there and you and you're trying to find for example or wherever and you haven't got a clue sort of where to start
erm it's a bit like it's a
is that yeah
bit like a UNK in that sense
is that the way you found it when you first started erm
wh when we first started working there we went right round all the flats and we put leaflets in every door so we got
that was with regard to er
that was with regard to the advice sessions the
yeah
weekly advice sessions
so we actually saw it all erm it's actually quite a lot bigger than it looks
there's a lot more flats there than you would even think of
it's amazing
lots it's quite a small area but they're really quite neatly packed in
mm
mhm
and you touched on erm the problems that erm so that living in the flats can have for somebody who's disabled or elderly
do you feel that do you feel that those are raised or not
do you feel that the flats are not particularly suitable for those groups
do you think fo do you think that who was disabled
would have difficulty pro possibly in actually getting to their flat
mhm
erm the actual UNK the geography of the flats isn't UNK to easy access within the complex
you said also that yo that there could be problems with young mothers
for the same reason
yeah for the same reason
and also for the er elderly as well
yeah
and also having got into the f into the complex i think maybe having said that the spaces you know the space between the blocks is erm isn't cared for erm
in terms of it not being cared for yeah i mean who do you
i don't mean not ca
yeah
not i don't mean not clean or not tidy
yeah
i mean having no s no it has no th there is no collective
responsibility for it
it doesn't make you feel it possibly wouldn't make people feel very happy about having to walk a long a long way within the complex once having got into it
you might want to be able to sort of get to their flat very quickly
mhm
t and one final question
erm we touched on quite a few of the quite a few of the erm bad points about living in the flats
would you sa you know on the basis of erm your contact with tenants erm in terms of living in flats are there any good points that people have made about living there t i mean
yeah
well yeah
i mean
yeah
it's ver a very central i mean
yeah
they're in a very good position
very prime position for shops and
yeah
for local and for sort of local UNK for the forest it's very close to the forest
it's on a main shopping route into the city centre
erm it's hello
right erm before we broke off erm this last question i'm going to ask you were s you were saying about erm in terms of erm some of the good points of h the you were talking about it being pretty central erm for buses erm being near the forest erm what about erm in terms of local shops
i mean what what've you found
do people do people t tend to use those
oh yes very much
i mean a lot of people who live on the don't go into town at all
don't know where it is
erm and they use local shops almost exclusively
so is a i it is a very thriving area it is a very thriving shopping centre for the people who live in the immediate area
mhm
what about the facilities for local people
i mean do people find tend to see those as being a plus or not you know
how do you mean
facilities other than shops er erm
what you mean like the boys'
club
yeah er
erm yes er there's a community centre on
yeah
now what's
yeah
that
yeah what
that belongs to the church st paul's church
yeah
erm there's
what kind of contact do they have much contact with the people in the flats you not sure if you're not
y i don't know you'd have to ask them
sure on that
no i'm not sure on that
there's what's the boys' club there's a library
there's erm a community arts centre which is used by both individuals and groups within the area
erm and there's the youth and community centre which is on the corner of and
so there is quite a concentration of activity within the area
whether or not that is actually used by the people who live in the flats i don't know to be honest
that would have to that would have to come out of any kind of interview with workers in those other groups really
right thanks very much thank you
so the patches
yes
the patches right now you're on we put you the UNK fifties
yeah
right
because you'd stopped the UNK and how are you getting on with those
you've had your first month's worth
er the first couple of weeks were fine
yeah
i felt a lot better
but i just feel tired again
oh it's got worse
yeah i'm just tired
and i notice as well er more so at night when i'm watching t UNK or even when i go to bed
mm
my heart starts racing and i can feel the UNK in my neck and like my UNK
mm
and i don't know why
right
any hot UNK
no
that i haven't had
right
now then you was put on UNK it was given at the hospital wasn't it
yes it we because i was er my heart was racing and
yeah
er what have you there
and before that you were having er horrendous UNK periods
yeah
yeah
let's have a look at er oh that's right oh that's a seven
hmm
no well yeah
well i think the thing to do is to actually give you the higher dose patches
mhm
wh when you put people on the patches for the first time because the hormone goes straight into the system rather than having to go through the gut
aha
if you've been short of hormone you'll get a big boost straight away and you'll get the benefits
but if it's not quite enough although you'll get the initial benefits they can tend to wear off so some people are better on the higher some people are better on the lower dose
and it looks like you could do with more
aha
the next step up is the hundreds and you use them in exactly the same way one twice a week
instead of being round they're sort of sort of UNK
aha
type
now the last person i had moved on to the hundreds had enormous problems with the UNK of them
so if you find they're not sticking i would be delighted to hear cos that means it's not just this woman it's actually
aha
the patches that are causing
yeah
problems
now in her case we put her on two fifties but that i uses up an awful lot of skin and it's a real hassle so er
i can imagine
so er i think that'd be the sensible thing to do
now
i checked your blood pressure only four weeks ago and that was absolutely
yeah
normal
er what we'll do is that i'll give you another eight of these now if they're a lot better just s give a ring in
yeah
okay
er that's ring for repeat and wh what we'd do is give you three monthly UNK
mm
after that well i would er it all depends who does the repeat prescription i suppose but er i would give you three monthly UNK
is that okay
yeah that's fine
you've just got to be aware they're a slightly different shape and they're also bigger
aha
and that's the other thing about it you see you've got to stick them down carefully
but they say that they won't come off when you go swimming and you take your clothes on and off
we shall see
mm
unfortunately they've got the market UNK with these patches
mhm
one twice weekly the so they're there's only the these
no other firm does them so you can't say let's try this UNK patches cos they don't do them
actually i found them a lot more convenient than
yeah
than the other form
mm
cos you tend to forget
yes
with the pills
yes
some people say they're so convenient they forget these as well
oh no i keep it at the side of my bed with the strip telling me
oh right
which day i've got to change them
right
and i they're there all the time so
good
i always remember
that's fine
okay then
okay then thanks a lot
see you
bye
right then UNK er when did you move to the flats
december eighty one
and erm where did you move from
i was near at the time with UNK in mansfield
and before that
before that i was erm living with some fr friends in liverpool
and before that i was m back in nottingham
where did you UNK from
nottingham
where about
edge lane estate
it's in between sherwood and UNK
did you live there with your parents
mm
was it did you have any er any brothers or sisters
i've got i've got two brothers and one sister
do they live in nottingham
my sister lives in edinburgh me two brothers live in nottingham
do they live in the flats
no
ted used to
he used to live on the erm in the but he doesn't any more
when did he move out
ooh
about eighteen month ago
might be more yeah about eighteen month ago
was that to move to another council house
no bought his own house
erm compared to other places you've lived in erm how does this flat stand up to the comparison
well i mainly up until when i started to live on my own i mainly lived in bed and UNK or shared houses so this is one of the better sort
really
it's really my ow first very own place of my own
do you like it
no
i never have liked it
why not
well for a start half of them the shape of them isn't very UNK it's not very good for ar arranging things
and er you can't really do much because of the stone walls and there's too much window and too much noise and you get quite a few UNK in them and they're just generally not very nice at all
in fact there's only two good points about them and that's you've always got hot water and your h heating you're always warm
that's the only two good points about them
you say you had the shape of the rooms what sort
mhm
well i mean l look at this shape i mean it's a like an l shape it's erm very UNK
i mean having to come upstairs before you even get into the house isn't very good either cos i mean with kids you've got to carry the UNK up and everything and carry kids up and carry all your shopping up it's not it's not very practical having them upstairs
erm y you say the UNK alright
mm
erm i mean does it deliver enough heat all the time
most of the time yeah i mean they're usually very good
i've only had ever about two complaints in four and a half years and that's not very bad that's only because the filter needed cleaning mostly
what about your hot water
do you get that
is that
mhm
part of it
oh yeah
it's always there i mean erm that's one of the advantages you can have a bath every day
that's something i'll miss when i move cos paying for it you don't well i know you pay for it here but it's all in and
UNK
er now why did you actually move to the flats
cos it was the only it was either here or the balloon woods cos i was er i was given an emergency placing it was either here or balloon woods and at the time i didn't fancy balloon woods but i wish i'd taken it now i'd be i'd have my own place by
erm so you were on emergency is that because you're a single parent
mm yeah
er you say there was a choice between this and balloon woods why did you actually choose
well cos it was in town it was nearer to shops and erm i'd heard that keeping balloon UNK flats warm was costing people a hell of a lot of money
cos it was in with the electric bills and i didn't want that and that was one of the advantages that made me decide to have here cos i knew that the heating was in with the rent
erm so did you have any friends when on the estate at first
not at the time no but i'm i knew people that were on here from other places you know so i met
other people so
how do you find it erm er UNK with people
you can't really around here cos everybody's suspicious of everybody else
and er as i say the only people i know on here now are people that i've met actually off here
or through people that i knew before
you say people are suspicious of each other wh what do you mean by that
well i mean erm i dunno really you sort of get the feeling that they're suspicious cos i mean there's so many things go on here that they're not sure erm about you i mean if somebody else doesn't know you then they're not sure about you
so d what sort of things go on in the flats
well
UNK erm drugs prostitution that sort of thing
and d th do they actually go on or is it sort of exaggerated
it's not exaggerated
it does go on
er do you think it gives a particularly bad name
oh yes it definitely does
er did you know about this when you were offered the flat
did you know it had
oh yeah oh yeah
i knew about it
but it didn't bother
no cos i knew i wouldn't associate with erm people and i wouldn't get into it
i mean i'm not messing against what anybody else does and i wouldn't try and interfere with what anybody else does but i wouldn't get involved with them
right UNK can you can you just go over s the places you lived in before you actually moved to the flat
well i've lived in quite a few places i've i say before i came here i was at mother and baby home and before that i was living with friends in liverpool and before that i was in nottingham at a bed and breakfast place UNK and er
were they was that through the council
no it wasn't
no
and then erm before that i got i was living with friends again in nottingham
and then erm i was at home for a while and then i was living with friends in birmingham and in between time i've been to leeds and london
not for very long though but erm most of the time i spent away living in birmingham
and you say you've never lived anywhere sort of similar to the flats
you've not lived
no
in
so they've have they been terraced or something like that
yeah one i shared a house in er in forest fields
where where's that
forest fields
yeah
i shared a house there
and erm so i haven't really had a place of my own until i got this one and it's usually UNK or sharing
yeah
now erm there are quite a few sort of single parents on the flats now erm are there any problems that you've had which possibly other people have had with living in the flats
any er particularly bad points that make it difficult for you
well erm i have been UNK a few times to do a few things you know erm like i say prostitution they think probably because you're on your own everybody else because one say one person in the block is one then you are one as well you know
you're UNK with the same brush
and erm
plus i have had i have been m mugged while i have been out
i had my purse pinched that wasn't very good
erm and you do feel shut in at nights when you're on your own
erm which isn't any help at all it shows the people they're on their own anyway cos you feel more lonely that way
you get more lonely which doesn't help in here and i mean say i mean the view isn't very n this view is very UNK and if you'd got something to look at it wouldn't matter so much but erm
not re
okay
yeah and it's very lonely in here if you don't really know people
erm especially now that everybody's moving away and most of the people you know have probably gone or going or they probably won't be moving near you any more
did y you said that you had your purse stolen did someone actually break into the flat
no i was walking up the UNK and it was ripped out of my hand actually
i cos i had the strap on my arm it was pulled off that
did you actually did you go to the police about it
yeah
did they do anything
no
what could they do
you know it happens quite a few times doesn't it
erm so y you never got it back or anything
no
so are y i don't think we actually established are you erm are you unemployed
yeah
so you're on supplementary
yeah
erm have you had any jobs in the past have you worked in the past
i was seventeen i worked at the flying horse
it's a pub isn't it
yeah it's a pub UNK hotel it's a hotel thing
erm UNK you find it living on the money get on social security
it's difficult but you can manage
i mean anyone who says they can't manage on what they get er they can't feed the kids on what they get probably go in the pubs five or si six nights a week and smoke too much and but erm i mean these never go without a meal or anything like that
i mean we're no when we have s like egg and chips it's cos we want to not because we've got to
you know
i mean do you manage to keep s sort of quite a good diet
or do y
oh yeah
i mean every sunday we have a sunday dinner i mean it's usually chicken cos it's the cheapest one there is but i mean we still have a sunday dinner we have fresh veg and everything
i mean there's not many probably not many families round here that could say that
do you actually shop locally then
yeah
and erm how do you do you do your shopping do you do it once every fortnight or do you
no i er do it as i need it actually
i mean i get a few things in every week that you know that you need that you know er i go out on monday and get everything else for the week like washing powder and that sort of thing but u for food i just get it every day
do you go into the centre much
about once a week
what's that is that for shop food and things
no just to go out cos i'm wanting
just to go out on a monday with her cos she doesn't have nursery on a monday UNK
so we go out and have a meal out
i mean i can have even afford meals out
so do you budget quite tightly then
mhm
i mean even when i smoked i did
i mean i could s i could still get what i needed
do you think a lot of people do that or do you think you're particularly sort of
i don't know people l i'm of them say they can't afford to pay the kids and get the food for the kids and they'll have to give them chips a couple of every day of the week or whatever but th there's no need for that
i mean if people smoke too much i mean they should put the kids before the c the cigarettes and erm people i have heard say that i've seen in the pub three or four nights a week
if they can afford to go there then why don't they you know if you have two pints in there i mean it's a meal really cos i could give these kids a meal for about a one pound one pound fifty
and that's feeding us
do you go out to the pub much yourself
no
i don't
so you don't go out for drinks
no i mean last time i went out would be erm well i've been out in the afternoon a few times with my boyfriend but the last time i went out in the evening
would be about eighteen month ago
and it doesn't bother me cos i put their them first
d so i mean what do you find to do i mean how do you spend your time
oh me and my boyfriend play cards and watch telly and that sort of thing
play UNK
right so you sort of er find activities that you can actually
yeah do in the house
yeah
do together
er y do you find it difficult to find people to look after the children or is it just that you wouldn't want to go out
no i could get a baby UNK it's just that i don't want to go out
i mean my money is erm
mm
you know the money is put towards their f food and things rather than giving it to somebody else
er where do the erm children go in the day time
do they go to a play er s school
well erm adrian goes on a UNK and UNK to nursery and on a UNK and UNK to his dad and UNK goes on a tuesday and thursday and friday to nursery
which UNK that
how did you get the n th the them into that
well she need needed it for erm her speech and then when he came along he just nearly automatically got one because everybody got one in really
well not automatically but they thought it would be a good idea to have him in
to
what
keep an eye on him see if his speech was too slow in talking
erm w why didn't you send them to the ones on the UNK on the flats
i couldn't get them in there
was it full
mhm
i mean there's not really one in the flats that is suitable really
wh what do you mean what's
i mean they need a nursery not a UNK there's a difference
i see
erm d do your children have many friends on the flats
do they mix with the children in the flats
no
she's got one friend over there erm on but not really
not really no
do you let them out to play
no
why's that
because you think they're too young or what
i don't erm yeah i do think they're too young to be out here because er you can't keep an eye on them
especially nowadays with things going i mean i'm not saying really round here like that but you never know do you
right now you've said where you've where you've lived before and how you got here erm now you're on the phasing aren't you
er
yeah in fact i've got a i've been allocated a place but it's not ready for me yet
yeah
so you're UNK i mean phase four right
phase four yeah
right
now wh where did you put your name down to go
UNK sherwood or UNK
as i say i've got a house in UNK but it's not ready yet
they're doing it up or doing something to it
what why did you decide to go to those areas
well UNK my mother lives at UNK i thought it'd be nice to be near her my dad lives up sherwood and i used to i used to live up sherwood it's a good place and got a good school
and i think UNK speaks for itself i mean it's don't you
erm so what's the place like that you got
three bedroomed house front and back garden
and i haven't as i say i haven't seen it yet but erm i've had a look at it but not actually been inside it because they're doing still doing it up
and is it the sort of place you were looking for
mhm
three bedroom and everything
yeah
erm will you be glad to move out of the flats
definitely
definitely
will there be anything you miss about them
as i say only the heating and the hot water
that i must technically pay for it
do you think you'll be able to ma
that is the only thing
do you think you'll be able to manage with the bills and that
yeah
right then
now you worked for the erm the tenants' action group didn't you for a time
yeah
how wh when was that
erm about nineteen eighty two to three it'd be
wh what was actually going on at the tenants' group then
a at the time they were trying to get this place looked at and UNK and everything to get it you know to see what they could do about it get it closed down but er they hadn't got that far with that then
erm they hadn't got a survey going they'd got coming round to have a look at it and they'd got the environmental health from london to have a survey of it and er everything
y you were secretary weren't you
yes
erm what was the feeling that came over to you from the tenants' group at the time
did it feel like it was a well organized group or did it feel
well a at the time they'd just changed over from the erm tenants' development association to the tenants' action group so it was a bit UNK to begin with cos we were still sorting out the everything from what they'd left over and things so but once we'd got that all so once they'd got that all sorted out yeah it was
erm did you think it reflected the views of the tenants
most of them yeah
most of them
about ninety percent of them
and did you have anything to do with the development association
no i didn't
so y you wouldn't know about the ins and outs of what went on when they
no
mhm
erm so y you were you were with the tenants' erm association eighty two eighty three
mm
erm have you had anything to do with them since
have you
no not really no
do have you do you go to the meetings
no
is that what cos you know you're moving out now
mm
erm i just want to go back and talk about a few things we just touched on earlier
er now you were saying about crime in the area
erm have y you had your purse stolen
mm
have you ever had trouble with UNK or anything like that
well a couple of times
but er maybe once or twice as i say i usually go out with my kids and they don't usually stop you
look at me but otherwise you know they don't usually stop you if you've got a kid with you
and can you does it i mean obviously it UNK you but i mean
well i just tell them to get lost in not so polite words
so what do you actually think about the er the UNK and
well i mean er i've got nothing against them
i mean in fact i i'm one of the people that believe that in a way it should be it should be UNK
i think it should be UNK
but erm it's the UNK i mean i've always thought that if it wasn't for UNK there's going to be a hell of a lot more UNK around so
mm
mm
so just keeping on the same sort of subject of sex drugs and
yeah
violence erm the other people i've spoken to have mentioned blues parties now d have you ever had
yeah i've had blues parties next door
could you just t tell me about what actually happened
well it wasn't too bad actually cos when i went upstairs and shut every door and i wouldn't didn't really hear anything
next door didn't really bother me cos once i'd shut the door shut the doors it was there was hardly any noise but then erm the guy that had got the place he wasn't living there lent it out to somebody else blues and they moved them u upstairs as well
and erm i wasn't actually in the bedroom and that did bother me
i had one night of that and when he came round in the morning i told him
i mean luckily enough i went to junior school with him
i mean if i hadn't have known him then there's no way i could have talked to him about it
i mean i says look i says i'm not i'm not saying you can't have your parties or whatever i says but i says not in the bedrooms
i says er that is going a bit too far i think
erm how loud were they
i mean did they keep you awake
very loud that night very loud
i say the other night i say it didn't really bother me but like i'm a heavy UNK anyway
but i could just not get to sleep that night and she was only a baby at the time she couldn't sleep
er what time did they start and finish did the blues parties
erm about one o'clock and finished about half past six seven
mm do you get any trouble from the people coming out of the parties or going in did they
no the door knocked once or twice but i mean that didn't bother me so i was asleep m most of the time
erm er is that the only experience you've had with blues parties
mm
mm right now you mention that you phoned the police about when you had your purse stolen erm are y have what do you think of the police presence around the flats
i mean is it helpful or what
non UNK
and if it is i mean they don't do much
erm
have you seen policemen UNK the flats
oh yeah i've seen them
i've seen them but i mean if they saw anything i think they'd just turn a blind eye to most of it
mm
have you seen anything like that happen or is
well i don't know how true it is but i have heard from somebody i know whose husband was a UNK and he came to UNK a toilet at the erm cricket players when it closed down he had to UNK it
and he found a hell of a lot of flesh down the toilet human flesh
and he said from the looks of it there must have been you know sort of dead whatever it was and there was a couple of fingers and a couple of toes right
but erm police went to visit him again and says erm you know that's it you know you won't you won't even be needed to make a statement about where you found it which he thought was a bit funny
i mean whether they UNK it up or not i don't know
but i mean i say i don't know how true that is i mean i only heard that through somebody else
i see
er talking about er UNK and er people like that have erm have how are you finding UNK getting things repaired in the flat
well i had to i had to wait for about eight months or was it s six months to get one of my lights fixed but for er other things they were quite quick actually
is that by using the housing office on the flat
yeah
are they very helpful there
mm
yes
i found them so
do you think it helps them being up with the
oh yeah
er i think it does i think they should have one of those sort of places in every not in every complex but in every estate
d do you think your amenity wise er the flats like they they've got the housing and the clubs and the UNK and stuff like that do you think you're very badly off for that or
no amenity wise you're okay but i mean UNK doesn't make up for sort of living standards you've got does it
s so i mean do you try and u do you use things around the area
er
not much no
wh why's that
because i just don't go out much that's all
mm
do you think is a
shh
particularly friendly place or
no
no
er what makes you say that
cos i haven't found it so that's why
but i mean d do you think the people are more UNK around here than they are in other parts of the town
yeah
just the people living around here
did erm
yeah i think it's b as i say it's because i think people are wary i mean you know not sure who's who
er do you find people mix around here very well though
i mean s i mean there's it's a multi racial area
do you think that people mix well or is it a do you feel
no everybody keeps themselves to themselves i think which is a shame really cos erm i think they do that all over the country anyway most of them they keep themselves to themselves
right
now you're moving to UNK you're moving to UNK erm just say in five years time they got rid of the flats erm and they built houses on here on the site would you move back
no
shh
erm is that because of the v the area or because
well i'll be settled in my own little place by then i mean i don't want to move back here plus that fact that i wouldn't want to move back here anyway
hello
hello
do have a seat right what shall we do with you today
i seem to have done something silly with my shoulder it's awfully stiff and
which one
this one
right but you
can't think what
well we were at a venture park on er sunday and i reckon i probably did something on one of the UNK without realizing it
no
cos it came on sort of about middle of the day
right you haven't been from anything or pulling anything too hard or
n other than carry my daughter
mm
since she's a bit of lump nowadays
now you don't need to take anything off
can you lift it up right up
yeah
pretty good can you get it behind your get your hand behind your neck
turn it ro er okay
can y
can't feel it
can you turn it round and get it behind your back
can you put your hand behind your back like that
turn it round
good okay
can you can you actually do that
can you swing it right round so you can do that
y yeah i can
you're not allowed to use that one
okay good
okay
so you've got a good range of movement okay
yes yeah
what happens if you lift something or pull something
i get a sharp UNK pain
if i'm br even
yeah
when i'm breathing
yeah
i can feel it in my in my
yeah okay just relax
what i'm going to do is to examine now i'm going to go up the collar bone first over the shoulder pad t shirt with a shoulder pad
i know they went out with the UNK didn't they
you okay over there
yeah
over the top
good that's fine
are you okay with the front of the joint in there
yeah
yeah
it's only in
UNK areas
i in the side of the joint there
is that okay
it feels a bit tender but
yeah
it's okay yeah
well yeah
over the top
yeah that's fine
under there
yeah
now if i come round just sit forward slightly for me that's right
if i come round the shoulder UNK muscles round there
anything
no
if i was to sort of pinch the muscle at the back here
if you can find it that's
huge muscle
is that tender at all
no
okay can you point to where you get most UNK
right in
oh
the centre there
right in there
oh okay
mm
is that tender to press in there
oh yes
yes
is that UNK there
yes
that's fine
i'm
now this isn't your s shoulder directly but it is the muscles that hold and support and turn the shoulder UNK and of course whenever you do anything with your shoulder the shoulder UNK moves with it
so it will tend to pull and it almost definitely is either reaching or pulling or holding something or holding on for your life
so i've just UNK something
venture park
yeah
it's
yeah
a muscle pull
but the trouble is with muscle pulls they heal fairly slowly
they tend to get worse over a fe over a few days before they start to get better as well
but it will improve and the important thing is pain relief if necessary because you must keep your shoulder moving
if you keep your shoulder still because it doesn't hurt so much it'll tend to UNK up like a UNK
mm
gate
practise first thing in the morning
so ke that's right so keep it moving and the shoulder needs to be to be able to go all the way up all the way round back you know it's a very mobile joint
yeah
but nothing serious though
good
so i can write it's a lower full range of movement mobilize
that's the important phrase and if you find it's easier to keep it mobile if you've taken some UNK or UNK then by all means do that
right
would it be possible to find out what UNK results were because she's had a urine test and she's extremely sore and they've asked for another urine test and i'm
that's right
a little bit concerned
wh we hav we haven't grown any bugs but we have found red blood cells and er white blood cells there which are the sort of blood cells you get in wee if there's been UNK inflammation or infection round
so it points towards an infection but it doesn't prove it
UNK
UNK in kids are actually very important to identify because they all need investigating
right
is there anything else that i can do for her cos she says she is in quite a lot of UNK at the moment
stacks and stacks to drink
the more dilute the urine the less it'll UNK and burn
and it'll tend
to UNK things through
but we must have another sample and we
yeah
don't want the first wee of the mor
we don't want the first one in the morning
ah
any other one
so let her empty her bladder after it's been sitting there overnight and then a nice fresh sample
as long as it gets here before
ah right
half ten
the first one in the morning often has all sorts of rubbish in
it tends to be rather concentrated and isn't really the one we want
that's probably why we had trouble last time
well maybe yes
okay have you got a fresh bottle
i have yes
okay
that's that
right okay thank you very much
not at all we'll see what happens with her but the sooner we get that the sooner we can take things on if we need to
lovely okay
thank you very much for your help
not at all
if you have further problems pop back
right thanks
see you
bye
hello dorothy
the s it isn't dorothy it's me
oh sorry joan i'm sorry
i do apologize i really do apologize for that
it's
oh ta
are you
yeah
well that's what i've er she said i've got to come and see you first
oh i see right that's fine yeah
right let's have a look whereabouts is it
i've got two actually there's one there
ee
it's er yeah that should be fine we shouldn't have any great problem with that
yeah the other one
the other one is this high that's a
yeah well we could do the same with both of those
they're both they're both neither of them are actually UNK okay
they're both rather UNK skin tanks
skin tanks
there's two ways of doing this you can either put some local anaesthetic in and actually burn them off but that often leaves a bit of a UNK
or you can actually try freezing them to kill them and then they just drop off on their own
and that's
mm
probably the UNK method of the two
and certainly the easiest for you
erm i'd probably give it a go on freezing first the only thing about the freezing is sometimes it doesn't work first time
but that'd be the UNK thing for you
and we
mm
can get that set up
now i'm actually there isn't another session now until the week after next cos i'm actually away next week
mm
er but then we'll have more sessions booked in we can just slot you in to one of those i should think
yeah
there's someone away all august but i'm actually going to try to keep the sessions going
yeah
cos there's actually quite a demand for them
yeah
well i'm away
so
er twenty second of august again so
yeah
er what will you do let me know
or
no what we'll do is go and actually get you booked in
oh
so twenty one where are we
twenty first so if we got you booked in for that
follow
me
yeah
follow me
as i said we may not have a set up but if we haven't we'll set one now
now let's have a look at some circuit diagrams
have a few of those in
erm don't know if you want to look at some on the paper have a look at some in the paper and see how you do on those
circuit diagrams erm i'm usually okay with circuit diagrams
right okay
erm just a bit of quick revision don't think you need to work out the examples cos you're okay at working them out
you've got something like this
erm you've got a battery and you've got say er what
say six ohms on each of these in parallel and two ohms there and that's say a twelve UNK battery erm could you work out the current in that UNK
tell me how you'd go about it what sort of thing would you w where would you start
they just want to know
there's the
the current in that UNK
er the current in that UNK
in this bottom UNK one of the six o in fact tell you what we'll make it awkward for you
here you are we'll make erm we'll make that bottom one twelve ohms a six ohms so the three in parallel
right
we want to know the current in that
current is resistance is equal to voltage divide by current so it's ohm's law
right
so where do you start
cos that's a typical question that
yeah
they give
a mixture of series and parallel which you've done before but you probably need a bit of revision
erm i've gotta work out the current of the twelve volts first
right
the current in the
first thing is work out the current in the whole circuit
how are you going to do that
