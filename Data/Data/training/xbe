so i have to work out what the entire value of these is
the six o the six ohms and the twelve ohms
what's the oh formula for parallel resistance
what's the formula for series resistance
that one's easier the you can
you add them together
just add them together
so the parallel one is the other one the awkward one
yeah
remember what that is
erm resistance one plus resistance two divide by is it
erm oh
you've got three UNK
yeah
divide by resistance
no
i can't remember
okay let's have a lo a little look at
it's an awkward one i know
right the series is no problem
we want to find another little circuit here with r one and r two in it
right voltage there
you know that one total resistance is equal to both in series
er erm resistance r one plus r two
right so that one's no problem r one plus r two
this one is a bit more of a problem
just think about two first of all
that's r one this is r two
resistance there is equal to
erm
and you were getting very close to it
yeah
with the formula so think about it for two
and just sort of write down a few expression and then think ah that's not right or yes that's
resistance of one divide by resistance of two no
just have a have a scribble and see what it looks like
i can't honestly e erm
oh
i have the feeling that it helps you to see it written down
yeah
and for you to then actually have seen it sort of write it down rather than for someone just calling out to you
i don't know do you agree with that
or
yeah
not but it is better that way
okay look what they say and if they've got a diagram of
erm five this one
and we definitely don't want that one do we
volts in atoms
so this is the sort of thing we've got
two circuit elements i think we need the fire on today
oh they're showing how to derive them which you don't really need
just sort of scribble something down even if you even if you don't think it's right
i can't think of it because that
erm
er
because of w what's
what i'm trying to do is trying to get it the way it will be in an exam so cos in an exam you're
ah
going to have to start from somewhere so
haven't i honestly can't remember
that's as far as i could er
okay what are the b write down any other things that you can remember about erm i mean turn that over you can remember ohm's
i can't remember anything
law
yeah i can remember ohm's law
okay write down ohm's law and that's when you when you sort of pull things out of your memory it your memory is usually all in blocks of links so
oh god
four
right
er
think about ohm's law in terms of what current is okay now good
now are you certain about that
yeah
good
so you can look at that not just sort of little symbols er not really meaning much but we're going to look at what happens to the current
if you make the voltage higher it'll keep the resistance the same what happens to the current
er if you took voltage
so let's say you've got a light bulb
no i just wondered if you make the voltage higher and
yeah
the resistance the same the current goes up
current goes up
so you can sort of think about it
get a get a twelve UNK car bulb and start it up at twelve volts and wind the voltage up
you
okay
leave it till about sort of thirty odd and UNK the UNK going up
okay
i if you put if you make the resistance keep the voltage the same you make the resistance higher what happens to the current
keep increasing the resistance for the same voltage what happens to the current
er if you keep increasing the resistance of the what happens to the current
er say it again i
so we've got let's think of a
yeah i know i just want to say it
specific example
again i keep on as i'm thinking
okay
over it again
so the voltage isn't changing you don't
you
need to worry about that
it's a steady pressure trying to push that through and we increase the resistance we make more resistance
less current
so less current
okay
so just think of resistance as sort of something that stops the current and as you increase it the current gets less
so those are both the right way the v is on the top because that's the more the bigger v gets then the bigger the current is going to get
the r is on the bottom because the bigger r gets the smaller
right
mm
if you have r ten times what it was in the UNK the previous one you'll now only get a tenth of the current out
yeah
okay
make the resistance a hundred times what it was you'd only get a hundredth of the current
make your voltage twice what it was and keep everything else fixed you'll get twice the current
so that's that is the way that most people find is easiest to remember ohm's law
you don't have to remember all of them cos if you remember one you just need a little bit of maths to work out the others
erm so that's one you can remember on your own you can work it out you can write it down
what about erm power
and erm the what how would you work out think of a practical example how would you work out the UNK erm if you know the current
erm the UNK if you know the current
so you know i mean this is okay let's say you haven't got a clue you can't work out what it is so you think oh alright i'm stuck
well
yeah
let's get something practical fan heater let's say it's about ten amps
it's probably getting on for thirteen
let's say it's about ten amps so which way round would it go
erm we've got i equals v over r doesn't help there
and we've got this one for UNK what's the UNK
well the UNK of a fan heater is about what
er let's say it's about two point four kilowatts
mm
right
two point four kilowatts
that's the UNK and the current
er
fan heater say around ten amps
i
yeah
mean you know these things you know roughly what the UNK of a
yeah
fan heater is you know roughly what current it takes
and you know what the voltage is
yeah two forty
two forty
so what's the tie up between those
er these are actual values something you know so you're not dealing with a weird isolated concept
ten times two forty
right so it looks as if
current times voltage
looks as if watts is equal to the voltage times the current the current times the voltage
and it is
so that's a way of not relying on remembering cos you've got so many little UNK you've got to remember not just in physics in chemistry and in everything else
if you tried to remember them all as just these equations you'd be very easily getting confused about which one was which and you'll just get your head UNK with all sorts of stuff and so that way something that you know something you can bring it back to
so watts is v i now this is a common question that you get
erm let's say a hair UNK is UNK at erm er let's make it a telly
t v is UNK at a hundred and twenty watts right
mm
how big a fuse would you put in it
right
okay
that that's how they'd word
yeah
the question
so how would you go about that
how would you think about that
right
watts is equal to voltage times current
right
so it's a hundred and twenty i'll write the equation down
a hundred and twenty equal to two forty now erm
if you don't know it current is the one we're trying to find out you just leave it as i
so you've done is UNK your equation
yeah
filled in the ones you know
and the one you don't know is still there
so now you've got your equation
yeah
that's m almost done the problem
all you've got to do now is a little bit of maths to
right
two forty a hundred and twenty plus v times it by oh have to divide it by so it would be er watts over voltage is er
you do it doesn't matter which way whether you do it
yeah
that way or not but
it'll make it easier
okay
okay
so it's a half amp so what sized fu and they would probably give you erm are you going to use a three amp a five amp or a fif or a thirteen amp fuse
yeah
and once you've worked it out you can tell
now that one sort of came out quite easily some of them will come point eight amps or two point
yeah
four amps or things like that so but that's that comes up quite a lot that sort of thing
so you're okay on that you you've got from thinking oh i'm stuck on the other i've nowhere to start
yeah
y i mean you know quite a lot about electrical things practically
mm
you can you can do them and you know what UNK to put in you know what you're doing
so use that knowledge and bring it in don't keep it
don't sort
yeah
of leave it outside on the exam and think ooh it's UNK time now i can't remember which UNK go on top and which are on the bottom
bring in
mm
your outside knowledge use that and then you're not relying so much on oh no i've got more and more formulae to learn more things
you can work it out and you know if you get it even if you're not sure of the original formula if you get it upside down you can look at it this is no good
the more i increase the resistance the more current is getting through oh it
mm
must be the other way round cos that's not right
okay
so going back to the parallel have you had any thoughts about it
parallel
resistance in parallel
i honestly can't remember what it was
no okay
okay
i can't i can't
forget about that for the mo
i did know it
you did cos you were doing
yeah
them very nicely
erm what's the sort of real shape it's not just you it's everyone sort of doing UNK at the moment erm i'm getting this quite a lot
they say oh i did about five examples of this got them all right no problems straight but now i just haven't got a clue don't know where to
yeah
start what to do or anything so you need a little bit of practice at doing them for revision and then it it's not nearly as hard as when you first learnt it pulls it out of your head again and then sort of puts it back in a bit more settled down and easier to retrieve
erm i don't think i have got any written down here for you to have a look so i'll have to write it down for you erm stuff about UNK knives
er chemistry and chemistry
one two three four chemistry books there physics erm let's have a look if ohm's law's in we can find anything about him
no it hasn't got any ohm's law it hasn't got much about electricity in that at all
er have you got any notes on it don't mean get them now have you got notes on what you did on UNK in series and in parallel
erm yeah
i probably
okay
have somewhere
okay
buried in some
buried
in piles of paper
have you got your text books with you
yeah
so you can look it
yeah
up
cos i don't i don't want to do much of i know you want me to show you
yeah
but i want to do so much of
yeah i even remember
it it's very se
looking them up and
right
them and everything
yeah
but i cannot remember
i remember the teacher showing me in school as well how to do it and i just i can't remember
so
how to do it
when you find out you must try and think of some way that y can make you to think of it
have it like this
say you've got erm i mean think of UNK electrical wires like pipes
yeah
okay and if we put perhaps a water tank here and the UNK trying to get out and we've got these two big pipes go through one big pipe and one little pipe
what we're trying to do is UNK replace those three
with another pipe
now would it be bigger than
let's look at it this way erm with a small pipe so much water gets out okay
small pipe is offering a lot of resistance to the water so that's a sort of fairly high resistance
a bigger pipe more water goes through offering less resistance
if someone said oh we don't want two pipes it's a bit messy take them out and replace them by one that had the same resistance that lets the same amount of water through what would you replace those by
i mean would it be bigger or smaller or what
just sort of talk about that
er
it's just water
if it was water and you wanted more to flow off
you want to get the same amount i mean we've got a certain amount of water coming through that pipe
yeah
and a certain amount coming through this pipe
yeah
but someone says oh this is a bit messy having these two pipes couldn't we just have one pipe that did exactly the same job
now would it be a smaller pipe a bigger pipe or what
bigger than both of them
it would be bigger than both of them
so it'd be perhaps a little bit bigger than this big one cos the small one wouldn't make a lot of difference so perhaps it would be that big or something
now a bigger pipe has that got more resistance or less resistance
a bigger pipe has got m more resistance
it's less
less resistance
yeah
yeah
so
so if we get two UNK and we put one there say that's a hundred ohms
mm
mhm
and we put another one here say fifty ohms
right this is low this is this is letting a lot through this isn't letting so much through
if we replace them by instead of those we're just going to have one UNK
what it's going to be like roughly
i mean is it going to be a thousand ohms two ohms or what
just a guess not no calculations no formula just sort of your common sense what would you think about that
now a hundred and fifty ohms okay that's more resistance
that's letting less electricity through
think of one at a time
just cover up the hundred ohms let's take it out of the circuit
right all the electricity is going through the fifty UNK
quite happy with that running all their UNK and stuff
and then somebody puts another piece of wire in i'm not saying how much resistance it is but somebody puts another piece of wire
are you going to get more current going through or less
mm more current
right
you're going to get more it's just as if we had just the big pipe from the
yeah
UNK and someone puts a little pipe on as well
okay you don't get much more but we're going to get more
yeah
so you said here to replace the two pipes the sort of medium pipe and the small pipe you'll have one that's a bit bigger than the big pipe
yeah
we're doing the same thing here we've got a low resistance letting a lot of current in letting a lot of current go through
mhm
and then somebody put another one in
okay it's only a small pipe it's got a high resistance it doesn't let much through but it does let some more through
mm
so have another guess at what the resistance is going to be
er
in terms of sort of like
er i haven't a hundred
right
and fifty ohms
a hundred and fif
oh
fifty ohms
right
well a hundred and fifty means a hundred and fifty is high resistance not
yeah
much gets through
the problem with this the problem where it's hard to see is cos we're dealing with an inverse
yeah
as the resistance gets higher and higher the current goes down
but what we're doing is as the resistance gets lower we get more current through
so with fifty ohms we were getting a cer let's say with fifty ohms we were getting about ten amps going through
mm
right
somebody puts another UNK another not a UNK conductor cos it's going to let some more get through no matter how much resistance it'll still let some get through
yeah
so let's say now when we put that one on as well we're getting eleven amps through
so it was ten amps with just the one just the fifty UNK and now it i mean this isn't right but just a let's say that with both we're going to get about eleven amps
we haven't changed the voltage we've got more current going through
so what's happened to the resistance
erm
got ohm's law current is equal to voltage over resistance well we haven't changed voltage we've kept that fixed
yeah
but now we find that we've got more current going through
well we know we've changed the resistance so did we make the resistance more or less
we've got more current going through now
we made it more
less
okay it's on the bottom so if we had ten times we made it ten times as big then we don't get ten times the current we get one tenth
yeah
this is the awkward bit that it's all upside down
yeah
it's an inverse relationship
so we put another wire on don't think of it as resistance think of it as a conductor it's going to let some more current through
we've got so much going through the big wire put another little wire on as well
some UNK go through that
more current going through changed the voltage so it must mean the resistance has gone down
resistance has increased so have another guess just a guess
don't try and do any sums on it and think ooh i'll square one and add it on half the other
it was it was without this hundred on it was fifty ohms
yeah
we put an extra one on what's it going to be now roughly
just a you know just a guess
is it going to be more than a hundred
or what
less
i mean it's not going to be a hundred and fifty because a hundred and fifty is
it's going to be less than fifty
that's it
so that's it that's more or less that's the end of your analysis now
yeah
you've worked out what happens it's going to be less
whatever the resistance of this comes to it's going to be less than fifty ohms
yeah
okay
erm if it's more well this is ridiculous because we were getting that means getting some more current going through there has sort of changed everything else so it's going to be less than fifty ohms
well then if you weren't sure of your formula if you tried the formula who's been doing that
right
s
er oh yeah i forgot to ask you
would you like a drink soft drink
i
i
can't really make coffee because no one else is here and it'll waste a lot of time
right erm no thanks i'm fine
yeah
i had a coffee
you have one though if you want
no it's okay
i had one just before i came out
yeah
so i'm alright
so we could try different things there's this one over it comes in somewhere doesn't it
yeah
so let's try one over resistance equals one over r one plus one over r two
why does this do you know what one over resistance is by the way
erm it's one divided by resistance
have you heard of conductance
no
well if we were you you've got the UNK outside a sort of electric UNK or something and you want to get some current out there to it to run it
erm you don't get a piece of string
yeah
what would you get
an extension
an and copper is a good
conductor
so you look for a conductor
it's a conductor
i mean if you were being really dangerous and you wanted to die soon you could just sort of get a piece of bare wire and
mm
run it out there and run it off that until it touched something
so you're looking for a conductor
a conductor is something that electricity goes along and there's a properties of metals called its conductance and it was it we might be better thinking of thinking of its conductance
so if you think of pipe as how much water it can conduct
yeah
this one say can conduct two gallons a minute
right
and this one can conduct twenty gallons a minute
yeah
right
so how much will th if you want to replace them by one pipe how much will this pipe have
twenty two gallons a minute
twenty two gallons a minute
this is the UNK conductance if you like
mhm
so we just add them together
well this is conductance the inverse one over resistance is conductance
so the conductance of this circuit is equal to the conductance of that bit plus the conductance of that
so it's just going to come to one over fifty plus one over a hundred
okay
what does that come to
erm one over fifty plus one over a hundred is er one two over a hundred and fifty
oh got to find
so that's
three over two hundred
three over what
one hundred
yeah
yeah
okay
so let's think of that as okay
two over a hundred plus one over a hundred
so the conductance is one over r is equal to that
yeah
right
which comes to so one over the resistance is that so the resistance is turn it upside down a hundred over three
what does that come to roughly
er three thirty three
around about thirty three ohms
does that
thirty three and one third
yeah excellent
point three recurring
thirty three and a third is better actually
a nicer way of putting it
thirty three and a third ohms does that sound about right
yeah that looks about the right sort of thing cos it was fifty ohms and we've put i mean it's not that much small you know it's not going to let it should let about half as much through as that lets through this shouldn't it
yeah
so if this was letting if this was letting ten amps through then this one should let about five amps through
yeah
yeah
does that seem reasonable to you
if
yeah
fifty ohms lets ten amps go through then a hundred ohms will let half as much it'll will let five amps go through
so we've got the circuit like that originally ten amps going through it
put this one on and s oh we get another five amps through there
so altogether we'll have fifteen amps and the resistance is now two thirds of what it was
yeah
two thirds of fifty
so we're just adding the UNK again and if we did it with three of we had sort of three pipes
mhm
and say well think of the conductance don't think of it as UNK and stopping the water how much can it get along and get through
how much can it conduct through
conductance one over resistance is equal to r one plus one over r two plus one over r three
as many as you like keep putting lots and lots and lots of extra wires on
so with that
you should be able to do that problem yourself
now what i want you to do is not look at that
i'll leave it with you but don't look at it
just try and remember what we were doing but the pig about resistance is it's one over and think ooh we're all into weird fractions and everything seems to work the opposite way round to the way you'd expect it
so get out of that change your model change your way of looking at it
don't think of it as something UNK electricity think of it as conducting helping it along
erm you know a lot about electricity if i'm going to use this little thin wire
yeah
and i'm going to say right i'm going to run my fan heater off that
what would you say
you're mental
it's not going to conduct enough you want a better conductor
you want a big foot thick copper conductor that'll get a lot of it through
get something with a good conductance not something with a high resistance but something with a high conductance
so if you use that and just have a look at this problem here
find out what's the current through the twelve UNK through in fact through each UNK
mhm
okay
is that all right it's very UNK
yeah
you can see what we mean there
you've got two six ohms a twelve UNK and a ten UNK and twelve volts there so the first thing
what's how how're you going to go about the problems sort of talk through the stages
right i'll work out the current i'll work out the resistance
right
the combined resistance of these and then i will add it to this resistance
okay
i'll work out the total current flowing through the whole erm circuit
then i'll work out the current through in through each of this here
okay
and whatever w the current what the current is when it leaves
right
you can work out
er
you can work out the current through this one pretty easily when you work the
yeah
total resistance
so that's not going to be much problem
erm work out what the current is when it leaves
mm
well think of this as a sort of water pipe system if you like
six UNK pipes
and there's a twelve UNK which is a thinner one because it doesn't let as much go through
okay
here's some sort of strange UNK okay
and water comes in there goes out there and then again out of the another UNK again
yeah
and then it goes into another pipe
goes into this other UNK here where it goes and then it flows round again
so what happens to the water that comes in here
it gets split up and then goes most goes
split up three ways
that way
right
a little goes that way and then a very small amount goes that way
right
so a lot of it's going to go through the big pipe and then what happens to it when it's come through the these three pipes
it pushes
it joins up again
and here's the other resistance
so you were saying about finding out how much current goes through
er yeah
so what hmm the water comes in here
let's say the water comes in here at sort of ten gallons a minute
what rate does it come out of the end here
ten gallons a minute
right
pick any point there say or here
mm
or there
how much UNK flowing past in a minute
ten gallons a minute
right
when it
splits up and goes its separate ways we're not getting ten gallons a minute through that pipe or through that or
yeah
through that but in total we are
so it's the same water going all the way round it's the same current going all the way through here so if we've got ten gallons a minute of electricity coming in there say ten amps
yeah
yeah
it splits up some of it will go there as you say the least of it will go down this high resistance
then it all joins up again and goes back in goes along here so everything that goes down there the ten amps goes through this one again and back into the battery
we'll close this switch cos otherwise it's a very simple answer
what's the current in there
non cos the switch is open
does that help you to sort of understand it better
yeah
what what's happening
think of it this as water analogy
it's all flowing round it all starts off here it all gets round and gets back again the UNK like a pump pumping it all round
UNK are like pipes if you work with a resistance it's always one over so forget about resistance deal with conductance
i mean you still write one over resistance but don't think of the resistance part of it think of the new one over as a separate entity
this is this is how big your pipe is
right
a big one over r is a big conductance
big pipe big diameter pipe
it lets a lot through
so i think you can sort that out pretty easily now
a factor tree on the back as well
as i say don't be tempted to have a quick glance at that before you start the problem
try and
yeah
just leave that unless you are totally stuck and i don't mean sort of five minutes have a good sort of maybe ten minutes or say about ten minutes of playing with this
don't just think oh i don't know this oh i can't do that i don't know what the formulae are
work out what you do know
like on this one you didn't know what the resistance was exactly but you worked it out well it's going to be less than your first thought was add it together of course
a
yeah
hundred and fifty
that's because you want to everyone does you want to think in terms of UNK so it's hard to get over this problem so don't get over it
think of UNK every time you think of conductance just write one over r erm so i think you can do it without working but if you need to it's there so i'll leave that
and i think you need to do a bit of revision on the firm basic
yeah
stuff there
that stopped
you're going very slowly i'll these batteries there's the problem there's little diagram to sort of think about it in terms of water
mhm
and there's the answer but don't look at that if you can
i won't
okay i mean
it's up to you but
yeah
it's i'm just trying to help
it helps
i'm not trying to make it hard for you i'm trying to work out what is useful for you cos it's no good you just sort of more or less copying it out
energy now
erm power er different types of energy how many have we got
different types of energy
er chemical
okay
erm UNK energy potential energy er electrical energy
okay
just finishing off on electrical energy
how do you pay for the electrical energy that you use
how many kilowatts you've used
kilowatts
mm
you turn you turn a three bar electric fire on say
a big fan
mm
heater
that's a three UNK heater erm
so you've turned your UNK three UNK heater on for an hour and i'm gonna charge you le let's say thirty pence
okay
mm
charge you've turned it on for ten hours how much will i charge you
three pound
yeah why
it's right why
cos it were using more
it using it's us
using it at the same rate but it's going for a longer time
yeah
so you don't just pay for kilowatts that you use what do you pay for
erm
erm you know it cos you've just told me the
yeah
answer
you've just told me UNK this is what you did
mm
i said three kilowatts
yeah
and it's running for ten hours
mhm
you multiplied them together
yeah
didn't you
kilowatts
per hour
times hours it's not per hour
UNK hours
UNK hours
mm
okay
and that's what we pay for and that's when you want to work out how much a fan heater uses and you know how long was it on for
if you just flick it on and off it's going to use very little
leave it on for a year you'll get a bill
mm
so the energy is UNK hours
kilowatts is not energy it's the rate at which you're using energy how quickly is this electrical appliance burning up electricity
erm three UNK heater it's really sort of running away with electricity
erm a light bulb is not using much electricity in a given time
but if you leave a light bulb on for a year it'll cost you more than leaving the fan heater on for an hour
yeah
so it's how quickly is it using electricity and how long did you leave it on for
so kilowatts is what
what are what are kilowatts a measure of
er thousand watts
right a kilowatts is a thousand watts and what is it measuring
erm watts is erm er
it's an awkward one
mm
and it's one that needs sort of a bit of thinking about and again tie it back to the everyday things that you know quite a lot about electrical appliances things like that
it's how much energy it uses er
yeah
how much e energy it uses
carry on
it's which ra how m it's the rate at which it uses
the rate that's it
voltage
the rate at which it uses energy it's the rate at which it's using the energy
so a three UNK fire is using it at a terrific rate it's running away with electricity
a er twenty five UNK lamp in the fridge is using it at a very low rate it's hardly using any electricity
so to work out how much energy you're using is how quickly am i using up energy well i'm using it at a rate of ten kilowatts
right so that's a lot of kilowatts is energy per second or energy per hour if you like
kilowatts watts energy per hour
watts is actually energy per second but if we think of it in terms of hours cos we've bought by hours
so to find out how much you pay for how much actual energy has been used up you think it again going back to the water if we have a big tank full of water and we're using it up this time in terms of power erm if we have something that's using up water at the rate of say six gallons a minute and someone's going to charge you for your water
well let's say you've got a water meter okay
water meter have you got a water meter here
don't think so
let's say your wa your water is UNK and erm you've got a washing machine using six gallons per minute
right you've got a garden hose running off your mains as well using say twe i don't know how much it uses twenty gallons a minute something like that
yeah
right
erm if they're going to charge you for your water by how much you use they don't just charge you twenty when you've got your hose running
they say well how many minutes did you have it running
right so it's twenty gallons per minute times let's say you've got it going for ten minutes ten UNK and the per minutes and the minutes cancel out and the answer comes in gallons then
yeah
you've used twenty gallons that's how they find out how much you've used
it's very similar let's say we've got things called el let's say they're electrons
right
i mean they're not but let's say they b big packets of lots of electrons so we're using things at erm let's say watts is equal to so many electrons per second
yeah
and erm well let's just say a hundred watts is a hundred electrons per second
and you wouldn't get a lot of heating out of a hundred electrons
so and they charge you for how many electrons you use
and we've got this hundred UNK thing running for twenty seconds so oh say for oh fifty be sixty for a minute sixty seconds
so how much how many electrons get through
how many are you going to get charged for
you're going to get charged for the amount going through will be a hundred electrons per second times sixty seconds
yeah
seconds cancel out and you're going to get six thousand electrons
so six thousand electrons will go through and that's what they'll charge you for
okay
mhm
and when they when they define watts and kilowatts and everything else in terms of energy that you can understand like erm horsepower
erm have you ever seen a UNK with a plate on it
erm ninety kilowatts
something like that
you know cars are UNK in horsepower normally
yeah
yeah
they can also be UNK in kilowatts and on UNK cos the regulation allow sort of what UNK sixteen year olds can ride and i think it's sort of something like seventy kilowatts or ninety kilowatts it might be ninety
they actually give its power in kilowatts so there's this obvious UNK between electrical and mechanical energy so watts is not an amount of electricity it's a rate of using it up it's a flow rate like gallons per minute
yeah
three UNK heater
that's three thousand gallons a minute of electricity going through that if you like
a hundred UNK light bulb has only a hundred gallons a minute going through okay
it's a very
mhm
similar thing
it's a it's a flow rate it's rate of using up electricity watts
so to find out how much you've used you've got to multiply it by how long you've been using it for
and the electricity people charge you for UNK hours
kilowatts rate of using it up times how many hours you've used it
okay
your hose pipe twenty gallons a minute well you ran that for ten minutes say so that was two hundred gallons we're going to charge you for there and your six gallons a minute appliance here you ran that for forty minutes right
that's a UNK per minute times forty minutes then cancel with gallons so they're going to charge you for two hundred and forty gallons
and that's
that's how your electricity was paying for it
it's a it's an awkward thing to understand this power and energy is the lumps of the stuff itself
the gallons of water the number of electrons
but erm power is the rate at which it's being used up
horsepower is the rate at which energy is being produced or absorbed usually being produced
kilowatts the rate at which
erm now moving on to other energy
physical
bit more easy to get to grips with the physical stuff
yeah
erm still got power as a rate of doing work
car engine UNK at fifty horsepower
yeah
or a hundred horsepower
how much energy would it use up
well it depends on how long you run it
i mean you can have a an x j six running for ten seconds and it uses hardly any petrol
mm
little mini and run it for a year run the engine UNK non stop for a year and it's going to use quite a few gallons
so the horsepower isn't actually telling you how much energy in total but the rate at which it's being used up
erm now what about UNK and all the other different types of energy
er UNK potential chemical
how would you convert erm potential energy into UNK energy
in a machine
in a machine potential energy is something erm potential energy is energy something UNK due to its position
good
state
that's an excellent definition
that's a sort of strict UNK definition that that's brilliant
er UNK energy is the energy something UNK due to it's er movement
okay
that's it
that's excellent UNK definition again
so potential is when it hasn't done anything yet it's stored up ready for us to
so some examples of potential energy
erm say you've got a stone on top a cliff
okay
and the that UNK be potential energy
er UNK potential energy
so anything that can fall down and go faster as it falls
yeah
erm any other form of potential energy
n yeah
er if you've UNK if you've got trying to think er can't think of anything
erm how do you start a car
with a car battery
okay
so a car battery has stored up energy
UNK it go through the whole process of how of erm running a car
starting it every morning
you get in your car and you start it every morning you run around and come back you start it again
when you start the engine the battery store you the battery which stores electrical energy
mm
by chemical reactions
good
erm when you start it you're closing a switch which star which starts the starter motor turning
right
that in turn UNK the engine over and
okay
the engine fires and the starter motor then turns off
right
then because the UNK used up energy the motor of the car turns the UNK
right
which puts electricity which UNK the battery
right
puts electricity back into it
and then when you turn the engine off your UNK full and restored and you got to start it
good
etcetera
now do you think not now but for sort of maybe for next time or some time very soon a little diagram a little sort of flow chart if you like showing where how the energy is changing from one form into another
sort of where it's coming from so we've got chemical energy
what types of chemical energy have we got in the system you've UNK been talking about
erm got chemical energy electrical energy
okay what types of chemical energy
oh the battery
so the battery
and the engine where the
right
petrol we're burning
and the fuel for the engine
that's now that fuel is producing energy
yeah
does your battery produce energy
erm it stores it doesn't UNK
good
excellent it just store any it stores energy it doesn't make any itself and that's the point that they want you to make erm normal little throw away batteries that you have in your tape recorder or something they produce energy they don't have energy sort of put into them chemicals and things
but they produce energy and then they get UNK up they sort of get blocked so they can't
mm
produce any more then you throw them away
but a car battery it stores up the energy so okay that produces energy the fuel erm what other types of energy have we got now
er potential energy and UNK energy of the vehicle
in the in the c this car system that
oh
you've just been describing
oh right
erm there's e electrical
so electrical erm what systems have you got there
system erm
what does the
there's the UNK
so what does the UNK do
er produces electricity
or UNK it
so it gets electricity comes out
what goes into it
er
what sort of energy
physical energy
what sort of physical energy
er erm the engine turning
right
is it moving
yeah it's circular er oh
d you don't have to be that specific you'd really you'd want to know is it erm
it's physical
is it fixed is it sitting there doing nothing or is it moving
cos if it's
moving
moving it's UNK
UNK
okay
so you've got UNK energy going into the UNK and producing electricity
what happens with the starter
er that uses up UNK electricity into UNK energy
electricity coming in going out okay
so that's a then you've got the other you've got the
what's happening there you've got UNK making the engine go round
so using little things like that so just a little box to show this is the UNK that's the energy for this is the battery and this is the fuel
draw a diagram with it doesn't have to be neat just sort of UNK all over it and UNK it until you get it to
yeah
the way you want it
and then you just draw it out again so that someone could look at it and they could see the energy changes in front
yeah
starting up in the morning the first thing you get in the car start up drive around come back and park it
and what's happened to the energy
the energy changes
have you lost any energy
what happens when you're driving along
erm what happens when you're driving along
er
where does the energy come from
the petrol
so the big the thing that's providing everything you take the petrol out you won't go unless you're at the top of a hill of course because it can
yeah
roll down
so this primary source is your fuel
think about things when you go up and down hill
okay
why what makes you use more fuel
erm
if you've got a lot of petrol and you're just like wasting it and you think oh i'm going to use a lot more fuel in my driving today what would you do
erm
apart from keeping it
yeah
erm drive up lots of hills and
drive up hill
yeah
so up a hill all day you can use a lot more
right
extra resistance
where would your extra resistance come from
okay you could drive with the hand brake on but you don't normally do that
erm
where do
let pressure out of the tyres
right
so there's some resistance from
air resistance on the car
right
so if you want to really use petrol
you know drive along the motorway
drive a range rover
and just yeah
drive a range rover at about a hundred and ten along the motorway you
yeah
fuel
yeah you can
i can see it sometimes
see it on that transit you used to run as i'm going along i can see it's going down
can't actually see it move but i can see it if i look
if you look at it every ten minutes you notice it's
yeah
moved a little
yeah
so air resistance is er is the big one
once you get up to speed that's you're it's like running through have you tried running through water
yeah
yeah it's like that
erm and your tyres as you said the resistance ro and lots of resistance in all the bearings
yeah
all the moving parts i mean your wheel UNK get hot
yeah
erm your brakes every what happens when you brake
it's friction brake pads squeeze the brake disk or
yeah
brakes pads push out on the brake UNK
mm
and what happens to the UNK
gets hot
right
if you've just come down a hill with your brakes on
yeah
touch those and burn your hand
so you got all this energy this UNK energy when you're going downhill
yeah
you don't want it you've got to get rid of it somewhere so you turn it to heat and there's every time you whenever you're UNK you're turning some of your UNK into heat
so there are lots of erm this is something that you know quite a bit about
mhm
it's just looking at it in a slightly different way and trying i've done some things there to show you a sort of a system to use your own if you like but i want to see what comes in what goes out every time energy changes from one form into another form
and i mean think of say rolling back in traffic if you're waiting on a hill
if you take your UNK off and you're not quite ready to move off what happens
your potential energy starts changing into UNK and you roll back
so as many examples as you can think of driving where energy changes from one sort to another er where your energy is going what's using it up where it's coming from
erm
yeah
because they do i mean they're not they're not going to ask you that as a question
could do i mean if i was setting the exam i probably would sort of you know people know roughly about i mean they're all going to drive cars one car
so i think you could almost enjoy doing a little diagram like that couldn't you
yeah
and you'll keep thinking of extra little bits he ah there's another bit can go in there
so your diagram will get very messy it doesn't have to all fit together as long as you can get all the main points of what's happening
erm have you heard of a fellow called UNK and his three laws
yeah
are you remembering them
no
hmm
erm you know them
yeah
you know his laws in UNK you know sort of in practice but we'll sit here and watch that pen until it suddenly jumps off the table
it's not going to
it's not going to it's just it'll just stay there
why
why does why is this book just sitting on the table not going anywhere
er cos that's stopping it
yeah the UNK stopping yeah
it's the normal state of things just sitting there doing nothing
erm
right
that's his first law
that if something suddenly you know jumps up
yeah
something's done something to it didn't just
yeah
suddenly decide to jump up
if UNK if you don't have an external force acting on something it just to remain stationary or carry on in a straight line and fixed speed if
erm and the second law you've heard of force equals mass times acceleration
yeah
now
okay explain it to me in terms of try and ex say if you were explaining it to someone who sort of wasn't very technical
mm
erm
force erm is equal to mass times acceleration
erm force is some is the power at which with which something UNK so if something if you drop a pen on hand
okay
when it hits you what you're feeling is the force of
right
the pen falling
right
if you drop say that heavy UNK on top
right
what hits you is the force of it moving
right
so that's a
a short sharp force
yeah
right
they're quite awkward to deal with
yeah
erm can you think of any steady forces
er say i place it on my hand
right
now here it's
pushing down me
pushing down
and UNK third law says that your hand must be pushing up on it
with exact just enough to balance its weight
yeah
cos otherwise it's be going down
yeah
okay so if you turned your hand over the other way
and then lift it up a bit off the table
now if you try not to
hold it quite so mu so much it'll push you down a bit
if you're lifting it up too much it goes up
yeah
so make it go you push upwards with a
yeah
force that's more than its weight
to let it come down you push upwards but not enough force to hold up its weight
so it's coming down a bit
so his three laws first one is everything just sits there doing nothing unless there's some good reason basically
yeah
the hard part of that is something going in a straight line and the same speed has no force no UNK forces acting on it
erm if you think of something say a UNK on ice
give it a flick it'll go for a long way because there's no there's very little friction on the ice and erm the second one is the awkward one
force is mass times acceleration
the third one is the this book is pushing down on the table and the table is pushing up on the book
and
yeah
the action and reaction are equal
if the table was i mean we've got to get the
if we get a car engine
yeah
and put it on the edge of the table what's going to happen
the table can't push up
yeah
with enough force to stop the engine
mm
so the engine will just sort of push the table down
erm so the if you're just sitting there doing nothing they're balanced
and the middle one force is mass times acceleration erm i'm going to give this a push i'll give this pen a push UNK
going to give the table a push that was as hard as i pushed the pen and
mm
well you see give your chair a push
can you feel that
hardly feel it that's as much as i would this is a very low mass it's quite small
you know come and come and give my mini a push okay come and give my UNK a push
mm
mm
maybe
come and give my bus a push
or
get lost
my yeah or my petrol UNK full
yeah
no
no
i don't think so
right so someone on a bike you've got a mate on a UNK and you're starting a race and you give him a shove
yeah
it really helps it's you know a massive
starts him
gets him going
but erm somebody in a tank give us a push
no thanks it's
because the mass is so high the same force will have very little effect on
if the mass is very low you get a very light little UNK ball give it a flick
it'll really go
you want to try and flick that see if i can knock that little one of those brass pigs flick it and see if i knock it across the table i'll take my own finger off the UNK hardly move
so that's a sort some understanding of mass times acceleration
the force is mass times acceleration
erm can you think of any applications of that
erm mass times acceleration
erm yeah when er rather than saying that something is a heavy mass and it move and it's got a good acceleration you can just say it's got good
no i can't think of anything
think if you put erm a go UNK engine
yeah
in a petrol UNK
it wouldn't get anywhere
erm it produces a certain amount of it can produce a maximum of UNK a certain amount of force a go UNK engine
it's enough a light go UNK and a person on it
yeah
it'll UNK about
yeah
if you try to make that drag petrol UNK about if you've got a suitable UNK
yeah
so your UNK doing about four thousand UNK and it's geared down like mad and your UNK is just creeping so you can hardly see
yeah
the w the wheels move yeah it could you could move it
if it
yeah
take a long time
if it didn't lose a you know
yeah
a lot of friction in the UNK and things like that
but you could get that UNK gradually creeping along and moving
the same force when it's applied to l look at this another way what's the acceleration
yeah
f equals m a divide both sides by m so the acceleration this is a bit like our ohm's law thing let's keep the mass the same we're dealing with say a mini we're not going to change that
yeah
erm we give it a bigger force what happens to the acceleration
erm it goes up
bigger force bigger acceleration
well that's
yeah
good that ties in with you know what we know actually happens in real life
now let's keep the force the same say we've got a mini engine providing us just running it steady at three thousand r p m pushing out the same amount of force keep the force the same this time we put a smaller mass we've got a mini engine and you've put it on your UNK
yeah
UNK we'll get a much what will be the acceleration will it be bigger or smaller get more acceleration or less
erm more
yeah
so because the mass is smaller we get more acceleration
now if we make the mass bigger put the same engine in a UNK acceleration would be very small
so it's sometime useful to think of it that way round UNK third law rather than force is mass times acceleration you're interested in the effect now what did we get for this what sort of acceleration do we get
what we want big acceleration and we put a big force
also if we want big acceleration we use a small mass
yeah
bigger the acceleration that you're very light object
or something like that
erm UNK three laws come up erm and particularly that one you questions
mm
on that
erm so his first one is about equilibrium
no UNK force no net force all forces balance
all forces are balanced
right
all forces are balanced and so no net force
you can have forces but they all balance out
and it will either be at rest or in a straight line
and a steady speed
that's the bit that people fe find a bit hard to er to accept because in the real world it doesn't actually happen because there's always some other force like air resistance friction road resistance from your tyres and it UNK it always stops eventually
but if it's in space you're in a UNK and then you throw your pen out through the window
UNK
yeah
preferably
it just keeps going there's nothing else
yeah
it's away from all the other planets and things it'll just keep moving
er steady speed straight line
and that's those three laws that's what the whole of dynamics is built on
the whole of the study of sort of moving things and UNK things like UNK leaning up against a wall it's okay it's interesting
what would happen there
just lean a ladder against a wall and start walking up it
er
why UNK why doesn't it slide straight away
when you le when you leave the ladder up wall
because your force isn't worth as much when you're there
when you're there it's erm it's liking more like a
more like a
what's stopping the bottom of the ladder from
which way is it acting
the force is pushing that way that way
so
what do you mean by the force
the mass
okay
right
is
right
so what way is the UNK force acting on the bottom of the ladder
it's acting on the floor
on the base of the ladder
stopping it getting pushed
so which direction
that way
is it
that way
is it
oh the UNK force that way
right yeah that's very common
yeah
marking the forces on going that way the easy way to think of it is well what have you got to do to the bottom of the ladder to stop it from put a piece of rope on here right
put a piece of rope and stand on the end of it and pull
and i've got to pull the of ladder in
so there must be a UNK force here pulling the bottom of the ladder in
what's the top of the ladder trying to do
it's trying to slide down the wall so there must be something pulling it up the wall UNK force
yeah
if you put the bottom on wheel put some wheels on the bottom of the ladder so it couldn't fall because of the bottom then it would still stay there because on the floor would be the bit of grip from the top
not nearly
mm
as good as the UNK force you get on the bottom
but you do get some from the top
and if i take the book away and so the pen is trying to push the book over
yeah
and the book is pushing back and the pen pushing on each other so pushing out that way
yeah
and it's this is what the UNK doing it's the normal reaction UNK force keeping the holding the ladder up stopping it from sliding down
there's a UNK force there's a different reaction
a vertical reaction and the horizontal
okay
these are interesting if you're building bridges but when it gets really interesting is when things start moving
when things start moving f equals m a UNK up all over the place
and it's very important so they always ask questions about it
the understanding of it is that
acceleration increase your force what happens to acceleration
erm goes up
increase the mass but keep your force the same what happens to acceleration
goes down
so mass if you like is a bit like the way resistance was in the electric
yeah
yeah
if you increase it erm then it's slowly go UNK everything down if you like increase the resistance you UNK everything down
so mass is a sort of a bit like resistance it's resistance to acceleration
erm this piece of paper hasn't got much ac resistance to acceleration
you can UNK it very easily
er this house has got tremendous resistance to acceleration
if i run
mm
at it and oh give it a good shove i'm not gonna
yeah
i mean okay the brick might move a tiny bit
yeah
but i'm not going to suddenly send this off into orbit with a small
force
so that's how that works
erm i'm trying to tie things together a bit as you noticed
yeah
at the moment so that you can
relating
you're not feeling that you've got lots of little isolated subjects and lots of little isolated topics and it's all building up and it's all a lot it is a lot
can i just answer the phone
it is a lot but they're all part of the same thing
yeah
so how are you how are you getting on with your revision
erm to be honest the revision getting a bit UNK it's we've done most of our coursework in most subjects there's coursework which in some subjects which has to be not doesn't have to be done before the exam but it's preparation work for the exams
there's art coursework there's a big economics project
okay
there and there's c d t because for
c d t you have to do four sheets which you take into the exam
and you use the information off that
so
you will have some projects that can keep but
yeah
if you do them before the exam the
yeah
stuff that you learn for them is even better then the revision
yeah
it comes in and it's very it's very useful
erm
or to do the projects you're looking up things
right
what projects have you got any science projects that're not finished
no science
they're all in
the good thing about the science was it was all in school practical
work
write up
mostly
all your experiments are written up and
yeah
handed in
erm what about your maths have you got any outstanding projects there
no
they're all in and done
yeah
that's good
english as well it's really it's just the
oh that's good
so you're really
yeah it's
i mean you've co i mean a long you know not that long ago you were sort of tending to put it off a lot
yeah
erm you've got you've got to
it's just the economic art and the c d t which it's not my fault it's just everybody's in
the same position it's the teachers have tended to say well you're not ready to do it yet or we've just got to finish the rest of this book
by the time we've finished the book bang we're on top of the easter holidays
okay so get yeah get those projects in
erm i would i think it would be very useful if you could make time in the next day or so you don't have to spend long on this you know if you just spent sort of
yeah it's just looking at it
spent half an hour maximum maybe twenty minutes would be all it would take you just to do that one problem while it's reasonably fresh in your mind
then you can forget it and the next time you come to do it maybe in a month's time or er you've i remember now the water pipes don't give it resistance think of conductance think of one over think of conductance
this pipe UNK so many gallons that so many gallons
conductance one equals conductance plus conductance three plus conductance four mm and so on
and then wherever you've got rid of conductance think well they haven't given me that they've given me resistance oh i had to write one over resistance turning it into conductance
erm it's a big course science but a lot of it and erm quite a i mean the chemistry alone or the physics alone
yeah
or the even the
i think somebody said it's mad the way they try and
yeah
i think yeah it was my dad said that the way they try to do combined science it's like doing a combined maths and english paper
yeah
they're all so different
it's
yeah
UNK
it er i don't think a lot of the curriculum at the moment and erm you ask most teachers and they just say UNK forget that you know
i think what he should have done
ooh you've got to take two sciences you pick which two sciences you're going to take it'd be easier for the teachers and he would well to do all three sciences in one exam is
it's erm it's a mess really the way
i mean you might as well be doing art physics and chemistry than biology physics and chemistry
yeah
i think it's
i mean there is some overlap between biology
i mean if anything the physics should go in with the maths exam rather than chemistry and biology
big overlap on especially on stuff like this about the dynamics erm don't forget that sort of first sheet i gave you a long time ago about
yeah
erm so many people throw marks away because they don't put thing down things that are obvious
what's tell me what are the properties of hydrogen
er it's a gas
right
er it's UNK
right
er it's got one it's
right okay good
one
one UNK
yeah you're getting now into the deep chemical
yeah
properties of it
good excellent that you know them
yeah
but
it's a gas
go for the really obvious physical properties first and if you have a little UNK that you go through bang for each one
doesn't smell and you can't
see it
right
now the especially if it is UNK or if it hasn't got a smell you think ooh i'm not putting that down
yeah
right
what's hydrogen
it's a gas
what colour is it
i don't know i think it's UNK well no good putting that down
if it was yellow with sort of pink spots that'd be worth putting down
mm
so many people leave it out
and you know losing marks when you describe properties
if you don't know the chemical properties you might think oh i zinc carbonate describe zinc carbonate
have a go
oh zinc carbonate
it's a powder
right okay it's going to be a solid probably a powder
you get erm doesn't burn
probably doesn't burn
right
erm soluble in water er
may or may not be soluble
don't think it would smell
probably does not smell
and then you get on to the chemical properties of it
what happens with all carbonates
what the property of all carbonates
say i've got some powder there that
look at this zinc carbonate or zinc sulphate
i'd like you to just do a quick chemical test and let me know if that was a carbonate
erm
oh i can't remember
you've got some acid handy some h c
oh
l
oh
i can't erm er when you mix it with the acid er it produces a water no that's er hydrogen and oxygen
go yeah
they all produce water and salt
and salt
a carbonate produces something else as well
erm hydrogen a gas er car carbon dioxide
right
and
and that makes lime water which
right okay
this is where we had some sort of car this is just looking at UNK of water actually but this is you've got the c o three
yeah
in there and that's where we're going to get our c o two from leaving the o who cares what happens to that you get you know a different looking powder left
well we'll get carbon dioxide off so you might be UNK carbonate or UNK we've got a powder which may be UNK car carbonate or UNK sulphate and you never heard of this stuff ah carbonate and maybe UNK carbonate doesn't give off carbon dioxide with acid but there is a very good chance it does cos all the others you've ever heard about do
so just go for that i mean you see you're looking for the pattern you can't know ninety odd elements and what the carbonate of every one does what the sulphate of every one what the nitrate of each one UNK hydrogen carbonate of each one
you can't learn all that lot
you just learn general patterns
maybe if there are a few very obvious exceptions you UNK those as well
yeah
erm you know pi stuff in your head full of more and more facts and more and more equations and more and more you know UNK law and ohm's law UNK everybody else
every little
had a law and a name and a theory
yeah
erm so you just stick them together
so that's something that only you can do really that you gather up the information it's like it's like having all your information in say a room this size
and it's chucked in bits of pa on bits different UNK of paper and it's all on the floor
about finished has it
chucked all over the place
right
and want to find something you've got to root through everything else you've got to move everything else and then when you want to come and find something else you've moved it
something else you can't
yeah
so you've got a lot of stuff up in your head you might oh you've got a terrible r memory you can't remember anything think of it the thing is you can remember phone numbers and people's names how to get to school
yeah
erm people you've met faces and voices you can recognize
stuff up in your head
mm
it needs organizing occasionally maybe in the holiday is a good time to try and do it
while you're doing your projects sort of practise organizing your files for your projects and don't l don't i think you can spend you're good at finding excuses for yourself i do the same thing
i'm
mm
not i'm not now i've got over it
but in a stage of my life i used to do the same thing a lot
i'll do my sort of chemistry revision tomorrow right well i'll sort all this out into these files i'm going to put all my acids together in that one
and by the time you've done that
oh well it's too late now right well
yeah
i'll do it tomorrow
but at least i got this file sorted out
erm don't get into that
you know
i to that
yeah
well you know the dangers probably better than i do but er you need a you need a good bit of organization but much time is getting the
so your other subjects going okay
economics
yeah
and c d t and
i've got
your maths is good now isn't it
yeah that's
so it's just your science that you are thinking ooh and they are a lot of
i'm not really worried about it to be honest i'm not worried about any of them i thought i would actually be erm i'm actually we're under a lot of pressure at the moment but i'm not actually usually when i'm like that it's all gone i tend to say well forget about it and you know run away from it kind of thing
yeah
when you're under pressure but i'm not
i'm just i'm just doing it in my UNK and taking it
as it as it comes
good
if you've got you know if you've got too much pressure
not worrying about it too much because that'll just make it worse
it does make it worse and if you've got a lot of things that you're supposed to be doing you just think well i can't do all of them
if i try and do all them
now pick up the important ones sort out your priorities
erm say if you're looking at erm say if and you think well i know pretty much about alternative sources of power wind and water and all that stuff
i don't really need to be just so long
yeah
as oh that's good i feel that they're now acid and UNK seem to be important i've done i've put a lot of effort into them maybe just a quick glance at those occasionally to keep up to date
use your use your time use your energy so it's going to get you know
but erm what are what are you hoping to do after your exams
er try and relax and wait for them
i don't know erm
depends on what you get
yeah
erm i've started writing off we've drafted a letter to write off to different colleges and sort of i'll write off before i do my exams
right
cos the answers when they come back are going to be things like depends on what you get in your exams and it's very it's very bad stage in your life it's er going to affect but i mean the UNK going to get nice and it you know it's going to be great
everyone will be tempted to go out
if you work now not you know not killing yourself but if you can put in a certain amount of work now and go without watching telly sitting round listening
mm
to music going out with your mates
erm just to get
thank you very much for supporting the evening nice to see so many faces as i said especially on a summer evening like today
we didn't really get an indian summer right on the
erm just to give you something of my UNK for being here er the name is lewis
erm i took a degree in textiles in the late fifties and i've specialized in the design development and manufacture of knitted outer wear ever since
a number of companies throughout the country er derbyshire been in scotland with a company called in the er in er in the border country
and in varied places
the UNK one of the big UNK companies in the late sixties early sixties
and then ten years ago i started my own company er started in a very small way to begin with
just two machines four people and gradually that got up to a reasonable size er i it grew on the back of companies like manufacturing what i call the UNK look cos knitwear was UNK for bringing other things together
i mean you see it today don't you
in the nice shops you see a nice er UNK skirt UNK nice UNK the knitwear brings it all together
that's how we built our company and we did UNK from the hundred and thirty girls from three years ago
erm but i put the company into UNK at that point because of the problems we were all having in industry and started again about a year two years ago
now we're back to six people again and they're all working for me in a very small way
again working with the same sort of people but in a very small and for our own as well
so that's the nature of the world to day you have to move with the times it's going to be a but er this is how we survive
it's one of the reasons we're doing this as well because it gets our products out of the people directly
so that's er i mean you probably know we do i do a talk erm i call it a story rather than a talk and i say i hope it's interesting as a story
it's about the craft of knitwear and how it's developed from hand knitting into the modern production units there are today
and what influenced that er development
the sort of things briefly are obviously demand the machine development new materials new UNK fashion and design
they're the elements that have changed what knitwear is from what it was
so erm in
to start the talk or the story by asking er ladies here if they know where the or the know where knitwear started as a craft the actual first knitted fabric started
anybody any ideas
wales
wales is an interesting one sorry
ireland
ireland there's another
any more
what about nottinghamshire
what about nottinghamshire yeah
er no i'm talking about before that
oh
i'm talking about really
when it started
lancashire
yeah it's amazing we're all thinking about the u k aren't we
UNK
would you believe yes
actually it started in UNK
which is amazing isn't it
i was in i was in the industry for thirty years before i realized or find out that it's an UNK craft
and the
evidence for this was found the very first fabric or the earliest UNK was found in spain on the UNK of the UNK of one of the great UNK lords
it had survived because it had got a UNK thread running through it
and so the UNK shape was there and it and the knitted there
and that was something like er two hundred a d and we know
and we know that from that it went back to b c we can trace it back to b c from UNK
but it's in having said that it's an interesting fact that the knitted fabric as such we know is a warm sort of comfortable fabric and it's obviously used in where i call the cold UNK and that that's why it's developed in the very areas we've been talking about
it developed in the northern er northern UNK so scotland ireland the yorkshire coast anywhere where there was er outside er employment like the UNK or places like er yorkshire all those areas have got their own knitted
so it was developed by the ladies of the day for the men to do their work and they developed their special patterns like UNK stitches which i'm going to show you now like fair isle stitches
they were developed at that time as a useful product for the for the UNK
there's the UNK we all know the classic UNK there's hundreds of them and there's a more modern one but that's the traditional one there
and that's a traditional one that's been made for in a modern colour
i mean they didn't have them in those colours in those days that was the true UNK
in black wool navy or this sort of colour
always knitted in oil
so that it er push off the water kept the water at bay
but that was er what was n knitted by the ladies and you can see if you look at the patterns what they did once they'd learnt their basic skills were to copy the things they could see
so what you see there that UNK if you all actually a net the knitting so their husbands were UNK and that's a net
and the UNK that you see running down the sides they're the ropes
so they copied the things that the men could they could see themselves and may be using
one of the UNK factors about this particular stitch in the UNK is that every family had its own pattern and the reason for that was often the UNK were lost at sea and the only way they could identify them was through the pattern
UNK but true fact of life
so there's the UNK er still up into scotland still on these UNK scotland we have the fair isle
that's
two or three years ago
i'll always keep it because it shows the original sort of colours that fair isles were made in
these are UNK colours
very nice subtle
very fashionable about a year and a half ago again because all these things come round again don't they
UNK and the fair isles all come back
although a traditional pattern they do come back
in fact i did one for erm one on for two years i think to ab about the same as that just in pretty colours but it went on and on
cos it's fashionable at the time
now er the things that of course was er was only different skill using colours and patterns but y you understand that the fair isles were developed on pins and you notice the patterns were always small and i think you know the practical reasons for that
because you can't have a long float on the back
UNK for a man cos he push his fingers through the
so that's why the patterns were always small
interesting little about the garment
and traditional patterns from the UNK or the UNK
now that's a modern version again i made that for a couple of years ago but the tradition there was you knitted on hands and you ladies will probably know four pins no UNK all on the circular right up to the neck and then the cast on the UNK there and again no UNK
circular and that was cast on so there was no rough UNK to work on and the same with the collar
so you could wear them under the heavy o oil skin or whatever else they wore on top and it looked a very comfortable garment apart from the UNK
and again you see the patterns are traditional baskets er UNK
anything to do with the ladies could see and translate
right
so just one more of the traditional ones and the historical ones
there's a fair isle but that's a UNK because this was happening in norway UNK everything that in the cold UNK where they've got a nice UNK
that's a fair isle again but can you see the UNK coast which they're very famous for
you've probably seen some of these that are UNK they get a very heavy UNK on them make almost into coats
they look like UNK and they're beautifully made garments and very warm
that's the UNK so there's some of the historical things that ladies had learned to do with their hands knitted on pins of various er UNK or d degrees UNK as i call them
UNK through to little pins
er and they developed these skills as i said earlier basically for their husbands for use in UNK weather and gradually as they obviously got to m make more and more they got these to trade
so they traded them just as we traded with the wool and we're talking twelfth century thirteenth century fourteenth century
and guilds were formed so that they could trade these garments around the country and eventually around europe
we became very famous for exporting wool er UNK clothes and knitwear
by this time gloves were being made hands were er hats were being made UNK were getting made all on hand knit
no you know happens doesn't it
it gets hard work and er someone comes along and says well can we do it a bit quicker
first machine comes along and a man of the cloth as some ladies here know from nottingham the reverend william UNK designed a knitting machine the first machine
fourteen eighty five
a and this first machine sorry fifteen eighty five not fourteen eighty fifteen eighty five fifteen eighty five erm and the reason it was important i mean it's well before the industrial revolution two hundred years before the industrial revolution so he was really a man well ahead of his time
did it for his wife actually because she was fed up of knitting stockings
because what i'm talking about now the knitting product then was hose
if you think of the UNK era even the men wore hose didn't they
can you imagine the UNK here and there was the UNK trousers and the and the UNK
now this was very popular and very much in fashion
very difficult to knit
so this gentleman designed a machine and i've got a picture of the machine here which you can see
nottinghamshire carpenter
yeah s so it's a nottingham a nottinghamshire UNK by the reverend william lee
that's one of the original frames it was
fourteen fifteen eighty five mind
this is taken a few years later
but that's one of the original types of machine that he actually used
it's still working today or one of them's still working today
looks like a hand UNK really doesn't it
it but er the difference this is that we've got a piece of fabric coming of there with a weight holding it down
and the knitting elements are along there
now i won't go into the UNK of the knitting element but it it's to say this that needle four hundred years ago is still being used today
so is the innovation i mean there are other knitting needles but there is still this type of what we call burns needles being used today
and er basically it shows just how far ahead he was
and the other thing of course was that one movement which took about one second right and you wouldn't have a UNK one movement of this machine where the needles go up take the UNK knitted a hundred stitches two hundred stitches what whatever number of stitches were on that particular piece of fabric the width
as you know when you go across on stitch so one second would increase er by a UNK
so productivity increased tremendously and therefore it was going to be a success
having said that in order to get into production or even to use it you can't just set up in those days any more than you can today now you need planning permission to you need
so he had to go to queen elizabeth the court to ask for a charter
ask for a charter to use the machine
and she UNK refused
because it wouldn't knit silk
now silk was the product of the day for the for the royal household you see
it wouldn't knit silk she wasn't going to have it
now that was her excuse but there is some evidence to say that she'd got a big investment in weaving machine and i think she was a little bit worried er that these might take over from
so you see the commercial aspects were still in there in those days as they are today
anyway reverend william lee his son and his brother went over to france to see if henry king henry of france could help him er but before he could get through to the court there king henry died and then william lee died without seeing his machine come to any sort of commercial UNK
but his son and his brother came back to this country early in the seventeenth century about sixteen five sixteen six
by sixteen ten there were three thousand of his machines all around the country
so that's how quickly they caught on
UNK was the first area for some reason UNK in UNK had er some
but mainly in the midlands UNK leicester nottingham
hose stocking hose was being made in mass production and the craft of knitting obviously began to lose it's UNK
the traditional areas still maintained fortunately cos it didn't affect the knitted outer wear at this stage so all the areas we talked about in the north of yorkshire moor and scotland fortunately there's more of a skill to maintain there
but gradually the knitting craft the guilds and the UNK pro production from these cottage UNK began to die down because these machines are anyway that's the history of it that's how the first machines came to light
and for the next two or three hundred years it was very slow progress in terms of technical development although the industrial revolution came along as we all know
er and therefore more and more people used machines and went into factories as opposed to being in cottages and we all know about this sort of thing
but it really didn't affect a lot of the traditional things that we were doing in knitwear
so the hose was still knitted on these machines
bigger machines were developed etcetera
but the real innovation the real changes after the second world war
cos up until then all the natural UNK were still being used wool was being used for outer wear cotton was being used for UNK cotton lisle
do you remember the lisle stocking cotton lisle was stocking utility stockings still i mean i
i was working for the company er in leicester called making cotton UNK for twelve years fifteen years ago
and was still making his UNK still are specialist
so you know these traditions die hard but i m but things had to change and they changed really after the second world war
and it's fairly obvious people had been without people here that remember the war my father
you know there was seven years of going without and going without for lots of things basic things basic clothing food and that what whatever
and yet we were seeing the film from the americans where the film stars of the day with their twin sets and fully fashion stockings and the UNK and what have you
so obviously when the war finished there was tremendous demand
there's demand from the ladies of this and the men to some extent and mainly the ladies for basic products and the fashion products that would lift the spirits a little bit
so this had an effect
it had an effect on the retail sector the retail areas of the country erm the obvious thing is the chain store
someone had to respond to this demand the small little shop in the village couldn't do it even the big co UNK couldn't do it
erm the stores like john lewis and UNK yet they were stores they were general stores weren't they
where you get everything so the knitwear or the clothing side more specialized only had a section
so the chain stores took up the challenge
we have to produce dozens hundreds of dozens thousand of dozens of this product that the ladies wanted
and they came to the manufacturers and they said look we there's no good producing fifty dozen a week on a machine it's not
marks and spencers wouldn't take anyone on as a supplier unless you could produce at least two hundred dozen a week on one site
two hundred dozen that was when i first started in the industry in the sort of la early sixties
dr so we had to respond to that and we responded in a number of ways
the british responded by being the best at one particular product type made on a particular machine
now this looks sort of different from the machine i showed you where they you know the machine but in fact it's the direct development of it it's called the fully fashioned pro and it's and this area's famous for fully fashioned knitwear
but the fully fashioned frame knitting machine the british made the best in the world
made them in leicester nottingham scotland and then the products that made from them were made in this country nottingham leicester and scotland
fully fashioned knitwear now i think you all know what i mean by that then
there's a fully basic classic fully fashioned look right
it's really stocking stitch cos it came from the stocking machine didn't it
that is a stocking machine that we've turned into an outer wear machine
that machine i think has sixteen heads and we did have them up to thirty two heads
when i say a head that one unit there is like the man was sitting at making one stocking at a time
this makes one panel at a time but there are sixteen so through one twelve minute cycle in twelve minutes sixteen garments were produced
or sixteen parts of garment and one man would run two of those machines
he'd be t running one there and turn round and running the other one
and i mean there's s there was a company it's still going in mansfield today that er it w c making twenty thousand dozens per week for marks and spencers alone in the UNK of only about eight years ago and we down a little bit
that's what we were good at
so we were good at the mass produced area for marks and spencers making nice wool garments like that
and the UNK because the UNK had to be developed new UNK had to be developed apart from machinery we had to develop UNK that would meet the demand
you couldn't produce enough wool you couldn't produce enough cotton
something had to be produced so the UNK were produced in
i'll come back come back to that in a mo but that's a classic fully fashioned garment
erm another one just showing what we call a fashion shoulder instead of a
but they're different the thing about the fully fashioned is that it is shaped
you see what i mean by shape
it there is no waste to that product it is knitted and when we come to a part where you want it to be narrow the machine shapes it
and that's what the old fully fashioned stocking used to be
they used to shape and give it a UNK down the back
but that is a shaped garment and therefore it's ideal for expensive UNK
UNK wool UNK and that's why scotland UNK in that area
cos they had the expensive UNK and they produced them on these machines with very little waste
so that's what the british manufactured the machines and the product
what was happening in europe whilst this was happening cos that's after the war they had their own development and they developed a different type of machine called a flat machine
now that looks a very simple sort of thing it's quite large a man stands about that high
so you get about five or six garments in width across there
the difference here is that it's a UNK fabric
now i don't know whether any of you see the little hand machines you can now buy
japanese versions of this like the singer
well that's the sort of fabric it produces
show you the fabric
that is a UNK right
marks and UNK garment again
UNK in the you have to do something with the UNK when it's not showing so you've what's happened to the white
the UNK gone to the back hasn't it
and the UNK fabric on the back
so it's UNK and knitted it on the back
so takes it up and UNK it on the back
two things about that
it means it's got to be heavier cos it's not a single fabric so it's ideal for heavier UNK
UNK and of course knitting some of the more specialist UNK like channel which in particular
so that's what flat machines do they knit these particular UNK and that's what the UNK were good at it cos they look i mean they were far more we're so conservative in this country little better now obviously we do more UNK you know we're talking about just after the war the italians and the french were into colour not UNK colour subtle lovely colours
but these machines could do that
our machine made a nice classical knitwear these made the more specialized things like this
right
so that is a UNK and that's an electronic UNK means you can do all sorts of different patterns now where it used to be limited it's UNK now
any number of colours virtually any number of patterns
i mean you get so busy in fact i think it's probably gone to the extent where it's gone too busy
it gets so you can recognize one of those straight away
and they've been UNK the last two or three seasons they've been back with the UNK haven't they
especially in recession cos ladies think better to have a nice navy UNK i can wear with this hat
one of these i only wear once and everyone's seen
but that's what the flat machines do and that's the machine that i invested in very expensive very versatile they also knit today they will also knit the UNK
i mean they'll knit this UNK and
they'll knit that on these machines so they'll stitch transfer they'll cable they'll do base
that machine is very versatile
that's what the UNK were doing and are still doing
the japanese are now taking over the manufacture of the machines as you can imagine and so that's the end of it for the
UNK and the germans in the terms of the market because they just can't compete
erm again mean time that the americans er the americans much more production they've been producing all this time anyway cos they've got high productivity need it for two hundred million people
so they worked on er what were called UNK machines
i'm afraid it's very that's not very good ladies but might just get an idea to er the type of machines
you can see the man standing there so you get an idea of the size of the machine
there's the man there
and there's the machine UNK machine
if i stood here the machine would go to that wall and the same that way and then round in diameter
so that's the size of the machine
they were initially developed er from a salt machine again like the other ones called the UNK a little hand salt machine you used to turn like that and make salt
people realized the americans in particular realized that the UNK the knit like for UNK the longer it takes to get it doesn't tie your knitting on and
so the UNK it is the more time or expense it is to knit it
so they developed this circular idea because that machine UNK
in one revolution whatever number of UNK are on there there's a UNK for so if there's a hundred UNK in one revolution it UNK a hundred courses
a hundred courses not one like we do on the fully fashioned but one hundred courses in one revolution
and it goes at sixty UNK to the minute
and it's going so quick the fabric comes down there so quickly you can't actually see it to examine it it's coming down
now the quality obviously is not as good as either the flat or fully fashioned and that's why the americans have a reputation for not but that's the reason productivity
if you like to think that we started discuss this discussion by saying there was a demand after the war you can see now that we met it in over and over again cos these machines were all over america
not only that in the far east where we've got hands by the thousand compared to ours they've got these machines as well
so not only have they got the cheap labour they've got the cheap and highly effective machinery
so in terms of demand er it's beaten it hasn't it
i mean everyone's got want them basically
the only reason now looking at the way knitwear is going or any products going the only way now that we can get the latest is if we design er oh er design new ideas that are want something fresh or fashion takes over
they're the two other areas so i've talked about machines er design and fashion is the next major element
the stores have the effect on the purse to produce that get them to you and now you you've got really as much as you want
the only thing if it's a bargain or if it looks nice or you need something new
what you need now not what you would want you want
it's now what you want
erm so you're back to this design element now and that's the major factor
er fashion and design well if from a design point of view erm we all work the same way no matter who in knitwear who you work whether it's marks and spencers or whether it's jack UNK or whether it's john UNK or erm UNK across the road there
whatever very highly er design orientated all sold in the same place
twice a year we all start there we manufacturers go the UNK the UNK go with the buyers from the stores with the UNK from the fashion houses
you go to one place and that place is called UNK and that's in florence
not in france i used to think well the french just starts in florence and it starts there because the italians determine the colour
it all starts with colour
not UNK not colour
UNK which is a castle in the middle just on the UNK of florence er and e for some reason i mean the c the italians have been UNK for UNK
before we were knitting these before reverend william lee was designing his machine the italians were design er pain er tt UNK silk
they were the best silk producers in the world
they were UNK then and good UNK in the fourteenth fifteenth century
so they've kept that tradition so we go there for the colours and they provide a UNK each year er that's the ninety one ninety two
that's the ninety three ninety four
now there looks like there's a lot of colours there
well there is because it's both the UNK and ladies UNK and basically er that's the wool UNK international wool secretary working with UNK but they determine the colours in effect every design house then sells its colours from there
but you find eventually there's perhaps two or three colours that becomes strong through the year
but it's usually not them that make up just like that it's you ladies
cos at the end of the day you just pick the ones you like from your boat you you're gradually the colours come through for you through your magazines and what have you and you pick the ones you like
but there is that sort of broad choice
and they are very good UNK as well and i buy a lot of italian UNK and people say to me why
i mean the british manufacture them why do you buy italian UNK
well for a number of reasons that's one of them that's one UNK and one UNK and he offers me all of those colours ex stock in sort of ten days delivery and er one UNK at a time if i wanted
now as a small design house with a small manufacturer that's ideal for me i couldn't work any other way
comparing it with my friends who i've worked with for years who are most expensive sort of fair enough
known him for years worked with him for years
that's the colour UNK which is very limited
mm
you see
that's two or three different UNK because it's the same colour UNK
and i've got to have three hundred kilos
because they're geared to marks and spencers now there's the advert for them they work with mass production that's where it goes wrong because we've lost our UNK and so i go to the italians in order to get the sort of UNK they offer me now they're the sort of UNK they offer me
look at that
beautiful
been a UNK
and they're all ex stock and the update i every season and i mean every season that's three seasons a year
they also provide us with and my UNK love this i mean they g go over there and they come back and they plaster these things all over all over their design rooms and it looks like a paris design house
but they give them ideas
these are the these are the UNK producers UNK producers they give the young UNK ideas of how to put these UNK together
a lot of them are not practical but it you know it gives them creative ideas
but it's important that they get abroad and see these because they also UNK a lot of feeling from just walking around these places and seeing what the ladies are wearing so it's very important for them to go to those places
so that's the UNK element and we get together with the people like m and s whoever it is and meet there and decide the colours and we're going to do that and that and you come back and your team works together to produce certain ideas for a range
but that's where it all starts from
so that's the design element the other element of courses is fashion
now your fashion is a thing you can't put your finger on really isn't it
but i mean in terms of knitwear over the last few years i can give you one or two examples which i think you'll readily er understand
er for instance erm films used to affect the design and fashion a lot in
not so much now because it's mainly the youngsters that go there
t what is it today
it's television isn't it
and the big one of the big things that affected us in the last few years was er UNK
and why
because of the UNK shoulders
and we been millions of UNK shoulders into knitwear
in some ways okay it's been UNK now but in some ways some garments would look super
and let's face it knitwear is an UNK fabric so it needs something to hold it together
and er small pads i mean that's a that's a pad you can take
yes
right
so i mean you mid winter wool but you can see without it would not have the structure would it
no
now as a matter of interest ladies i sell that at UNK twenty nine pounds seventy nine ninety nine
that gives you an idea of the mark up that the retailers put on the garment which i don't blame them for they've got their problems i've got mine
so that's UNK shoulders
the important thing in the last two years everything has to be in as i say it's not true to say everything but quite a lot of things have been in so both those are the
right marks and spencers both of those
so even m and s has got into the UNK market
er but these er the quite fashionable all long line
and it's still going on for another season
no the we're moving about a bit now there'll be an element of long line but there is er i know a lot of ladies will be relieved to know there is a shorter length coming back in
you'll find you'll find a whole of shorter lengths having been having been to nottingham
so then anyway i've got one other little story about er fashion before i finish before i conclude this
er if there are any questions afterwards i'll be pleased to try and answer them
erm i w we suggest that while you're having your coffee and refreshments if you can push some of the chairs back get those rails out into the middle there and you can have a look
please feel free to try anything on no obligations
as you know erm we take the money here we don't charge you for the talk but we give ten percent back to your w i so it's a self funding situation
so er keep that in mind when you're looking and buying
erm now the other little story in fashion of course is the is er princess diana
now of course she's had a tremendous effect on fashion knitwear ever since she's been involved with before
but our knitwear in particular erm she UNK us by the little UNK she wore er with charlie before she got engaged
you remember
the little sheep
do you remember that
red with white sheep on
hand knitted
see
so we're back full circle hand knitted
caused a tremendous demand for hand knitted products now she payed three hundred and something pounds for that
i'm not saying it was worth that but she payed
hundred percent nice wool hand knitted for her specially
but it created a demand and we manufacturers well come on lads can't you make these
we want to sell these at under fifty pounds
which means you've got to make it for about twelve or fourteen
but you know we rose to the challenge and now there's almost anything we can do er on the machines that i bought
so here are just two examples two or three here that i did
will see that we did
now you know in the old days how i mean
the knitting machine has done what we did by hand well under fifty pound i think that one sold at twenty nine and that's five
so i mean in the shop i did sell for the national trust once but i s i sold them the
you know the
er no not national trust r s p b that was it
national trust so in conclusion in conclusion ladies i think we've met the challenge of the UNK in terms of making and from you the demand
where do we go from there
we can only by hope but er you know with creating new ideas keeping the quality good so you know you feel right with prices your pocket and er therefore we will survive
and i hope you found the talk informative interesting
mr do have a seat
what can i do for you this morning
well i seem to have a sore throat i can't get rid of
i've had it
three week i've got bad breath and it's all like coming down here and in my ear
but the thing that concerned me my little UNK had UNK three times on the UNK
and i'm
wondering whether it's i'm giving it to him to him or what
i don't know whether i am or not
is he giving it to you or are you giving it him
i don't know but he can't shake it off
he's had antibiotics right three times and he's still got it
have a quick look at your right ear your left one looks fine
what job do you do
er well i'm not working at the moment cos i've hurt my back
oh right
i've got arthritis of hips and
you haven't been down drains or anything like that of late
no
no
stick your tongue out
say ah
ah
still can't see much
you smoke
no
any false teeth
no
right
open mouth for me
say ah
ah
yes very nasty looking
okay let's have a quick look around the rest of your mouth
would you breathe out for me
yeah
breath is fine
it's usually in the morning when it's really
yeah
really s i've been to dental hygiene cos i thought
yeah
it were my teeth but she says
no
you've got no problem there
no i suspect what's happening is the stuff that's UNK out of your UNK is what you're UNK and
yeah
is what is making the horrible taste
so your breath is fine your teeth are fine your UNK are fine your UNK fine but your UNK look very UNK they really do look nasty
and you can see little UNK of UNK out
i think you've got a really nasty infection down there
yeah
okay
coming under
yeah
the UNK
you know
yeah
and round
yeah
here i don't whether
yeah
any
yeah the inflammation will often spread down here and make you feel UNK
yeah
now you rea fo w with a story like this you really need a erm a decent does of antibiotics and given the of the unpleasant taste and the UNK you can see ordinary penicillin probably won't do the trick so we need to use something with a bit more UNK
yeah
than that
and that's what i suggest we do
you're not allergic to anything you know of are you
no
okay
do you pay for your UNK
yeah
right
and UNK of some sort might be a good idea
well i've been using that what you buy from
oh good yeah
keep going keep going UNK
chemist and i've also had a throat spray
yeah
UNK will help just to sort of clean out any UNK that's UNK
that's it that's the reason for using it
you won't actually make the UNK better any quicker but it will help to prevent some of the taste and the UNK
yeah
this is a penicillin UNK
it's been sort of UNK charged
yeah
by something extra with it
th one three times a day for seven days
you can take it with food after food between meals makes no odds
y you can take
yeah
UNK if you're getting hot and UNK
yeah
you can erm yeah
you can still drink alcohol if you want to it doesn't interfere with anything okay
yeah
the side effects of penicillin the UNK one is loose motion
so if your bowels go a bit loose don't be
yeah
too concerned
but i'd very surprised if that doesn't do the trick
if it's not settling then we should do some blood tests and a throat UNK but it's bit late to do those today i'm afraid
yeah
okay
yeah
and hopefully that'll do the trick
and if your son isn't settling down then we may need to have another look at him and run some tests on him
doctor and he's still with my wife you see
oh i see well
sending him to a throat specialist because
yeah
he's had it
oh
i see
like a month now he's had it
yeah that's a long time
it implies there's something more to it more to it than just a standard UNK i must say
and if i come down with a sore throat now i'll know who to blame
yeah
i've got a spot here
yeah
i've got to ask you to have a look at it
yeah
my wife says she's seen a programme on telly
i don't think it's UNK anyway but
yeah
i'll show you anyway
yeah
it's just there look i've had it
about three years and it has UNK a couple of times
mm that looks like an innocent little er
i don't think it's UNK but just to prevent my
i don't know how you'd describe that but it's er it's got all the features of an innocent little UNK
right
i'm okay then
yeah i think that's okay
thank you
right not at all
take care of yourself
yeah
see you bye now
bye
hello
UNK hello dorothy
doctor for you doctor
doctor
mhm
hang on
the bad news they haven't arrived so and that rather it still
yes
it still ties my hands somewhat
i mean
because i received no further communication from anyone so
erm i don't know if this would help because you know i'm i said that
ooh a d s book
yes that erm you know they wouldn't
yeah
actually give some money well they've sent this they've sent this letter so
still got a d s book going so
no this is the o yeah this is the one that they sent you see
when i
yeah
came to you and said you know they won't send any money because i haven't got a note but because you was a bit you know doctor's
yeah
a bit suspicious
well you've got a book so you can still actually er
yeah but you see they sent this on the twenty ninth of june
yeah
but the thing is this doctor's note runs out yesterday
mm
see so i can't really cash any more you know
why not
well because i haven't had a doctor's note and it makes it a bit difficult if i cash it
but they would have only given you a book for
right
that long if you had a valid doctor's note for that time surely
no
you have to get another one you see
it doesn't work like that
i mean that's some proof i mean i
it's proof that someone's issued a book to you yeah
i'm not quite has is th it gives no indication of why it's been issued that's the catch
well see these are the ones that i sent in and i didn't think they would they would agree with because they were UNK unless they found the original
mm
do you follow
no they won't accept UNK as a rule
well they put those in anyway so unless they found the original ones
that's two months and that keep that keeps you covered for a while doesn't it
but you see the thing is that's true but sometimes the way they deal with it they deal with it say eight weeks so which makes it what
about UNK
yeah he's just put yeah he's just put depression
i mean how do you actually feel at the moment
well i feel better than i was but i've been at UNK heath which was a religious community
hmm
and er i feel i feel as though i'm generally
mm
aye
what about sleep patterns
that's fine
and mood during the day
that's fine not too bad
see if you're actually better UNK
mm
you actually become fit for work
right
ah in which case it'd be wrong for me to say that you're not fit for work anyway
right
so er i mean if you if you know if you do feel you're looking better i mean you look you know
right
fairly okay
right
so i mean if you if that's how you actually feel then what we should really do is to sign a note at some stage saying you are fit for work on a certain date
mhm
and er then what will happen is the benefit you receive will change from
right
erm sickness benefit or invalidity benefit depending
mm
how long you've been off for to unemployment
benefit if you're eligible
so i and to be honest i think that's what we ought to do at this stage
mhm
if you remain fairly well
now obviously
mm
if how you are
mm
changes
mhm
you know it's a different ball game
mm
and then we have to UNK you and say you're UNK
mm
UNK and then we sign you off
but then
mm
also we ought to be treating it are you not actually having any active treatment at the moment are you
no
no
you see you see i don't mean to be erm rude or anything but as i'm sure you understand you can't really you know you know write a note without my doctor's notes because you see i think if i get a job at the moment i think it'll just it won't last
no
well i
i could write a note
on my own assessment
right yes
but i have got nothing to back up it's a bit like
before you have the notes
oh i can oh yes i can i could
yeah
write a note treating
right
you as my own patient
right
on a on how i find you at a particular time
right
but what i can't do is to look back and saying you've been you are like this now but
we know from your previous history that this
right
is the course of events
and perhaps it'd be reasonable to wait longer before we say you're fit for work
and i haven't got much evidence
you can't do that until you get the notes can you
well it's a bit i well i well i could do but it's a bit tricky i mean to some
right
extent i'd be happy to keep you going for a bit longer
right
there's no
what i don't really want to do is to sign you off sick long term without really knowing i mean
mhm
what's been happening before what's been said
yeah
to you what's been given
yeah
to you
yeah
exactly what sort of thing you've been in
and you can say some of
yeah that's what i
to me but i d i still i don't get the same feeling from you as perhaps i might with medical notes if you see what i mean
well i no i agree
yeah
with you precisely
yeah
i think that you can't really make a decision until you have that literature you can't
it's tricky
but what i'm what i'm is because you've got this order book
yeah
and these you know things from the benefits er agency because if i cash any more it makes it so i mean
yeah
what you see i don't know when these notes are going to come up
yeah
you see
well what i
and i need this cash
yeah
i mean what i suggest we
do
yeah
given you're given how you are at the moment which
right
is probably not one hundred percent UNK fit
yeah
is to actually give you another note for the moment for say
right
erm where are we now
we're july so if i say another six weeks that'll actually get
right
us through to the first week of september
right so these
and then
you can
and then have another chat
and if you are fairly okay then we'll probably say well we'll sign you off at this stage anyway
but
mm
at least we'll have the notes to back up what we're doing and i
right
think that'd be sensible
it'll
right
keep you ticking over for the moment
which is what you need
yeah
and it'll erm and i think that'll be reasonable
yeah
is that okay
that seems okay for now yeah but
it's a sort of compromise
when you
decision but it is difficult to know which way to go when you're actually up you know i wouldn't say you're a hundred percent but i wouldn't say
right
there's anything too much wrong with you either
right
now what i've got to put a diagnosis on this so if i write depression cos that has been the problem hasn't it
right yes
yeah is that fair enough
yeah
and if i put six weeks now this'll overlap slightly with the present one that doesn't matter the d s don't give two UNK from that point of view and that'll then run out six weeks which is about the beginning of september
right
exactly
but i you know i agree with this thanks for the writing the note but
that's okay
erm especially that when you get those er notes from UNK heath
yeah
and then see what you think
but i mean i don't want to stay on the sickness but it is
yeah
invalidity
it's sickness benefit on your
mm
income support
so it's
mm
exactly the same amount of money
yeah oh yeah
so you won't gain any extra yeah
not unemployment benefit ordinary income support
mhm
but you know when you get those notes if you could look at them and see what you think
mm
yeah i think they'll be informative
mm
oh yes
yeah
it's a question of getting them back they haven't long gone but er
right
they will return complete i hope
okay
right
is that there's no point in er me going to work if it's going to just you know work out
no
so i'm just you know unemployed again
yeah
but as i say when you get those notes if you really you know try and understand them so you know
and if i can read the other doctor's handwriting
yes
anyhow we'll sort that out in september i'm sure they'll be there
we sent in an urgent request three
yes
weeks ago for those and i'd be very surprised if they don't soon
apparently they should be on their way because nottingham was er
they should be
yeah
they should be
alright thanks very much
right okay take care of yourself
right mrs do have a seat
what can i do for you
it's the UNK again
oh
actually it started getting a bit better from when i UNK
ah good
what are you taking at the moment
are we putting anything much on
erm i use the UNK and the erm
UNK
UNK
UNK i think
mm
it was back in february i saw you isn't it
let's have a look
and it really is very UNK but that is quite angry it's UNK too and spreading little finger
but these two are fine
mm
mm
hmm
this UNK area
you say that's
mm
yeah
right are you still using UNK and
mm
UNK and
yeah
it's UNK up despite that
yeah
right
okey doke
hmm
it's a bit cracked
it makes it very
as i say it's better than it's a bit better than it was
but it's still not that
no
good is it
no
no
right what we need to do is to hit it fairly hard and try to get it UNK down as quickly as we possibly can
now don't get rid of the UNK have you still got some left
mm
okay
because as soon as it starts to die down you could probably go back on to UNK to keep it maintained
and you may actually have to use UNK on a preventative basis every now and again
even if there's not a deal there as soon as it starts it's slightly UNK straight in
but what i'm gonna do is give you erm UNK is actually more UNK than UNK in the UNK form again to get the rapid UNK
and once again like UNK it's used twice a day
and in a similar fashion you should use the UNK to keep the skin as soft and UNK as you can
mhm
rather than letting it get dried out and cracked
UNK is as i say it's more UNK it's probably not so suitable for keeping going with but for jumping on top of things in a hurry it's fine
and i think that's what we ought to use
sometimes you actually need to use it under something but it's difficult to use under things and part of the hand
i don't know what you mean under
well sort of under a dressing or
oh right
under a bit of UNK so it actually gets absorbed even quicker
mm
but er i don't think we need to go to that er length with you
i've still got those erm you know the little purple tablets
yeah
that dissolve in water
yeah to UNK them
mm
you could you could go back on the UNK if you want
it's not desperately UNK although certainly one of them is UNK quite a bit and if that helps to dry it up and make it more comfortable then it's worth giving them a UNK ten minutes a day
mm
if you want to try those you dissolve one in four litres of water which is er which is a little just short
just short of a UNK yeah you need a bowl
yeah but then you get the right concentration
if you use too high a concentration it UNK and it UNK even more than the dilute stuff does
but that may be worth a go if you've got some UNK left
mm
but i think we'll use some UNK have you got plenty of UNK
yeah
good
a big tub yeah
mm
that's fine
is it alright to put that on you know when it's broken
the skin
yes you've got you've got to be a bit careful with broken skin because if you put things directly on it they tend to UNK
it won't do the skin any harm particularly but it can smart
and
mhm
that might be one good reason for using the er the UNK
the other think i'd recommend is using a fine pair UNK is take off the UNK bits the bits that stick out cos they're the bits that catch
mm
and hurt and
yeah
pull the skin apart
and once they're all sticking out dead and UNK they're redundant anyway so you may as well trim it all down
UNK it up
and you're less likely to catch your hands then
okay
okay
i'm
going on holiday a week on sunday and that was mainly why i wanted
mm
you know to get sorted
yeah
yeah
before then because
yeah
i think if i'm in
yeah
i'm going to spain it's gonna be even
right
more of a nuisance
yeah i think so
well let me give you two tubes just in case you need to keep going for er longer than we might think
okay
and then you can take that with you
so if
the other thing about the UNK of course it UNK the hand which is handy if you're going into the UNK
mm
if you will get some er protection then from the horrible UNK wa soup getting in and UNK it
what about swimming and things
i mean
yeah you're okay you can go swimming it shouldn't do you any harm
i mean in n things like swimming baths are UNK so they've got a low UNK count anyway so you'll be at low risk of getting anything there
right so i use this till it UNK
yeah
up
yeah and then you you've got your UNK to keep yourself ticking over with i hope
mm
okay
some people need UNK to tick over with but er it's a bit UNK to keep people going and going and going on so we'll see how you go with that
lovely
take care of yourself
okay thanks
bye
bye
so when they update it i mean people don't you'll probably find most people don't say yes
it's yeah or yeah or yeah or
mhm
so when they update it they put
right
is that alright
aye
you can say no if you like
right
what's a mapping
mm
erm a relationship between two objects
erm have you heard of a many one mapping
one mapping
which
many one many
no
one many
no
oh tt erm hmm
mm
shall we go into UNK
yes
they're very straightforward
some people
right let's have a look
some people tend to sort of think of functions and mapping as being the same thing
but they're not
er let's have a look
two sets okay
mhm
a is a set of kids in a class
set of names
now michael tracey UNK etcetera
so the elements of this set are kids
in that case
and some of them have the same name
mhm
now erm let's say they've all got names
okay there's no one is called UNK
that's a picture of the mapping
it's just a tie up between elements of one set and elements of another set
mm
if you've got more than one element of one set UNK to the same element of another set
mm
yeah
you've got a many one mapping
a many one mapping
oh right
okay
yeah
if it's a one to one relationship like there's only one person called michael there's only one called tracey there's one called UNK you've got a one
okay
right
now those are the two important types of mapping
mhm
there are two other types
there's the one many mapping
where one element of this maps to that's the one many
okay
and you've got the other one which is just a mess which is the many
right
many is the real life mapping it's what tends to happen
and it's very difficult to deal with
mm
so in maths and computing and everything else we tend to split it up into many ones and one UNK and try and sort them out separately
mm
right
now when so two sets
a relationship between members of the sets
and basically we can draw a line between an element in one set and an element in the other and say that represents some sort of relationship
it can be his name is or she is called
mm
depending on which way you did the mapping
er is that okay
that's a very
mm
quick what a mapping is
i can see the relationship
mm
where it can that apply
right well a function
is a special sort of mapping
a function can be a many one mapping or a one
mm
okay
so if you get something like y equals two x there's all your xs in there
and one y is equal to
and what happens there
is this a one many one or what
well it's only one y
right
but it's got more than one x in it
ah
no
this is a set of numbers
x and y are numbers
okay
oh i see i see
so it's not you're looking at it as two
you're looking at it as one to one
if that's a five it maps to the number ten
right well it's one so it's one to one
so it's a one
that's a one mapping and that's a function
yeah
right
erm we might have another one minus three plus three
nine
okay this is
that's a two one that's a many one
y equals x squared and that's a many one
mm
often in maths it'll be a two one
but it's just called a many one
those two are functions
right
yeah
one many sorry many one or one are functions
mm
the other sorts are not functions
mm
erm now if someone says draw a graph of this y equals square root of x well let's say this way
y squared equals x
yeah
right that's not a function
yeah
why not
because there's y squared y and y
erm what value if these are always look at it x to y right
yeah
those are the xs erm x is nine
sixteen
yeah
what would the y be
four
that's one answer
mm
what's the other one
minus four
right
so this is a one many
that's a one many mapping and it's
mhm
not a function
now most of the stuff that we're just about all the stuff that we're dealing with are functions
so before even we get to is it continuous functions
is it even a function
so that's not a function
if we chop one of these out
and we say
we say something like y maps to the positive or you can say the negative square root
okay
y maps to the negative square root of x that's a function
y maps to the positive square root of x that's a function
mm
but just stated like that it's not a function because it's a one many
cos you never
eh
know with a root
yeah
whether it's positive or negative
yeah
now this comes into
when we start with when we get onto inverse functions
have you done inverse functions
i don't know
i don't think so
they don't ring a bell
erm well they're part of the g c s e syllabus
mm
i think i've probably done some point or other
so yeah
erm a typical thing they give you is so you're happy with
that
UNK
and a function those are functions
okay
many one and one
put this on the back here functions on
if you let's say we have erm something like y equals x squared
mhm
right
that's a function
mhm
it's a what sort of function is it
is it one or a many one
it'll be it won't be a one
that's got more than one value in it
that's got that's got one value
you're okay you're this function
mm
you're that function
i give you the input and you tell me the answer
mm
erm six
mm
what would you give me
thirty six
okay
five
twenty five
so it's one
minus five
still twenty five
so there's it only needs any two numbers anywhere in it to give one number
right
yeah
and that makes it a many one that's in fact that's many one for
right
every value you can give it
so that's a many one function
now when you try and get the inverse function
to come back take the square root of x to find out what y is that's not a function
and they will give you things like this and say find the inverse function
yeah
so as that stands just take the square root of x not a function and you'll have to restrict it
and say well we'll either if we restrict this
see you don't restrict the
when it is a function
the value of x here
you restrict the value of x when you start off
so let's have a look at this
we've got positive and negative numbers here
mm
right
and there's plus five and there's minus five
now what can you th this is all the real numbers right
mm
what can you say about x squared
that's positive
always positive
right
so you'll only get the positive
yeah
so there's no way of getting back with the inverse function to any of these
mm
if you're going to take the positive square root
mm
when it comes back
if you take the negative square root there's no way of getting back to these
mm
so the only way that you can make i mean this is a function
that's a function as it stands
yeah
it's a many one
and if they want the inverse function as well then you've got to restrict the function the first forward function
mm
yeah
and you've got to say that we'll restrict this right restrict it to all the negative numbers
yeah
so the forward function is y equals x squared which always gives you a positive and then the function comes back it's coming back that way
mm
will always give you the negative square root of that
yeah
yeah
minus the square root of y will give you the x back that you started with
or you could make it the positive but you can't have both
mm
okay
so most important thing about functions is what sort of functions is it a one or a many one
mm
so the first thing is it a function the first thing and then two if it is it many one or one
right
and if it's many one does the inverse exist
right now if it does and it's many one yeah
mhm
if the forward function many one then you've got to change the forward you've got to restrict the input
okay
mhm
erm so you restrict acceptable values of x say we're not going to accept any negative numbers in this
mm
right
and then it'll work both ways
you can square it gives us plus twenty five come back take the square root it'll give us plus five
ignore the negative square root because something that gives you two answers
mm
is not a function
okay
coming back would be one many not a function
yeah
okay
so this restricting the input is one of the things that we get on inverse functions
you restrict the input to the forward function
yeah
so that when you come back there's only one thing to come back to there isn't a choice of two
it doesn't matter though because you put it down as negatives
doesn't matter which one
it doesn't matter which one
what you have to say here for this one right we restrict x to say x is less than the of zero
mm
right then that'll be the inverse
if we'd have had x greater than or equal to zero right
mm
then the inverse would be
square root of x
mhm
coming back
it doesn't matter which way you do it but you can't have both
because coming back won't give coming back
no
won't give functions
so erm a many one function usually be a two one and will usually be symmetrical
mm
so if you think of what y equals x squared looks like yeah
yeah
it's symmetrical because for minus and plus five you get the same value of y
yeah
so one way of just looking from the graph and sort of re reminding you oh hang on we've got a many one here we haven't got a one
and it's symmetrical
and usually the even powers of x or anything even powers of x plus something else is going to have some sort of UNK
okay
so that's a little quick UNK of what a mapping is
mm
and what a function is
erm so what are the important things about a function then
erm i don't know
have a guess
erm
what sort of functions can you have
you can only have those that you just said
which are what
many one and one
many one and one
okay
erm now what about this continuous thing what's that all about
how do you mean
functions being continuous
oh
what's that about
do you know like the relationship is
erm well anything you like about what continuous what a continuous properties of continuous functions
and what's the opposite of a continuous function
okay if it's if it's not continuous it's UNK
right
right
what's the difference between a continuous function and a UNK function
go on say what you
one goes on and one stops
one stop
okay
a dis a UNK function has got a at least one point of UNK
mm
there's a point where something weird happens
it usually UNK from one range to another but mainly there's a point where the function doesn't exist
yeah
erm why doesn't it exist
because it's not defined
mm
it's not
there's no mathematical way of defining it at that point
erm the maths breaks down it's not valid
mm
and that nearly always means
mm
so how would you if i just gave you an equation of a function
mm
what would you look for if you were looking to see whether it was continuous or not
i'd probably look like on the on the others
yeah
right you'd look at the bottom of the fraction
mm
and what are you looking for there
what's gonna equal zero
any values of x that would make the bottom line zero
mm
erm and if it's expressed as a number of factors
mm
you'd look for a value of x that you could e make
er what's the other thing that's likely to happen around a UNK
something that you mentioned earlier
he must have ran out with my copy before cos this is different
i think he did i think he said he'd go and get you another one
no i said it doesn't matter cos
erm does it put you off with mike there
mm sometimes
cos i it does it doesn't put me off i get very self conscious
yeah
erm this happens a lot if i've got sort of kids and the parents are sitting in useless
and i'm thinking this UNK alright normally and they're sitting there i should know this
yeah
so
that's how i feel
well he doesn't
i know he doesn't really
no i no i don't think he he's not gonna
no i know
it's up to you
it's if he UNK me later on
and erm
no i know it's
we were just discussing whether your presence is putting the student off
yeah erm i did wonder
it tends to be the case
yeah it's just somebody else there
yeah
you're thinking oh i'll er i think i should know this and erm
yeah
he's just told me just told me
er
get off now if you'd rather
it's just you have er a habit of when peter explained stuff you pipe up
mm
i UNK up
no i think it's a good idea to
yeah
erm the work with two students very often the one that i'm not working with can be learning more because they're not sort of ooh he's gonna ask me a question
you know
and it's ea it's very easy to watch two people talking and think ooh that's what he just said
he's just asking her what he just said
easy
but if you're the one who's being asked
sat there
the question you're thinking ooh no which er is it important that i word this exactly
and you get a bit off put
well i did have a thought
mm
mm
why don't you do what john is doing where he's
yeah
yeah
it's a good idea actually
yeah
okay
yes
erm
oh okay
so you won't object to me
no i don't object to you UNK this no
i was just gonna say erm that provided this is
working alright you could just copy this if you've got a fast UNK
no i no i well i have but mine's mini tapes
okay
no it can be very off putting
even if you're just totally
no i did think that myself
in the background
i didn't intend
erm
sort of staying that long anyway
yeah
because especially when someone says you know this is what a continuous function is
now what's a continuous function
and the person who isn't being asked just UNK it all out exactly what i've said
yeah
even if it doesn't mean anything
they don't have to understand it they just have to remember the words yeah
er it's could be very
so how are you
oh very well
i've got too much work to do
got er enormous assignments to do
which should have been done a long time ago and i've been given yet another extension
right
okay
so what's the other thing that happens round a UNK
that you were saying your lecturer explained about one session in the first half an hour
you went you went to his lecture
mm
he gave one lecture on this topic
the UNK
no he i didn't make that lecture
he UNK that up in one lecture
no
yes
okay
right
but i'd missed that one
right
okay
and it wasn't until i got back that they'd said he was doing UNK
right
right
well that's h what
how do you get them
that's what often happens round a UNK
doesn't always happen
mm
erm if you have a function erm right a function is a mapping
mm
a mapping is you start off with one set and you have another set
mhm
they don't have to be numbers they can be people trees names whatever you like
and there's some tie up you could you could draw a picture and draw a line from one to the other
say that maps onto that
yeah
map onto people mapping to names
mm
erm now a function is what sort of mapping
er many one
or
one
the one is easy to deal with the many one
you can you can do lots of functions with numbers
mm
and we tend to maths numbers
we concentrate on the ones that are numbers
but the properties of UNK and functions apply to other things
erm we'll also tend to work with continuous functions
nearly all the time
most of the stuff you've met so far is continuous functions
so you tend to think all functions are continuous aren't they
it's obvious you know
no
they're not continuous
erm so you're a function generator i'll give you a number
mm
you do the function to it and then you pass it back to me
and your function is designed as when i give you a number you give me the nearest UNK which is just above it
which is equal to that's equal to it or just above it
so one point two
one
just above it
oh you mean one point
nearest UNK nearest UNK above it
two
right two okay
one point three
two
one point nine
two
right one point nine recurring
two
okay
two point two
two point fifteen zero one
three
well it depends how you defined it
i mean i said the erm it's the nearest UNK which is equal to it or above it
ah
yes
mm
we're not talking of UNK we're just talking of a function that's made up
yeah
right
so if you draw a graph of that
mm
right
yeah
there's x and y and erm one two three there
nought goes up to one well nought is actually nought
yes
just after nought goes to one
one
and then it suddenly jumps two then it jumps to three then it jumps to four
and at these points here UNK small little region of the graph there where the graph doesn't exist
okay
yeah
there isn't any UNK
yeah
it's just a UNK a little staircase a series of flat short straight lines
that's a function
mm
it's got one input and it's got one output
right
it's a one it's a one function
doesn't look like a function but it is a function
so maps to nearest UNK equal to or above nearest UNK greater than or equal to x
erm
did i say it's a one
yeah
you said this is like these are one functions
did i
i'm sorry if i did
tell me is that a one function
well i wouldn't have thought it was a one function
i'd have thought it was many one
so many one
many one
well i've given many different answers here i could have been here all day giving you just between point five and point six and you'd have been giving one as the answer every time
so no
so it's many inputs to one answer
that's it
and one input to one answer
right and that's a function
there are other things which are UNK one input many answers
i've never recall doing anything like this before
well
unless
you possibly did it at g c s e in about three minutes
well these are UNK we don't bother with them but here's functions that's what we do really concentrate on
and even then you probably wouldn't have bothered with UNK functions
he'd say here's a function y equals x squared
and it is continuous and it looks continuous
yeah
and you just assume well they're continuous aren't they
so when you come to UNK
i mean there are
functions it sort of throws you a bit
yeah
there are things that i have thought to myself about these
where you have got a function because you can UNK them so much and turn them around and i thought there must be points along functions where it is it goes against the rules
right
when it doesn't exist or when it is UNK
because i know that's a part of maths is picking those points out
and knowing and understanding the
yeah
points
yeah
the big erm you've probably seen UNK proving quotes that three equals two and things like that
and they're nearly all the ones that i can think of are based on division by zero
yeah
now if you've got a function which has got a UNK in it and you don't pick that out
mm
and you try and put those values in you can prove anything
so the answer that comes out is just rubbish
mm
because somewhere you've done a division by zero
and this is sort of right at the beginning by assuming that the function was continuous when it wasn't
yeah
was just sort of setting all up for yourself to fail really
you know set this trap for you
i think that's what's the part of it all is because with maths there is so many rules there's so many
well
different parts
there's o it's i mean if you think of languages it's dead simple maths
it's erm zero is not accepted as a number by a lot of UNK
yeah
cos it doesn't follow all the rules
mm
you can do UNK addition division multiplication with all the numbers apart from zero
mm
you can't divide by zero
now because of that you can multiply by
yeah you can multiply that's fine
no problem there
it's only the division by zero
mm
erm because it doesn't follow all the rules they say well it's not really a number
and it's you know some say yes some say no
i tend to think it isn't
well it's a neither entity
it's er it's an UNK
yeah
it's a neither entity cos it's
yeah
neither that side nor that side
mm
and considering it's not just the band that it's on it can stretch to the band
yeah
either way
because it's so near
and it's more of a number than minus one
yeah
it's closer
i mean it's real
how many elephants are there in the room
none
none
okay
mm
have a look and see how many elephants you can see
oh minus four
what
how many cars out how many cars out there
minus six
it's rubbish
mm
but the rules work very nicely
but they don't work for zero
so you have to be careful of zero
mm yeah
b i think what it is it's purely because in electronics or when you're working out an equation for a value for something else
yeah
if you had a zero on the bottom line at all
yeah
then it is it does it's not that it's UNK it's not that it's it can't be it's purely it's infinite
and that's what you're taught in electrical in electronics
you say it's infinite
erm right
okay well a UNK will s a UNK will say if it's nearly zero
no these are when the value is
if it's as close as you like to zero
aha
then it's infinite
if it's actually zero who knows
we d our rules don't cover it we don't know
you're in the realm of sort of UNK then it's not maths any more it's division by zero
mm
for all practical purposes you'll normally get an UNK
and you'll say well it's getting closer as it gets closer and closer to zero it's getting bigger and bigger and bigger so when it gets to zero it'll be infinite
i mean a simple thing is erm if you if you spin something like that for example
yeah
as it goes r you've heard something sort of er say an UNK going round on a hard surface
and at the point of contact goes round faster and faster
yeah
right
now what happens when it's going faster and faster you can graph it and you can see it going right up
mm
what happens when it's absolutely stopped
does that mean that the point of contact is now UNK round UNK quickly
no
yes no
who cares
it doesn't matter
mm
it's just that what it means is our model has broken down
yeah
our mathematical model of what's happening erm gives us a bit of a silly answer really
mm
that point of contact is UNK round UNK quickly
doesn't look as if it's moving at all to me
it's not moving it's just that the model when it gets pushed to its limits doesn't work any more
mm
erm so whether you think of it as the point is now UNK round UNK quickly or it just stopped
mm
it was really going faster and faster and faster and suddenly it stopped dead
it's a UNK
mm
okay
so there's the real world and there's maths
it's like that with everything there's
well
ideal and there's what really happens
maths explains things very well up to a point
as long as you stick to the rules
and there's two main rules
one does the maths UNK follow the real world
does it model it correctly
mm
yes that's okay
and then there's the other rule i is it valid within the rules of maths
and when you come up against it division by zero it's not
and whether it's electronics or physics or maths or anything else erm when you get to the point where you're dividing by zero you have to say well now we leave the mathematical model and we just go back to the common sense model
mm
right
so i mean what do you mean by infinite in a circuit
to get zero resistance for example
in a
well it
straight circuit
it's not UNK zero
have you got infinite current
yeah basically
it's not UNK the relationships
well what have you got infinite current
well no
we wouldn't have infinite current
okay
i mean you start off with a fixed quantity of electrons that you can push down this UNK
mm
what it basically is i think is that potentially it can be infinite because there is not
okay
a fine line
what's UNK what's infinity cubed
that's still infinity
so it's a very it's
i think that's
a very UNK idea this infinity
well that's what it is
yeah
it's because it's UNK that they refer to it as being infinite
yeah
because it's UNK
it potentially it can go to infinity
erm right not necessarily
erm i mean if you were working with erm solid state circuits and you're talking about UNK
mm
someone puts a hundred amps through it
mm
that's infinity
well it is but
if you're talking about power UNK right and somebody puts erm two hundred kilowatts
mm
down a wire well that's a small value
mm
erm
but i think that
so infinity just depends on what's big enough to UNK the little bit that you're looking at
and there's all different types of infinity
but usually i think ours have been it's more it goes down to not actual being but a an actual reading it goes down to potentially what it's capable
right
or p because you can't take a measurement for there is a relationship between whatever's going on but you're looking at so many different functions within one actual function
so it's coming back to functions again
that you've got to look at little bits at a time
mm
if there's any UNK you'd normally look either side of it
yeah
and see what's happening
i mean with the y equals one over x that we were looking at on friday
like that on one side and like this on the other
how do they get from minus infinity
mm
bigger than any number you can possibly think of to plus infinity with the UNK change in x that you could imagine
mm
i mean UNK than that UNK than that and it just UNK
well round about that point we've got to be very careful because we've got to be very careful about interpreting the model as reality
right and this
mm
is where a lot of the problems come in
if you get into the maths you get into the model and you start thinking of it as reality erm even in a circuit say simple things like ohm's law
it's a good UNK but it's not true cos the more current you put through the resistance goes the temperature goes up so the resistance changes
mm
so it's not true but it you know it's good enough it's a very good UNK
erm but you get some circuits where the only thing you're interested in is the tiny UNK from ohm's law
mm
so it's looking at very small parts of the graph if you like
very small
mm
areas of the function where things that are a little bit out of the ordinary start happening
yeah
and when it's things like division by zero that's the time to s back off and say well we've got a model that works that side of zero and that side of zero
when it's actually zero forget about the model
mm
because the rules that we've made for ourselves in maths er we will we're about to break those
yeah
so we just get away from the model now and see what happens in reality
and it might be that infinity is a hundred amps or
mhm
two amps or erm five years if you're talking about charging up a UNK or something
it's you know if you're talking in UNK and then you go to five years
mm
that's infinity
but it's easy to get carried away with these oh well infinity is still infinity
mm
it's just something which is so big that for the problem we're working on at the moment you'd be there forever or you'd be there from here to the moon or something
mm
it's just something that's very big compared to what we want
right
okay
i don't really think that should erm i mean half of it is not true anyway
half of it's not true and the other half is lies
half of it no where there are so many and so much in electronics which conflicts with one another
and the same with UNK
yeah but so your electronics is a complicated subject and erm i mean if you just go to UNK theory
mm
something can exist in at that energy level or that
mm
and nowhere in between
mm
well how does it get from one to the other
well it jumps
well it jumps
well don't you see it going past if you stood in the middle and watched it there it goes
no
well why not
because it's an energy that you cannot see
it's a potential energy
or measure or
you can't measure it
mhm
you know that
well surely you could measure it as it went from one to the other
no
you would know about it
okay so we've got something that's a bit weird
like this sort of this function of jumping
right
tiny
erm you can't explain it with maths any more
you can't explain it with the funny little rules that we have for how your potential and different things vary in your circuit
that breaks down
mm
and we've got a point where back off from that say well let's have a bit of common sense what's happening here
mm
mm
so it's all about realizing the UNK of your model
so that people absolutely spot on always
it's not it's a very good UNK most of the time it's an awful lot better than erm you know wh what sort of current do you think's flowing in that joe
and he sort of puts his hand near it oh it's a bit warm oh i'd say about a couple of amps
what about that one
it's not very scientific
mm
so using the maths helps to get it more and more accurate but there comes a point where it
that's what happens
so that's a weird function
mm
right sort of you could i mean you could do the UNK up function if you like which is what we were sort of point five or above it goes to the next int UNK
you could draw a function for that
mm
it's a many one
if you try and do the inverse function
mm
it won't work
i give you one point two give me two and i say
well okay you gave me two now what did i give you
it could have been anything
mm
but if i restrict my input to UNK
mm
one three
okay you've got three
well it would come from three
now the only way to make that one is for me to restrict my input to UNK
and then you can get back and use the inverse function get back from your answer you can tell where it came from
yeah
but if it was many one in the first place
yeah
so that's the big difference in functions between many one and one
mm
okay
it's recognizing the many one
i mean i know it's obviously it it's got to be UNK up and if you've got five inputs and you come out with one answer you are not going to get the inverse of this one out
because there are five inputs
so your on your only answer is well it could have been any one of these five
that's a mapping
mm
fine but it's not a function
no
and there are special things we can do with functions and we need to make sure they're functions before we do them
the other thing is functions split into ranges which each ra each bit of them each range is continuous but the breaks between the ranges
yeah
now erm you're making some notes on what to look at when you're drawing the graph
right
function
is it continuous whole range
if not okay
so maybe erm maybe up there
put it in if you like doesn't matter
and label it one put that two
is what sort of a well is it a function is the first thing
and then what sort of function
so is it a function
and is it a one or a many one
and if it's a many one watch out
alright
yes
if it's a many one watch out cos you're going to need what you're going to have to do if you need the inverse function at any time
is restrict
i is restrict that many one choose your input so that it will make the forward function a one
okay
so very simple function y equals x y equals x plus two
no problem with that
beautifully well behaved you can see what it's doing nice and continuous
the inverse function very easily
unless let's say erm y equals x plus two
yeah
okay
erm you're the you sort of generate the answer so er if i say three
okay
now if you got five where did that come from
what must i have given you
well if it's something plus three then you must have given me two
right so to get back to what i gave you you'll take three off
mm
erm let's say you finished up with zero
mm
where did that come from
well if it's plus three you must have minus three
okay
now let's say erm only positive numbers are acceptable
mhm
alright
mm
erm we have to restrict the input i'd have to restrict the input to three
greater than or equal to three
mhm
okay
erm so this is what happens in addition and UNK
mm
erm when you get you know sort of what's ten take away eight
well two
what's eight take away ten take away ten
can't do it
right
true you can't do it if you're restricting yourself to a positive answer
cos you don't get minus two biscuits
you know
how many biscuits do i get today
i've been very good
oh you get minus two
okay
or if you'd have been naughty you'd have got minus six
i think nuts
yeah
it's very UNK i mean you're very happy with negative numbers
no
no
they do a very useful job we'd be lost without them
yeah
especially in circuits and things like that
but they're not real
no
i mean they're even called UNK but they're not
no well i wouldn't have looked at them from that from the point of view of
yeah
if you've got greater than and you are taking away
yeah
then i would see yes this is negative
yeah
but i would not see it as when you're looking along the because that's the first way you're taught it
yeah
i always find plus three or whatever
yeah
and you're looking and what relevance is all this got to it because it's not nothing's given negative
yeah
cos you don't give somebody nothing or less than nothing
mm
it's nothing and that's where it ends
yeah
so that as you say you don't get minus two biscuits you don't get minus three apples you don't get minus you know nobody gives you a minus amount of money
you can't it's not you can't touch it
well the bank does
and it works
no th the bank says that you owe them
so it's just switching it the other way round
so what's minus one
really it's an operator that UNK a UNK through a hundred and eighty
your UNK is your UNK which way the money's going
and minus one UNK it
mm
puts it the other way round
mm
yeah
which brings you on to what's the square root of minus one
mm
what's the square root of minus one
you can't have a square root of minus one
well you use it all the time in electronics
you cannot have j minus one is well no we use
okay
j as a minus one
well yeah
okay
because they realized that they needed it to invent something to fall in to what they've already got
so they needed to invent negative numbers
so they invented them
i meant
i mean we don't like saying we can't do it in maths
so we say oh well we can do it but we'll have to invent another sort of number
mm
and there aren't many
mm
extras that we have to bring in
it's like UNK
i mean i know that's a method of counting
erm okay
UNK
UNK
well i mean it's
and i've told you minus one is er an operator which UNK a UNK
mm
so what's the square root of minus one
there's a there's a UNK
mhm
this is any old UNK
multiply that by minus one
and it becomes that
now i'm going to what i'm going to what i'm going to do is i'm going to operate on it
some operator that keeps the same UNK
mhm
but UNK it UNK through ninety degrees
let's call this operator
let's call it UNK
UNK
so UNK operating on v gives you the same but UNK
what happens if you do when you've got the answer there you operate it you operate on it again with UNK
goes to minus v so this thing
right
okay
if you do it twice do UNK squared on it and it's equivalent to multiplying it by minus one
mm
as the square root of minus one
and that's the that's the j that you use in your electronic circuits
right
now UNK are already a bit of a weird thing
mm
without bringing that in
but negative numbers are more weird than anything you'll ever meet in maths
mm
right
but everyone accepts it
mm
gets used to using them as if they're real
they almost be over to the window saying look at those minus three cars
and wondering why people didn't understand
mm
erm so anything to do with minus one or negative numbers you expect weird
things to come up
but that's all the square root of minus one is
mm
you get used to the idea that all squares must be positive so a negative number can't have a square root
okay well negative numbers are funny things anyway
well this is where i mean this is like this comes into UNK squared will came in to electronics
the j notation will come in
yeah no normally in maths you have you use i
mm
right in electronics you use j so it's a plus i b for a complex or an imaginary number
wonderful names
guaranteed to put you off
what are you doing today
imaginary numbers
ooh we were doing complex numbers
that sounds hard
they're just i mean if you're doing things like a plus b times a minus b or x plus y all squared no problem
mm
somebody else looks
what's that
numbers
no they're not they're letters
so it's developing the degree of UNK
so that you move further and further away from these nice familiar counting numbers that you learnt
saying they are one two three
algebra
erm
because algebra is letters and if you have got er something which is you need a root of it or you can do it with a number you can't do it with a letter
mm
you just have to put the indexes up with the letters to say what you're going to do to it
er algebra is similar to if you like erm if you think of english
you can everybody who can talk knows what a noun or a verb an UNK an UNK and things like that are
and what the rules are to using them
but they don't know that they're called UNK and UNK
yeah
and if you said draw me a picture of a typical sentence they couldn't do it sort of noun verb and probably another noun
mm
that's what most english sentences look like
erm well what are all these funny things there're no words in that
they would say oh yes he went to school she picked a cat
give you millions of examples but they're just examples they're not sort of showing you the shape of it
yeah
and showing the essence of it and what is true for all numbers
mhm
so when you go into the algebra you're UNK what is true for all numbers
a times b is always equal to b times a
right
UNK
if you're talking about UNK
mm
it's not true
but UNK aren't numbers
no
they're a number are a set of numbers in a weird shape
so having things like division by a matrix when the matrix happens to be zero
what does that mean division by zero sounds like a good way out here
we don't know
UNK
get out
you know
good that's got out of that one
erm
if i put that on my exam
well i i'd give you some marks for that
well i mean we're doing UNK and i know UNK sort of comes into i can't remember wh which part of it because it's i know it's later on it's about
mm
but it actually comes in with differentiation to work out circuits
and i'm really not looking forward to that one
no i wouldn't be looking forward to that
because i can remember doing UNK on g c s e most of it i can't remember
i can remember having a particular question which is what's this matrix equal to when it's the inverse of zeros
what the hell
and it's something to do with getting the num the system so you've got zeros in and i didn't understand what the heck it was on about
well they're probably just asking you asking for the answer that i just gave you
what happens when the inverse is
mm
erm when the UNK is zero
mm
and there isn't an inverse
why isn't there an inverse
cos dividing by zero
mm
i mean there might be millions of them for all we know but we can't find them using our system of maths cos ours does not allow division by zero
yeah
because we try to relate it to the real world
yeah
yeah
mm
and division is sharing out between sharing it out into so many sets
you can think of it as sharing it out between people share that ten pound out between ten of you
no problem
share it out between none of you the process goes on forever
shared out
you can't do it
mm
mm
okay
back to back to functions and drawing pretty pictures of them
if it's many one be very careful
you need to restrict input so that so that they usually call them a forward function
so forward function is one
right
yeah
then
okay
because if the forward function is many one forward function is many one then the reverse mapping would be
is going to be one many which is not a function
mm
so we're going to have
you can't you can't you can't have one rule for the forward and one rule for the backward it's got to be the same rules for all so you restrict the input for the forward function
so that makes it a one
and then the reverse
well if the reverse exists
mm
might now might not always
erm for example you could have a function erm saying y equals zero times x so all the answers are going to be zero
x
okay
so you'd have to restrict that a lot
you'd probably just restrict it down to two numbers zero maps to zero and zero maps back to zero
mm
that would be the simplest
yeah
erm there are other ways of doing it
so you're interested in what sort of function you've got
is it a function for a start
if it is it many one many
mm
if you're going to have to find the inverse you're going to need to restrict it
number two then is it a continuous function
if it is if it's not then they will often ask you for what range is the function for what or ranges is the function continuous
and if you exclude the points of UNK then the bits in between often from minus infinity up to plus infinity
mm
those continuous well behaved functions
okay
mm
and on those points where they're not continuous anything can happen
so you know
so it looks as if it's going off to infinity or something but
on this bit here
this was your question
yeah
of x where you just want it is continuous
right
so obviously it's not continuous at that point and around
right
that point and it's not continuous around that point
right
so would what i was wondering is the continuous going to be up to there and after there or can it be up to there in the middle
mm right
so there's three bits
i mean probably i haven't looked at that function but it's probably from minus infinity up to as close as you like to minus three
yeah
but you can't actually get there
no
and then flip just to the other side of minus three again minus three plus the UNK bit
yeah
and it's now it's continuous again all the way up to but not including plus four
so when you give your limits
mm
be very careful with your less than or equal greater than and equal
whether you put the equal or not
yeah
usually with these with the UNK it's going to be don't put the equal in
right so it's
yeah cos you haven't got a value to equal it to
x less than minus three but not equal to it
yes
yeah
and then in this range x will be greater than minus three but less than four
mm
not equal to and again the last bit greater than four up to UNK greater than four you don't say greater than four less than infinity
greater than four
erm that would be okay
it was just i wondered if so if i get something along this line i mean i can cope with something like this
i think
well i think this two things about it
one it's the basis of maths
mm
it's also the way to understand it drawing pictures
yes
right
it's much bet better than thousands of words and equations and everything else get a picture see how it's behaving
tt but everything we do is based on this based on functions
mm
all your electronic theory and everything else they're all functions
sine functions all sorts of
right
UNK fun they're all functions
mm
so it's a good idea to know what a function is
yeah
before you start doing it
and most people spend years playing with functions before they find out what one is
tell you what most of them do
yeah
and they think that they're all continuous
and that's when you really start getting problems and they start treating something as a continuous function and it's not
or treating one function and trying to find the inverse and it's not
weird answers and erm i mean it can have very serious consequences and you find you're working on a little UNK
yes
and
mm
it does a does affect other relationships
so how would you sum up a function
a function
mm
it's a mapping
and how would you sum up a mapping
a mapping is a very vague concept that just says there are two sets okay
mm
erm you could s you could have two empty sets but that's a bit weird
talking about UNK again
nothing mapping to nothing
erm at least one element in each set
mm
and the simplest way of summing it up is that you if you can join a line from one to the other
which represents a relationship
so a relationship exists between an element of one set and an element of the other way of the other set
and there is a way of describing how to get there
right
you could have erm a function erm everyone let's assume everyone in the world has a name
mhm
some don't but let's assume everyone has a name
and you map to the first letter of your last name say
mm
and you go to the dole office and they have all the UNK out there and you go for the letter which is the first letter of your last name
erm
mhm
that's a function
so it's a mapping definitely
cos it's you and
it's telling you how to get from your set which is the first set we're talking about which is your name to the second set which is which box you go to in the in the dole
right
okay
so that's a mapping
it tells you precisely how to get there
it gives you enough information for you to know where you finish
yeah
which element of the other set you're tied up with
mm
okay
mm
so
it's a relationship between one set
a relationship
and another set
right
so you could have a relationship between parents and children
say erm everyone has two parents
more or less safe on that
everyone has two parent and erm so a relationship exists a mapping exists
mm
you map to say your father
okay to his father
chains of UNK
erm so a child every child in the world sort of maps to his father
that's a mapping
what
mm
sort of mapping is that
well it'll be one to one but i would have looked at that as many to one because one child has come from more than one parent
well hang on let's erm yeah
here's a set we'll make it a very small set so we can see what's happening
yeah
and it's only got one father in it
right
and we've got children
there's a few
right
each element in this set maps to its father
okay
mm
and what's the inverse mapping
well you'd have to restrict it
it's okay as a mapping
each father maps to many children
but if we want it as a function right i give you this person's name is UNK say and she maps to her father
and now all we've got all you've got to start from is UNK father
mm
UNK
and i say well whose the child i started out with
well it's UNK hasn't it
no actually the one i started off with is UNK
yeah
that's not a function
erm so not a function coming back
it is a function going
one answer
coming back lots of possible answers
mm
who is the child of this father
could be one of the twenty three
yeah
it's a mapping
it's fine
but it's not a function
right
now if i
okay
just write in there
so that's i mean you can give a very precise mathematical definitions of what we're talking about
yeah
but er russell and UNK don't know if you've seen UNK
about this thick several
mhm
volumes
and most of it is erm whether one and one makes two or not
right
but it's a very it's a very tight academic mathematical treatment of it
erm but you don't need it
cos most people will accept
yeah okay got that
and another one makes three
yeah got that yeah
got several books on it
yes
with all sorts of weird theory of sets and UNK and functions and everything else
i know that i mean i is just at the moment going through the s a t s course
and that's been another thing that's been worrying me over the weekend
mm
because i've had
well the UNK not gonna help
no but i mean it's something that had to be dealt with aside junior school and everything else that's applications getting made elsewhere
but erm i've spent sort of twelve months trying to cope with UNK about s a t s and his previous teacher who was in the second year is a really good very UNK teacher
and is all the children
yeah
and what's to their benefit
right
this one however the union she's in is not the union which is pulling out
and pushing
it doesn't make a lot of difference
erm for a long
i've pulled him out of it i pulled him out of it for the simple reason he is the only one which is i didn't want to UNK him on his own
well
my opinion from last year is that they are far too young to actually be put into this
labelled and UNK and
but it's not just it's not labelling and screening them it's
most of the most of the most of the teachers feel that there is far too much admin work to do with this
there is
a lot of them are having nervous UNK or sort of UNK their family life because
mm
of it
others are saying a lot of them for the last few years have been saying this is ridiculous
i mean if you think of say the time we've spent talking about functions and mapping
mm
it's a very important thing
mm
erm it would normally be UNK over in about three minutes
mm
and then they'd go on to y equals x squared can you differentiate that
good right well you've done differentiation
yeah
now have you integrated that
good well you've done integration
right that's got that bit of the course covered
and when they come to the exam they're how do you integrate this
yeah
erm there's too much in it
so most teachers are tending to ignore the national curriculum and the tests and everything else and teach what they've always taught
the basic stuff that they know they need to go to the next stage
because if they don't understand that there's no point going on to the next stage
cos you're UNK more and more confusion
you see i don't think
so teachers i don't think are going to
they think now that they've got a feeling that this might be taken out all these testing schemes and stuff because i said to them while their argument is that while she's doing these sat schemes and she's following this she's all worked up
yeah
she's not teaching
yeah
she's all worked up she's all nervous because she's trying to get through them and michael is going er further and further away from his maths
because she's trying to push m multiplication in that doesn't come in till the UNK
he's getting it UNK in him now
so if he's getting that UNK in him now what's he missing out on
what part of it is missing
i'm having i'm saying UNK things to him what is ten and seventeen
erm UNK and he's still going back to the fingers
and i think well this is okay it's acceptable
yeah
but he's losing the concept of it and the understanding because
well
it's getting shoved in
yeah
now
just get him he needs to know erm numbers that add up to ten
mm
right
numbers that add up to twenty is a bonus
which will help him
but numbers that add up to ten
and a cut down multiplication table where he just UNK about half of them
well i've tried to explain to him i've actually sat down and said you have got and i've done it in a way of sets
t trying to UNK multiplication because that i remember starting multiplication
yeah
and i remember going through UNK fashion with everybody else
two times two is four two times three is six
now that didn't benefit me at all
because come somebody saying and just giving me them i had to go through them all
and i think that's no good
five million people
well yeah because you're having i mean it's like UNK
yeah
it's simple at nine twenty you know it goes down it's got a particular pattern
yeah
so they're easier
yeah
so if you can relate to something that's over five you know approximately where it's gonna be
yeah
without being actually accurate
but you can determine quicker the things between them
and i think the way they're doing it now i don't know how she's teaching them i know she's UNK
because she's got the two and as she said to me it doesn't matter in the junior school he will take a teacher's assessment or a report with him anyway
so why put him under the pressure she sa cos i said i want to know what the long term effect of me taking him out of this is because effectively i'm taking him out of something of the system knowing he's going to miss that
mm
so i'm concerned what effect am i gonna have on his future
and she's well the effect that you're gonna put on him is probably better than what the others that are sitting the s a t s course
at some time you'll have to come back into some sort of a system like g c s es if they're i mean they might be changed but there'll be something like
he's only aged eleven he's only got four years before he has to have something assessed anyway
and to me they cannot get an overall assessment of a child sitting so many tests
yeah
they get confused the minute you say to them there's a test
ooh
yeah
and they go into a panic
that's no good because then the true worth of the child is not coming out and at that age i mean what had started it was last year i didn't want him to do it
because i thought you know at seven they're too young they're still babies they're not
you know they c the they make decisions yeah but they're still learning so much that you they can't trust a decision that they make there and then
now
no but the big thing is that they only learn
yeah
er anything that's work they've got built in resistance
erm
i yeah
i mean michael is extremely lazy anyway
the best way to do it is to get some get some coins or UNK or something and play yourself
mm
till he comes over and wants to know what you're doing
and it's a
mm
game
mm
erm you have to put them into use erm twelve to start with
yeah
and see what patterns you then make
mm
yeah
twelve ones one twelve
mm
two lots of six in
and you can look at it one way and say oh i've got i've got two rows here with six in and space them out a bit so or give him that so he's got sort of two rows with six in and you say oh from where you're looking at it it's six rows with two in
come round have a look at it come this way
oh yeah
well how many have we got
well it's still the same whichever way you look at it
and let him find out three by four same as four by three
factors of twelve are useful anyway
yeah
erm there's a tendency not to bother with multiplication tables too much because you do everything on your calculator
and that's fine until it comes to
yes
and you can say what's a third plus a quarter
now if you get a kid who knows that three fours are twelve there's no problem but if they don't
well this is where michael is a he would rather i mean when i say to him can i just do some work on you UNK i say no cos you are not doing any work the UNK doing the work
doing the work
mm
i s a cos i bought him a calculator but it was primarily for
well you can
checking
you can give him his tables written out
mm
and or a calculator and ask him er not to UNK tables but ask him five ones
mm
erm and sort of keep asking things like three fours and four threes and five tens and
so he wor it's very difficult to keep your mouth shut and let him realize
yeah well
what the answer is
i mean but
when he when they do discover it when he does discover it for himself he thinks hey i can do this and i invented this myself
hey i can do it
i mean i know through the summer holidays that i've really got to get to work with him on his maths likewise i know i've got a lot of work to do myself for
well that's gonna
august
be your big problem i think
concentrating on your own work
it's time
erm
unfortunately he's in the position whereby although i have got my work yet the problem i face is not just now it's come september he is in a new school he's going to have new people there's new teachers there's new rules there's new policies
yeah
and it's a lot further away than this one
yeah well the easy way for them to assess him is have a look at his tests and if he hasn't done any then they'll just assess him on what he can do
mm
can you do additions
he can do addition and he can do take UNK and he's pretty he's not so bad with them but i think what it is basically they're UNK them now
the ones who are who have seen it all before and done it from last year because they had to split a smaller section of them up into the first year
so they've done it
yeah
they did it last year
so they're pretty confident
whereas these
yeah
these coming up now are not confident and i know by okay the girl is particularly bright
mm
but her and michael are both being pretty equal to one another for some time
yeah
i don't think that by any standard that michael is needs sort of a lot of work with his work
he is quick he is intelligent
the main thing is interested and motivated
that's with him it's motivation
he is if he can get you to do it for him then it's done
yeah
and he is
if you get him to do erm addition and multiplication let him use the calculator let him
right
have an addition table made out
and h let him realize that he's remembering these and it's easier than looking it up every time
it's great fun using a calculator when it's a new toy but when you've got to use it every time you need to work something out
yeah
you start to think oh three add one next one up
yeah
erm give him that on a calculator some things add one
i mean
all the time and eventually i'm not using that and he'll just start giving you the answers and when he does start giving the answers keep on let him get a lot right
mhm
because he's got this new system he wants to use it a bit
erm so you probably think oh he's got it now you've done two or three of them let him do about ten of them what's six add one
what's erm what's ten add one then
right
we do have a terrible problem for some reason when you get to the end of a number any number block whether twenty thirty forty and you get there was a big block there
well yeah
because there is a there is a big block there there's a big change
yeah
weird numbers
to another number and that he used to get really stuck on ninety plus ten or ninety nine plus one
do it with money get erm about a pounds worth of pennies
mm
and ten ps and pound coins
mm
and erm let him let him add five pence and seven pence
mm
and say well what's that all these pennies
mm
right that's ten and two
what's twenty three and erm eighteen
mm
right i'm not having those pennies change that for a ten
mm
and i'm sure he'll be able to do that
and then he will just apply that to numbers
yeah
he does actually i i've tried doing it with him on paper
mm
when he was he brought work home
and he cut it in ten blocks
mm
now he didn't actually to begin with he didn't pick up the concept of counting in tens
well he will if you if you he will if he uses money
he does now
yeah a he does now he understands
yeah
the ten and two units are
yeah
and show him UNK by counting off erm you buy something for thirty seven p and he gives fifty pence
mm
so that's thirty seven p thirty eight thirty nine
mm
forty and ten
yeah
it's a lot easier than UNK and it gets the answer
erm
yeah
well it's something they can actually relate
it gets them
to because they
it's got to be something real
you can't talk to him about erm division by zero being infinity
no
he won't buy that
neither will i
so it's got to be something you can relate to and once the model gets too far removed from reality he'll switch off
yeah
so it's got to be you know they
because they can't see it doesn't apply to them
but better get back to this
right
erm so you're okay on UNK and functions
yes
and your drawing
that's what i was in
okay
so you've got a function you've got some expression that you want and they will usually say sketch in a function
mm
so you can probably assume it is a function but you should check what sort of function it is
erm watch out for the ones
then dis UNK does the function exist for a whole range
yeah
if not where does it stop
mm
okay
now the next thing is where which values of x would make y well first of all the easy thing is what happens to y when x is zero
okay
yeah
what's f of zero
er do you want me to
yeah
what is f of zero
what happens to y
when x equals zero
and then the next bit which is sort of solving the equation is what values of x would make y equal to zero when is f of x equal to zero
mm
and the next thing that comes in is what you asked about where are these points in UNK and these turning points
have a look at
erm what's differentiation all about
what's differentiation all about
why is everyone rushing off doing it all the time
mm
what is it
it's a function of a function
mm
i could draw you a picture of that
i could draw you a picture of that
yeah
here's a set one two here's a set of function here
and
two of these map to one of those
so that looks like a function of a function
this mapping is a function
is that what you mean
no
so t try to think of it as something a bit more real
erm there's a curve
we want to find the gradient of the curve
mm
at that point
happy with what gradient is
gradient is a slope
yeah
that distance and that distance use those as a ratio tan of that angle
yeah
right
and it tells us whether the curves
so an interesting point is where the gradient does this
right or the other shapes we've been talking about
right
yeah
now there's an easy way to find that out without plotting every point
mhm
erm cos if we differentiate it gives us the gradient at any point
mm
right you can only differentiate a continuous function
yeah
well the another of function a UNK function
mm
now if it's not sometimes there are some continuous ones that
isn't it the velocity
differentiation the velocity of
yeah
that's a practical
yeah
a practical example of it
in the sort of pure maths you can differentiate a function your functions are split into two types UNK and non UNK we'll just concentrate on the UNK one
er generally if you try and differentiate a function which isn't continuous
mm
the only way to do it is to split it into two continuous bits
and do
mm
each bit at a time
mm
okay
so if we've got something like y equals x plus one times x minus two times x plus three
mhm
right
and someone said draw a sketch of that
mm
okay
what's it gonna look like roughly
well it's going to be something like that cos it's
yeah so it's
cubic
it's cubic
what happens when x is minus infinity this weird number that UNK all the rules
when x is extremely negative
y i is negative
yes but what's this come to
are they talking about such a large number
right we're talking about such a all we got to look t i t the sine of x and it's plus times plus times plus so it's
mm
okay
and so we're it looks like x cubed
right
yeah
minus infinity minus x cubed and at plus infinity
er cubed
plus x cubed
zero
x is zero do you think we'd get
no
you think some number here
so there's some points right away
yeah
erm then what are the values of so we've done what is y when x is nought
minus six
right so the next thing we'll do is
is these
yes
which values of x would make y equal nought
minus one
okay so minus one
so we've got quite a we know from this that it's roughly er cubic
we know now where it cuts the axes
we know roughly what its shape is
the only other thing we want to find out so we know it looks something like this
yeah
the axes are somewhere depending on these
now the other t the important points of this are don't forget these bits are very important
mm
tend to get left out
people tend to do well we'll do it from minus well we'll do it from minus ten to plus ten there
that's a picture of it
it isn't it's just a very tiny part of that function
yeah
don't forget the outside limits
where does this happen because now that's very important
mm
very interesting bit
where it's going up and then it levels out and it comes down
it's going down it levels out and starts going up again
right
right
local minimum and local maximum
local maximum
that's not the highest value it ever takes cos all these are much higher
yeah but that's
yeah
just going
and that's all of these are much lower
so it's a local maximum and a local minimum
in this range
yeah
so how do you find those points
i don't know
i can't remember
is it differentiation
it is differentiation
so could you differentiate that
so if someone said sketch that
you'd need to differentiate this to find
isn't that one
well now what are you going to do
how are you trying to differentiate it
i don't know
so you're just doing one
er you've got to work these out
right so you have to expand it
okay
so what's this gonna come to the first two brackets
well it's x squared and it's
and don't be afraid to put those on when you're doing this
i usually do actually
right
yeah
i usually do because i'm not he does a quick method which is sort of and i don't go to that because it's too mu
hopeless
it's no it's no it's no it is much too easy to make a mistake
with a little bit of extra time you can
yeah
get it right
so that's
yeah
gonna be a minus two
so
okay
yeah
minus two x and then
er that's just gonna be minus two because i do it
oh i see
right
like that like that and like that and like that
okay
so your next one is
well i there is a minus two x then there's a plus one x right and er now it's minus two
okay
right
so x squared
x squared minus one x minus two
x plus three
yeah
switch it about like we can with three times four and four times three cos these are only numbers
yeah
that might be seven this might be three
mm
whatever it is it's a number
okay
so you can do the same on that
so if you do the same on that one and then differentiate it
now i'm getting confused now
okay
so a sys a system
minus x squared minus two x then we do this way three x squared
mm
minus three x
and add them up
yeah
and that's y equals
right and now i can differentiate that
right
good
no that has a
and that
right okay
so where does these maximum and minimum come in
well this i wh what does d y by d x mean
well that's it's the velocity of something
okay
if we were if we were doing velocity time graphs and things
but this is just a some
that's the gradient
that's the gradient
ah
right
and what are we looking for there and there
we're looking for the local minimum and the local maximum
right and what happens to the gradient at that point and at that point
they stop
they stop
it takes a special
value
yeah it changes
yeah
from here it's getting closer and closer to a certain value it reaches that value and then it changes
and then it gets to the same value again
here
right what is the value of a of a gradient that's absolutely flat absolutely level
not going UNK or down it's just level
zero
right
so you put this to zero
right
so you're looking for values of x that will make the gradient zero
and that's what the gradient is for any x along here
so what would you do now
right so we've got three x UNK plus four x zero
yeah erm don't just suddenly come out with it like that
no
when the gradient equals zero
right
then that equals zero
right
so what values of x would make that zero
erm well plus five would it
are you looking for each particular turn or are you looking for everything
well which wh what gives you the value of the gradient
erm this d y by d x equals that
so if i said x is three how would you work out what the gradient was
what's the gradient at the point where x is equal to three
erm
how do you work it out
this
three times three squared plus four times three minus five that would give you the gradient three
mm
yeah
so this whole expression gives you the gradient
you just put x into it
mm
and it tells you what the gradient is
now we want the gradient to be nought
so you've got to find some value of x that you put into there and there to make the whole expression equal to zero
nought
but look that'll make it minus five
yes
is there any quick way of doing this or is it just trial by error
well how would you no forget all about differentiation now if i gave you something like that three x squared plus four x minus five equals zero
which you've got there
yeah
and i said solve that equation
what would you do
it's a UNK
right so what would you do
erm
it doesn't look as if it'll UNK easily
no it doesn't
and even if it does it's often quicker not to bother trying to UNK it because especially in an exam if you could
we get more of you than me get plenty of me on these
right that's better okay
now where's the question in the book let's see what you made of it before you copied it down
no actually it was just it was just like a question erm find x that
okay
was that was all it was
okay
it was just like a big list of questions
so right so we've got x and two open brackets x add four close brackets equals minus four
and the problem is this brackets here the x plus
what are we going to do with that
erm before we do anything let's have a look and see what it would mean if it would mean just as numbers
let's say x is was ten i mean it's not but let's say it was we'd have ten add two brackets ten add four
minus four now we won't bother with that side what would we do on this side
would you add the two to the ten or what
yeah
you sure
no i would multiply it
right in there between the two and the brackets although they don't bother to put it in there's a multiply
so that's the first thing to realize we've got a multiply in there now we've got this two UNK in the middle here between an add and a times so the times win
yeah
now we've got multiply into the brackets so we'll just leave the ten where it is and work out what happens to this everything inside the bracket has got to be multiplied by
by two
so
two times ten
add two times ten twenty
two times four eight
times ten add two times four eight that's got rid of the brackets equal minus four
now are you happy with that
yeah
okay so you do it with the xs then i did it with the numbers that's the easy bit
so whenever you've got xs and UNK and all sorts of strange things in there think just it's only a number
we don't know what it is yet we haven't found out but it's only a number
and whatever we do if it was a three a seven or a ten a five just do the same but with the x
shall i
yeah that's fine carry on
what do you do next
it's going very well
are you sure about that
not really no
it's right it's correct it is minus twelve but i could see you were really not very sure what you should be doing about that that's great you've found you've got that down to there let's have a little look at the number line zero one two three and so on minus one minus two minus three minus four
and what have we got here
we've got minus four take away eight so we start at minus four start there and then we take away which means count along that way for eight so we get minus five minus six minus seven minus eight minus nine minus ten minus eleven minus twelve okay
whenever you're not sure about what to do just look at that and just write it down or just think about it UNK it there's zero then we can adding a negative number or taking away go that way up towards the negatives adding a positive number go that way
okay so you've got three x equals minus twelve see minus twelve a negative divided by a positive comes out negative
it's the same for addition and erm same for multiplication division
if the signs are the same both signs the same when you're multiplying or dividing both signs the same will give you what
positive
right good and if the signs are different
negative
so you get th a negative divided by a positive be a negative cos the signs are different
oh that's no problem is it
no
erm now what were you doing when you were
th
trying it
you were doing two times x add two times two x add eight
i was two there
mm you were
and the two and the two x i was leaving
okay let's have another little look at brackets let's try multiplying say a hundred and one by twenty three
okay
and we'll do it with brackets
so what have we got
we'll do twenty three times a hundred and one okay
twenty add three put the brackets round it show that's one number we have to work out what that is first
times which we don't bother writing in a hundred add one okay
now we multiply everything that's in there by everything in here
so would you like to try that
how would you do it
you add those together
erm i want you do it without adding them together okay i'll show you one
erm you've expanded brackets before like this haven't you
yeah i think s
okay so twenty times a hundred
oh yeah
is two hundred
twenty times one is how many
twenty
okay
three times a hundred
three hundred
and three times one
three
then if we add those up
hundred and twenty three
right okay do you want to check that on your calculator
it doesn't sound about right
no
okay so have a look and what's gone wrong here
let's work backwards
three times one what's that
three
that's okay
three times a hundred
three hundred
okay
twenty times one
twenty
twenty times a hundred
two thousand
right not two hundred two thousand
so that's th that's my mistake there but that's a very common error yeah
now if we add it up
it's going to look a little bit better
two three two there
yeah
okay we check it this way
twenty three times one o one
how would you do it long division
l sorry multiplication how would you do that
what do you mean long
just normal multiplying the way you multiply that out by hand
have you tried that or you u have you always used the calculator
yeah i've always used the calculator
okay the way you do it by hand is you just say one times twenty three is twenty three
no tens times it
a hundred times twenty three will be twenty three
twenty three
hundred
add that up two three two three is that what you got on the calculator
yeah
so when we're doing this normal multiplying we're really doing this
yeah
yeah
now if we don't know let's say we wanted let's say we want to find out what would erm what would a hundred and one times twenty seven be
let's say i'm going i give you this question i want to find a hundred and one times twenty six right
a hundred and one times twenty seven a hundred and one times twenty eight twenty nine we'll put twenty five in as well
in fact we'll ma we'll make it all of them twenty three twenty two twenty one right
find all these
what's a hundred time twenty six a hundred times twenty seven sorry a hundred and one times all of these
well we could work out a general thing we use brackets and see what happens
are you happy with this
yeah
okay
so it'll be a hundred and one times twenty something twenty plus x but we don't know whether we've
yeah
got twenty one twenty two twenty seven twenty eight twenty plus something we could make that n if you like instead of x we could make it n is just some number from about nought to nine
a hundred and one times twenty what will that give us
it'll be
two thousand and ten
it'll be twenty hundred and twenty
okay
oh
i see
yeah
erm add now what's n times a hundred and one
well this might be th this might be too awkward this
it might be easier to split this hundred and one up a bit hundred add one times twenty add n okay
that's a bit easier
a hundred times twenty
two thousand two
yeah
two yeah
two thousand or twenty hundred same difference
now a hundred times n what will that give
a hundred n
okay a hundred
now one times twenty
that's one
and one times n
one n
one n so if we add those up keeping the numbers and the UNK separate we get two o two o add that
one o one n
one o one n okay so let's see what happens when we try a hundred and one times twenty seven that just means that n equals seven
now what could that come to
well it should come to two o two o plus seven times a hundred and one which will just be seven o seven
let's see what that comes to
you want to check that on the calculator see if that one works
no
no
no oh wrong again what's it what it give then
two seven two seven
it should always come to two seven two seven shouldn't it
we've got two seven that's a two
right i put a nine in that was a bit more than seven okay
so it does come to two seven two seven
how about we know it com it always come to that two twenty plus a hundred and one n so let's try twenty nine when n is equal to nine we'll get two o two o add a hundred and one times nine UNK just be nine o nine
nine o nine
add that up nine is two nine two nine
i don't think there's any need to check it on that cos we can see the pattern
yeah
that's coming out two seven two seven two nine two nine what would erm so what answer would you expect if we try one o one times twenty six what would ma what would you expect the answer to be
three six two six
so we expect that and we're pretty certain that'll come to two six two six
we can just put it in there it's two o two add now this time we've got n equals six o a hundred and one times n added on six o six two six two six okay
it's all this is showing really is that when we do multiplication normally you see if you if you've done this sort of multiplication you've seen the pattern and how things are working and how you're not someone says to you multiply erm seventeen by a hundred and one
don't try and do the wh whole lot all in one go well that's simple george i happen to know my hundred and one times table
as far as the UNK
you work it out in stages little bits and then you add the bits together and then you add the bits together so you say well i could do a hundred times seventeen and then i could do ones times seventeen
and then i could add them together or if that's a bit awkward what i could do is i could think of the hundred and one as a hundred add one i can think of the seventeen as ten add seven and then i multiply them this way and i multiply all the bits and then add all the bits up at the end
so we're doing a hundred and one times we'll make that erm twenty eight
we've done twenty seven up there we'll do it again here say it's a hundred and one times twenty seven
so a hundred times twenty is twenty hundred a hundred times seven will gives us what
seven hundred
one times twenty
that's twenty
and one times seven
seven
and if we add all those up
two seven two seven
two seven two seven
now work this works with any number so if we've got we want to find out erm sixteen times twenty five there's an easy way of doing it think of the sixteen as four times four okay
and then that's the sixteen the four times four so now it's times twenty five
and then we could look at it that way
four times twenty five is
a hundred
so the answer is going to be four times a hundred four hundred
so it's an easy one to check see what we do when we do it with brackets
we've got ten add six times twenty add five okay
if you'd like to do that one
hello john
thanks very much
got
okay
time to finish your tea tonight then
sorry about that last week
i came in after you
oh dear
i was supposed to have a lift and erm i was waiting like i say ten to five we knock off half one you see and the guy never turned up the car was there but
so er it was a case of where i worked er was g p t er buses
buses yeah
and there's no bus direct
no how's it doing there are they still sort of
yeah
it's er well you see g e c took over er and that's the worse thing that could happen to anyone er cos is an accountant and manufacturers
so he just looked at it and says making a big enough profit
that's right and if that's right and even if you're making a profit
yeah
if he thinks he can a er
make a better profit
make a better by selling the assets and literally UNK it he'll do so
er he couldn't give a damn about er
about er people
no
i mean first thing he did was er UNK we used to get four weeks for every year redundancy payment bang no forget it
and er they're going through the courts now
it i mean it now just it just ruins the morale doesn't it
so you're
that's right
not getting good work out people
that's right
won't put themselves out for the firm and it's you know
yeah
he can't see that doesn't help in the long run if
yeah mind you his short er term policies so it doesn't matter in the long run
right
ten times twenty is two hundred
ten times five is fifty then we go down here and six times twenty is one hundred and twenty
six times five is thirty
right
your arithmetic has really improved you know you can do these things in your head now whereas not all that long ago you'd have been reaching for the calculator thinking oh i can't do that
and now you have a go and get it right
good
is it four
erm let's have a look all zeros down the end and then we've got three and two that's a five
yeah
five and two is seven and three makes
ten
ten so that's a nought and carry one right
and carry one and then we've got two and one is three and the one you carried makes four
actually you're right with your four there it was just you UNK an extra ten in somewhere okay
and that's what we got doing it that way
so you could you reckon you could do sort of any number of those
if i gave you lots of those to do you
yeah
reckon you could do them no problem
yeah
so try one with the xs in now
now what's the difference
what's the difference
no difference at all is there
do you want to do another one with the numbers in
no
no
no okay
try one with the xs on the back of that save my paper a bit
right
erm we'll put
we'll go right for the awkward ones and put an x and a y in as well
what does that come to
hundred times ten
okay
is a thousand
right
hundred times y a hundred y
okay
x times ten x times y x y
okay
and then adding all these up well there's none of them that add up that we can just add in to any of the others so we'll have to leave them all like that so the answer is just a thousand plus a hundred y plus ten x plus x y now if we wanted to multiply let's say we want to multiply a hundred and three by seventeen that just means that x is seven sorry x is three and y is seven
so this should come to one thousand plus what's a hundred times y
hundred thousand seven hundred
good and what's ten times x
one thousand
right and what's x times y
that's three times seven
so we've got a thousand
twenty one
right we've got a thousand and we've got a hundred times y hundred times seventeen okay
and we've got tens times x ten times three hang on ten x is three okay we add those up one two and three is five seven so see if that looks anything like right
a hundred and three by seventeen
is it wrong again
yeah
oh no never works this does it
so is this right
a hundred times ten is a thousand
yeah
a hundred times y is a hundred y x times ten is ten x times y is x y so that's okay the bit you were worked out is fine
so we're doing a hundred and three which is a hundred add x being three
times ten add y and y is seven
so let's see if we've got these we've got one thousand yes
a hundred y is
no y isn't seventeen
seven
y is seven so that should be seven hundred
okay
erm ten times x which is the thirty
yeah
and then x times y which is twenty one
is that right now are we still one seven five one
yeah
okay
now you can see how easy it is with the numbers to make mistakes especially if you're multiplying by tens or hundreds or thousands or looking at trying to just look at a bit of it oh that's just oh hang on is that seven or is that seventeen
it's actually easier when you're using all xs and UNK
yeah
it really is this is the thing that people won't believe
they i'd much rather be doing a hundred and three times seventeen
but it's easier if there are no numbers in it at all if it's all letters
when you pop it in you're not gonna you don't make these mistakes
so try this one that was a good that was good that
try this a add b times x add y see what that comes to
a times x
that's it
a x a times y
yeah you normally write them in a straight line but when they were numbers i was writing them under each other cos it was easier to add
so yeah a times y is
a y
right
b x erm b y
okay and they're all they're all added together because there was
well what did you think of that compared to doing this with the numbers in
that's a lot easier
it was an awful lot easier wasn't it
there's no chance of making all these errors that i was making oh no what's this
it's seventeen hundred or seven hundred or what's a hundred times twenty is that two hundred
oh no it should have been two thousand
it's easier it's the easiest thing is when there isn't a number in sight when it's all letters
yeah
okay
now a more interesting one try this
a plus b times a plus b
a times a squared and a times b a b
right
b times a b a
right normally write it a if we get an a b a we'd write it a b we keep the letters in UNK order when we multiply just so we can see what's going on
see why when you've done them finish off the last one then
b times b is b squared
right
a b what does that mean
a times b
and what does b a mean
b times a
so it comes to the same thing
so instead of those two we'd do that first as you've done it and then instead of those two we'd just write two a b so it'll come to a squared plus two a b plus b squared
so if you want to just write that in
so it's a squared
a squared underneath that one now these two we just add the a b and we that's also an a b we've written
yeah
it as b a so we've got two a bs
so it's like doing the a b and then double them
yeah so it's two a b two times a times b
yeah
plus b squared
right brilliant
try this one
what do you think of that compared to the numbers
it's a lot easier
it's e once you get over this shock of UNK i haven't got a number oh what am i going to do nothing to UNK on to it's all letters ooh i can't do it i can't do it
you know
yeah
once you get over that a UNK
this is easier than doing it with numbers any day
so let's try a minus b times a whoops a minus b see what you get from that
now it's just what you've done there right but you've now got to start thinking about signs a bit haven't you
we've got a plus times a minus or a minus times a plus or what
what does it give
a times an a
right
go that's a squared
okay
and then erm a minus b
yeah
times a minus b
well hang on
follow the normal erm oh okay do it go on do it your way
a minus b times a minus b that'll give you what
b squared
yeah and is that plus or minus
plus
good
cos the signs are the same
so it's a squared plus b squared and now what about the other bits
b minus b times a is
now when you were doing over here you did a b times a is b a okay so it's gonna be b a all you've got to decide now is it plus b a or minus b a so you can put your b a down while you're thinking about it
and what have you got
minus
good
so cos it hasn't got a sign in front of that a so it's a plus a we've got a plus times a minus which is a minus
and what about the last one then
b times b erm minus b times minus b
no you've done that already
yeah so it's
which is why it's better to sort of hey now hang on don't put another b squared in cos you've done that
let's just put it here a minus b times a minus b now it's UNK to go for the easier ones in it as you did so we'll do the a squared okay that's no problem
done the a squared and you said well let's do the b squared cos that gives a positive then you got a little bit sort of not sure of which ones you'd done and which ones you hadn't
so it's probably better to stick to the system of a times that one that gives us the a squared okay
now a times minus b what does that give us
that gives us the minus b a or minus a b
yeah
okay
so we need to carry on from there so i've done the a times a and the a times minus b now we start with the minus b times each other so what does give
minus b ti minus b times a
will give you
minus a b
good brilliant yeah
gives you another minus a b there now erm
and then b minus b times minus b
gives you a
a b squared
right
a plus b squared
a plus b squared
put that one in put the plus b squared at the end there
right so when we add those up then we've just got a squared and how many minus a bs have we got
two
so we've got to finish off with minus
two minus a
so we finish off with minus two a bs
okay so you finish up with a squared minus
minus two a b
that's it good
plus b squared
plus b squared
now those two you probably won't come across it much but the level you're doing but those two expressions a plus b times a plus b and a minus b UNK times a minus b come into algebra a lot they crop up again and again
and there's a n there's one more that comes in for you to have a look at
a plus b times a minus b what does that give then
a times minus b
erm do the first one of this into the first one
wasn't it
oh that's right
okay
so a times a
a times a squared
right
a times minus b
right
is minus a b
okay good
b times a is b a
right or a b
a b
and b times minus b is minus b squared
good right
minus b squared
so you've got a plus a b and a minus a b there
they just cancel out
yeah
so what does that come to altogether then
a squared minus b squared
right erm so those ar those are the i mean that one is the most useful actually a plus b times a minus b comes to a squared minus b squared
cos the a b the plus a b and the minus a b cancel out
so if we wanted to do some i mean if you if you can use that to do mental arithmetic to impress your mates that's
or maybe even the teachers if they're not teachers
let's say we wanted to do erm twenty one times nineteen
well let's rewrite it as a plus b times a minus b so if a is twenty we've got twenty add one times twenty minus one
okay
and we know that the answer comes to a squared minus b squared
well a is twenty so that comes to twenty squared minus one squared
so twenty squared two squared is how much
two squared
t just two squared would be four
and ten squared
a thousand
and ten squared is
ten s
ten
four hundred
is a hundred
so it's four hundred minus one squared and one squared is
one
just one
so it should come to
three hundred and ninety nine
erm have we got that right
twenty squared
is that not bigger than that
it should be very nearly twenty times twenty
yeah
so could you try what i said could you do erm what's a big number for you
a hundred and one times ninety nine
yeah
no
what's wrong
a add b comes to a hundred and one
mhm
and a take away b comes to ninety nine
so what would a be
a plus b s two
it'll be two
th that two is very important where did you get that two from
cos ninety nine plus two a hundred and one
right so the difference between these two right so let's say that's a add b and that's a minus b and if we take that one away from this one we get two
so if we had a add b that's one number take away a minus b it comes to two
now let's what d what does that lot come to on the left hand side
a plus b minus brackets a minus b
shall i write the arrows
ah now we're not multiplying we're not multiplying here
we're just working out what this comes to wh with the minus going in to it
now what did you mean by write the arrows did you mean from here
yeah
no
let's write it slightly differently let's write it as a add b add minus one times a minus b are you happy with that
no this is all going
right
and i don't know anything
that's what i thought right
you do know quite a lot but you're thinking UNK where does he get that from
well it's back to the old confusion again that we've got this stupid sign here which can mean it's a negative number or it can mean take away and sometimes it doesn't really matter which way we look at it
so let's put some numbers in let's put some numbers in
let's say we're doing let's look at the one that i did
which w erm twenty add one take away twenty take away one
what does that come to
well it's leave that as it is this bit comes to mi think of a minus one
what do we do you must take away everything that's in the brackets so we take away a twenty so that's the same as a minus twenty and then we'll take away a minus one signs are the same so it's add one
right take away a minus one is the same as add one so we've got twenty add one we can get rid of these brackets now twenty add one take away twenty add one
twenty and take away twenty cancel out and it comes to two
right so what happens here
with this lot we've got a add b that's one number take away a minus b that's going to come to a add b a take away a or a minus a and then take away a minus b taking away a minus b is the same as adding a b so the a take away a go out and this comes to two b now this is not using a long way a long way round to do it
erm it is but we're l we're seeing quite a lot about how brackets work in algebra
now brackets weren't invented for algebra they were invented for these normal numbers that we play with
they work for those and algebra just follows so it just follows the normal rules that we're using for the numbers that we know
so we've looked we've looked at one lot of brackets times another lot which is the most difficult thing to do really and you can do that no problem
now we need to look at one lot of something in brackets add another lot well let's forget about the first one being in brackets let's say we're doing ten take away six
what does that come to
four
okay so i'm going to do ten take away now i'll put some brackets where that six was i don't want to write a six i'm going to write it as five add one
now that should give me the same answer as if i do ten take away five so it's take away a plus five yeah
that just comes to take away five and then take away a plus one take away one
ten take away five how many does that come to
five
take away one
four
right so that works okay
now i should be able to say ten take away i'm going to write six in here instead of six i'm going to put it as nine take away three
so we do ten take away a plus nine that's just take away nine
yeah
take away a minus three is the same as adding the three
don't forget the same with take UNK as well if the signs are the same you get a plus or you get an add erm so that's i mean i can see this is the bit you're not too happy with but we'll just see if it works
so take away a minus three is the same as adding a plus three and what would that come to
ten take away nine
one
add three
four
ah
so it does seem to work this method and it wor this is the method we have to use for all the numbers including the as and bs and xs and UNK where we don't know what the number is
so that bit you got no problem with it if i keep to positive numbers inside there have you
so ten take away if we did something like ten take away a add b well that's the same as ten take away a and then take away b
yeah
if i say to you i want you to do this sort of ten take away three add four in brackets so you'd add the three and four get seven ten take away seven three
or you could do you could take them away separately
take away the three then take away the four
