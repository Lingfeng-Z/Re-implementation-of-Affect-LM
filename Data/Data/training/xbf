so you're okay with that ten take away a minus ten take away a add b will be ten take away a and then take away b but if we do ten take away like we've been doing here a minus b and it comes out the same as this it'll be ten take away plus a just take away a and then take away minus b well taking away a minus b is the same as adding b erm do you remember the table
for when we're adding and taking away and things
that if we have let's have a look at some of the easier ones
if we're adding a positive number so if i say add plus three to a number it's the same as just adding them okay
if i
so these are say those are the that's a positive number and that's a negative number and this is it's that means just add the positive version
now how about if i take away
if i take away a positive number of course that's taken as normal take away
yeah
good
what about if i add a negative number
i'm going to add some money to how much money how much money have you got
you've got ten pounds say i'm going to add some money to that good
so i'll add two pound to it i'll add a positive amount to it and you've got more you've got twelve
my next day i come in and say oh i'm going to add some money to what you've got and you think oh that's good
how much have you got put it on the table
so you put your ten one pound coins on the table and i say well i'm going to add minus eight pounds to it tonight help yourself to eight pounds
i've added
very much like taking away to me that did very much like no
i was adding minus eight pounds to what you had
i've got eight pounds left well it's the same
adding a negative number is the same as taking it away
okay
so
it's minus
that's not minus that's take away right
the ones with the rings around them are positive or negative
so adding the positive number that's just normal adding a negative number that's the same as taking it away
and you're
yeah
going where's me eight pound gone
he's told me he was going to add to my money and he said oh the bad news is i'm adding a negative amount of money to it and he's taken away
okay now the good news the next night is that i'm gonna take away some of your money and you think oh wow he's taking
last night he said he was adding and he took away so what's he gonna do tonight when he said really UNK he's taking it away
i say i'm gonna take away minus eight pounds let's say
so i add it
let's say erm we forget about all that ten pound early and you owed me a hundred pounds right and i say erm forget that just take it away forget it it's gone you're a hundred pounds better off
we've taken away let's say erm have you got a bank or a building society account or anything
yeah
right
so let's say you're let's say i'm the building society and you can have your put in your book and that
you make a withdrawal they take it away and let's say you can go UNK so you've got eighty pound in the building society and you take a hundred out how much have you got left now
none
less than none
yeah
you've got minus twenty
minus twenty
okay you're twenty pounds over you owe them you owe me the building society twenty pounds
now if i say oh well as it's i mean easter we'll forget about that
right
i've got your balance here and i say what have you got
you've got minus twenty well i'll take away let's put the sign round that
usually they put UNK after it or something or put it in red
that's a minus twenty
if i take away the minus twenty well i'm taking it from the same thing aren't i
i'm taking a minus twenty from
yeah
a minus twenty so it's got to be zero the answer taking away a negative it would be the same if i added if it was minus twenty and i added twenty come to zero they'd just cancel out
so if i take away a negative number it's the same as adding
you come into the building society and you're you've got no money in the world and you owe twenty pounds and i say oh we'll take that away we'll take that minus twenty away
you walk out twenty pound UNK
you've got no more money but twenty pounds so taking away a negative number is the same as adding yeah
and again if the signs are the same i mean i know they're not exactly the same this is and add and that's a positive it's the same as adding a positive number
a negative and a positive it's the same as taking away
a positive and a negative it's the same as taking away
this was this was the night i added minus eight pound to your money and walked off with eight of it right
and then this time i say well i'm going to take away some money and i took away a negative amount and you've finished up with more
so all you need to do is remember that table which is the same the same as when you this is for adding or UNK and the same table for multiplying or dividing yeah
a positive times a UNK
it's not no
and it's no good just looking at little bits of it
you want to sort of look at the whole picture together
erm do you think you got the whole picture
yeah
okay you can guess what comes next don't you
questions
questions first to build up
erm seventeen take away ten take away three
how would you if you had to do that if you do it the easy way don't do it the hard way how would you do that
ten minus three is seven
is seven
seventeen minus seven
is ten
so if we get it right the answer should come to ten
yeah
now i want you to do it the hard way i mean you wouldn't normally do it this way but when you've got letters in you've got no choice
so we'll do it while the numbers are there to get you familiar with it
so what we'll do is we'll put that means take away right
that's a positive ten there and this is a negative three here if you like
so take away a positive i'm going to take away a positive ten pounds away from you now
it's take away minus
so that comes up that comes out as a minus yeah as a minus ten
now i'm gonna take away a minus three
minus seven
er it's a seven
just
well we're just looking at the
i these minus and pluses and that
well there's two there's two there's two things there are four things going on here and it's it was designed to be confusing
it's not it's not just you and everyone going what on earth is going on here
because we've got and you've seen this before we'll just have a look get this right if you can
what's that
no that's a plus
what's that
take away
erm no that's a negative
you can't tell they're the same the only way you can tell is if they're if they're working with number i mean that's a plus or a positive that's a positive three
that means take away if it's between two numbers it means take away
so this one is take away
and what's this one
take away
this is a take away but we can treat it take away three is the same as add minus three
let's write this out again seventeen take away ten add minus three
yeah
i'm going to add some money tonight
the bad news is i'm gonna add minus three pounds to what you've got there
well we know how to how to work when it's add
we just do the first thing and then we do the second thing
you see this sign outside the brackets let's change this as well
let's make this seventeen erm add minus whatever this number is
is this getting more confusing and you can think of that as seventeen add minus one times and then we're multiplying into the brackets
seventeen add this big number here which is minus one times whatever we've got in here minus one times ten what will that give us
minus one times ten
ten
are the signs the same or different
different
so i'm gonna say
positive
negative
that's it
signs are different
okay
will give me minus and so a minus one times a ten gives us a minus ten
now a minus one times a minus three
is a positive three
a positive
plus that's the same plus from there plus a positive three
that's what they'll come to there so we've got seventeen add minus ten add plus three
that's seventeen as well
seventeen add a minus ten the same as take away a positive take away a positive ten and add a positive three
we've got all positive numbers now
UNK
so we can drop the signs and we can forget about mentioning whether they're UNK or negatives and get now a nice straightforward seventeen take away ten add three
seventeen take away ten
seven
add three
ten
ten okay
so same as same as you got here
what's what di do you get here
ten
what i've done was three minus ten seven
yeah
seventeen minus seven
good
the big thing is we've got two things going on here two different types one of them is a f
one is an operation add or subtract
what does add mean
adding the two values to together
what does it mean you're still using adding what does add mean
put them together you know
okay what does it mean in terms of the number line the number line there and we want to do something like two add three what does that mean
you start at two positive to
right good
so we've left a bit of this out we're a bit UNK in our notation we should be saying let's put a sort of a ring round the whole thing to show that's the number positive two
add positive three see this thing of using the same symbol for add and for positive is very confusing very confusing it's as though you know you're speaking a different language where one word has about fifteen different meanings and you can't understand what they're talking about most of the time
so positive two add positive three what does that mean
start at the two
start at positive two okay
what does add mean
what does g go
yeah
along is right erm which way
positive
go that's it go along towards the positive numbers
so you better count along that way for how many
three
one two three
so the answer is positive five
yeah
is that right
okay
now what would this mean
minus two add positive three
don't tell me i can guess
what does this minus two mean
start in the negative
that's where we start
so we start negative two minus two and i know what add means cos you told me last time
count along towards whoops
count along for how many
for three
for three
one two three
so the answer should be one
one
positive one
is that right
positive one
yep
okay now
you didn't think adding up or taking away was this hard did you
no
because it's very i mean you know UNK have written books about this erm and yeah kids of five or six are quite happily adding and taking away until they get to negative numbers until someone says ah i'm going to add to that money you've got there i'm gonna add minus seven
you can get a UNK you won't get away with explaining
so okay
a minus two add a positive three now what would minus two add so that's a negative two add a negative three mean
well minus two is where you start okay
add that means go along towards the positive numbers and i'm going to count how many am i going to count
minus three
oh
i count in that direction though so minus means minus three means count the other way
so i start from them and i count this way
that's a minus
one two three and i finish up there minus three minus four minus five
the other way of looking at it is you can say i'm going to count you start from nought and you count along that way until you get to this number so i'd go nought minus one minus two minus three
so altogether i'd still count three that way
so negatives go that way
now how about if i do four add minus five
so it's plus four add minus five
okay that's always the number where you start isn't it
so we start at positive four add to count in the positive direction oh
minus
we're adding minus five whoops switch round count the opposite way
so from four we count five backwards count minus five just means count down the opposite way so we go one two three four five so it should be minus one
yeah
negative one
now the tricky one let's do plus four make it plus five plus five a UNK a negative three
okay
where do we start
plus five
plus five no problem there start where the first number tells us to start
take away what does that mean
count negative
count that way
so if we said take away three let's do this first it's bit easier plus five take away plus three you start at plus five take away means count that way count to the left towards the negative numbers so we count three
plus five count three one two three
two plus two
so
it should be plus two
now what does this one mean you tell me
plus five take away minus three
start at plus five
okay
going that way
that take away means we're going in that direction and how many are we going to go
three
three or minus three
minus three
minus three
when we were taking away three we went in this direction for three
but to take away a minus three
go the other way
go in the opposite direction turned your pen round and you go the other way
so a take away a negative those two signs together is the same as an add
a positive
when we did our table this is for adding and taking away erm that's a positive number and that's a negative number okay
add a positive number is the same as a these are all the things you do with positive numbers this is add a positive number is the same as add a positive number right
so that's add a positive number these are all for the positive numbers add a positive number okay
take away a positive number well okay we
take away
take away a positive number right
add a negative number this is when i said i'm going to add minus eight pounds to your money tonight add a negative number is the same as take away a positive number
add take away a negative number is the same as add the positive number
so whether it means add or take away or subtract or negative we can sort of forget about it and just look at the signs so if get if we get take away plus three that will be the same as take away plus three yeah
take away three
if we got add minus three that's the same as take away plus three just take away three
the interesting one is when we've got take away a minus three that's the same as add the positive three add plus three
now what i'd like you to do this is not straightforward
it's er anyone can do this you know
people always think that until you start throwing in the double negatives and they think whoa don't want to know
no this is all rubbish you're making this up as you go along yeah
it doesn't se it's not natural is it
not sort of it's not obvious
especially when i could do this one yeah erm positive five going that way
mm
and then turning back this way
yeah
you know when all i've ever known is plus is this way negative this way it's either that way or that way you know
right
now i'd like you to just have a look at these for next time erm and work them out on the number line
yeah
erm because that's what gets you to accept it and stop thinking this is a load of rubbish this is a con he's just making this up
yeah i am making it up it's not me making it up UNK had things like erm you met this sort of earlier on in school
what's seven take away three
okay what does that come to
four
no problem one number take away another number gives us a number wow that's great
okay what's three take away seven
infants
minus
infants school and you say can't do it
it's obviously a load of rubbish
you ask some kid he'll say there you are i've got three pens on the table now take away seven
think he's off his UNK you know
what's he on about and then just forget about it and they go and play in the sand or something and he's crackers that bloke
and they're probably quite right
but cos UNK are a bit crackers we want we don't like saying i can't do that
we'll find a way
you know we'll change the rules so we can do it we'll move the goal posts slightly
we'll make sure we can do that
that's what they say well we have this silly game that we play on the number line going up and down the thing and when you do three start from three count seven in the opposite direction we finish up at this number called minus four
well what on earth is minus four
you show me minus four in anything there's mi minus four houses out there
there's mi minus four people coming to the party tonight they're all crackers okay but it works it's very useful it UNK an awful lot of problems like you know getting UNK to the moon and things like that we couldn't do otherwise
it comes in handy with your bank statement your temperature oh it's minus six
it's tonight it's think of these as a sort of temperature numbers that try these it starts at plus three tonight and then it drops five degrees plus three and it drops five degrees what does it come to
okay it's minus seven and it drops minus three
it's erm minus fourteen and it drops by minus six
fourteen take away six
er oh keep these numbers small so you can sort of play about on the number line more easily and ten minus ten take away minus four
six add minus three add minus six
and minus six take away minus six
any number take away itself what should it come to
nought
yeah
so minus three take away minus three should come to nought
minus six take away minus seven
and minus six take away minus five and then x take away minus one
x take away minus x take away x which is just plus x take away x and three x take away minus two x hey now on the number line you can't it's difficult to do x take away x but you can work out roughly where they'd be and what you would do and what the system would be
so if you have a look at those and play with them for next time erm and make sure that you learn those two rules about if the signs are the same
yeah
it's always then a plus sign whether it means an add or a plus
al also the way we talk about it is very UNK we often say a minus b when we should be saying plus a take away plus b we start talking like that people he's off again
he's UNK
erm it's negative numbers aren't a natural thing fractions are actually easier and that was what happened in the history of UNK fractions were developed a long time before negative numbers the old UNK used to play about with fractions quite a lot
negative numbers came later
anyway i must dash because i've got
i'll do that for
so you have had before i try and don't i won't go off with your homework UNK honestly i won't
erm now next week er where are we right
you still want a lesson next week
yeah
usual time okay
that's good
last week before i was told a chest infection and throat infection and well i just don't feel no better
coughing all the while
i've also been sick but er
yeah
i UNK i haven't been sick for er about a week
right
now
right
you've just finished a course of antibiotics haven't you
yes
and that's fine and before that er yeah
do you smoke
do you smoke
no
right okay and nothing coming up
no i get a bit there every now and then and UNK and that
yeah
makes me feel even worse
yeah
like cos i
yeah what job do you do
a miner
okay open wide for me
stick your tongue out
say ah
ah
yeah it looks pretty good down there okay well let's have a listen to your chest
yeah they'll be fine bit cool
nice deep breath
mm
keep breathing for me
very deep UNK out
well
how would you feel if er a if i said sort of describe how you feel on a scale of one to ten
er right now i'm two one two or lower
yeah do you get
feel really low and out of breath easily
yeah
are you getting hot UNK
yeah do now and then yeah
have you been anywhere UNK on holiday in the past three months
no
past year
no
and conditions down the pits
hot
damp
water
well our pits there's a lot of water but it's mostly body sweat and s i do get some water off a machine that i drive
yeah
but er it's it is very hot
it's n no a hundred degrees
UNK
yeah okay
previous to this you've been fit and well
cos we've
yeah
hardly seen you at all
no
okay
you've got a nasty chest infection
down here the whole of the left side on the back
are you getting any
chest pain
i have been on you know with
yeah
the breathing
i couldn't
yeah
you know when
yeah
i wanted to cough and i couldn't
yeah
because i couldn't take a
okay
big breath
right
every time i took a big breath i were getting short pains all down this side
yeah
well it not yesterday the day before i got them under my right shoulder UNK
yeah
like when i took a big breath it were the
right okay
we erm probably ought to do some blood tests too
yeah
and a chest x ray and some antibiotics
are you not fit for work
well i should have started back yesterday
no
but
so you're not fit for work
you're not fit for work
don't often tell people they're not fit
i normally say how do you feel but not in your case
i was worried about the work i couldn't get in to see you until today
yeah
and i should have started back yesterday like
do you think you can roll your UNK up
have you had blood taken before
i think so yeah but a while ago
right
which UNK left or right
whichever you've got good veins in really
just er
has anyone else been UNK with anything similar that you're aware of
my son was about three week ago but it w it wasn't as bad as this he got a bad cough and
yeah
things like but he wasn't
you're not taking any pills and tablets at all are you
no
only i have had those what the
yeah
they obviously haven't worked
er i keep getting a lot of headaches and i think it's with the UNK and coughing i'm doing
i should think so
and i just er you know i have UNK or UNK
okay one two three
i'm sure you've got one of these really strange chest UNK and these are the ones that tend to hit young healthy fit young adults
yeah well it's rare for me to come to the doctor's but last three week i've been here like every week kind of thing
mm
well they're not common but every now and again we see someone who looks like they've got a straightforward problem that doesn't get better
yeah
and it's the not do you want to press over there
it tends to be the
the not getting better with normal things that gives it away
yeah
and i'm sure when we do these blood tests we'll find that things are not altogether normal now sometimes it's actually the way you respond to treatment that gives it away rather than
mm
doing blood tests but er we're going to treat you somewhat differently
now we'll probably need to repeat some of these in about ten to fourteen days
the lab really want two samples
i'm going to ask them to run them today
to well to run them now they'll still take a week to come back even if they do run them today
that's okay isn't it
yeah
okay
the other thing you need is a chest x ray and that's very important er to see exactly what degree of trouble is going on
because there's an awful lot of rubbish to hear UNK around
we'll find there's a quite a lot to see on a film
it's isn't it
yes that's right
now if you nip down to the victoria hospital if you know where that is in mansfield
yeah the one
it's called mansfield community
yeah i know which one you mean yeah
er you can go to the x ray department there any day monday to friday any time between nine and four thirty so it's basically all day every day
okay
if you get yourself down there they'll do a chest x ray you don't need an appointment there should be minimal waiting time in and out
okay
have i go that have i to hang about for the re the UNK the
no they send it
they'll sort it all out
they send the report to me
okay yeah
okay
now it's important that we review you
you do need to be seen next week really
ah unfortunately i'm not here to follow you up cos i'm actually away next week sorry about that
but you really do need to be seen next week to have a look at the initial blood results the chest x ray more importantly how are you getting on
that's more important
now this stuff is two a day as a single daily dose on an empty stomach okay
for i think we'd probably better keep you going for how about six da hmm for five days that's actually quite a long course for this stuff cos it lasts an awful long time in the body
so that's a these are a pretty UNK dose of antibiotics
yeah
two a day as a single dose strictly on an empty stomach so at least half an hour to an hour before food
yes okay
for five days boom
it's completely different from what you've had before
er if it UNK your tummy let us know but that's actually very UNK
this is the stuff i used for my UNK it's wonderful
okay
it's not quite like UNK by mouth but it's not far short
if the blood tests show anything specific that we need to get back to you on we will contact you directly
are you on the phone
yes
lovely okay and you need a note
i'm gonna put two weeks cos i'm sure you're not going to be g fit e you won't feel fit
okay
to go back that quickly even if your chest is clearing rapidly
i'll put UNK chest infection
we may be able to actually narrow it down to a particular UNK and that's what these are for
yeah
but er we will see
okay
thank you very much
so it's very important we get you seen next week even if you feel a lot better
er note chest x ray
do you want me to make an appointment next week while i'm here
blood s yes i you'll have to see one of either doctor or doctor i'm afraid but er if i if i write everything down they'll know exactly where we are and what's going on
okey doke
thank you
not at all take care of yourself
plenty to drink ordinary wise
i would avoid alcohol
even though they don't actually antibiotics it'll probably make you feel more UNK than you already are
yeah
thanks
right
right thank you very much then
okay take care of yourself
right cheers
bye now
right so we have erm the neighbourhood UNK housing officer and the area housing officer
erm how do you what's how do the roles actually differ
erm well there's sort of five staff
yeah
here at
yeah
at the office
two area housing officers management erm one area housing officer technical a clerical
mhm
and a neighbourhood housing officer
i'm responsible for the sort of overall management but i tend not to get out as much as say area housing officers they're more sort of at grass roots
mhm
erm sort of i may deal with sort of solicitors letter that sort the more complicated legal side and that sort of thing
erm distribute work out to officers and they report back if there's problems with it or that sort of thing
mhm
erm in your case you worked at erm another neighbourhood office prior to erm and how does it compare working
yeah prior to prior to coming to UNK green i worked at
yeah
and then previously i worked at neighbourhood office and i only came to when it had be d been declared a clearance area
mhm
so it was totally different work from what i'd been used to
mhm
erm but it w saw it as a useful experience in a clearance exercise which
mhm
i'd never been involved in before as an area housing officer and just involved with day to day management but with it being a clearance area it's a totally different approach and the sort of things that you deal with are totally different as well
mhm
so what are the areas of work that you've been involved in
what are the
previously
yeah previous and how and how's and how's does it yeah well here right
t what what's the kind of work that you are now involved in
what what's your
well before y you tended
yeah
to deal with re letting the property normal
yeah
day to day transfers neighbour problems that sort of thing
now you're involved with finding people alternative accommodation
erm there's no choice everybody's got to move and you're more involved with the removal of people sort of the sort of problems that they encounter finding removal firms connection of electricity at the new places and all that sort of thing
mhm
in terms of the neighbourhood housing office what are the what are the origins behind that cos this is cos this i this actual it's actually situated isn't it within the flats erm
do you think that was a deliberate decision made that it should be part of the flats rather than somewhere outside
yeah it's part of
erm the housing policy erm
yeah
to basically UNK erm er n c the city of nottingham
erm they picked out erm particular areas where there were a lot of pe there were problems within that area erm whether it be normal management problems or erm racial issues i e there is a particular area there is a high density of black people erm er the properties them themselves weren't up erm of a particularly high quality erm they decided to UNK and i and do an intensive management area for that area
erm and so they set up a team erm four or five teams within the city er which included UNK the UNK area erm and UNK area
mhm
yeah how does it actually differ this kind of office and the roles that
it's
compared with the typical traditional housing officer
housing officer yeah
erm you basically erm deal with erm the tenants on a more personal UNK basis
mhm
you see them as erm er you know you t you speak to them on erm christian name terms you help them with any kind of erm social problem or welfare problem they may have
it's not a par erm not particularly a housing problem
erm you you're in fact a er everybody er every housing officer erm oh what was i going to say
they they're sort of like a probation officer social worker that sort of thing erm most people come to us with all sorts of problems not just not particularly housing problems
and you're on site you're about
and you're on site yeah
you're just
two minutes away aren't you
yeah they see you every day they you know and
you use the same shops and
mm
you know
mhm
how good would you say the relationship has been between erm the housing office and the tenants how is the relationship for all of you
i think
generally there is erm a decent UNK between us and the tenants er because yo we do explain to them erm you know what we can do and what we can't do
the they're never sort of given UNK excuses we are erm very UNK with them i in order to make them understand that you know there are limitations erm within our jobs as well cos a lot of people expect things and erm you may promise them well other people may promise them and it's not delivered then of course it's sort of them and us and we try to UNK that idea it's not them
mhm
and us
we're here to serve them that's why we're being paid
er we we're here to give them a decent service and we'll do our UNK to do that
mhm
and help done
obviously you can't please everybody
everybody
you are going to get people who are who are
can i start by asking your name
well my name is er mr UNK er o of the treasurer of the in edinburgh area
and erm what was your date of birth
my date of birth was the thirty first of the of the seventh o nine
which makes me now approximately seventy six years of age
what can you remember from when you were young about sort of housing conditions and
what i remember of the housing conditions when i was then UNK in UNK a mining er community
and known that particular time as the steel town of scotland
was erm the whole town taken up with these sort of two UNK
yes it was all mining and UNK
was all
in fact the UNK present UNK was built up on the first place from a UNK known then as UNK
mhm
and d l UNK and UNK these er UNK all amalgamated which is now known as the UNK
mhm
what erm what kind of education did you go to when you
well i my education was in a small er the local school in UNK
mm
and they were only a s a sort of infants and secondary school er there and you
there was no all these UNK er certificates to gain en all you had to had to gain to be fit for employment then was a qualifying certificate that was the only certificate issued in those days
a qualifying certificate
er how old were you when you left the school
i was er four i left the school at fourteen years of age and i was down the pit the following day
the following day
mm
what do you remember about working in the pit
well the working in the pit and the first and the first time i went down the pit er the pit was er john UNK number four colliery in UNK
and er i went with my dad and got into the cage which takes you down to the pit bottom and er immediately the cage left the surface it just dropped like a stone and i myself was frightened that the bottom of the cage collapsed completely
because my stomach come up and met my heart
and everything went
when i reached the pit bottom there was approximately three feet of water at the pit bottom and i had my first experience of water in the mines
were the conditions in the mines quite dangerous in those days
well in those days er there wasn't much me much er coal cutting machine this was all UNK by hand
and we had the pit ponies and where we didn't have the pit ponies drawing the UNK which we termed the small wagons carrying the coal from the coal face to the pit bottom then er we had to do it by hand
and if there were h a wagon or a UNK went off the road there you were with not enough height to lift it all back off the rail again and believe me that was experience in itself
so it was quite a difficult job then
it was a difficult job yes
mm
what were the erm the wages and the hours like
ooh the wages
i started the wages and er i didn't have much more i started i had six and eight pence per shift
mm
and er what were the hours like
the hours well sometimes i would do a double shift which was sixteen hours
or eight hours for a full shift sixteen hours for a double shift
mm
and in those days we required the money and er often very often we had to do it to strengthen our wages a bit
do a double shift
which meant you come home from your double er shift went to your bed had about four hours sleep and were back out for your normal shift again
was you erm in a union or anything at all at this time
yes the miners' union then was just wasn't that was started was
in fact there's very near the start of the unions in and o er that the miners' union was one of the first to start up
do you think it gave you erm any advantages being in a union
y oh yes it gave us advantage to the extent that we'd someone b behind us to fight for any er UNK that we had
that was the idea of the union starting out in the first place
mhm
we had to pay into a union
we can on every friday there was a union official down there in a small hut
we had straight from our wages straight to the union it's payed at union right away
so that there was nobody UNK
what were the erm the erm relations between the w the workers and the bosses like
ah well more or less much the same as it is today
that's what we got the union for
that's what we got the union for
that's what we got the union for to make sure that these things did not happen
mhm
that we wouldn't be stepped upon
were you involved in er any strikes or anything
yes i was involved in the nineteen twenty six strike
and in nineteen twenty er strike going at the present day there was what we called the soup kitchens
and every local village where there was a mine had these soup kitchens
i do not forget the other unions which were going at that present time helped us out quite a bit
though we UNK we actually lost the strike through no fault of our own
there was just because there wasn't enough money within all unions not forget that there wasn't such a thing as a t u c then this was in at the UNK when the unions first started there wasn't such as a t u c trades unions congress
these were er in its UNK then and er we had a soup kitchen and er we got soup once a day when we got issued with it
each family took over a ration card
and you got so many UNK of bread so many pots of soup
and this was all done in old wash houses where they used to have the UNK
where we used to b boil the water
and the soup was made in these UNK and they were issued with their soup then
and that was all we got
what was it erm started the strike in the first place
well they started the strike as UNK as some UNK come up and the men as union thought that was not right
not forgetting in that most of the mines then at that particular time were nearly all privately owned
mhm
were nearly all privately owned
were nearly all privately owned
most right across the length and UNK of great britain were all privately owned
which the present administration of central government are doing their best to under the same hammer as it was in those days so it's just this is just a repeat performance of the those days and the government today
was what it erm finally brought about the end of the strike in twenty six
pardon
what was it finally brought about the end of the strike in nineteen twenty six
well it were just like i like i the unions weren't as er financially well off as they were er at the present day
there was not the money we were forced to
as i say the present day er UNK just now is actually trying to do the same thing as a repeat performance
so sort of erm what was there erm any UNK or anything like that from the bosses when you went back to work
oh immediately there was a UNK in the pit o the pit was out
mm
it was er taken there
the UNK was taken to the union the union just say er told the steward who belonged to that particular pit there right just call the men out that's it
s so erm did presumably are quite strong like that then
oh yes oh yes it was one of the be it still is one of the best unions
still is one of the best for sticking
mm
was there erm i've forgotten what i was going ask you
er mm were there erm many strikes at the time
oh no oh no oh there were all v very few and far be there may have been local strikes but such as one day er a UNK been put in and the men struck work just for it
but immediately the get a result
so all our lads are more or less that was UNK strikes and finish off
mm
one day and it was finished you know
because that would union you see
did you work in the pits for a long time
i was five years in the pits
mhm
er eh in er in UNK and UNK and er at that time being a young lad no more between er f er fourteen and twenty i realized then that wasn't going to be a life for me
so i then decided that i would join the army
now i joined the army
i served my time in both india UNK egypt and these sort of places abroad and when i nine months of my colour service to finish which were a twelve year service when war broke out in nineteen thirty nine
i then went er across to france with the b e f was in france about nine months approximately when the big invasion started in poland and through france
i was taken prisoner of war at saint UNK for a few of my friends in from edinburgh who were taken prisoner of war
i was taken to a main camp called UNK camp in er polish er german border
and er you know what happened then
i was back down hole again
for another five years work so i served five years in germany too as a as a miner
the prisoners of war were used as miners in the
oh yes
camps
yes
oh yes
we were used as miners yes
how did the pay and the conditions and such like in the army compare with erm being in the mines
er the money the money that i money difference wasn't great but the fact was er who you were thinking about er when you did come out
you had a lot of a lot of qualifications which you could get in the army in those days that you didn't have when you were in civil life
for instance you could learn to be a motor driver you could learned to be an electrician you could learn to be an engineer you could learn to be anything
and you through these courses and you got a certificate when you come out which er some of the said to us a fully qualified member of a so these advantages were open to us then you see
mm
so this was the main incentive for joining the army then
pardon
was that the main incentive for joining the army
knowing that you gain qualifications
well my that was my incentive the mines
yeah
but as i've already told you just it was very UNK that i should l go back down the hole in er germany again
were the conditions worse in the in the german mines
in the
oh no i the mine the mines in germany at that time were far advanced of what er britain's mines were
cos they had different methods of doing the digging the coal out than they h than they had in britain
and i believe
although i've not been down a mine since then er the german mines to my er UNK were far more advanced than what the british mines were
were you made to work hard harder being a prisoner of war
no harder than we did in britain
you could not no a miner once he's been a miner cannot go down er a pit and say to anyone down a pit and say to anyone down a pit that he's not a miner
because he gives his right away
the experience he has gained in the mines at immediately a man g a man who has been in the mines goes down there again his er n er he gives himself away because just because of the experiences
i saw an incidence er down in the mine a miner himself can tell by the UNK of a tree just where the heavy UNK coming on the on the roof
and where there's likely to be a fall
and the miner can only pick up a pick and knock the UNK and he can tell exactly where er where it's UNK in the UNK
so these thi these things did do show up when you're d when you're down the mines
a ma a magic phase you can't give it away
and they didn't ne we didn't need the if we were a miner
a mine w a miner could tell another miner by his accent
not just by him telling he's a miner he can say er that's a miner
what did you do erm after the war
when you came back to britain
well i well er i came back to britain er i was er liberated by general UNK in a small place called UNK i was flown from UNK into UNK and from UNK into a small place called UNK which was a reception station for prisoners of war where we were treated er on entering the camp we were handed a UNK
all we had to do was sign our name to it
and these UNK were for to our nearest and next of UNK telling us we were now safely home
did erm did you notice any great differences when you came back from the war
oh vast differences
to the to the
er yes
oh vast differences
my first experience in going into UNK er in edinburgh anyway and i suppose that the same thing would have happened er in any country just gone through the UNK of war with UNK and so forth
the people from the highest paid to the lowest paid were all just one unit
and i wish to god that would just come back again now there people would just treat one of our as they did it one of during the UNK years
and i can't see any reason why they can't
why they should people with a higher look down their nose at the people who are lower than themselves i can not figure out
i think we need another war to get rid of the er get rid of some of the thing that's happening at the present day
so you think the war erm UNK the people
behind the
er it definitely it had proved it itself
it proved it the war years proved it to the people
er that they were they were all just one
but nowadays we're not nowadays we there's a higher a middle class and a lower class and a lower class
what erm what kind of employment did you find when you came back from the war
well i erm my first employment was in the was in the building trade with er an old firm in edinburgh called and believe me i was not a very fit person then after seven five years and i was like a UNK i was like a skeleton
and i got there and by good luck i got a very good er site agent and after asking me what i'd done he says it's alright son we'll build you up
and he actually treated me like a more or less a son the site agent and he made sure er i gradually developed my muscles
he never put me on a heavy job until at such times he thinks i was fit
well that's the way i was treated when i came home
by the i served five year then and i left that and i went into corporation transport which was UNK then
and i went then from a timber mill and they there's various different jobs i've been in since then you know
what was the conditions like in the building trade after the war
well er you know at that time there in the building trade there was er what they term a an essential work order
which you had the government the government or building firms had to guarantee you forty four UNK payment f of wages forty four hours guaranteed and you had to get that whether you were working or not
so that was an essential work order was by the government in power then
that m er the firms must guarantee forty four hours wages for the man doesn't matter what
was this erm to protect the men or to make sure that erm
it's er it's more or less a
UNK for the men
aha
a UNK so that they could have that man couldn't go in another job
aye
presumably this was cos there was a big erm a big UNK on to rebuild the
oh yes there was
country
yes yeah
mhm
the present the present day er in edinburgh the present day buildings that i helped to build up are now in UNK and in fact er out in saint i built that was a er built a fact i did all the rough
both in UNK and in present day er UNK circus which is er there's a lot of er controversy going over er m making them UNK them and so forth but i l i was er the building of these things and did all the er the work for them
is that erm quite a dangerous job working on the on the building sites
well it depending what sort of job you're doing
all depending what sort of job your job it could be dangerous if you didn't know what you were doing
i mean you couldn't put a stranger on a job that you yourself
but once you were qualified for the job you couldn't put a stranger on you had to ta teach that stranger a job
before what he was to
erm where did you go after the after the building the building work
after the building i left er the building work and became a tram conductor where i went through a course in the down at UNK hall went through a UNK course
after going through the UNK course i then went to leith depot old leith depot er of the with the UNK
eventually was put on the UNK as a conductor
served with them as a conductor er for about approximately four years er and the experiences i had er as a conductor were many and varied er if you do er recall er the old UNK er the fares weren't in comparison today
i can remember quite vividly the old UNK running there er day and night with the last service leaving the UNK of edinburgh around about er twelve er eleven thirty and you g have about ten minutes or so to reach the depots which there were many and varied at this particular time
there was depots in tower cross UNK leith and many other places like that
but while i UNK leaving any UNK area there was always what was known then as a UNK return
and that UNK return was three pence
three pence for a UNK return
and it was always on that er UNK whichever er UNK district they were leaving was always a packed car
always fully UNK
because the conductor always had to wait until such time as the queue was diminished quite a bit and hi his UNK was full so that the next UNK come along er coming along whatever number was to be d the same thing happening again
so the UNK districts then were very well served with the old UNK
and i believe myself today at present day the UNK were coming back again there would be could be a way of UNK this matter of going onto different buses
i take for instance the present day just now where we have what we term the old aged pensioner's UNK
now what is to stop instead of an old age pensioner getting on with their ticket or a thirty pound annual ticket or their quarter quarterly ticket
what on UNK to stop to have a transfer ticket which could be used on any bus at all
so there would b take away this UNK of old people having to use three buses to get from one end of the town to the other which means in actual fact that each bus they went on to they paid this ten pence which if there's three if they do not turn it twice a week twice a day that's sixty pence
now why can't they issue a ticket UNK ticket so i don't have to use three buses all i have to do is i've got one ticket now that ticket reserved for particular
do you think then that the er trams provided a better service for the people than the buses
well we were a better er service they were a better UNK i'm not saying that i think so i know they were a better service don doesn't does n they're not quite proof there were in an UNK edinburgh corporation UNK were running they were running at a every year a profit
whereas at the present time with the buses it's all UNK
if that is not proof i
the one speech for the other surely
was you erm in a union at this time when you were in the
yes transport and general workers' union was yes
did you find that erm there was more advantages in being in the union when you working on the trams
oh there always is advantages
if you're a UNK union member there is advantages
with the UNK that you keep your payments up to date
and attend your branch meetings
was there any erm disputes or anything at that time on the on the trams
oh very few and far between
very few and far between
maybe just locally at local garages but as far as far as being the all national or anything like that there was never anything i with the UNK
were the erm the relations with the bosses and the workers quite good on the
very good very good
oh
even with the inspectors too there was always a good er going with the people in those days
mhm
and was this quite a well paid job
well it erm it was average it was average
yes
and er did you have to work like erm shifts and things like that
oh yes
ex exactly the same as going to the present day
you had the split shifts and the down shifts and maybe we were called for er a
what did you do after you left you left the trams
after i left the trams then er i went er i went away to east UNK
i used to work for a certain er c er UNK there
er
getting milk UNK milk er UNK milk and like that
was east UNK one of the erm one of the new towns
it was er now it was now at the start of the new town er present east UNK a new town it was known as a new town and it was just starting to build up
and i had better chances of getting a proper house for myself and my family which was then two daughters and my wife and i
so we actually went there to better ourselves and try and get a h a reasonable house to sort of live in and
was there a lot of encouragement given to people to move out premises
oh yes at that time there was yes
oh yes
if they accepted it of course
was it er easy finding a job at that time as well in the in the new towns
oh yes
it was being that the rolls UNK saturday came in to east UNK and american firms like that were coming along
singer sewing machines and sort of things like that
they were all coming into east UNK there was b cos after all there was starting off a new town and they was building up then from it
what were the erm conditions like in the UNK where you worked
very good
we got our free milk of course we got our free milk
that was one we got our free milk as many pints of milk as we required for to keep our UNK but no more no more than that just much your family had they'd allow you a pint per person
was it erm was it hard work in the in the UNK
oh no
no not in comparison to the jobs i'd already been in
oh no this was much easier for me
because at that time
and er after this did you move back to edinburgh
i moved back to edinburgh too because er my er my family had taken a UNK for edinburgh they didn't like east UNK so i says left
and also it's true today you go where your family wants to go and that was this was er they had a UNK for that and they were not settling down so
what did you do when you when you moved back to edinburgh
well i went into a timber yard er known as er what was the timber yard again now
and they
where as i said er working with timber
was that erm like UNK or something
UNK and
cabinet makers
was that a dangerous job
well it could be dangerous if you didn't watch what you were doing
like every other job you've got to er gain experience as you go along you've got to experience
and you've always got to you've always g advice and on how to handle it before you put actually handling them
were there erm any accidents or anything
er but if there was any accidents through negligence if there were accidents it was negligence er and the people by themselves
which is er worker often most of our accidents is caused by negligence
so what were the conditions in the er in the mill like
very good very good conditions
very good conditions indeed aye
was there a union there as well
er there w wasn't a union then
mm
i believe there is so now but there wasn't then
so it didn't really matter to me
i've always still held my card
although i still held my card of the transport and general workers
mhm
so you continue to be a member of the transport and general
oh aye yes oh
oh yes
god i you could never tell if you're going to be there long enough in job if the boss didn't like you then he would just say well you're paid off and that's it so that's sort of benefit of keeping your union membership up you could go to anywhere where there was a trade union a union membership and get a job
so er the was being unemployed at that time quite UNK
if there was
it was it was
at that time yes
it was er at that time because of the they were very few and far between
employment was very few and far between
because there wasn't the same amount of work this is just after the war i'm talking about and there wasn't so many going then
there were only starting making themselves then
er
so were erm were jobs quite hard to come by in those days after the war
well er well it all depended on the individual themselves
if there's a miner who's in getting work
although you had to be very careful in er in d knowing what to go after
depending on the rate of wages
depending on the rate of wages
so you're actually if you're going for a job you want er for the highest place where you get the highest wages which was a for any working you're going to
what did you do after you left the erm after you left the timber mill
after the timber mill er
now can i remember about after the timber mill
let's see now
my UNK a blank i've been in that many different jobs now
i thought you said you were in a warehouse after that wasn't
oh that's right
you i was in a warehouse at served thirteen year there
and i was working in a large warehouse a three floor warehouse a UNK
i served there for thirteen year became a UNK eventually and eventually the f the firm folded up
what were they
very old established firm it was established in er eighteen fifty six
so it was a firm of about a hundred years standing at that time
but the both brothers who owned it er charles er john and tom were becoming very aged and were not capable of carrying on the job
and they approached the son who wasn't interested so they just folded up
what were the conditions like where you worked in the warehouse
ah well we actually made our own condition and this is one time i'm telling you again where my union membership came in very handy
i actually made it a union firm
so you UNK the whole firm then
organ organized it
organized the people inside it
and i explained to them what benefits they were getting
mm
although the employer was pretty reasonable to us he p always payed us sixpence above the rate
above the normal rate
what was the erm the employer's attitude to you UNK and organizing and
oh he didn't say he says oh just a it'll not worry me he says whether you er start one or not he says
i pay my men sixpence over the rate
so i says well thank you very much but still for mu l people benefit themselves
mm
they're better being in a union he says i agree with you quite agree with you
the union UNK for he says and the union's a but i'm one of these employers who paying them my men a plus rate so i'm paying men sixpence plus over the normal rate so there was no difficulty there
mhm
so he obviously wouldn't have thought the union would have been much of a threat to him seeing as he
no it didn't because he was prepared to pay over er above the rate
the union already fought for that rate and they got it
but he was paying them sixpence above the rate so there was no problem to him
did you notice much differences in the work once you got promoted to a UNK
well er there was i didn't do so much of the normal UNK naturally but i was always if there was a new man came on the job they would always UNK
and i was to show him what to do and i made sure that all
on the first day i made UNK i stayed with that man all day
as i said i stayed with that man all day
although i wouldn't t in interfere with show him how to do the job and er i would make sure he understood the job
if he asked me such and such i'd say now this is how you do it
if he said to me after i'd shown him that he understood it i would say alright show me how you do it
and then that way the man learnt
mm
the man himself learnt
and usually the man telling me he understood if eventually when he starts the job he hasn't understood at all he's just saying so but i wanted to prove to the man himself that he could do it and prove to myself that he could do it
so i was in a safe and so was the man
but
so you were given the responsibility then to train people up
given the first in this
now then that were left on the
did erm do you still keep up your union er membership right away when you were
oh yes oh yes
aye yes
in fact i were shop steward in the in the building trade i was a shop steward in the building trade
mm what did you go on to do after that
after the business folded
was there anything like erm redundancy money or anything like that payed at that time when the place
er
folded
and can you remember what year it was
oh it's about
just roughly
fifty seven i think
it was somewhere UNK
mhm
and they didn't have all this er legislation about redundancy money or anything then
no
in its UNK then
and then er at that particular time you know and er then unemployment you i you had to see each firm was issued with the and the firms had to agree that you had to sign a contract of employment so that er if you were leaving or he was paying you off you had to be given two weeks' notice either way before they pay you off
and that was the contract of employment
mhm
yeah
what did you go on to do after the business folded
ah well i was i was a y on er thing we had back in the building trade
back in the building trade once again which i had experience before so i had no problem
and the reason in the first place i did leave the building trade was my hands was breaking out with in industrial disease see
UNK and i felt i couldn't go near UNK and all of that
but then i eventually i tried the building trade again and i joined a firm called er forget or something like that and i was working up in george street in edinburgh
you always go building we UNK right from ground floor left the existing walls in
and then inside building we completely demolished inside just sort of left the retaining walls and built it up from fourteen feet below the ground to five UNK high itself
and we had to go down through fourteen feet of solid rock
so this was obviously quite a difficult job
aye it was a difficult job but as i say to have an experience mines
mhm
and er building trade work both of these things had left me with the qualifications for be UNK be able to do it
did you notice much difference in the sort of er erm the techniques or the machinery or whatever that was being used between
ooh vast UNK er in the building trade
oh yes
for instance you see all these big they'd actually built up from the ground up they'd no taking now just the odd
they built up from a working
was there still the erm the thing you talked about with the guaranteed work at that time
yes
oh aye
yes
but er the essential work contract then that i had spoken about in the first place the building trade that was a government order
essential work which was operated during the war years and er what year a couple several years after that
that was an essential b eventually that was taken away but the building trade still believed if a building firm wanted men they had to have at least a thirty two hour guarantee which is at present still in operation
a thirty t they had to guarantee an employee thirty two hour guarantee
was that to get rid of the sort of ee erm the way them building firms used to take people on every day
UNK stop this casual labour business you see
whe whereas the building trade would say oh i'll take you you're a friend of mine i'll take you you're a friend of i can take you you're a friend
it was it was a great lot down in leith here and i've often seen it down in leith docks
when i've been down there trying to get casual work you know in leith docks
and he just down they're all in a big crowd
and a chap come out the offices and say right you
so in actual fact it was always a favour cos i got the jobs
so to stop all that this is with the b building trade they had to guarantee them
so presumably that was quite a popular piece of er legislation
legislation oh definitely
mhm
i've had s still operating now to present day i don't know
mm
what did you do erm after that
well as a reach up
in fact that's what i left from i left from the job at job street in george street with the building trade
that's when i
and i work after that
but the site prepared to let me work to carry on then as s they ma and i wouldn't claim my pension until i'd finished
and behind that their reasoning for that is for every year that i worked over my UNK age there's a that is added to my pension
he says i haven't got you working long longer i worked the bigger the pension i have when i go out
so were you allowed to work er after your UNK age
not at that UNK when they got to hear about it
mm
of course they had questions of and he says oh well i've sat with him the man's prepared working at UNK but no you can't allow the man to work after he's sixty and that was it
so that was me on
but the UNK
were you involved in any erm political parties or anything er
no not necessary though i have done quite a wee bit just now er in support of my labour party you know
done quite a wee bit and i've been there at a few of their quite a few of their meetings and erm a good friend of quite a few of the councils
and lothian district council
quite a good friend of them you know and i'm a close contact with them
is it just been recently that you've started to get involved
within the last ten years i've been ten years UNK actively concerned with the old aged UNK association and er the labour movement
mhm
d do y do you think there's a great difference between the labour party now and the labour party when you were working
ah well more or less the same
they're more or less as a i don't think there's a great lot of difference UNK i d i they're not pushing they haven't the same the i would like to say i would say they haven't the same interest in their union they've not the same interests in the union as they had in the earlier days when there was a union
mm
did your involvement in the trade unions when you were young got lead to your any involvement in the labour party or anything like that
oh no not necessarily through the union no
i've just had so solely an interest to defend myself
ah but i believed if i'm going to discuss or argue about anything as regarding that i had to be interested in it
and to be interested you've got to attend your branch meetings and know what's going on
whether it be a union branch meeting or any other branch meeting you had to be there and you had to know what you're talking about
don't just go into these meetings and sat there like a UNK
you liked it if you've been active at all you'd want to know what's going on
and the only way you can do that is b attending your branch meetings
i mean there's no use a man being employed and he's got a shop steward if he don't and depend on the shop steward coming down to tell him what happens in the meeting
my reply to these people if they asked me what happened at the branch meeting i say do you want to know what happened in the branch meeting
yes i said well attend them
so that was er that was my answer
when you were er in the unions and you were a shop steward did you find that you got a lot of people working in branch meetings
well it wasn't too bad it were not too bad from the firm that i UNK i worked from
the firm that i worked from weren't too bad
but as i say as paying the er r i i've seen them when i'm going round the site er i got an option from the firm i'd be allowed time off my work my actual work on the on the on the site to go round and collect their unions dues
i'd got an option from the firm and they were very good that way
and i've seen them whenever they see me come along going away and trying to hide
but i say there's been a
you mentioned the erm the national association of
scottish old age UNK associations
scottish old age UNK association
what do they erm that what does that association do
oh well wait a i'm just going to read first to you
the name of the association shall be the scottish old age UNK association
the association shall be non party and non UNK you understand my meaning by that
that we advocate the immediate implementation of the scottish old people's chapter to UNK to maintain and improve the standard of living of pensioners by ensuring that the pension will rise according to the cost of living or er or UNK or earnings which er whichever is the most UNK
and number and two to press for the provision of suitable houses for old people at rents they can afford
and social services as may be required to ensure the welfare of the aged as set out in our declaration of intent
in cooper in cooperation with bodies on all questions affecting the welfare of pensioners
that's er br
is it er was it a very large organization
well we er it's a it's a national organization in fact it's all over the country all over er scotland
from as far up as er in er UNK down to the er borders
er branches approximately thirty one branches in edinburgh which i myself er attend to
as far as the financial side of things goes
and er a g a good er and er can be er the mi the name itself the scottish old age pensions association is not to be UNK from er sometimes it's UNK as the scottish old age UNK association
now if you use that g gives the people the wrong impression that you must be a pensioner before you can join it but this is not so
it's known as the scottish old age pensions association
not the scottish old age UNK association
you can join this association any time after the age of eighteen
do you have a lot of er younger members
that's what we er we want that's what we require because don't forget old people er in fact our present national treasurer a mrs mary is now serving as the national treasurer and has done for the last thirty five years
still national treasurer and she's o well over eighty she's still the national treasurer
board of conference every year for two days conference and we go to different parts of the country aberdeen dundee glasgow UNK you name it we have conference in
it changes every year so we go to these conference and we fight on our declaration of intent on pensions reviews that's er reviewing a pension what we're trying to get for the government of the day to review the pensions every six months instead of at the present every year
are as an instance do that the present government er last year in fact since it some over it was the seventy nine er nineteen seventy nine
we were getting paid our pensions on the first week of UNK november
now if anyone like to look at the present day and er pension book they'll discover that since then for the last three years they've done the people of this country out of one week's pension every year
they've now this government has actually made a fifty three year or a fifty four week year
is it a very er lobby
ooh yes
we're i am up at least anything from ten to twelve times a year up at lothian regional council or the district council in UNK concerning anything concerning the old age pensions associations
and has been imposed on old people of er edinburgh and er
so the they're the old people have been done o out of a lot of money
this year in itself the single person has been done out of two pound ninety pence and er after the er older ones that's four pound odd
this year alone
so if you total it up be er again and first of all council being a being a council and they succeeded very well
and at the leith south leith very well and they just er district council
was there a lot of that sort of feeling around that sort of UNK action
no this one man this one man in the whole of edinburgh district council was UNK tax
what er caused them to put that for the er group forward i could not tell you but that's what he stood for this UNK action
he was neither liberal labour conservative none of them he was just he
mm
what had been a er election representative until
er an election agent election agent when you're er a er d doing the work of an election agent you've got to be responsible for all the data going out concerning the running of the election
making sure that your candidate UNK every meeting for er s you know during er an election campaign they've got to attend all the meetings
well the election agent was the man responsible for getting that data through to the candidate to say that you're speaking at a meeting such and such a night and another meeting at such and such so keeping the keeps that candidate on his toes all the time during an election campaign until UNK over and then of course er you know what UNK after that i su it's either
was you involved in the labour party for a long time before erm before you were the election agent
no
no
no n never
of course i had this spell er don't forget i was five years as a prisoner of war and a lot of interest because i was a union member UNK b previous to that you see
was this what erm led you to join the labour party
your initials at a trade union
yeah yes that was er actually yes er
mhm
i wanted to see how it o operated politically
i'd heard a lot about er af er i've been in the transport and general workers' union as a shop steward and so forth like that
that this was interesting me
i want to know find out the workings of it politically
what did erm how did you find the labour party at that time UNK with the labour party now
oh much better
w er united
it's not united at the present day there are far too many UNK and rights and centres
if there's e if there any party's operating at all there's only one p one thing and that's centre
no UNK no rights centre
united
and the same in most of our organizations in this country at the present day and that's what's wrong
it's holding them back
when you've got a left a right and a centre you've got three different parties within a party
so the labour party got united then at that time
oh definitely very well united yes
then
but don't forget that was just after the war and er the labour were beginning to build up getting things better run better country than they were previous p people
did the labour party gain a lot of support after the war
oh yes aye they did oh
oh aye proved it they got in
e eventually they got into parliament
erm now did your er labour party membership lapse after that time
er yes it did lapse
because i had seen my young brother in law and i says i'm gonna be like that then didn't fe er feel any of this er at that time
me as the district council
i couldn't see myself doing it so as i said i wasn't going to make a fool of myself by putting my name as being nominated forward er as a candidate etcetera lose interest that's the first thing that happened because they knew i was an UNK bloke
i knew spoke too much next UNK next candidate for
and i felt it wasn't up to them i didn't have enough experience i wanted to gain some more experience but it just fell away lapse
and erm you're not a member of the labour party again
no i'm not a member of the labour party yet
oh
you see the pre the present system we've got scottish old age pensioners is non UNK non political
you understand
is this er does that actually UNK from belonging to er
oh i could have er well it doesn't UNK me but i feel it would it wouldn't be right for me being a labour party member sitting on a non UNK and non political gr er ah association
mhm
now er you mentioned your pensions association
now you're area treasurer aren't you for the
area treasurer er edinburgh area
can you tell me a bit about the organization and what its aims
well the aims i'll just read this and this says this gives you most
this the name of the association shall be the scottish old age pensions association
the association will be non party and non UNK
one
that we advocate the immediate implementation of the scottish old people's chapter to UNK to maintain and improve the standard of living of pensioners by ensuring that the pension will rise according to the cost of living or earnings whichever is er is the most ad UNK
two
to press for the provision of suitable houses for old people at rents they can afford
and social services as may be required to ensure the welfare of the aged as set out in the declaration of intent
to this end we employ all constitutional means in cooperation with similar bodies on all questions affecting the welfare of pensioners
that's our aim
aim and object of it
where the le let's say association was first formed on the thirteenth of february nineteen seven nineteen thirty seven so you can see by that date fifty years an established national organization for the whole of scotland
what does the er the organization do
the UNK er organization doing is er fighting in every place where we think that there are o old aged pensioners being in er imposed upon in any way
whether it be welfare gas bills housing you name it and we're in there fighting to keep them above the water their heads above the water
you go on about erm some of the experience you've had some of the you've met
well i er i've occasionally thing that was about last ye er year or the year before a as being a member of one of the one of the lunch clubs
er and er the lothian region took over the lunch clubs when they took over er this two tier government in scotland you know
they took over the lunch clubs
and immediately they started raising the prices of the lunch clubs
well we were up there one time er at the lothian region and we to be up and tell that this was imposing higher things on higher prices on both the bus buses because they were raising the bus fares at the same time and they were increasing the lunch club
now the pensions when they raised at the same time because we only pension raised every year and we're up there at that particular time at the lothian region a full council meeting
and er we had told them that the q the quality of the food was reasonable
but the quantity the quantity of the food being issued in lunch clubs was very u even disgraceful
i er i serve our people with quantity of food that's supposed to be meant to be a dinner for an old age person
and er they listened very carefully to us in fact council of UNK actually brought up a sample of the dinner they issued to old people and i did notice as soon as they put this sample on the table the opposition the c conservatives and they still are their heads UNK
they refused to look at it
and i would have thought that was a disgraceful thing to do in a public in the council to a sample being brought up and they were afraid to look at it
their heads were actually UNK they themselves were ashamed of it and yet they would not commit themselves to vote for it
will you tell me a little about the erm the campaigns you've the erm the free erm travel on the buses
oh well the campaigns er i'm o i'm only speaking actually about the down here in leith i started my campaign for er the er let's see campaign for er UNK of free travel for the elderly
the campaign was supposed to start with a away back in the beginning of september
well i by good luck have had some copies of the petition sent down to me so i started it immediately and i had in the first they made over one thousand one hundred and twenty five signatures
in the first day
and i had er had given myself a target of five thousand for leith so i turned up the next and made my five thousand in fact i made five thousand and fifty signatures for the h and i believe myself if every branch were doing the same as i had been doing then we would have no problem at all in getting a hundred thousand signatures which is our aim
and they said so at the er at the district council went up to district and i asked for the support of the district council and er probably john immediately said you have the full support of the district council for it he says and i'll ensure that you get support with the result i also received four posters direct from the edinburgh district council with john photograph on it and with the UNK st stating every old age pensioner should be signing here
so that in itself was a great boost for me and it er it helped a lot
i also got support from er labour party in leith who sent down two volunteers to help me
so it's made a lot a big difference too
i also had support from UNK house and from er leith community centre
so i wasn't i wasn't doing it all on my own you understand my meaning
i weren't doing it all although i sort of organized it
and when i took i had to report back to area control i was immediate i got immediate applause
but i just said i don't want any applause for this at all i feel that every pensioner every pensioner should sign it whether they belong to the association or not
whether they have a senior UNK club with the association
if they want the free bus passes they've got to something done about themselves and
one of my in fact was i can remember i went up when i was first er paying for paying for an annual ticket with their bus passes and eight pound for a single ticket for us er for our quarterly ticket
i was up there three days campaigning UNK to this that i'm being charged and believe me for those three days i stood right in queen street just outside the offices there and at no any time during at any particular time of day you could have come along to me and there were still one thousand five hundred people standing there rain UNK or blow
for their tickets and i said at the area council if they had turned up like they turned up to pay them thirty pound and eight pound if they'd turned up at the same time with a petition form what a difference it would
what kind of erm reaction do you get from the different political parties to your campaign
oh well er most of us are b even the tories themselves know they know that we're fighting for the old people but do they we get the same old reply from them where is the money coming
that's the s o reply and that is all cos because of the central go government support grant who are naturally younger
they're responsible for the for the present that they keep they keep sending us this and that minister and that
but they're the UNK they're going to end up in the government
they're going to UNK the country they cut the money off from they cut the support grant from the from the district council and still are still are and there's going to be even bigger cuts the next year
going to be even bigger cuts the ne and it's en there no used to lothian regional council hall and district council
if the lothian regional c council can't get their money from a from a central government where are they going to get it from
so erm do you get a lot of support from the labour party for your campaign
oh every time without fear wherever you are er labour's scottish commons gives full support to the scottish old age pensions UNK pensions policy
that's from our own we also have the trades union congress with the same
and that's when i say we have a campaign which is going to it's a demonstration and er and rally in the end of march of next year
when we will be UNK off probably from UNK street proceeding along UNK er UNK street
and then we've got us a we're going to the cinema
and that's a and that's them all over the country not only edinburgh all over the country in north south east and west and you name it
and we have branches but we could have a lot more because the amount of branches we have although we have a lot of branches of scottish old age pensions we are not old age pensioners are not united they're not united the only way they can be united if it's a national organization join your national organization and fight the government
you can't do so locally if you're all working separately
you've got to unite and get in the one gives us strength to fight them
is er how large is your organization
nationally
well i er th well i couldn't i'm not in a position to give the total because the national the national treasurer would be able to you see
and as i said mrs mary she's the national treasurer and has been for over thirty years
that woman's now approaching eighty three eighty four years of age and she's still national treasurer so it gives you a sort of sample of the kind of people they have at the top who are really their heart and soul in it
pensioner themselves who would sit down and think now take for instance assuming that i wouldn't be a member of that just so surely a senior UNK club
now you go into a UNK club you enter your name and you get registered in the register you get your cup of tea and then you get social activity
i remember thinking si sit down and say and where do we get this money pay for this tea and this money pay for the registration
where do you get it from
a voice says it's solely from my pension quite able and get enough to give to join the association at less than a penny a week
do you find you get a lot of erm UNK from old age pensioners when you ask them to join
are a lot of them er quite prepared to fight to get their erm
oh the members
the members who are members of the branches are prepared to fight but it's not them i'm er i'm the other people who are er they're gaining from our fight they're gaining from our fight
where we've tried we've tried to keep a reasonable pension for them
but they're not fighting because they've nobody no national officials to fight for them
we have the only national organization to f er that goes on to fight for goes to parliament and UNK for them
have you had any erm any sort of successes in your campaigns that you've run
oh yes oh well er is just across in fact is across the border
everyone got free passes over there
has that just been in re UNK lately
yeah oh aye
by just
it's only within the last couple of year and then oh no you cannae do a certain of the er it was actually our vice president at the started the campaign over in UNK and they won through
and there again the supported the both the region and their district council
and here we have the calling under er an administration you know who they are and they're hanging their heads every time you speak you speak to them
they're ashamed of themselves but they're afraid to admit it
they're afraid of ashamed of themselves and they do to the old people
and they're afraid to admit it
they've all got UNK an UNK or a counter argument with you
and it's general to fail
i've bought i've as i say when i pay my have you got a mother and father
and they ne er never answers it direct never answers it direct
what's that got to do with it
never comes out with anything like that just got another one answer you
can you tell me about the er incident that happened when you went to meet erm brian at the council offices
oh yes at that particular time i will tell you that once again er that was er i was supposed to go for an interview and this was er for the er declaration of intent of wh which was er supposed to er supposed to be given every year to both the lothian regional council and the district
and this is happened all over the country each area are doing the same thing and all of this er produce this declaration of intent and ask the head of the er council to put it to their members and get the support of their members
now the r the reason for us doing that is that if they do accept it they are duty bound as a council to write to prime minister prime minister direct saying they support the declaration of intent
cos every cos really the should go direct to her and it as she's taken notice of you yet
all it does it comes round and er regional council say no we support she's got to think
well that's the idea of anyway we're going back to brian and er accepted that he would accept the d the UNK showing there was three of us there was the m the president of the area council myself and the secretary
well we er duly arrived down at quarter to ten as twenty six of september this year
and we went up there and we had just we'd we took the labour rooms and er of course we had got a cup of tea with them you know
and in comes councillor the leader of the labour group you see
well lads he says i'm sorry you'll have to wait another hour
course naturally we asked why
what was the matter
he says er i've just had a phone call from brian he can't meet you until eleven o'clock
an of course and naturally i says well why is he getting
is he in the building
no he says his car's broken down
i says what a bloody excuse i says and his car broke down shh bloody corporation buses here why doesn't he use a corporation bus to get in
why doesn't he UNK ring for his bloody chauffeur
or his k
why doesn't he get that
no
no he says er that that's er that's all i can tell you er that's he wouldn't until eleven o'clock come
and er immediately he went there was somewhere around about eleven o'clock he
right that UNK of er old age pensioners
so we immediately walk through and he's all
very pleased to meet you no
now he says er what is this now and of course immediately the president says well you know happens er mr can we says you've read it before you see
and so the our declaration of intent you've read of before you know what we're up here
and of course er once he read it and er put it down and UNK in his notes
agrees with so and so and agrees with this and agrees with that
first of all mr can i ask you a question
i says how come you UNK you gave us a time of which to be here now we said we turned up a quarter hour beforehand and i says we get a phone call er a an UNK from councillor that you couldn't make it because that your car broke down
he says that's right
er that's alright let's behave ourselves i says what about us we've been here since quarter to ten waiting for you to come
you
you're not the one who's got to
i says what was wrong with you not on a corporation t er a corporation bus
and he didn't know where to look
but eventually he again when time we started and then he moved on to it back on to declaration of intent and they pulled him up and took
he didn't agree with er h no he read a part of one of the d declaration of in one of resolutions that a substantial UNK fare would be alright
and that's what you're getting here so as far as i'm concerned
i says you're picking holes you're picking holes and i says i'll tell you what that declaration of intent is last year's declaration of intent
i says a new declaration of intent has not yet been printed
i says but you'll find next year when we approach you with this declaration you'll find it's been changed to free passage and where will your argument be then
proper UNK mi mind don't get me wrong
er he'll he's a good fighter and a good a good a good but there's certain points you can pick holes
right just
right first thing
we'll make a list
i lost me prescription when he gave me and we've been away
the my eye i got some drops from the chemist cos my eye was bad
and it feels as if there's UNK all in it now
yeah
so you hav t haven't actually had any UNK
no i had i had of the chemist in chapel because it came
yeah
so bad
yeah
so you really need
some UNK don't you
yeah
i think i do with this
you really need some UNK
yeah
i wouldn't go to a doctor there because of this UNK thing so i just managed till we came back
yeah well i
getting better but it's just this UNK thing in the back of my eye i mean i
yeah
was
just er look up for me
it still looks rather UNK doesn't it
mm
it's terrible
er the other eye
that one
mm
doesn't look too bad but that one
just look straight at me
yeah i the front of the eye looks quite
mm
it just feels horrible
yeah
it's nothing to do with hay fever is it this do you think
yeah
cos when i blow nose this thing pops
it's ever so UNK
there's a drainage tube th
i've always suffered with my UNK
there's a drainage tube that goes from
yeah
this corner of the eye to
yeah
the top of the nose
which is
mm
why when you cry your nose runs
okay and
mm
mm
if that is a little that keeps blocking
mm
when you blow your nose it will tend it can go the
mm
other way as well
yeah
but are they okay with leaving it
for another week will i
it'll be okay with
mm
leaving it
i hope
well i hope the UNK will actually get it to settle down
so you said that was the first thing or were was it that were both it
no that was it
i wanted to be honest and say i'd
yeah
lost a prescription
then we
went away you see
and i thought well i'll just pop in chemist and i was hoping it would clear it up so i wouldn't
yeah
have to confess
no don't wor
but it's not
still UNK
yeah
so we'll see what the UNK does
if it still remains uncomfortable then we then we need to have a closer look and we may need to get the eye specialist involved if it's refused to settle down
but you can still see clearly
yeah
yeah
that's good yeah
i a lot of pain at the back of my eye though
yeah
while i were on
holiday it was terrible
well it's bit UNK at the coast and
yeah
well we'll see what happens with the UNK i think that'll turn it off but doesn't then we must have another look very
important
i'm very bye
okay
see you
bye now
how did you did you find it going back to a heavy engineering plant like after having been at for a while
well obviously erm the work that er one was engaged in was smaller than that er produced by brothers
mainly because brothers were attached to the UNK industry and the making of ships UNK er UNK er UNK work erm UNK for ships
erm but of course they did other work you know which was of a general character
er and they were what we would call medium to heavy type of er engineering
er but the work was good
erm for example on the on the er UNK we were capable of making a UNK erm that was so efficient that on one particular occasion the americans and the british navy had a competition to see how many planes they could put in the air er in a certain number of minutes
i think it was ten minutes
and er the british UNK came out on top
erm we had a full load you know in the air before the americans er were three quarters of the way through
erm and that was using their own u s a er UNK
and was that the kind of er was it still all mainly military type of work that you were doing even after the war
no erm part of it was military or UNK rather
erm most of it was the er for commercial work
erm it took some time you know through the mid fifties to run down the wartime contracts
erm some firms needed about ten years er before the contract the wartime contracts were eliminated
er and fulfilled
er but brothers er took time to get over that and er but at the same time were using their sales representatives to go abroad and to gain work you know for the commercial aspect of the company
and they were indeed successful
er in as much as they maintained the labour force
er at one time there was just over about a thousand people employed in brothers
that was the total UNK including the
erm at the time when i took er office as a shop steward er there was approximately two hundred and fifty apprentices and er there would be about six hundred shop floor workers and the rest er were UNK to the staff
the drawing office and the er dealt with the money side of the company
finance
but erm the contracts that came in erm were in the main for the ship UNK
and erm sir william who was the UNK of it er had designed the UNK in such a manner that all sorts of er materials were required for it
there was loads of UNK and er UNK and different things that gave plenty of work to our colleagues er including the housing you know which was a huge er piece of er UNK equipment you know built into the side of the ship
and the slides that were then UNK and put into it so that the arm of the UNK could slip into the water you know
erm was all fitted into these er containers
and it gave lots and lots of work to our colleagues and you know when i say that er i think i made a comment that at that time er had made the comment about er the winds of change and that er you know we were never better off well really the unemployment figures were so low at that time that it's to my mind you know a UNK
er notwithstanding having said that er we were always of the opinion in the shop UNK committee that if a man left we would then go after the employer to re engage someone else you know or engage someone er in his place
and the employer was quite responsive to that
and so it was no problem at that time
but as we gradually erm worked our way into the nineteen sixties er there were new technologies er brought into focus in brothers and the design particularly in regard to the UNK was one thing that er brought about a dramatic change er not only in regard to design but in production
the UNK at one time they designed er a UNK which was er a type UNK rather than a mechanical UNK er UNK and subsequently all the materials that i was talking about the UNK and you know all the rest of it were not required and it UNK the size of the thing er so low you know that er the british manufacturers had to look because the UNK were then in the market er in a competitive way to take on brothers or anybody else who were prepared to er produce them under licence
er and the italians at that time were producing them under licence from
so the management looked at the thing very critically and they designed a new UNK erm which did away with the whole housing which did away with the cross er UNK and the slides and it was so easily produced er that we were then seeking to sales representatives to go out and look for other work
so that created a problem and we then found that a number of people were leaving brothers to seek their UNK elsewhere because the work that they liked to work on and you know traditionally they'd been on it for years er was no longer there and er subsequently there was a slip in the numbers employed
how did you feel about that yourself the way the machinery had changed er and your trade was obviously having to adapt to that
well erm i took the view that er two things were happening
there were new forms of technology coming into existence then one we had moved away from the automatic er type of machinery to what they called er UNK controlled and numerical controlled machines
not UNK but UNK controlled
where you know the UNK on the UNK etcetera er were easily seen and er easily operated
er there were new types of tools brought into being er UNK tools for example on the vertical boring mills
erm they were used
er
i wonder if you could describe that in about er for the UNK if you like
well they had gone into the production of er steel er turning er in such a way that er they looked for the best possible tools er in order one that they could produce the item more cheaply as far as the employing class is concerned they want to produce it as cheap as they can and probably sell it the UNK
erm but this is more or less UNK within the engineering industry there is even UNK within an engineering mind and i'm not with the planners or the technical experts but even in the ordinary lay engineer he looks to be able to do the job more efficiently with the materials that he has in hand er and possibly introduce a new type of tool if he can get the proper material and likewise the employer was doing the same thing
erm and so therefore er they knew tools that they had been using since the period of the war erm were gradually being UNK by the new types of UNK tools
er for example the ones that they fitted on the vertical boring mills were round er in nature UNK through the centre to a tool post and subsequently when they went into action they were so hard you know that they could UNK the existing type of tip tool erm because the material itself stood up better to the cutting flow er rather than the tip tool which was inclined to chip
er and so therefore we were entering into a new phase of technology not only in regard to new types of machinery but also to the UNK
and then UNK that of course erm there was the introduction of the er work study personnel
the management er sought to change the type of incentive scheme that we were working on
because of the new UNK that had been installed
and because also that it was er partly the directors' money that was being poured into it at that time we knew all these things and they were expecting a return back from it
erm that er the er management er agreed to introduce a work study system
er now that was met with a great deal of er UNK
when i say that er the existing bonus structure er although UNK to time was certainly related to the man's pay packet and it was given in the way of an advice note with each job and a price attached to it
a price
so the man could calculate exactly what he was earning you know hour by hour if not day by day and week by week
erm so it was it was a it was a paradox
the money was removed and the new element of time on a job was applied and er this wasn't done easily of course because when they introduced the work study consultants erm we found it necessary particularly the shop stewards found it necessary to have consultation with the management
one to eliminate any feeling of UNK er to the introduction of any new incentive scheme but more so er to give confidence to our members that whatever happened erm there would be a benefit
because you know money wise because we were not content to sit back and see er schemes being introduced that which were going to act as a deterrent to er our members er being able to earn wages er on incentives and so therefore erm what happened was that we agreed that the consultants er head personnel manager would come down and talk to each group of people who were being put on to the incentive scheme one in order that he go over everything with them in regard to its application and two then answer any practical questions er where our members may find that there could be difficulties
er one in regard to how they would operate it and secondly in regard to what would be expected of them perhaps if they were attached to one of the older type machines and not the new machines you see
erm because new machines were costly and er you know you're we're talking in terms of a UNK machine for example costing something like twenty five to thirty five thousand pounds
but the change wasn't radical it took place over a period of er i would suggest er maybe about six or seven years
until all the old type of machinery you know was UNK by the new
and so whilst we were conscious of the fact that erm management were pursuing this policy to introduce the new system we were just as conscious that we were going to protect our members er and have prior consultation and that's the operative and effective word as far as shop stewards are concerned to have prior consultation before anybody accepted going on to the scheme
now the management agreed to that policy er and subsequently erm the main machine shop was the first er department to go on to it
so the targets were set er and a new basis of working agreed to UNK with the management on the understanding that er the existing UNK supplement erm would be multiplied by three and that meant that our colleagues were er able to earn something like er three and sixpence old money an hour if indeed they met the target bonus
erm on the basis that er we were when we were setting the targets the time was set by the work study personnel erm and then the operator was able to obtain a trial run on the time given er and if at the end of the work he was satisfied that he had made the target bonus or near enough or if he was satisfied that given a little extra opportunity to go back onto that job should it come back again in the near future then he would he would see clearly that he could make at least fifty percent er which was the target bonus and probably more
and so after a while erm we found that apart from one or two minor UNK er that our members were able to achieve round about forty seven forty eight forty nine percent
one or two instances that were UNK the fifty percent
erm but the stewards were told that er with all the changes that had been implemented that our members weren't satisfied
and so erm we went up i think it was about six months after it was introduced and negotiated an increase on the bonus element
and er that added er to our members pay packet something like another fourpence an hour
and er they were quite happy about that
they were quite happy
do you remember the time though as being you certainly imply that it was a time when there was a quite a bit of UNK perhaps at the complexity of the scheme as much as anything else
it was quite a new thing er in itself er you know it's you like i say you've implied that er there was at least some degree of UNK on the shop floor
yes
well one of the you see one of the strange things that happened at that time traditionally engineers and i think i said this in my previous statements to you for example in where there was no bonus ever UNK to er our members looked at their the daily production er routine that any interference as far as time was concerned by the management you know would be an UNK on their UNK and therefore it wasn't UNK
erm they could have to my way of thinking have engaged in UNK or a reasonable incentive scheme set with times and everything else but er they didn't do that
UNK in brothers when i arrived there was an existing UNK structure implemented although not everybody was on it
and that created a difference of opinion between certain of our members who were not in receipt of any incentive payment as opposed to those who could clearly UNK in it and make a reasonable er profit out of it
erm when the work study consultants came in er we UNK as to one whether their scheme was going to cover everybody because we were not satisfied that the existing scheme gave everybody the incentive that was required to keep people in harmony
and so we had discussions with them and i can tell you know it was at least six months before the consultants ever made any specific move to introduce the system as such er because of our UNK to them because of the fact that we asked regularly to meet them and to consult on various points
er one mainly being the fact that we wanted an overall scheme to cover everybody including a payment for the lowest paid UNK in the shop
that meant it went across the whole spectrum of the workforce
ultimately we were given that assurance and er we were quite proud of the fact that you know the members had gone along with us on the UNK that we had got that principle you know to establish
and being successful in that we then went forward to seek its application
but er one of the UNK things that happened was that immediately men are faced with for example someone standing beside them with a UNK
i was going to ask you about that
how people
that
how people responded to that
yes
that kind of
yes
well that created er a great feeling of ambiguity in the minds of our members erm mainly i think due to the fact that some of our colleagues you know may have been a bit er UNK
er mainly because in the past they didn't have the proper equipment to do the work that they were engaged on anyway and although their own minds would clearly tell them that they would identify the work with certain equipment you know that was up to date and you know would make life easier for them and be able to produce more i think some of them er their minds were UNK by the fact that er there was a degree of UNK between them and the management that they would ever get the proper equipment to do the job
however er during the course of our er UNK with the management er and i must say this that er they did introduce er whenever asked new equipment new tools they did everything possible to make life a bit easier for our members er in that respect
and then it was clearly seen er that not only were the changes in the er financial er arrangements for the introduction of the bonus scheme with the introduction of a further fourpence and hour with the introduction of the time factor on the job as opposed to them starting we'll say round about forty seven forty eight forty nine percent the movement was then into the fifty percent bracket fifty five percent
and as they went on you know it was gradually working up and so therefore the graph each man's productivity you know was rising
and er we were quite happy with that
the result was that other departments er particularly the fitters for example er who were still working on the old scheme wanted to they then wanted to come onto the scheme
and er that was with a great deal of persuasion er on the shop UNK part and argument with the management and pushing the management to introduce it er that we moved into the fitting departments
but er
the management were clearly trying to identify the whole process in regard to the machine shops in particular first of all so that when they did move into the fitting er departments they would have all the materials there necessary to give our members the UNK you know for producing the m er items
erm from you from your experience in the negotiating of that kind of er deal and just from what you saw of it working in factories er do you think that management quite explicitly sought to create some division or was the division that arose wh you're talking about the fitters being on a different scheme from the other members of the workforce
well can i say that er if i might say so first of all i think that the UNK that existed for a period actually came more from the workshop rather than the management
the management er clearly desired to implement the scheme er with the minimum amount of frustration er to anyone although you've got to understand that as an engineer working a big UNK machine for example if someone comes along and said er you know you could stand that job on its side different to what you've got it at the moment and you could do two faces instead of one you know by turning the table and you know by use of various tools er decrease the time factor there was the it was a fear that our members may work themselves out of a job
and i was quite conscious of that
but er at that time there was plenty work coming in erm there was there was no need for us to be UNK and so therefore we had to convince the management that in the best interests of everybody having agreed that the scheme would go on across the whole spectrum of the workforce was to move reasonably you know quickly through the various machine departments and introduce with a minimum amount of frustration
and we had to keep pushing them all along
it was an incentive i would say for the shop stewards
one to protect the members' you know interests in each department to see that they got the a time limit you know to go onto the scheme that the consultation took place
so it was done in that manner and it was fairly reasonable er and eventually you know everybody but everybody was on this scheme
do you remember any specific instances of er people being particularly UNK by the fact that there were these blokes on the shop floor suggesting this job might change and timing jobs and that kind of thing
oh yes er
did people get UNK by it
i would i would have to be absolutely honest and that and er i wouldn't exclude myself from that particular er way of thinking because when they moved in when you got a time for a job erm for example there was one particular job that i was on erm and i thought that i was doing it reasonable accurately and rapidly erm and they wanted to introduce a new UNK so that you know i could do the whole series of faces on it
erm and i could see what they were after you know an engineer has in his mind the plan and how to go about the thing and get it all done in a one off situation
so speaking personally of course when the work study man comes along and he's timing you lifting a UNK you know to UNK a bolt erm and things like this er it's a strange feeling to have someone standing looking over your shoulder and i personally er didn't see any need for that
er it would have been better had he perhaps said well there's the time for the job there's your card there's all the operations listed for you from one to sixteen or whatever it might be and each one UNK you know as to how long it might take
have a go and i'll come back in an hour and a half and well what the work study man wanted you see was to define whether his assessments were reasonably correct or indeed absolutely correct you know or whether they were too loose
er and that the final analysis er in regard to time was reasonable because you've got to bear in mind that there was money attached to that and if his figures are out and your bonus effort could be increased by ten to fifteen or even twenty percent you know then his time was considered by the management to be much too loose
but er yes there was a there was er a change UNK that type of er scheme which er initially was felt by each individual er when they were work studied
but after a while when they got a variety of jobs to do they took off on their own initiative and in fact some of them er without even advising the planning department er introduced one or two minor UNK which made life easier for them in regard to the work study man's er schedule
and that's where engineering you know knowledge comes er to bear because an engineer looks for that he looks for the easy simplest you know er method of production er which gives him an effective er UNK operation throughout the whole job
er and to be able to pick it off the machine at the end of the day you know as a first class simple object at a competitive price
and that's how it operated
do you think er work practices became any more flexible with these changes
like did er people begin to be asked to do different jobs whereas you described in the older days you were very much sort of pinned to one machine if you like
yes
well one of the UNK that was applied you see under the under the old er time workers' er arrangements where it was only the foreman who by visual contact you know with the amount of items produced at each machine could make any reasonable assessment in regard to the individual's effort
this was introduced in a more scientific way and subsequently erm times on machines can be measured
for instance if you want to turn an object on a UNK erm and you go from one end of a shaft to the other no matter supposing you do it ten times erm the machine will take that cut in exactly the same time
you know it's a mathematical er fact that it won't take any longer to go along
er and having established the measurement of combined with the time er people seemed to accept the fact that this was more you know scientific
and er it was accepted but erm the whole structure of the system was geared to efficiency
and through time the establishment became very efficient
not only in regard to the machine operators but there was other things that entered into our discussion
for example UNK they were finally UNK and replaced by er a schedule which was a work study schedule applied to each job
there was a card which you received from the er clerk at the desk they were introduced the clerks were introduced in order to note everybody's time
erm your time was made up it was then applied to the sheet you know and there was hardly any er personal allocation you know of duty in regard to filling up the UNK
so that was removed
other major things such as er doing away with time consuming exercise such as travelling even to the store for tools
erm the tools were made up in a kit and er every time there was a work study exercise done on a job er the tools were all numbered and laid aside and registered for that particular item
they were then made a sign in the store and if the job came up again all you did was to go down the store and it was a one off exercise instead of travelling back and forwards to get a particular tool erm er that was all eliminated
and you had the whole kit
it was easy erm so other things were brought into too such as drawings
drawings were altered er instead of getting a whole sheet of a combined er part of a steering gear or whatever it might have been er they were all UNK and reduced to part pieces and it was much easier to look examine and find out what sizes were required than you know three UNK er drawings
so it was really everybody was brought into this
er the only thing is that er it was the people on the workshop floor that were paid from it er rather than the er planning er personnel or indeed the drawing office
who came
in at a much later stage by the way and presented a claim for the management you know that they were now part of the whole scheme
did you not find that er the work them became very sort of com UNK if you like very specific people were doing bits of jobs rather than a feeling that you were all part of a much larger thing
you know i if you see what i'm getting at
yes indeed er the there was no doubt about that
er i was fully aware of the fact that er you know some people say particularly in the fitting departments where experience had taught the fitters having been given a free hand er that they UNK all the parts for a job or even part of the job they did certain UNK you know until they got all the part pieces UNK ready to combine it into the main unit erm that experience er was being UNK by an introduction of smaller units being UNK you know bit by bit as they were being produced in the machine shop
and this created a degree of efficiency
er there's no doubt in my mind that it was efficient erm and it was it was controlling time
but it must have changed the
and
the atmosphere of the job quite considerably
and
you know
yes er although let me say this that er there were many things which the management were required to do for example when we when we went to our monthly meetings with them we established monthly meetings with the management one in order to try and control from our side er the to have some control on the production er side of things
one in order that the old type of arrangement you know would no longer UNK and that subsequently if people were going to have UNK part UNK before they UNK the whole unit then whole areas would have to be cleared new benches would have to be built the departments would have to be totally gone through you know and all the rubbish cleared out and access and UNK you know to every department to make life easier for everybody
er and so to our credit er the management did this
it took time it took time it took a period of years till they got it UNK but when we got it UNK we had for example er UNK areas in which no one was allowed in unless they were a UNK you know
or were given permission to go in
and the fitters worked happily in their particular section and they had everything at their UNK you know more or less er in the one unit
we had the machine shops divided into the main er machine shop and the other sections
so that it was much more efficient and UNK and er UNK were all cleared and lined and kept clear
all the er all the UNK and the part pieces were all kept you know in a safe position behind the lines so that the it was easy for people to walk up and down without fear of accident
and so we were UNK by some of our colleagues on the shop floor you know that what a difference is on the place
you know and that this is what they were saying
mm
it seems like quite a radical sort of transformation of the whole work environment
well radical in the sense that er not UNK it took it took time
er but radical certainly as compared to how things operated before when you went into the fitting shop you know you could you could only walk a few feet
mm
before you were er trying to jump over UNK and
mhm
and old plates and nuts and bolts and all sorts of things
whereas the men the men were taught to be more tidy erm although let me say this that er if you asked jimmy who was an old established fitter in brothers where you would find a certain item you know in the fitting department er he could go and get it erm but er when the new system was UNK er everybody knew that they were stored either you know to the north of the department or to the south or whatever
everybody had an idea where they were
yeah
erm maybe you could describe how er i mean was it a big open plan type er set up
i mean you've described it there was over a thousand employees er and a large operation as well
yes
well there was no division between the well if i might say so when the there was a fire took place in brothers in the early sixties and it was an awful unfortunate thing
although perhaps it was fortunate in one sense that er it completely destroyed the main machine shop and er it all happened over a period of about twenty to twenty five minutes
room
can you remember
i remember er the effects of er working in the department er after the fire
erm we were asked by the managing director er a man called w p whom i had a great deal of respect for because he was a he was a design engineer by trade and craft
and there wasn't much that willy didn't know about the business
but apart from that he was a he was er UNK too by nature and er he was he was quite free in as much as if you made an approach to him and he understood that you weren't there just for fun he would set up a meeting and discuss it with you er and go into details and at the same time give you an answer at the earliest possible moment
but after the fire er willy er requested you know that er the men should carry on working and we gave him our assurance that we would do our UNK you know to keep the place er going
er but having said that er h his it was it was terrible
the for example where i worked i had to UNK out you know in the morning about thirty UNK of water you know before i could even see my UNK
and these were the type of conditions that our members worked in whilst at the same time the management provided plastic UNK you know but it wasn't efficient and it was cold and UNK cold if i might say so erm for a long period
but er to their credit er they got the contractors in and they commenced by putting up new pillars and new UNK structures and it took them about twelve months i think to actually build a new machine shop
but during this twelve months you were still actually working
we were still working there
er but er and the they negotiated er a payment er for working in these er cold conditions for the men who were in the machine shop
but er at prior to the fire there was there was a division between what they called the UNK shop er the machine shop and the fitting shop
so the new planners thought well why waste all this available space between the various shops
we can we can put it all under one roof and the d the design came out er good erm so that you could walk from the end of the machine shop was extended and you could walk from there into the UNK shop directly or straight into the er fitting base and UNK down onto the UNK sections
erm and they installed heating equipment er which our members accepted with a great deal of UNK
erm because UNK it was a very cold shop especially in the winter time when it was UNK you know
er i don't know if you've experience of steel but when you feel the UNK of a UNK first thing in a morning it's like lifting pieces of ice and er the heating arrangement took about four hours before it built up you know to a reasonable working degree
whereas the UNK that were installed went on UNK controlled and er when you went in the morning the place was nice and warm and you could apply yourself to work right away
so when all these changes were going on with the machinery the bonus system etcetera you think there were other facilities arose around about the same time which made the work environment still more er still better if you like
well the er the new building erm was certainly er safer
erm there were new UNK erm the management er applied their thoughts to it and altered the layout and certain machines were put to one side of the machine shop and UNK machines to the other side you know
er and it looked more regulated
er and the result was that the heavy casting you know didn't have to travel the system had to be monitored correctly you had to see that fair play er was the order of the day both in respect of the member and indeed the management to try and reach a er an agreement
er but in order to introduce reasonable facilities for shop stewards we had to make approaches to the management over a period of time
for instance we had no place to keep our er records we had er minute books er we used to receive minutes from the management for example after our monthly meeting with them er and they were more or less dictated by the er personnel department who were present at the meeting
er and we shared the common objective that these minutes would have to be UNK because if there was any element er in any of the minutes that we didn't disagree with then we would point it out to the management and had a UNK and have a signed UNK er by the secretary and the convenor which meant that er at least we were all talking with a common voice
er we UNK that procedure and then we went on to try and extend the facilities for shop stewards to be able to take care of the er problems arising out of the incentive scheme
now it took several years for er the new incentive scheme to be introduced throughout the whole of the works and i think during my last discussion you know i did indicate that the fitters for example you know were about the last group to go on
er and by this time you had several departments machine departments you know involved in the process
and er that had to be regulated as far as fairness and response to er any claim that our members may make in respect of fairness you know er and it to enable them to reach the target bonus
it might have been a question of time it may have been a question of UNK it may have been a question of instruments it may have been a question of materials raw materials or a UNK of all of these things
er or indeed you know the issue er of a job which hadn't been done on a particular machine er but was timed on another one
there was a whole host of things that had to be monitored by the stewards er on a daily basis
but erm happily erm we managed to deal with the matters primarily because management agreed that we would have a meeting on a monday and a meeting on a thursday both held in the afternoon in the last hour of the working day
now what happened and it was a good procedure because what happened was that if anyone say on a friday had found himself in a difficult situation we would then discuss it on the monday afternoon er bearing in mind that he had taken it to the foreman and had got no response from the foreman we could discuss it on a monday afternoon the convenor and the secretary would deal with it the following day and in all probability without having UNK to take it any further reply to the man that the matter had been resolved and to his liking
or UNK if it wasn't then we would discuss it again on the thursday and if it was a failure to agree situation then we just registered failure to agree with the management
and we kept these things UNK in a minute book
er which was kept in our custody
so were management quite flexible in that in that they you described they allowed stewards monitored the incentive scheme er they had two weekly meetings were management quite flexible in that they gave you time off or er whatever
well er in the early days erm there were occasions where erm if i may say so that just to divert for a moment the scheme had to have supervision and there was an increase in the staff the number of UNK and UNK increased
primarily because the UNK had to regulate their own department as far as er input and output was concerned
they had to regulate the er flow of materials from the store to the individuals concerned
erm and it became too much for them because people were working more efficient and therefore there was a an increase in the productivity level and so they had to increase the number of UNK and UNK which wasn't a bad thing because it was always our members that got made up to these respective er positions
sometimes you lost a shop steward erm notwithstanding sometimes if the work study department needed a er an extra man er you would lose a shop steward
mainly because the stewards had become involved in the incentive er scheme working er and had the best idea you know of how to set times and UNK and everything else
that's another interesting point that actually you're saying there that shop stewards were lost er became UNK and whatever
did you ever have the feeling that you were almost more a part of management that you were a representative of the workforce
well i never took that er as a stance erm bearing in mind that er we were there as the UNK to defend the interests of the membership in general
it would have been rather a dangerous step to take you know to con even consider er that
although from time to time some of our colleagues on the shop floor who ran into difficulties you know er sometimes described you as a tool of management er which was to say the least you know er entirely UNK
erm and once they got the problem resolved you know then they became different people
er and er as i say the it was a it was a line that we could never take UNK
you could be you could be UNK into a position where if the management had you by the tails thinking along the same line then you could never be an efficient you know UNK
and i've got to say this in some cases i had additional time as a shop steward and a convenor to spend on major problems er affecting the incentive scheme
er and i took the time at my own risk took the time at my own risk er primarily because of that very fact that you were there to support the interests of your members and no one else no one else
and er happily we went along in that situation and i've got to say this er i had shop stewards who even if they were new shop stewards coming into the committee weren't long in developing the same train of thought as ourselves and you know we dealt with things in such a manner but er we were efficient just as efficient you know as our members were on the production line and perhaps a little more efficient than the management in determining times
because we knew the speeds you know and er the working of the machinery the tools and equipment that were necessary to do the jobs the application of er UNK you know er what kind of materials ought to be used er and we went into all that you know in regard to setting up new times
again you never felt that you were because you were doing that you never had the feeling that perhaps you were becoming too much a part of management rather than er simply representing work or did you simply see it as part of your job to look after the incentive scheme in that way because it did er that was a part of representing the workforce
yes indeed er because we had an agreement and er w the men that i worked beside were quite prepared to honour an agreement once it was established
and it was to their credit that they accepted the new er system er and the new times
sometimes new UNK and equipment er and as i said before a UNK always looks to see if he can do a particular job better if not somewhat easier er than UNK
and with the help of all these er pieces of equipment er we found in general that we were reaching a new standard of production where we were increasing it er and we were able to bargain more strongly and more UNK on behalf of our members
and as each year went along erm we were determined as a committee erm that we would lay claims natural UNK claims to the employer to increase the remuneration in regard to the incentive scheme
and it was done successfully in brothers i've got to say that
and to the UNK credit they did respond
talking of the management er how do you think their attitude changed going through your experience er of negotiation over the years you were at
well i would say that er there was a dramatic change er in the UNK er manner of dealing with things
we were UNK erm if a person had a problem regarding er his UNK er it may never have been er argued to the point where when the new system came in we were educated you know to the extent where we knew how to apply ourselves to the argument
erm we knew that there was a certain area of profitability attached to the er scheme itself which the management were happy to receive
now having said that then we had every entitlement to argue the case you know on a UNK agreed basis i e to get the management to recognize that there was a fulfilment required from them to reach a mutual agreement with the individual
or i a group of individuals if it was necessary
er in order that the time could remain set at that without any UNK to you know er feelings of UNK or anything else
and we built that a feeling of trust rather than you know UNK or UNK er in the minds of people who were engaged on the previous scheme
do you think speaking personally that er management felt quite comfortable over the years er more comfortable with er being round a table with stewards
yes er i think that er notwithstanding the fact that we only spoke about the er incentive scheme on occasions we reserved our er judgment as to when we would apply to the management to discuss certain matters
matters arising through the procedure from any individual or any group of individuals on the shop floor was dealt with primarily and UNK so in regard to the individual making an approach to the foreman if no settlement was reached then it was referred to the shop steward in that department if he couldn't settle it along with the member with the foreman then he could report it to the er shop stewards committee through the UNK of the secretary or the convenor
we would then discuss it and take action
that procedure became operative so effectively that i think the management subsequently realized that unless they had shop stewards who were capable of discussing the matter UNK you know and UNK then they were on a UNK because they then stood to lose more productivity than UNK
so there was the UNK and roundabouts where had they not recognized and had come along with us to the extent that we thought we could do our a sharing objective er and it brought them out of the attitude that was UNK adopted where well management really couldn't care very much you know if a man did suffer the loss of er five pound a week or whatever you know and once it was made clear to him that there was no further er use of the procedure and he could take it through his district you know if he liked the man didn't well on exceptional cases perhaps they may have taken a case through but er in the majority of cases the man just accepted it and made up his losses er later on
but that was on a slower basis than he could make it up under the new scheme
under the new scheme a man er with a little extra effort could afford to offset and compensate his own er earnings
but the management did respond and er i think it was just because of the sheer pressure of the shop stewards er making continuous UNK to them on each and every problem that came up and they were not going to be set aside er with a simple answer er that wouldn't satisfy a member
we made sure that er on each occasion er we reached a figure or a set of figures that would be UNK acceptable to ask the colleague or colleagues and then it was registered in the minutes as a so we could refer back to er any cases er that were similar and that then made life easier for the shop stewards er who may have had a recurrence of the same problem
well it sounds like the procedures were quite formal quite highly formal
well they were highly formal they and i wouldn't have had them any other way
because had we had them any other way you may have fallen into the dilemma as you've suggested that the shop stewards may have become part of the management
erm in no way were we ever going to consider ourselves part of management
had we done that er you would have er you would have been in UNK street
er and in fact er i would say that had you become recognized as part of management our members wouldn't have UNK you as a shop steward
thinking about things like er the UNK commission in nineteen sixty eight did that in any way have any influence i mean that looked quite closely at er the state of local bargaining
did that in any way influence you as a convenor
well i think that er as i said previously that erm the engineering industry erm for many years er was under the influence of national wage negotiations
erm in the nineteen fifties and right up until i became a full time official erm there was generated an opinion that if companies were financially well off due to the effort of the employees then there was some formal entitlement for employees in these particular undertakings to put forward a separate claim at domestic level to enhance their pay
and erm well this became more or less the policy of the union
and notwithstanding the national minimum time rates were still negotiated and even today erm our members er in general er helped themselves er not only through the field of increased productivity but simply through strength of argument
er to force the employer into a frame of mind that er well there was a bargaining unit there
and er i don't think that UNK did anything other than to enhance that
er and to give the shop stewards er a greater degree of recognition
again it was a UNK of procedures wasn't it
a lot of the recommendations
that's right
exactly so
exactly so ken
er whereby the procedures er at national level you see the procedures at national level er are quite explicit that er in the national handbook any matter arising whereby the tools or the materials or the conditions attached to certain jobs are offered then our members have the right er to take the matter up with the management
now that applies to any matter arising and subsequently i think that er the UNK report more or less reinforced er that particular er procedure although it had been written into our national agreement er as far back as i can remember
and er but i felt and i feel looking back on that particular er decade between nineteen sixty and nineteen seventy that the work which the shop UNK movement did er even in a preliminary way prior to the UNK report coming out was based on reason and fair play
many companies er were making fabulous profits and what reason was there to prevent a good shop UNK committee from going in to try and enhance their members conditions
and after all you know from all labour there is profit
and our members share that
i've not there's a conviction that er if management were making money then why couldn't they get a reasonable increase in pay
now we did go through dramatic exercises in the nineteen sixties erm where we entered into a three year agreement er on wages settlement at national level
erm the UNK of our members throughout the length and UNK of the country er initially was not to accept three year package deals
er and the only reason that i thought they may have been favourable would have been based on the principle of fair play but then erm when you think of er companies who are making profits from year to year which were in excess of the previous years then by the time three years UNK our members could have been in a loss situation if indeed they hadn't gone forward and argued the case at domestic level
now within the national settlements at that time there was always provision left that if our members erm were in receipt of pay which was more than the national minimum time rate then that would satisfy the terms of the agreement
having said that there was always another clause which said that er there would be nothing to prevent our members from bargaining at domestic level
and that was always UNK in our minds you know as shop stewards
it was a fundamental principle that we never er put aside because we felt that er well as i say if a company was being profitable there was every reason why we should go in and increase our members' er standard of living
do you have any UNK of any particular disputes and maybe an answer that you could possibly sort of make a few comments on whether you felt the procedures were worked out so UNK that they in fact prevented disputes because they were so long and drawn out perhaps or er it took the fire out of disputes if you like
i think that er one of the things that we had to examine at national level er and this was done erm after i became a full time officer erm there'd usually be a procedure in the national agreement er whereby first of all if we registered failure to agree at domestic level erm with the management the next stage was to draw in the district secretary
er if the district secretary failed to agree then it was referred to the divisional officer
at that stage the divisional officer may have taken it away from the domestic scene and er put it through to glasgow if it was the if the employer was a member of the UNK association he would then take it to local conference
now local conference usually was held as quickly as possible erm but when you went to local conference as an official you were then faced with obviously the employer who was concerned in the case an independent chairman of the employers but a battery of other members of the UNK association who were UNK to the actual claim itself
and you discussed it with that body of er people at local conference
if you eventually failed to agree at that level then you would have to register failure to agree as you did in all other cases you know leading up to that stage
and indicate to the employers that you were then transferring the matter to central conference
now central conference by the time you went through all the stages of procedure it may take you ei possibly six to nine months in some cases sometimes it was held earlier
but erm it could take that length of time
erm i remember taking two cases when the procedure was still UNK and it was a company in edinburgh it was as a matter of fact
and on both occasion we were successful but there were other people there from different parts of the country who were not successful
and subsequently after a long period of time the opinions of our members generally was that we should change the procedure
and once the divisional organizer was in that would be the UNK point of or the end of the procedure as such
so there would be no local conference neither would there be any central conference and that's how it UNK after the changes were UNK by the rule revision
erm i'm not so sure that in some cases er it it's to our members benefit
obviously erm people may argue the case with me
er but er in my own opinion i think that er employers were more or less forced in the same way as we were to recognize that they had a problem on their hands
and the longer they dealt with it the more UNK our members could become on a shop floor or that they could have additional disputes you know on their hands because of the fact that the dispute or the problem had lasted so long
so you don't necessarily believe that UNK negotiation er necessarily takes the heat out of a dispute in fact it may UNK it
it could UNK it
on the other hand erm if you're looking at obviously sometimes our members felt that there was a benefit at least the employer wasn't getting wasn't getting off the hook as far as the matter was concerned the matter arising was concerned and therefore he was left with a problem just the same as we were
and therefore in the interim period things had to be you know you had to treat people fairly in order not to let them be of the belief er that going to er central conference was just an exercise
because you know both parties were there to make sure that er there was going to be a mutual agreement or it may in some instances be referred back to domestic level for resolution or UNK the employers just said no and that was the end of it at that stage
and at that stage our members were then at the s at the point where they could take industrial action if they so desired
after UNK the executive council
thinking back to your time on the UNK committee did that situation arise er very commonly very regularly
er and what was your sort of feeling at that time er about taking such as UNK action for example
well er i was never of the opinion that we should be taking UNK action
erm i always thought as did most of our stewards when i say most of out stewards there was always the occasional steward that felt er the desire you know was justified that the matter should be dealt with now and because the management didn't respond effectively then we should walk out the door
erm well that's easy
it's easy and it would have been easy for me to get up on a platform or to go into the department and say look lads you know we feel that you're justified in walking out the door
but there's a procedure and the procedure our stewards recognized that the procedure was there to be effectively operated and if words can resolve a problem and that's how we became trained in the situation affecting all our members
erm if words can resolve the problem then at the end of the day there's no need for a man or a body of men to lose money
and we did that effectively
and that's why i'm saying that leading up to the UNK report and because i was caught up in a situation along with my colleagues that we were changing a system er and you know a new incentive scheme that we were increasing production
with all the UNK that was involved in that er shop stewards taking cases up the shop stewards discussing it with the management the UNK involvement the UNK attitude becoming gradually not UNK but er UNK to the UNK fundamental logical claims on behalf of their members made it easier you know and progress was being noted that and earnings were rising earnings were rising
and er it was it was acceptable by our members in general that we were achieving the aims and objective of the basis of the whole incentive scheme you know notwithstanding a lot of other things that was UNK by because we could we could then say to the management on most occasions well we could do with something here that would help health and safety
you know if we thought that there was a need for new UNK boards or anything like that it was no problem no problem
it was just a question of time
and the less of time that it took the better
but we got we got the things done in that respect
again taking you back to when you were a steward erm what do you recall your relations personally and the relations generally er between the stewards and the full UNK the officials of the union
well erm i've got to say this that er as a shop steward the record that i inherited er was one of very little UNK between the employer and the union as far as union officials are concerned
and in twelve years as an experienced shop steward i can only recall having a full time officer in i think on three occasions
and as i say the more competent the UNK committee became the less frequent that it was necessary to have the sh the full time officers in
er if i may say so erm it was early in our career that er in my career that er along with the shop stewards we UNK in principle with the management on an annual wage increase
er and i think it was about nineteen sixty two or thereabouts
and er i was determined that er we wouldn't lose hold of this claim because it was a good claim it was a logical claim it was one that could be answered by the management and could be er put into effect without any delay in time
there was a slight UNK on part of the management simply because i think they were not at that stage UNK to the shop UNK effective way of dealing with things
they wanted to push in the incentive scheme throughout the shop and they were UNK engaged in doing that and were rather UNK you know to the claims that were coming through
and so to try and bring them to heel er we referred the matter to the district
the district committee the a g e w district committee er recognized that it was something that er was a UNK exercise because it covered all aspects of the workforce and therefore you had er engineers and the sheet metal workers and UNK and pattern makers everybody within the UNK in brothers was affected by it
so we referred it to the UNK and er we had the officers down and the matter was resolved and we got our increase and it was acceptable by everybody
erm i think that was the only occasion that we had difficulty in respect of a wages claim
what we did have difficulty was er with an odd occasion where a man was on the verge of being dismissed
when i say that he was sent up the road on suspension er with the intention of management that they would look into the case and you know possibly dismiss
and on this particular occasion it was a man who was engaged t on UNK work of a very er significant nature
er fine limits in the UNK of the object er piece of work that he was doing
and a slight slip you know had taken him half a thou over the bore
now what was required then was that although the job was in a rush the management had to telephone down to the UNK in bath to get the appropriate UNK you know to accept the cylinder with the er bigger gauge bore
erm and we're talking about half a UNK of an inch and for that you know the man but when i investigated the case the man had been working on these things for about three or four weeks
erm his brain when you're talking about human endeavour and craft skill you know to enable you to get to that stage of er fine working erm takes a lot of intensive you know er attitude
and the man had made a slight slip and for that he was being UNK
and we just stood aside from that and said to the employer look here if you don't bring him back on monday erm i'm afraid there'll be nobody here tomorrow right
er and the management equally sort of stood back and said well if that's your attitude er you can do what you like
so er that was a telephone call to the divisional officer who was available at the moment and who came down and discussed it with the employer and notwithstanding that in the afternoon i had given the management one hour to resolve the problem otherwise there was going to be a major UNK
and happily we got resolved happily we got it resolved
erm there are days occasions that could have UNK off major UNK with the trade unions binding the members binding themselves together to protect the interests of one of their colleagues
and that's what the trade unionism is all about
you know we don't stand back UNK and see one man UNK
er and therefore when it got round the workshop what had happened and why he had been er suspended you know initially the UNK of our members rose and subsequently er the place just ground to a halt and there was a meeting and therefore we put the point to the management that er if they didn't really in a reasonable manner then we were going
but we resolved it and er happily the divisional organizer resolved it er i would say in about twenty minutes when he came down
but it
was with the pressure of the membership behind him that did it
were the stewards formally involved in disciplinary procedure
erm we didn't have what was known nowadays as a formal disciplinary procedure
erm disciplinary procedures are now written into agreements with the unions
erm but in these days erm i think that UNK were in the main er fairly well off as far as UNK attitudes were concerned
UNK attitudes er were fairly stable fairly stable and some of the work that was done was so highly skilled er that it needed a UNK experience to be able to get to that stage of being able to turn a job you know to very fine limits or to grind an objective to absolutely no limits or to UNK a job with all the skill and the know how that had been built up over his twenty five or thirty years' experience you know along with his colleagues
erm and so therefore most people were UNK engaged all of the eight hour day
and erm it was to the UNK credit that we didn't need to UNK any er disciplinary procedure as such
although it was always recognized that er there were limits to which a person could go
i was interested in you talking there about you know that one that particular case whereby one bloke was threatened with dismissal and very rapidly the way you describe it the men came back with a threat of strike action
i mean did you do you think that kind of feeling that kind of solidarity spread beyond er if there was any news UNK through about another engineering factory in dispute or whatever
what sort of feeling was there about that kind of
yes i think i think in general er it was it was occasionally erm heard of in other undertakings where this happened
erm
but i'm thinking about di er disputes in general though not just disciplinary disputes
yes
yes
well disputes in general of course er in different undertakings there was a different attitude
erm for instance in the UNK erm where conditions weren't broadly the same as was UNK for example say in brothers or
erm you're talking about people working outside in elements er you know natural elements such as might be brought to bear in the month of january or february
er and er a similar incident took place for example
er there would be a UNK there would be a wa there would be no long discussion of it
there would be simply a UNK and the men would stay out until management either UNK to listen to one of their representatives and resolved the matter then and there
what i'm driving at is did in your in the time you were there ever the workers ever get into a situation where they wanted to come out in support of another dispute in another place of work
no
erm not really because well when i say that erm generally speaking there was this er UNK towards domestic types of agreements which tended to UNK erm district action
at one time for example you see there used to be an edinburgh district rate way back in history
and UNK usually UNK to its application
if for example the full time officers er negotiated with you know for a district rate erm brothers and er or whoever would concede that district rate
but erm and you could always refer to it in your dialogue with them if you had a claim to make er that they were only paying the district rate
on the other hand various districts had differential rates and those who had above yours you normally quoted
and erm you could use that in your dialogue with the management
so there was always that tendency in our members minds you know to refer to various districts and er earlier in my submissions i did say that there was a UNK in earnings especially between the scotland and england er to something like seven percent if not even more than that in certain undertakings
so you were always you were always faced with this er coming from the membership you know that we were always like the UNK tail you know we'll always be behind
er although erm basically speaking you were normally talking about basic rates rather than earnings
and if you quoted the earnings as opposed to some of these undertakings or districts erm then there was a wide gap you know er which we felt the benefit of rather than the reverse
pardon
ooh
do have a seat mrs anyway what can i do for you today
well it's this damn cough and cold get
still coughing
i've had it since just before christmas and it keeps going and coming
mm
are you coughing anything up with it
no i can't i UNK with it but i can't get nowt up
right
i made myself some medicine some er honey UNK and apple UNK
mm
it's an old UNK but i think
but it still hasn't worked
no
no
no
let's have a look
nothing's worked
now open wide for me that's fine
say ah
ah
stick your tongue right out
good
right let's have a quick listen i think what we're going to need to do is to get a chest x ray even if your chest is fairly clear i still suspect it's the hernia that's drying things up
bit cold
nice deep UNK
clear at the front and your heart sounds fine too
deep UNK again that's fine
oh breathing hard i go ever so UNK
oh i'm sorry
breathe a bit more gently then if you wish
that's fine your chest actually
sounds absolutely clear
so what can it what can it be cos it's worrying
don't know
me
something somewhere is UNK either the lungs or the UNK or the back of the throat
well in fact the back of the throat looks fine
yeah
the lungs sound clear so it's probably the UNK
and if you get a hernia UNK hernia with acid
yeah well i got that's what i have got one
that's right
and you have acid coming up the UNK
yeah
it can UNK the UNK too and you can cough because of UNK
no the important
there's no way i can i don't
yeah
UNK
don't
er
they ever go
well
UNK or anything
they don't go by themselves the problems they cause can go but that's a bit different
what we need to do to start off with is to look at your chest in greater detail get a chest x ray
if that's clear we then need to go back and attack the UNK hernia with more erm but we'd better get your chest sorted out first
should have gone in hospital last monday to have me hand done
yeah
and i'm going on holiday on saturday
right
so er it were daft weren't it
going and having it done and then going on holiday
to keep going and everything
that's alright
now if i give you this you can actually go along at your own convenience
yeah
so you can go before you go on holiday
yeah
or in fact you can go afterwards
if you know where the victoria hospital is
yes
now called mansfield community
yes
if you if you nip down there you can go any day monday to friday you can go any time between nine and four thirty you've just got to remember to take your lunch
tomorrow because i'm at me UNK tomorrow at
yeah
mansfield and i can go when i come back from me UNK about three o'clock
perfect
and i get the results for when i come back then
won't i
yeah
that's right
okay so let me just write that on the back monday to friday and that's nine to four thirty
if you go there it's easier to get to
yeah
okay
that's the next step we st we may need to treat your tummy with something else after that but i think that's rather go going to depend on what the chest x ray shows and how you feel
you may find after UNK coming back from holiday there's nothing wrong with you so er
yeah but i mean i've had it since your fortnight before christmas on and off
yeah i know yeah
it's driving me blooming mad
mhm
it's driving derek mad as well and i've
got right down from about what
twelve fifteen cigarettes to four
yeah go you're doing well
so and i'm trying to stop altogether but
yeah
i can't do it all in one
no
go
you're
and
doing the right things though so
you know it's not having this
you know here
mhm
and even here i've got it
i do you know i wish i just wish that i could explain how i feel but i can't
mm
i'm trying to tell you how i feel in myself
all my bones feel as though they're UNK up
yeah
that's how i feel
i hurt i really hurt
mm
here all up here in my arms i mean i had seven week physiotherapy on this arm it's
mm
no better now than
no
what it were when i started going
mm
it's all it dead it's
mm
it hurts
i wake up like it i go to bed like it i've got it all the time that i'm living with a bloody nightmare all the time
and i don't think it's from that hand
mm
i don't for a minute think it's from that hand because you know the UNK you're s are you supposed to get UNK all time
you can do yes
well i don't
you can do
i don't
not necessarily
i it's these bones what hurt here
mm
that's the main problem there
th when i'm picking doing UNK it hurt really hurt
mm
it's like as though i've in UNK
and this is like two day where i just UNK burning
you know i don't know what to do with myself sometimes
i can't sit and watch television i can't knit
i sit and read and i'm UNK up like this and i like that to sort of
mm
i'm always doing that think i'm bloody daft when i do it but it sort of releases tension
mm
i don't know what it is but it oh it's carrying me down i know that much and i have it for years and years
well there are one or two other things we can do to try and make you feel better er even if the hands aren't the principle cause er i think we'll see what happens work your chest out of the way first though
yeah
i'm certainly not going to er w to say let's give you a trial of this or a trial of that until we know what's happened with your chest so
yeah well i've b t to tell you honest truth i've been on th i've been down that road
i've
mm
been down that road
if you've got me on the records it'll show you
yes we're short of
cos i er i've just asked they haven't found them yet
no we don't know where they've gone
cos i mean it tells you on there i can't remember it tells you on there every tablet i've had all for this
to
yeah
no UNK
yeah
they go here they go here and they make me UNK
mm
they make me light headed they make me feel sick they go to my stomach
mm
i'm UNK and they don't do anything for this
no
what i want
to happen
we need to watch what we give you because of your
yeah
UNK hernia
yeah
anyway
let's have you having a chest x ray and have a holiday
yeah
and then we'll have another look
well
when we come back
but your chest y
i've had an holiday
that's right
but your chest is sounding clear and i expect it's management of the hernia that's going to
ooh can i have a prescription for them tablets
w the UNK is
yeah i didn't actually take any
the ones i gave you last w yeah
yeah
yeah
i'm nearly out of them
in fact i don't think i am
sometimes er do i have to take them all the time
i'm not sure about that
if i do if i don't feel this hernia if i ain't got any UNK i don't take them
i would for the moment yeah i would for the moment
yeah just keep taking them one in the morning and one at night
yes
alright then
and then we'll have a chat about that as i said
yeah
when you're back from holiday
now UNK food alcohol large meals UNK drinks
yeah
will all tend to upset your tummy
yeah
so be a little bit cautious
but
yeah
you are allowed to drink and you are allowed to UNK out and you are
oh yeah
allowed to go and have sausage and chips at a UNK
yeah
you know
just be just be
but drink in UNK
a bit careful yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
right
well i know i can't eat oranges and i can't
no
eat orange juice
no
you'll find your own things
yeah that's it yeah
if i and UNK cream i can't e i can't even put UNK cream on a UNK
oh dear
because that UNK me and all
shame i like
i like a bit of UNK cream
i know yeah
i've tried UNK and i've tried
this is a conversation with mr UNK in galashiels
mr is seventy two
right mr
well er i think some of my earliest memories are er UNK to the first world war time when i was a boy and we lived in street which er during the war we made a shift to which was really the opposite side of the street
yeah
it was a peculiar street because street was on a higher level and at one time the dam which must have been open now the dam when i mention the dam it's the mill lead but known to everybody in galashiels as the dam
and it runs through the town and was the means of driving the UNK in the old days in the factories
and er this divided this street into two but at probably a number of years before it had been UNK in and the top part of the street was called street and there was a slight hill run down to
now my father had the garage in
it was er he had it since my grandfather had the same place as a UNK shop and then my father followed on with the garage with cycles first of all and then when the motor trade came in he started in UNK repairing
motor repairing
had the garage been a erm a stable at one time
was it did he have UNK or for coaches
no
i think it like in galashiels there seemed to be a lot of rows of one storey cottages at one time in that part
and at a later date part of them had been another storey had put on to them
er but at that time this the UNK shop was really made in a one storey cottage
then the gardens were UNK behind the front row and then there would be another row of cottages behind that again
now as the garage grew the UNK shop was it still remained in the same place but the remainder of the cottages were made into the garage and the garden ground in between was filled in between with sheds with UNK iron roofs
and it made a long garage
a deep garage
and then in these days there were pits for going underneath the cars er dug into the ground so as you could get underneath the cars
there were no UNK lifting the cars up at that time
what year did your fathers er UNK wh it was really a bicycle shop that he had but i
yes
erm did he tr er make it into a garage
i should think round about nineteen hundred or nineteen hundred and one or two som it was
was that the first in gala
er no
there had been a shop in street i which is still there but it's been used for other things now
but they were the first people to sell a motor car in galashiels
they called them james
and er they had sold a car in eighteen ninety eight i think it was
the first motor car in galashiels
and er that was before registration of cars
i can't find out what make of car it would be but it would probably be a french or german car
and it was sold to a wealthy manufacturer
well a mill owner the owner of the skin works in galashiels a mr
and this er was the first car in galashiels
but we came into it about after nineteen hundred i should say
we bought an engine in edinburgh a gas engine run off the UNK gas to drive the machinery we had
er we also did general engineering because my father was an engineer er and my grandfather was a blacksmith my father was an engineer
the machinery of course was driven by the gas engine first of all
in later years that it was driven by an electric motor
but the UNK of course it was driven off the UNK and we had l UNK and UNK machines
and an ideal little workshop for anybody doing work as they did in the early days most of the components of a motor car had to made
labour was cheap of course time was no object in these days
and of course er when an article became when you needed an article or something broke down in the car and you needed to m make something up on the UNK o it was made on the premises
later on of course the change in the trade components were readily got as cars became more popular
and er there were not so many i in the older days every car was an individual thing
but in the later days when they made mass production was coming in the components for them it was easier to buy a component and fit it than to make up a piece in your own workshop
but er i w i would think although it's before my time i would think that er of what i've heard my father talking about these early days there was great enthusiasm for UNK and of course some of the early registered numbers you'll find that there's many of them were UNK the young men of the town who had probably been cyclists quite a number of them er took up this UNK and they made their own UNK so were buying either UNK and er even manufacturing the tanks and these things themselves
and our er workshop was open for and they got every assistance and every help from my father in these days
mhm
they these when i remember the garage it was a series of er lock up garages in the front with a central one opening right through to the back
and er by that time the w the horse UNK has gone out
my father had first er he had him being an engineer and had been working in glasgow after his er having served his apprenticeship at UNK the it was the thing to go to glasgow in these days which was the centre of all engineering activity and er to gain experience he went to glasgow
and er also many engineers when they were out their time they went to glasgow and for a few years he everybody who went from galashiels word got through to him and he met them at the station and got them settled in their UNK in glasgow
and er
would this would be about the turn of the century
it would be about before it would be eighteen ninety seven i should think
when my grandfather died in er just about that year
er eighteen ninety seven he died
and er i he that my father came back to run the business for my grandmother
and er later on he took it into his own name you see
but er his erm father h was the blacksmith and he had been born away up and er he came to ga he came to serve his time in a UNK shop at and er
the one that's still there
still there today aye
it's still there in today
he came to serve his time in he came from a place they called green which was a track between the hills away up
and er it was probably where the UNK came through it's a drove road and i haven't been quite able to find out what he di i think he would be a shepherd probably
and my UNK yeah my great grandfather
this is your UNK father your great grandfather
mm
and he died in eighteen forty eight when my grandfather would be about probably eight year or nine year old i think
er he the family must have came at a later date into galashiels
of course galashiels in at that period was the place for everybody to come to
because the mills were thriving and you would come to galashiels and get a job right away
but first of all he served his time in the UNK at and he met his wife my grandmother in which was quite you can quite imagine it was just a walk up over the hills and er he met her in and er they were married
she had been born in edinburgh but only mad chance because i think that the family were only there a short time
they belonged and they had to come back to
and they were UNK
and er their name was
er there's none of them left now except an old m mrs in who is over a hundred
and she's the last of the family
in the borders there's some in england but er that family has died out in the borders
er mostly anyway there is a relative i believe er in the town but er my grandfather after he had served his time at UNK got a job in galashiels in one of the big factories which was er was the name of the manufacturers there
it was one of the big mills and er there's still parts of it yet in use one of the high buildings is still there
and er he was there for quite a number of years and then went to just for a few years and came back to galashiels to work with the same firm and then he started business on his own
he i say in these days blacksmiths made bicycles
and we have a bicycle which he made in the year eighteen seventy that was before he had started business on his own and he had erm made it for a young solicitor in galashiels and i believe it was used in a race from galashiels from place in galashiels to the
where five of these UNK or UNK took part
and er this bicycle well it would go out of fashion and was put in a loft in one of the it must have changed hands from mr whom it was made for
er it er w was found in a loft in mill about the year nineteen hundred
and they were going to throw it on the scrap heap but somebody in the mill the said that was the bicycle that adam had made
and we got it back into the family and it's been with us ever since
during all our alterations i've seen it in the old garage away up in a loft and i've seen it put out in the back yard in the rain and i've always saved it and it's there today
and er after er my grandfather made that bike after he started business on his own he had well the next thing came in was the penny UNK bicycle
mhm
and of course blacksmiths still worked on the penny UNK bicycle
and i have lots of letters which i discovered about five years ago which i thought were probably letters that my father had written it adam because his name and my UNK name were exactly the same
but when i looked at the date my father could only have been about twelve year old you see when these letters were written so it must have been my grandfather writing to coventry and birmingham for parts for the penny UNK bicycles which he worked on
and er these were er he would do a lot of the iron work because a lot of the iron work would be UNK
but wheels and these sort of things would be got from coventry in i think the UNK the same people who invented the safety bike
they were er these letters are to one of these firms
and erm these er he must have given up bicycles when the penny UNK was UNK
and er there's quite a number of years h he there was many bicycle shops in galashiels when the new safety bike came in and blacksmiths probably didn't bother doing any work on them
it was mainly UNK bicycle shops
but when my father took over when he came back to galashiels he started in bicycles and there was quite probably ten bicycle shops in galashiels at that time and er he gave well he attracted business with his efficient way of repairing bicycles and er it's funny that after about a number of years we were between the last after the last war i should say the second world war er we were about the only people for a period the only bicycle shop in galashiels
there's more now but th at that period we were the only one left
then we father er with doing the bicycles and with interest in other engineering things like gas engines which seemed to have a period of er great prosperity i would say er in the period between nineteen hundred or maybe a few years before that until early twenties the gas engines were ideal things for little factories
and er you even find them in some of the mills er in galashiels and in er as the taking place of steam
and of course the or driving part of the mill i wouldn't say they completely took over from steam
but they just went out of fashion as well
and er when electric UNK came in naturally and each individual machine was driven by an electric motor
er well this maybe gave him a an insight into working on gas engines er i couldn't really say
but he erm he was once burned very severely with one of them blowing out and he's b he suffered from it all his life after that
but er when you looked at his skin he was all burned in the front and er with this UNK explosion of a gas engine
mhm
now in the period that i come into it would be the first world war when we had er of course in these days the thing we always to look at the motor trade then it was a follow up from the carriage trade
because motor cars didn't go at great speeds and nobody would dream of taking a motor car to edinburgh when the railway was there and could get you in edinburgh within three quarters of an hour
but the motor car was used firstly for taking people back and forward to the station
in place of the old horse and cab
and then of course people had UNK on the sundays of the summer and er so on it grew more quite a lot from the UNK
and then after when there was practically no erm commercial trade with them at that time
any commercial vans or lorries seemed to be made out of what was originally private cars
and which is natural because you know the very early motor cars were only a sort of toy for the rich as it were and er when it came to you see er UNK vans or er laundry vans made out of old pr private cars
and then of course when the first world war came along th a lot of cars were UNK into UNK and er then of course the lorries began to be come into their own
there were there wouldn't be very many before the UNK first world war
but after the first world war there seemed to be quite a lot of lorries
and of course after the war broke up there were quite a lot of x w d lorries on the market and they were converted into a erm UNK which was an open bus as it were
and er they we had a stake in that too at the very beginning er we did have a converted er x w d lorries into UNK and we also got some UNK ones
but this ceased in nineteen twenty six
when we sold to another firm
er who ran bus services from gala to UNK and UNK and er we sold out to them because we the other side of the business where the private car side seemed to be growing
and we just hadn't the time to do both
and er it was quite a good move i think to dispose of the UNK and concentrate on the private cars
we then got the agency for morris which was a very popular car and erm we also got the agency for UNK which er it came about with father being interested in a UNK car the austin twenty he thought it was it was the best that could be got
and he went into the main agent in edinburgh and gave them an order for three of those and of course we didn't get them just right away because er probably we'd have got the last one about a couple of years later in these days
but anyway we they must have been so impressed by the order that they got that they gave us the agency for galashiels and UNK for the austin
and of course the next year the austin seven came on the market and proved to be one of the most popular cars in the market
so that the foundation of your future prosperity in a sense
that was we were main one of the my father seen er possibilities er when he attended the london show he went er he was very much taken on with the morris UNK first of all
and he went to he decided to go straight to oxford before he came back to galashiels and er see william morris who was lord UNK later on
but he we were offered the agency for the four counties in the borders
but as we were very small people in these days he could only see his way to take UNK and UNK
he'd probably have been better to have taken UNK and UNK
but however that's the way things went and er we were UNK for the morris for UNK and UNK
and held it right up until recently
which the organization changed you see and er it wasn't through our fault but er UNK they wanted some a main agent in every town after that
and the UNK sort of fell through
but that was only after we had it for about thirty years or more
to go back to your own life mr erm you could you er were you always interested in engineering as a boy
no
i would say of the three brothers i was the one that was least interested in engineering
i always had a sort of UNK towards buildings architecture and that sort of thing
but being the son of my father it was his aim to send me out to serve my time as an engineer
which i really i went to UNK and i didn't like it but of course i had to stick it
but i only s er times were very poor as it was nineteen twenty seven twenty eight and things were very poor in the mills especially
and of course a lot of the engineering was on textile machinery and er i didn't i just wouldn't go back to it after i'd been at it about a couple of years
i wouldn't finish my UNK and i came into our own firm and started with bicycles and UNK
right up until i wasn't able to do any more and able to like all engineers you get most of the men when you get to the stage where you're not able to UNK under cars and do things like that so you find another bu business we went into sales and er UNK stores and that i've been in all that line in the last twenty years before i retired
did all your schooling take place in gala
yes my schooling i went to the school in nineteen seventeen in the middle of the first world war
and er we had er a very fine teacher then when er i can look back in pleasure when i went to school
they were miss was the teacher and the next three classes i would say with great pleasure and then we came to one of the old ones which er they were more severe probably she used the UNK a lot
and we used to c as we had nicknames for the ones we didn't like she was called
so er we didn't like er so we she was a miss of course
and we had erm we there was a few changes during that time we used to get troops coming in and UNK the classroom and we maybe at the very early days i can remember having to go to the street school and also the street hall which belong that was a church hall
but we only went for half a day at that period and then for a month or so then the troops went away again we got back into our own school
i can remember the days of the UNK when we thought there was a lot of the with the teachers and er this is UNK in my mind we heard all the mill UNK blowing
and er then we knew that the war was finished
and then every year after that they used to hold the one UNK silence which the mill UNK went and of course you stood for a minute and then they went again and that was it over
and this carried on right on well practically until the second war
and er then we had a bit there was a victory organization of the schools then
we had to go from the school to the school for two years and back to the school again and er finally we'd go to the UNK
but i went to a private school after that i went to one run by a mr e m
he was a grand master er and er you got greek and latin and all these sort of things
but i didn't er i think his teaching days he was getting rather old and he didn't control us as he should have been able to
and er it was a mixed school of course some of ours er different ages you see because it was just one big classroom
and er however it's funny that you things remain with you er even in the greek and latin i often find when i'm doing a UNK something i don't think i would ever take in and yet i seem to can answer the question
about er the son of er greek UNK or something
the after the school i was never one for er i never was a great one for sport
although i did go and watch the rugby i never was a great one for and i used to swim quite a lot
mhm
but er most of my interests were in UNK actually er in the days of er after we left the school after i was driving of course i was er these were the days when if you had a UNK the whole world was at your feet and er you could go all over britain if you just for petrol at one and thruppence ha'penny a UNK or something like that
and er therefore er w we made the most of it my UNK and i UNK we were in nineteen thirty two i would think we would be o one of the first hundred people or so to go with a week's f er tour to paris by air
a package deal
the imperial UNK airways had just er they had just received four big planes er which they put on the paris er route
and i think we were going first of all it was a firm UNK tours in london
we had booked up for the ordinary ship and rail you know to go over by ship and rail but er during the months awaiting the i think we were going in july and er we had booked up maybe about april but they had put these planes on and UNK wrote to us and said if we paid two pounds ten extra we could go by air and we did it and the full tour for a week in paris going by air was twelve pounds ten
and that included two tours as well
and we flew from er that was from london we flew from the UNK airport in london and er we you went down to er an a small office near victoria station in these days and er you w we you put your UNK in there and then they took you out on a special bus to UNK
and we only flew about i think it was four thousand feet that we flew and we thought this was terribly high
and then and of course as far as i remember we you could hear the noises of the engines of course terrible not like planes today
and you could also feel the UNK of the wings and the UNK er and er it was rather UNK you know if you hadn't been before
but er it's so simple today when you realize the difference how easy it is and but er that was an experience i can tell you
can you possibly remember how much you were paid for your apprenticeship with UNK
yes i have the slip somewhere and my father i didn't keep it but my father must have kept it but i discovered it one day and it was seven and thruppence i think for the first week's pay
and that was the common thing in these days
with er apprentices was seven and thruppence or seven and six or something like that
and that would be about the m the m nineteen twenties
nineteen twenty seven i would think
mhm
nineteen twenty seven
and er your working week was what
well erm eight o'clock in the morning till quarter to six i think it was then in the evening
er there must have been a at one time it had been six o'clock i think it was a quarter to six we finished
and of course there was a thing we w a lot of the work in the mills was in or UNK and of course you went to the early train in the morning there was a train from galashiels to and it was full of workers going to the mills in and of course if you going er to work in a mill there your foreman would come you would draw the tools at the night before you went to the job you would take them there to the train in the morning and meet the foreman and you would go to do the job and the same to UNK
and these sort of jobs would be repair work or construction work
er textile machinery er i can't remember us doing very much except er UNK machinery
mm
er because at that time there was quite a lot you would get one mill in probably with somewhere about seventy UNK in it and there would only b be less than ten of them working
the it was into the depression period
it had been b i think a lot of the mills had been during the very the years after the war they had been very busy and a lot of them would build sheds and b take up UNK that were you they probably had new UNK on order but they were filled with a lot of scrap almost you know anything they could get that work
and er they were well quite a lot of them were UNK in the days when the depression came on
and erm the i can't remember er oh i think most of the work up there that i was on we were doing different jobs in the mill like er when very too when the mills were closed at the holidays we used to go up and work in some of the mills
and er we had er i've seen us work er i think one of the jobs was on UNK and things like that mostly
didn't work on the machinery so much
er but as i say i wasn't very long at that so er when i came back to the motor trade and bicycle trade motor trade cars in these days you get a variety of er all sorts of cars
some of them were some had got old cars in where the tyres if it was a UNK it was these great big wheels with UNK edge tyres which you can you put on in quite a different way from the modern car tyres
you had to put them all on in a piece you see with the tube in it and er things became much easier when the wheel base trim came in
er then of course er petrol before that i was in the before i started the work we used to go out delivering petrol and petrol was all done in tins two UNK tins
there was no petrol pumps
and er they were kept in a special store which had to be three feet into the ground you know for safety
and every big mansion house had a place about at least ten feet away from the house where they had a store for holding the tins
and each of the places er where we got the supply of tins er we had a little van that went out to deliver the tins and we delighted as boys going out carrying the two tins er into the place
and er the cars then of course were all painted in there were no UNK paint we had a paint shop there but er it and we had an old UNK who used to paint the cars in UNK and they were an awful lot of work on them
and of course you had to have great UNK to keep the dust
because if it had been painted and the paint took quite a long time to dry and er if there was a UNK of dust it remained there forever
or you would have to take the whole thing off again
so there were the place was specially big UNK and kept the dust off the paint
and there was a lot of rubbing down and that sort of thing
after the UNK paint came in of course things were quite different
they had to be done in a special you know where they extracted the fumes away from the paint shop
and of course it was a very much harder paint
did you go to a technical college at all
in the evenings everybody then went to the technical college here
it at least u two nights a week
and er that was the old college in street
i can remember it well it was lit by gas e even in these days you know it would have been all electric light but it was gas and er we had erm i would go for engineering drawing and maths probably i think
i just can't remember
of course for about two years you know after and everybody went to something or other
it was the done thing
there was no er you thought nothing about it
and what about er your life you started really on the sort of bicycle and repair side of life
yes
erm how did that e wh what did your father pay you in those days for that
oh well being the UNK son i probably got ten shillings a week probably
ten
when i started i would think
and er later on er i would be er wages i think were then about three pound something in the very little more than three pounds
for a skilled man
yes
for a skilled man
er they had been very much lower th er in nineteen hundred and ten when we i have some of the books showing you know as little as er thirteen shillings a week for a skilled man you see and that sort of thing
but erm and of course my father was also an UNK he had he had done everything was used
we he had a UNK on what we called aiming race for laying guns in during the first world war
he it was for the you know the UNK w would come round and see if you had aimed the thing it was a UNK sort of thing
now orders came from and sons the printers who were great target printers and are still today the great target printer
now orders came from the and also we had orders for th e the falling target in the you know of a rifle range where you had to er put up the frames you know with a target on it and er we made a lot of these during the first world war
w that bit we gave up after the first world war but we made er we did make some of these er UNK things that they had in the second world war
er he also everything was used they were made out of gas UNK and what got the UNK in certain lengths and there's always a bit a small bit about a foot left over he made these into gas UNK
and er the things that we had we had a or two when they used to be when all the cars most of them were open of course in the early days and except for the UNK who were chauffeur driven
but er there were so many open cars and we had an UNK who er made the UNK and repaired the UNK and UNK and er we even made things out of the old UNK of these er just to we made bags for carrying trade plates for er people going away for cars
to oxford and birmingham
and er i used to go myself quite a lot er when there were well when there were more than one coming up i've seen me go into down in the UNK train from here to er well we had about five changes i think fat father had it all marked out so as you changed at a certain place
we used to walk from new station at new street station at birmingham u up to snow hill station
now that's all away now there's no snow hill i don't think you can really find out where it was nowadays
but we got into a train there and went to UNK i think it was
and then there was a certain place where we would go to a breakfast on the train
then he landed in oxford just at the right time to go out to the factory and it was open and you had to get your car as soon as you could and see that everything was all right
and erm if you noticed anything get it done before you left the works you see
and then he got on the road and he we usually took he had to run it er not more than twenty five miles and hour and er you had to run it we stopped at preston if we could get there
that was one of the stopping places
and then the next day we brought it home
but er that was one of the things er he UNK it was an enjoyable trip and the roads were in these days er you get the motorways today i just think on the roads what they were in these days there was even some places we went through a ford in the middle of the road with the water about two or three inches deep
and er there was very little money spent on the roads at that time the railways had been the great carriers of everything and the UNK were just coming in
and er but w i did see the roads improving continuously through all these years
did your brothers go with you into the family business
yes my oldest brother they were older than me er my brothers there was one two years older there was one seven years older than me
and er i was really the youngest there was one in between who had died
er but he had died actually as a very young child
the then of course when the wartime came along the last war i didn't i didn't used to rush away i had that sense to not just to rush on to the with the rest of them so i joined the fire brigade the regular fire brigade
and er i was UNK at that time and erm i for a number of well till nineteen forty was the end of nineteen forty i think i joined up and went into the r a o c as it was then it became the side that i was in of course
in a workshop which was being made up then we went on to er it was funny that we passed through london the very s day or second day that word arrived that the invasion was on the troops had arrived in UNK
and oh the reception we got in london
they thought that we were going straight we and we thought so too that we would just go straight over the through london
and of course everybody after years of UNK were all absolutely er treating everybody you know
we just couldn't get off we had the metropolitan police UNK us through you see to the we were going to the south
er where i ended up in UNK which was a guards UNK near
in UNK
and then we started we thought oh well we'll just th be guarding then we'll be away
however we the next thing we knew was the flying bombs began to come over
and of course this there we couldn't understand it what these things were that went flying through the sky and er aeroplane tried to chase them
of course they couldn't because they weren't speedy enough
and then the next thing you heard er away in the distance some had landed about UNK or UNK or something and some landed in the hills rounds about us
one landed in the very centre of er east UNK too
but er however there were none of them struck the camp
so we were off er after that we were off and landed down in erm bishop's UNK er in the woods there and we the next morning we were off down to UNK and we were embarked on the ships there and er landed in UNK at the beach it was
and er then we were led through into the assembly area
and it was quite quiet for a little bit because most of them had established themselves and we were waiting for a UNK and er we didn't get on the move again until the they went through the after it had been
er we went through just after it the rest of the troops had gone through we followed them on
and then we were held up at a place because some of our tanks e the seventy ninth UNK division was er holding all the special tanks er which were UNK and UNK and all these sort of things
er and of course they had to use these UNK er down the coast er where the germans were holding out er at and UNK you see
er and although they'd got they couldn't get the towns although they had
and also they sent some of them away down to the u the n the army that was coming from the south
er i can't remember i wasn't with them but we were in a spot and erm some of the tanks were away down there and some were up here and we the next move we went to
and
and all this time you were UNK and repairing
yes
UNK and repairing aye
well mainly UNK taking them into workshops
many of them were er sometimes we you co got into a UNK and you couldn't you gave it up you know because er by that time i think there would be plenty UNK coming on the market
but some of the early days they we gathered them into a park which er the w they were UNK
instead of sending back to britain for a part they took it off an old tank you see and on that had been part was still all right you see but the tank was er useless but there would maybe be a bit of the track alright so we UNK them
and they were put onto it
and then we went right through belgium and holland we were stuck in holland for er in luckily enough for the winter
in er the last year before we broke through
and then it was erm which was er UNK about a bit but we were preparing for the next move you see
then after they crossed the UNK we moved away up to the north holland about
which was on the german border
but by that time er we weren't there very long and the war finished and i was there in for a year after that in er germany
up near the
so that was er and then i came back here i was UNK and came back to i was er the highest rank i had was UNK you know in the acting UNK actually
er in er when we were in germany
now er we i came back here then and of course we had the workshop had to be brought back to normal again to deal with the cars
er and the we had a lot of during the war we did a lot of general engineering we had made er what they called iron UNK machines
cutting the iron by hand
and er it actually went back to my UNK day when he always wanted to get one of these machines and er he couldn't afford it
but he got a pattern made and had the base of the machine made at a local UNK and he made all the leverage parts and got the he got the UNK made in sheffield or somewhere and er he made one for himself
and he called it the well he was asked to make one for other blacksmiths
and we s we had kept on making this maybe we some years we would sell about ten of them
this had went on and on and there was practically every UNK shop in scotland would have one of these machines made by us
and they called it the number one
and er i think there were some of them still in use about fifty years after they were made
they'll be still in probably in use today
but at the beginning of the war when things were very doubtful and we didn't know whether the army would UNK all our buildings or what and we started to make bench models of this er iron UNK machine
and
can you describe really what i what an iron UNK machine does
well it's like a big lever and it has a at the bottom it has a bar which the very high UNK steel is fixed into
and the b and the bar on the bottom as well holding the th no the base of the thing holds the other bit of the UNK
mm
and as you pull it down it's the leverage that cuts the steel
it er it'll cut mild
it's a huge knife really
it's like a huge knife aha
yeah
just the same you've seen them with paper UNK you know
it's the same principle
like a UNK type of thing
but er we made them er of course the le it's the leverage that does the cutting you see
because you get er great leverage on this thing and it er you're cutting mild steel bars you see
and er we did erm we started making er bench models because we found quite a lot of these had been made in germany
the there a lot had we had never made the small ones before
but we st started making them and er we made thousands during the war and of course part of the lower part of the garage was used for making these
and er then we after the war was finished we continued making them for several years but we had to transfer it to another factory
and it was a UNK business sometimes we were very busy sometimes we could er we could UNK and making some other machines like we did some er rotary UNK machines which were instead of UNK a hole you could punch it you see
and er we did this er in this little factory at UNK
but there was periods that y your men you hadn't enough to occupy fully occupy the men
and we got a firm in glasgow who had to move
they made bakery machinery and they came er and took our factory over
and we concentrated on the motor trade after that
we kept on er making or doing repairs for the ministry of works for about ooh seven or eight years after the war finished which kept a lot of men working in galashiels when we you know when they weren't very sure if they could come back to their old jobs
but we kept this on for quite a number of years
and we had an inspector from the office from the home department here who er e had his office down there and we did all this they were for er the ministry of works
and they did erm vehicles for the navy the army the air force and the UNK commission any government thing that was
and er until it became the time when the thing got smaller and smaller and we finally had to do away with that place
but it lasted for a good seven or eight years after the war was finished
and provided work for quite a lot of men
how
and then of course the other garage in the middle of the town we got back to normal repairs and er
and how h had l had l life changed between er the nineteen thirties and the nineteen forties
by the time you got back
oh very much
very much er so although wages at the end of the war weren't so big you know even then er
can you remember what sort of
five pound would be a wage you know five ten five somewhere between five pound and er six pound i would think
as opposed to maybe three and
and they gradually went up
three pounds before the war
yes probably three pounds before the
now i was one who saved a lot myself and we had some very good holidays
and one of the last holidays i took and i was on my own i went to the united states for and canada for er the six weeks i think it was or eight weeks
and er that was a very interesting period because it was nineteen thirty nine and of course the what the my UNK of america were quite different when you got there from er what er their er UNK of the world situation were
where even going on the boat we went from glasgow from quay in one of the line boats and erm it cost erm the cheapest fares were twenty seven pounds ten return
the fare for er that i went was thirty two pounds ten
and that was er i didn't come back with an line boat i came back with a erm canadian pacific boat
because i changed out there but we had to pay about five pounds just to change from one line to the other
but er we went from erm quay we did stay at belfast for a about erm just er a few hours picked up the belfast passengers they we didn't dock there we they came on by tender
then you had about ten days at sea and you had oh three big meals a day included all in this
and erm dances and everything you know it was really a luxury the crossing
although it was very rough at first but i got used with it even when the UNK caught me up going round the top of the UNK but once he was away from that and er i wasn't a UNK in these days but some old man says to me er before you go to a meal he says take a drop of UNK
i says oh i says i hate UNK i says i never could
and i did and you know i was never UNK after that
and i went er in the boat coming back er from canada was far worse as the one going UNK but we went to boston and we stayed out in the harbour there and then we sailed down the coast into new york which was a great sight
and of course the main object of going there was to see the world fair that was on that year
and er it was interesting to the point of view of their attitude to britain then and er you know they were UNK of course you see
and er of course er their newspapers told an awful lot that ours didn't tell you see
and their impression er of germany well you can imagine a big country like america there's quite a lot of them germans and the german angle was er played up as well you see
and of course er they knew that there was gonna be a war whereas we put it out of our mind we thought well we'll be prepared but it'll never come
you know and that's our UNK of attitude
but they knew of course it'll happen
mhm
if it doesn't happen this year it'll happen next spring you see and of course er one lady who had been with her UNK er over in the germany she says when they went into she knew they were UNK theirs she had some friends in germany and of course they she said they were UNK up just at the borders of poland i think it would be then
and er she we had some very interesting UNK you know into the just from various people what the situation was
and then of course er when i got to new york we were quite friendly with all the people on the boat you know that made great friends with some of them and er i had two or three places to go i had spent a few days at the world fair and then i flew down to washington and er then i came back again
er then i went on to UNK and UNK falls and crossed over to canada which i had a few friends there
and erm stayed in UNK and UNK
and er UNK
and then sailed from UNK i was going to go back my it was my intention to go back to new york but i changed my mind at UNK and sailed down the st lawrence from UNK back to glasgow
well we'd the trip back we didn't go into quay we stayed off the tail at the back and we came ashore
and it was a magnificent sail up the UNK
everybody was impressed it was a glorious day like this you know so the UNK looks so beautiful when you see it in the in a in weather like this you know
s and er two or three friends oh i had been on a number of UNK before that to germany to norway and UNK to denmark
i had been on all the northern UNK
and i had been once in a UNK to the UNK islands and UNK in nineteen thirty five
and er some of these ships this one was the UNK of australia
they had been old german UNK you know ta brought over to this country after the first world war as part of the UNK and they had been finished off in liverpool and glasgow somewhere
and er they were a lot of them were sunk of course in the second world war
one of the UNK ones i was ever on which we enjoyed it wasn't a new ship by any means but it was the UNK
mm
and it was sunk at UNK
mhm
mhm
and er these are things you never forget you know
i was once going to go on a trip my mate and i we go a trip to er a train UNK down from er down through italy and of course
mm
here the UNK experiment was
oh
the thing you know with the italians
of course that was cancelled
and he cancelled his er trip but i'd i booked up for one to go to norway
mhm
and at that time so
so bringing you back to after the war er how did the business continue er then or for from that time forward
well we had er the business was quite good er we had er we could do of course at the end of the war we could have done with an awful lot more cars but we couldn't get them
i was just UNK the other day i think i brought one of the first land rovers to the borders from edinburgh
and i can always remember it was in the middle of winter and put on the four that bit circular bit put it into the four wheel drive and it came up there wonderful and the yet er going in we were and the other car was UNK all over the place
but in the impression was that we'd a land rover then it's funny
er we could have done with cars he says what are they bringing out this silly thing when we could have done with more cars you know
and who will we ever sell it to
and of course mr our salesman er he took it up to that big estate and er mr had got too old to go up to the shooting on the horse you know
and of course er w wondered if this land rover would go up there with the four wheel drive
so mr went up and er he went a way up the hill places that never a car or anything like that had been before because there were UNK and everything and he could have UNK in the middle of a UNK or something
however he must of chosen the right place to go and er he went right up onto the hill and mr got his shooting er and he bought the thing on the spot
i don't know if it's the sa i don't think it's the same one they have today but it was the first land rover that i can ever remember coming to the borders
and then we took on every farmer got one after that
but it did at the time appear rather a the last thing
the last thing that anybody would want
was anybody thinking on you know to have er cars you know
however it was a winner
and er we went on er for a few ye at that time we had agencies for jaguar rover m g er UNK erm UNK
we had all these er and austin of course and morris we had all these agencies at the end of the war and yet we couldn't get enough cars
but er however things went on and er we we've had very bad years some years when the we stuck too much i think to some of the morris of course er they had their troubles of course and then eventually we it was funny we were the only two people in the whole of britain who h ho held the agencies for austin and morris together and we were at times we were thinking we must lose one of them
and er we never lost them they joined together eventually and we that's all the position
and er we didn't do an awful lot on commercial later on we gave up that er thing we mostly concentrated on the private cars
going back to your trip in america
but going yes
mhm
now one of the things that was on the you know there was the great radio city music hall
and er oh UNK shows they had on there
and they had a what they called the twenty four girls dancing you know and also they had the a film in the show which probably i think it was a UNK crosby film that was on
v very good show
