but another one they had in another cinema across off it was just off UNK the UNK i think it was and they had goodbye mr chips
that was with robert UNK
and you know i went into that film it was just being launched in america and there was a sort of UNK to the film and er i didn't know whether to become terribly angry or just about cry because the UNK was as if britain was a UNK ship you know this was the last we would see of this great thing and they made the most of it you know like er i the g the film was the old private schools you know the old w well the public schools in england
and er this was a thing that would die out you know
they always had in america that sort of er something er that against UNK you see
although there were more UNK in america than we were in well are now anyway but er in a way that was the sort of impression
and that gave me a terrible feeling i just didn't know what to whether to you know you was sad and yet you felt wild at them putting it that way
and yet they were right of course they were right enough it never came again completely as it UNK nothing stay the same
but er some of the exhibitions at the great er world fair were really there were some splendid things although the main er theme of the thing wasn't so UNK well it was UNK in a way but just too much so
it was the UNK that struck me
the railways of america the different l er railways they had a huge UNK well a huge er arena open air with a huge stage and it was the presentation of the history of the railway engine
oops
sorry about that
rocket and so forth
something similar and er they came up to the great pacific engines that came on and they two of them came down in front of the stage two of them were just a little bit higher up and on the stage itself there were scenes done like the hall in the grand central station new york and er they were it was either the ink spots or some of these UNK that gave a performance and it was so well put on that you couldn't help being impressed by
mm
them you know
and then they had that great UNK in another place
it was er you paid to get into it but this railway show was all free
and of course there was er with engines from all the different countries including the flying UNK and different german trains and italian trains and so on
and then they the one where johnny UNK was it was a lake in front of a great arena which they did a lot of you know swimming about in the lake and the different UNK
and they then the other ones er there was one with general UNK and it was a huge thing you were ten it was a huge building modern building but you just couldn't tell what it was from the outside
but you went on to a UNK belt of chairs and it took you it was highways and UNK they called it
and you went on to these chairs and you went through a UNK part which showed you the roads of the future
now they're what we have today the motorways you know
mm
but it was so varied that you went through the cities and the UNK scenes where they went through the UNK and in the country and then you ended up with coming on to a crossroads in a modern a UNK city where if you look down you the pavements were UNK and you walked down to where all the models of general UNK were displayed as if they were crossing roads
and er i thought it was what a money it must have cost to put that one commercial firm doing that
mm
and ford was the same you could have a run round in a up and down you know in a sort of in any of the latest models and oh there were some great commercial er UNK in the in the place really
the british one wasn't too bad either in the new york world fair
could you tell me now mr as to some of your experiences as a town councillor please
well i was sitting in my house one night on the i think it would be er nineteen fifty four and a UNK came up from the ward committee to see me and wondered if i would join the council
i hadn't thought about it before then and i said well i would need a day or two to think about it
so they said they would come back the next week and see what i thought
so i decided to go on to the council
at the time er i did various things i was in the
i wh could you sorry to interrupt you could you could you tell me what year this was mr
nineteen fifty four it would be i think
right
and er
you were in the opera company
i had been er just in the UNK of the opera company and er you know various the church choir and things like that i was in
but er of course i gave up that and went er when i went on to the council
i er first of all i was a kind of shy wee UNK as it were on the council
because at that time the council was er men very much older than me and er very few young people on it really
how did you come how was the election managed then
well they were the ward committee had been seeking for a candidate but i had no opposition at that time at all
i was the only one who stood
in that second ward
which was a ward which i would say it was built about the UNK the eighteen seventies
and er a lot of the people the families had grown up and the housing was in a poor state
but the old people preferred to remain there instead of moving to properties which might be a bit far away for them
now er when i w went on the council o of course i was first put on the parks and recreation committee
the one that i would really like to have got onto was the building h the UNK housing committee
which er i did eventually get on to and was a convenor for quite a number of years
and then i got on to the i was convenor of the housing allocation committee for very many years
i served under five different UNK
whom er the last one that i can r the last who was alive died just about a fortnight ago
it was colin
the first one i was on was under john
i was under er UNK provost UNK
provost UNK provost colin and provost william
er now william of course was on more than one term at the end
and i think i would just needed to say the word and i could have been provost myself but i didn't really feel that i would be able to control the council i think that was my impression at this
although i believe i would
but er later on when the council er after the new set up came on i didn't s join the new set up like the region a and the district councils
i didn't i came off the council at that time and er i became the president of the gathering
it was a three year appointment
i was the first president of the gathering
now the duties i had to do there was to take the place of what the provost of the town did before you see
and er introduce the candidates to the public you know over the UNK when they're elected
and take part in all the UNK
but there isn't now a ga a provost in gala
no it's a district provost now
provost is for the district
you see now if anything happened er it could be a provost who'd the district who hasn't anything to do with the galashiels you see the next one in every probability
now er we had i had followed the gathering well since it was UNK in nineteen thirty
and had known took part in every one right up i'd never been away out of the town in the time the was on
all through these years took part in every one for the last fifty years
and er in some way or other you know not always in the same position but i'd always er had something to do with it
going back to your
erm er council experience erm what er you said that you were first put on the parks and recreation department
erm what sort of duties did you have to deal with in that
well we had the parks to look after we had the baths the public baths and the playing fields to er they were UNK through a parks superintendent
the we did er our baths were UNK from the nineteen fourteen period and they were getting rather old the boiler wasn't too good and we were afraid that it might burst at some time
we did erm get estimates for to change the system
of course when the baths were made there were ladies days and gents days mixed bathing was considered not the thing in these days but it did come in the twenty or the or the late twenties
and of course the with the boxes being all round the side the dressing boxes this was UNK we needed a building at the side which there was sufficient room to build something at the side because we had a park at the side of it then
and er we had a plan for to build a building with er dressing accommodation and er this was gonna cost seven thousand pound when we couldn't face it we thought that there were far more important things to deal with than that when we had housing we had just had a housing report which said that two thousand houses in the town were not up to the modern standard
and that meant in many cases that the toilets were out in the garden and one toilet was serving about four houses
and that was the traditional sort of way in galashiels it was rather more like the rural areas than what the cities of edinburgh and glasgow are the toilets were just outside where the old dry toilets had been
and er they didn't spend the money when the sewage scheme was put into the town the landlords didn't spend the money on UNK bits of the houses
for some reason or other the money would be UNK at the time
it came or it or it would be one of the UNK that the town has suffered from many times during the last fifty or sixty years
mhm
well we began to tackle the housing problem because this was a very big problem
and the result was of course that we couldn't build the centre of the town
we would have liked to rebuild it but then we had to find places for the people to go and being a narrow valley it most of the housing was put at the end of the town
and er some of the schemes have been criticized but it was a blessing in a way that we got them done when we did and er we were able to house a lot of people out there and release ground in the centre of the town to be UNK and er brought up to modern standards
mhm
and er there was a stage when we came to the where we really decided we'd have to UNK different streets how far we were gonna go in the centre of the town because people were beginning to get grants for altering houses and then in another five years time the council the council were having to buy back these houses to UNK the area
so there was a stage where we did say this scheme is going so far and anybody that buys a house out with that area they're free to apply for grants
but if they we will we will not allow them within this area which we intend to UNK and rebuild
mhm
and so it went on and the town today has er practically been either UNK the centre has been UNK or the older buildings have been brought up to modern standards
er there there'll be a very small number of houses now which are UNK compared with what there was in nineteen fifty four when i first went on the council
and er of course on the UNK town council i was also er on the county council because the proportional representation of the area galashiels held the whole fifteen councillors were on the county council
and er there was only one who couldn't take part and he was in the fire brigade and couldn't take part because they were er his employers
so er when i was i was on the county council i was on the welfare committee and er in later years i was on the planning committee
mhm
but er the welfare one was my er secret love as it were it was
because er i knew the area very well i was er we had two committees which were composed of two counties we had the UNK committee th that was a home at UNK a children's home and we had in cooperation with UNK and UNK were the owners of the UNK children's home
and i was chairman of it for about six years or so before the council broke up
we also had another one which was er which had been a UNK turned into an old folks home and it was er UNK and UNK
it had been at one time going back over a hundred and fifty years it had been what they called a combination UNK
and galashiels being placed where it was on the between four counties th you had UNK and UNK all having a part
but UNK and UNK came out of it and it was a UNK and UNK home
and er it was er we had to develop it from a UNK into an old UNK home
which took a very long time
we tackled it without putting a great lot on the rates we were a we were able to tackle it year by year by altering some of the rooms
adding er dining rooms and er sitting rooms for the old folk and er also trying to break up the wards into s smaller units
but er this place er was called view and it's now been er UNK and a new home has been built at the in the park
and it's
and what was it what were these homes for mr
well er old folk who couldn't look after themselves
but originally i can remember that view in the days of the when it was a UNK and i visited with my mother who used to visit a woman up there
and it was a very bare place then wooden seats and wooden tables and long UNK tables and er tha that's i have very faint memories of it
but when we took it over the one of the first things we did was to UNK the kitchen because the soup was made in these great boiler and it was probably heated up every day of the week and can imagine what it would be like being in prison
however that was all changed and er that was the first thing we changed and erm then we erm during the period we the staff were changed mr and mrs who are in charge of now they came as a young couple to view and er i think with their coming they had different ideas and the place did seem to change
that's this are we talking about the late fifties
or later on
yes
er the late fifties early sixties i should say yes
they just the early sixties i would say probably sixty two or sixty three when they came i think
and er of course we took away all the iron beds put wooden beds we put little UNK in the rooms and these thi tackling it bit by bit each year you see
not without throwing a great lot onto the rates because the rates were just UNK and UNK had to keep it up then and er we didn't er get grants for it in these days
and er so UNK had their separate homes we also had a separate one at side and then we also built the one at er lodge which is another part of the park
these were er built in between the th that long period that i was on the council
er i was chairman of that committee as well view when during quite a long period until the whole system was changed to the council system like and went onto er and er there was one of our er officer who was in charge of welfare was a mr who had a great knowledge of both UNK and galashiels and the country and er he was known by everybody
and a very great man he was and he before he UNK he had died he didn't reach retirement he died before he retired which and we missed him very much indeed
and er i didn't have a lot to do with roads or anything like that or education it was mainly welfare that was my the
could you tell us what job you do in b m k
in picking
in picking
what does that involve
that repairs any UNK that's happened at the weaving or the spinning
oh right
or anything we repair them
you're the last stage in
just about aye
just about aye
have you been doing it for many years
seventeen
seventeen
mhm
right
so you're the right person to ask the
right
question
right
what we're go interested in is can you tell us anything about how you came to get the job at first
was it because you knew somebody in the factory or was it the wages that attracted you
well i worked in johnny walkers and when i worked in there at that time when you get married you had to leave that was their policy
mm
they didn't employ married women
so i had to go to the like the job centre and they offered me this which i didn't really fancy at the time
er but i really like it
mhm
now a lot of UNK a lot of people find that surprising but
mhm
i quite enjoy my job
have you met a lot of friends in here
er well i keep friendly with the people that i work beside but not outside the work
mhm
i get i have a different circle of friends outside the work
mhm i see
i like to keep it separate
do you ever do or anything like that
yes aye
mhm
so
oh i'll do anything
if something happens in the work you'll maybe have a social occasion to celebrate somebody's retirement
that's right or somebody getting married or oh aye i go to these things
mm gosh
do you find that the place has changed much in the length of time you've worked here
yes aye
i find quite a difference aye there's i don't know in what way but i enjoy it better
i find er it's UNK
mhm
you're kept UNK all the time
you don't get so much time to get bored or fed up and there's always something going on and everyone's in a hurry and i like that
mhm
i like to be kept going
is the actual kind of machinery in the way you do your job changed
no
no
no it hasn't changed in any way
do you feel that you've got more or less job security now than in the past
what do you mean by that
well is it you mean technology hasn't affected your job to such an extent that you feel that you know you could get laid off at any minute if they bring in something new
no i don't think
no
no i feel quite secure
mm
in my job aye
now i was gonna say do you feel that women are an integral part of the factory there are a lot of women working in the factory doing quite important jobs
oh yes mhm definitely do i mean
are there a lot of women bosses
well in the department where's there women working they've got women bosses
mhm
i think it's a kind of policy they have they've got to have women where there's women working
mhm
find out what's than
a man well personal things you've got to
mhm
up you've got to it's easier to approach a woman
mhm
then a man
it's always been that
mhm
do you have any nicknames for each other
mhm
and are you going to tell us
er there's one girl called UNK
UNK
she never UNK down she looks busy and everything but she's not really she just goes all the time and that's
mhm
her name UNK
mhm
you know
anyone else
er no not that i can think of
no
do you have any special terms that applies to the job that we wouldn't know about
any nicknames for machines or processes or
not really no none that i can think of
is it a job that you would need to really you would need to be trained for it
you'd need to you couldn't just bring somebody in
well there's certain parts that just the basic like you could i could go down and show you but there's others parts it takes a lot of years
mhm
well quite a while to
mhm
if you get a hole in a carpet maybe you could put your hand through it would take you quite a
mhm you'd be able to patch that
aha
aha
oh i think so aye
do you ever go on any training courses or anything
no never
just within the job you're doing
mhm when i started in here er i just got put up to work beside one of the women she just showed me
mhm
as things UNK up at the time she just showed me how to do it and i just picked it from there
and is it a big section
i think there's about seventy or women in it but there used to be must have been about maybe about eighty or ninety women
mhm
to the picking
do you do a lot of overtime then
mhm aye
shift work ever
i've did er night shift once just one week
mhm
i didn't like that er
are there people work it
er there is sections there are not very many women do er night shift
mm
just two or three but some of them do the er six till two till ten
mm
but we're er we get a lot of overtime in our section that's
mm
where all the backlog of work catches up
anything bad you can get a good run then you just get a bad er run of carpets of the weaving
aha
and that's it held up at picking
aha
and how do you feel the er the hours and pay when you started relate to how it is now is it better or worse do you think
i just find it much the same
mhm
because well i get paid off when the UNK come in i was about three month out before i got sent back for and er the starting wage was i think we actually got a wee rise i think we were the only section that
got a rise and everybody else got a drop
because we were one of the lowest pays in the factory which we don't our section doesn't think it's right because
mm
we determine quite a lot of the quality of the carpet
mm
i mean well it's like everything else you can miss a thing but that's
mm
where the inspection comes in
mm
to it
mhm
but er we have to repair everybody else's bad work
mhm
have you noticed any kind of like a kind of hierarchy within the factory like you know one section thinks they're better than another section
oh yes oh they definitely do aye
mhm
oh definitely
and who thin who thinks they're the best
well the UNK think that they they're the lead
mhm
er weaving it
they don't think of us sorting they just say oh the UNK get it
and er the UNK think they're better than us cos they get higher pay than us they think it's er they're more skilled it takes them to longer to train to do the job UNK but they couldn't we have to sort their repairs again if they do anything wrong it's us that have
mhm
got to repair it
mhm
which we don't think's fair
we've always thought that we should er at least be in the same label as them
mhm so there's quite a bit of joking goes on between sections about this and
mhm oh aye mhm
and the laugh i had was er the last time they were advertising for UNK they you had to have i think it was o levels or something
aye
never
i mean what do you need o level alright to be quiet with your hands and things like that but how do you need o levels for a factory job i mean
mhm
and they say if any jobs come up at you would need it there
and to me that's not i mean you can have you don't need to be clever you just need a
mhm
just need to be och i don't know the word for it
you can be smart without being clever
mhm
i'd have been i didn't like the school i didn't
aha
i wasn't interested in i liked anything you didn't have to use your brain for
i felt the teachers had a lot to do with it at the school if i liked a teacher i liked the subject
if i didn't like the teacher that was it i didn't bother
aha
but er i was always more interested in doing things with my hands er p e music art all the things you didn't have
mhm
so naturally i was going into
mhm
i had no aspirations about
as quick as you could leave
aye mhm
earn some money
well in them days you could if you got fed up with a job you could just go and move on to another
mhm
job
and were your mum and dad happy about that
did they expect you to do that
ah they didn't they knew i wasn't really interested in school they were didn't bother them at all
no they were just ordinary factory workers just the same
mhm
they felt quite happy when you got a job in here
mm
oh aye
and you're married
mhm
do you have a family
i've no family no
no
no
you don't have that added burden
no
just a husband to clean up after
no and
no
and a wee dog
aye i've seventeen year of being married
where does your husband work
he worked in here as well he was a carpet fitter
is that how you met him
no i knew him from the school
aha
knew him for years and years
was that a good job carpet fitting
aye well he's started his own wee business up carpets
aye
so he's been in that's just about a year and a half now
aha
er he's selling and fitting carpets he quite likes it
do you get any UNK in here
no
no
no
i go outside and do er repair jobs if there's any you know complaints in the carpets they send me out as long as it's within the kind of
aha
er driving distance but er i feel that's a big UNK
mhm
but it isn't really
you have to face people er that sometimes not very pleased that you're coming
aha
that there's something wrong in their carpet
er but it's a wee break away it's a wee change of UNK
mhm
i quite enjoy that
and what kind of holidays do you get do you get a week at the fair
fortnight at the fair and
is it a kind of traditional thing
that's it aye that's it aye that's all
usually in our section they've er you can work during the holidays
mhm
because there's usually somebody working in every section just to keep a wee turnover of things that's in a hurry
mhm
going
but i prefer to take my holidays at the fair
mhm
and everyone gets quite excited
that's right aye
oh you making your holiday plans for with all the brochures are due out shortly so
we bring them all in and when we go for breaks we look through them and decide where we're gonna go next year
and where's the favourite place
er UNK very popular this year
mm
mhm
UNK
mhm
aye
one of them's been two or three times this was i think this was her fourth time so she went away to f UNK away over to the gulf of UNK
she really enjoyed that
mm
er i was at UNK we had UNK going to america but er my husband's young brother and his wife want to come with us this year and they've got two young kids so they felt it was far enough for them
mhm
mhm that's good
do they ever hold anything down like the way they used to children's parties at christmas and
no they don't have anything
they used to have er dances as well every
mhm
christmas dances annual dances but that all stopped aye
do you know if they still have a football club
they still have a kind of thing within i don't think they've got football but they've got a UNK thing going
mhm
er i don't i haven't time for all them things i work twelve hour shifts
mm
tired enough when you get home
aye
you just like to sit and watch the television
oh no i've got to get my
get the tea made and no
it's all go
does your husband help and things
not very much i'm afraid to say no
not in the
no he's a bit of a male UNK
and i gave up er UNK him i just got on with it myself
aye there's a lot of them about
do you think you have a few views in common with your UNK or do you think that when you're talking things come out that you kind of like minded about things maybe because of the job you're doing and the place you work in you know like maybe like politics or something
mm
you'll all be sitting saying oh i hate that maggie thatcher or whatever
oh aye
er they don't really bring that up much
no
no
i must admit in the break i we like to do the UNK
mhm
we sit and concentrate on the UNK we don't kind of unless we get it done quick which is isn't very often
er we concentrate on that do my UNK and things like that
so i don't really have much conversation with a lot of them
mhm
just the wee group of us there's different groups go at a time
mhm
and er that's what i do
i feel it keeps the brain ticking over
mhm
it's important
right thank you
no i've asked all them
have you
yes
er there's just one thing i wanted to ask you ken how you said you were working in johnny walkers
mhm
i mean how did they used to compare in the two there was all these different factories
a lot of them before that as well
aye
so i mean w was there a s kind of like one that was the one to be in if you could get in and other ones that were maybe not so good or was it just going from one to another till you
it was just going from one to the others if you got fed up you just when you left the school you put your name in them all and
mhm
just whatever one come up first you went for the interview and if you answered it you just took it
aye
well when i worked at when i started off in the i quite liked my job in there you made your own pay and i liked it was a UNK job i'd quite a good job in there
i got er timed in there with the what do call them they come and timed you erm
oh work UNK
aye work study getting my minutes caught in there cos there was er but at the time i left there they was doing a lot of shifting about and they were talking about shutting the old sewing
mhm
and it made everybody was getting shifted down to so i didn't fancy working down there we'd heard that much about it so that's when i left and went to walkers
and then well i met john when i was in there started going out with him and er as i say when you get married in there you had to leave so this was the next job they offered me
so you weren't too happy about that getting shifted on
no i didn't no i don't really like change i kind of
aye
mm
but i didn't like working at johnny walkers so i think it was quite a good thing at the time although i didn't really like it i'm glad now that it happened cos i'd probably still be working in there
mhm
er i didn't like it was awfully boring
really boring in there
and it was all just young girls they were ov over UNK with each other you ken it was oh it was terrible place to work i didn't like it
aye
but as i say it was a job at that time and in fact i'd never this was the only factory i hadn't UNK working in was the b m k and yet i like it the best
mhm
i think that was quite lucky i landed in a good job
mhm
aye
something i like doing
cos every day you're seeing a different carpet because they do a lot more contract now
mhm
in the old factory it was just all like home market what they call home market it's the same
mhm
kind of carpets all the time just an odd contract stuff now it's nearly all contract so you're seeing a lot of different carpets and it's more interesting wondering where they're going to like america and
mhm
all different places
i quite enjoy it
do you have quite a bit of pride in your work
mhm
oh aye i like i like getting something that's a bit of a mess and being able to make a job of it and
mhm
i get job satisfaction at it which i didn't get in any of the other jobs
mhm and do you feel quite settled in the job
mhm
oh aye
in the town
quite like the town
mhm aye i like
i wouldn't like to move to
no i never UNK
yeah
and yet it's not really any distance into
i'm quite kind of set
it's
in my ways
quite a difference all the same isn't it
aye
but er so how how's the town changed since you started work
how's the town changed
mhm
oh well it's all changed up certainly you mean UNK and all that
aye
oh that's all changed aye
mm
definitely
i think well there used to be three or four picture houses in the town there's only one now
aye
they kind of things you mean
mhm
i mean how do you feel about that i mean look what
well we've
they've done to it
we we've just got a local we go to which
mhm
we don't really go about much but i like the UNK i quite
aye
like shopping in
if i'm looking for anything i prefer to shop in but if i'm just UNK i don't mind going like out of the town down to or up to for a day but if i'm looking for something particular i prefer to stay in cos i know where to go
i think they've got quite good variety of kind of up market right down to if you're looking for a bargain
and do you think youngsters nowadays have got less opportunities than you had leaving the school
oh aye definitely mhm
well they all getting encouraged to stay on
well they're i mean at least you knew if you didn't like the school you could go into a factory but i mean o levels for doing the jobs we are i think it's we had a good laugh about that
mhm
mhm
then that was one thing we had a good laugh at
couldn't believe it do you not think that's
mhm
a bit
it's just
no grey mass is not anyway
it's not you've got to be clever with your hands in most of these
aye
jobs maybe a good eye to pick up UNK in the pattern and that but as for you have to be clever i think it's UNK
do you get any particular kind of UNK working sore fingers and sore back
aye sore fingers hard you get hard where you're cutting all the time in the shape but apart from that maybe UNK fall that on your foot and
do you have to stand all day
mhm aye
when i left in here at the when the UNK come in i got a wee job in centre up the town and i had i could have got a job in a hosiery in but i didn't fancy travelling down there so i took that wee job up there
it was alright but i didn't like the saturday work
it was a complete change for me
mm
going into something that i'd never done before
mm
the UNK
counting out the money and that at night cos there's only two of us in it
mhm
but i coped alright with it
work saturdays in here now
i do work aye
mhm
just the saturday morning it's only
mhm
till quarter past eleven it's an easy wee shift
mhm
quite a good wee shift
good
but i've i take my long lie on a saturday
that's my day off
course saying in another two or three weeks i'll maybe not
aye
if i get fed up and take another wee day off maybe a sunday or something like that
well in here you don't get double time for a sunday
never good with their good with their overtime hours but we're working at that
so you're happy in your job then
i am happy in my job aye
my husband always gets amazed at that if we're outside he'll say to people ask do you know if she likes her job and they he's amazed ken that can
mhm
can enjoy their job in a factory but
aha
i do
probably the only one
corner
mm
UNK to your end
yes
oh it did erm did wha did
what would it be
joyce did joyce do a few
she gave a few
no i took them off of her she gave them to me
oh right
and i went down as far as er
was it the corner
where you can see i think you know
er
as far as the eye can see i mean
yeah i see what
you mean yeah
yeah
yeah
i went down as far as frank 's
yeah
on the corner
yeah
yeah
have you had problems in the area recently
don't know
burglaries
well
the only thing we
somebody
oh yeah
buy three ten
yeah
i mean i go i go to some meetings yeah and i asked who's been UNK and all the hands shoot up
really
oh yeah
yeah
not in this area in nottingham
yeah
one or two burglaries during the day time
mhm
yeah
people have been in the house and they UNK in while they've been
yes
yeah
mrs
yes
that's only about two month ago isn't it
two month ago
mm
they've just gone round
they've been on loo while they've been and done them
anyone's gonna
they don't want the same crime
well i don't know really what you mean by
well i mean there's nothing much anyway
it
into southwell
yeah it's very low
yeah erm
er but having said that was
oh absolutely yeah
seventeen cars broken into
oh
on saturday night
there can be a lot of crime occur without you knowing
yeah that's right
someone tells me the other day that i i've you know y
yeah
s three public houses there in a row must be fairly unique that
er it's not to live there it's just
no
coincidence
but he was telling me that there's twenty one cars been stolen from the car park this year
mm
and i didn't know wh anything
because
yeah
the people come into the village
mm
yeah
er for the entertainment and their car gets stolen
cos they don't say anyone in the village car been stolen
no
they go home and tell their neighbours
yeah
mm
consequently we don't hear about it
so you may have crimes against cars in
mm
particular
yeah
where people coming
on the main road
yeah
get broken in to
mm
do you want me to make a start now or do you want me to
yeah
right
i'll give these out first of all
just get rid of them and i wo won't have to worry about them any more
three four five
take one pass them round
bit like being at college isn't it
pass one of these round each and if there's plenty here so if you've got any friends neighbours that can't be here tonight for any reason then feel free to take one afterwards and well it wouldn't bother me if i had none to take back
yeah
thank you
oh right
right
pass them along
if i can just introduce myself
er i think you've all guessed that i must be the policeman
considering i'm dressed in a black suit
i were looking at your feet but
well they're not that
they're not that big they're only size eight they're not really a sort of UNK policeman
my name's paul i'm a sergeant with the community affairs department er i'm i was based at until last week but now i'm based at temporarily
erm my history in the police is that i've got eighteen years' police servicing started at newark which isn't too far away from here did about four years there and i was a village policeman at UNK for about a year of that time
and er it achieved my first ambition in life to appear on television i don't know UNK can you remember the UNK enquiry
yeah
that was on
yeah
mm
well that all started of at UNK hospital when i was seen to run across this field and rescue
patient that had UNK their UNK
yeah
when it was on television it really looked it really looked good but er the reality of it was it was pretty bad really but er the editor was very kind to me and made me look quite a hero but
in fact he had me arriving at the scene in a police car with two UNK at that time we didn't have police cars with two UNK just UNK so they obviously put some sound on it
i actually arrived in a UNK mini car
see on television
i moved from er UNK and went to bingham i suppose you all remember the bingham area again
i was there for about a couple of years and then i moved in into nottingham on UNK on the traffic department you know the people that wear the white hats and do people for UNK
er but we dealt with quite a few serious accidents in the time i was there
that was the main we had
also had a spell on the motorway for about er i think it was just over a year
er on the m one
we don't cover a great deal of the m one but it's something like fourteen miles but that was about the time of the miners' strike as well so i was on traffic when that was on and we had these intercept boys who were working something like thirteen hour shifts for about a year
absolutely ridiculous it was
and then from there i moved on to c i d at in nottingham
did a year and a half there and then er promoted me and moved me back to newark
er where i did about three years and then moved to southwell
so there's a good year and a half at southwell so i know the area in fact i was over at southwell when simon was a police officer covering the area
i don't know whether you know simon
yes
i think he's been replaced now well not replaced
a long time ago
he's gone yeah
er i think he still covers the area though doesn't he
now and again
yeah but there's you've got a new village police officer haven't you
or have you
yes er ex
yeah
army yeah
is he
oh
yeah
oh yes
i don't think
what's your name
er
colin
colin
that's it
ah i don't i don't know him i've not met him then
no he's not long out of the army
no
he's in the army
so you're gonna get some northern ireland type policing
yeah oh yes
right we'll move on from that
so i was in at er southwell when the job came on community affairs i've been on community affairs for the last four years
what we deal with there is crime prevention
er school liaison er we do things like arrange talks to different community groups put on shows and displays
we also have er a branch that deals with juvenile crime as well
er although that part of the department seems to be a bit independent of the rest of it
tt so that's what i do
er j i just wanted to give you a bit of background so you know who you're talking with
when there's er when there's this sort of number what i like to do is make it very informal more of a chat really than a talk
i mean if the room was full a UNK and slide show and everything and then usually everybody falls to sleep
half way through anyway so we'll have a chat and if there's any sort of er questions burning questions as er i'm going along feel free to ask
in fact i'd rather you ask as i'm going through because er very often you think of something and er you wait to the end and you've forgotten what it was you wanted to know until you've got home when then you re all of a sudden you remember what it was
so i want to start about talking about what neighbourhood watch is and what it isn't
and see what you feel neighbourhood watch should be or shouldn't be
and then talk about er house security
but i wanted to try something slightly different tonight as a bit of an experiment i wanted us to sort of put ourselves in the position of the criminal and we plan a burglary of our house and see what we think about
now if we do that then er if you know how to plan a burglary and we're relying on you not to actually take this in
in to practice
if we plan a burglary between us at least it makes us think about the sort of things that we need to look at our houses to stop that burglary from
burglary from happening
so that's what i want to do is that okay with everybody
that'll satisfy everybody will it
right
neighbourhood watch erm it's an american idea
i think in america what they did is actually people went out on patrol there
er i'm not sure whether they went out with guns or anything
like that
or
well yeah that's the sort of thing it was
more the UNK the emphasis was on civilians UNK their own their own areas
erm that may be fine in america but we didn't think it was particularly relevant to this country although there's nothing to stop anyone UNK if they want to but we don't particularly advise it
it came over here in nineteen eighty four the first UNK sorry nineteen eighty two
the first neighbourhood watch was this place called UNK in UNK
now i say that was the first neighbourhood watch it was actually the first police recognized neighbourhood watch
there's a chap er at our called bill who claims that he got one year before that but he can't prove it to us er apparently he read in the readers digest of neighbourhood watch schemes in america and set one up himself in his own little area
now but he forgot to tell the police so unfortunately for p poor old bill he never got his name in history
whereas the er coordinator at UNK in UNK er has now
so that was nineteen eighty two the first one we had was at the end of nineteen eighty four which was at
erm we made a little mistake with that one because it was a very big area a lot of houses and er the crime prevention department as it was then promised everyone that we'd visit everyone's house and advise them on their security
which is a nice promise to make but when you've got so many thousand houses to get through it took about six months to set the scheme up
now just give you an example of the numbers of schemes we've got at the moment just on my area my old area from west UNK covering newark there's two hundred and twenty neighbourhood watch schemes
so if it took six months to start each scheme up
w well i think we'd still be on number three or four
so we re we UNK neighbourhood watch and what we did was er is er instead of going to everyone's house we have this meeting at the beginning just to discuss crime prevention and er tell people what neighbourhood watch is about
er neighbourhood watch has grown quite fast
erm it's certainly grown faster than we anticipated it growing and we are not able to er we're not able to carry out what we like to do with neighbourhood watch
we'd like to keep neighbourhood watch fully informed of all the crimes that happen in the area
we can't do that we can't even keep ourselves informed too easily as to what's happening
so the emphasis now is more on the people themselves basically neighbourhood watch is your scheme it's not a police thing we support it we pay for the hall tonight we pay for the signs for the street and we give you all the literature free but it is your scheme and it's how you want it to be
some neighbourhood watches do things like run cheese and wine parties and trips to the coast and bonfire night christmas parties and all that lot
some don't do anything at all they're just there in the in the name alone and if anything does happen they'll into action
but i suppose the real thing about neighbourhood watch as i see it is it's there to create a UNK spirit
not much more than that i think most good ne neighbours look for each other anyway in fact probably that's what happens in your street
you all look after each other
if someone goes away on holiday you may well give the key to a neighbour they probably know a relative of yours or somebody like that if anything does happen they can contact you or your relative to come down and check the house over
er some neighbours cut each other 's lawn while they're away so the grass doesn't grow too long and make sure that the UNK moved away from the letter box
they're the sort of things that happen
mm
i don't know i'm not
you're a
i have methods actually no
yeah
i mean i'm her relative around here and certainly no one cuts my lawn
don't they
right
no
right
erm
n neighbourhood watch is trying to establish that type of relationship in the area so that everybody does know each other
not to the extent where you're living in each other 's pockets it's just that er you know enough about each other to see if there's anything out of the ordinary happening
and if a strange person is walking up the UNK with intention of breaking in at least somebody may notice it
mhm
er i suppose if we're going back something like forty fifty years where people tended to live in the same area most of their lives and their families in the area people didn't move very far they were probably born in an area went to work in the area and died in the area
er that's completely changed now p people move great distances when they get employ to find employment
now i'm from UNK and my first job was at newark and my contacts now gone
erm s so you've now got the situation in modern times where people probably go out to work all day come home at the end and don't even know who the names of the people living next door to them
and that's happening more and more
and neighbourhood watch is really to try that down a little bit
the only problem with it is that very often we the people that organize the neighbourhood watches already live in areas that don't really need one that much
you know they're already fairly good neighbours anyway
er we'd like to introduce neighbourhood watch into inner city areas where people don't know each other too well
we try and get them to look after each other
th the crime problem as we've already said isn't too great here but er nevertheless it's important that we er keep our eyes open and try and keep crime out because some of these people that erm are living in the bigger cities that are criminals are now starting to discover that it's easier to come out to places like UNK and commit the crime because we we're not experienced at it
but we trust too many people and er could certainly find burglaries have gone up gone up something like five hundred percent in the last two or three years
er it hasn't happened here too much yet but it could be there in the near future so we've all got to be really careful about that
neighbourhood watches is organized er in the there's we have a head coordinator i of each scheme which is er someone that lives in the area
usually the head coordinator is the person who er takes the initiative to organize the scheme
and in that case it i forget your first name
jan
jan
jan
jan
erm usually it's the person that does that so it it's probably you
yeah
but er some schemes have annual general meetings and elect people er some are quite content to leave things as they are and the volunteer carries on all the way through with it
that head coordinator is appointed contact for the police
if we needed to talk to your scheme and if we would it would be fairly serious incident for us to come to you to tell you about it ask phil for some help with it
er it just gives us a focal point for us to go and see
and then what the head coordinator needs is some other people to help
now have you got is that
mm
organized is it
to my left
you don't mind them do you
known about them
discussed it actually
no she asked me
that's right and
yes
UNK
and we have discussed it haven't we UNK
yeah
yeah
now all that all that is just to ease the burden that
mm
you may have
in occasionally we send out er we have like a neighbourhood news newspaper for neighbourhood watch schemes
and we'll come and we'll leave you a pile of newspapers to distribute
if you don't want them you don't have to but they're free of charge
and if you decide to distribute them then you're going to need to help so you just give a few to and a few to you as well we'll get them distributed that way
er if it was something serious like say we'd had a murder or something in the village
mm
you'd probably know about it before our police force do the way villages work
but may be that we had a description want to get the description out to as many people as possible to see if anybody recognizes the person described er then we'd come to you there give you the description of the
mm
go round and ask everybody in the area
er and you'd get some feedback to us from the neighbourhood watch point of view er and it's not peculiar to neighbourhood watches but er from your point of view you also have access to the police in that er eventually there should be a liaison built up not overnight i mean it won't it won't happen tomorrow morning either but there'll be a UNK liaison between the local police officer and yourselves er and if there's any problems that you may have you know and you'll be able to communicate back to them
if there's an incident happens doesn't mean you have to wait for the local police officer to tell to come along and tell him you've still got police support all round you anywhere
it's important that if it's an incident to get in contact with us straight away
it's only if there's a sort of UNK problem that would tell the coordinator about and they would pass it to the police officers
er it's hard to think of an example but something like if you thought that this street lighting wasn't adequate and you were concerned that the it could affect the crime levels in your area
and i'm not saying that will happen but that's the sort of
thing you could pass on to the police and they could take it up with the local council
or you could as a neighbourhood watch do that yourself
makes you into a sort of pressure group
if there's anything you need action on a UNK crime or anything like that then contact the police direct
there's two ways of doing that dial them on nine or ring up the local police control which for this area is at newark
er a lot of people ask me how are you choose the difference between nine and the local police station
if it's something you want the police there to deal with quite quickly and if they waited an hour or so and the police didn't come then couldn't deal with it
an example would be if there's er a strange person g gone up the UNK drive you know they're on holiday and you hear a window smash you need the police there straight away to deal with that
that is a nine
if you er using a similar example if you were looking after the UNK house while they're away on holiday and found that they'd been broken into then that wouldn't necessarily be a nine call unless you thought there was somebody in the house
because it wouldn't really matter that much if it took an hour for the police officer to come
i mean it's happened it's gone er and doesn't matter how quickly the police officer gets there to deal with it
having said that if you did dial nine we wouldn't be too hard on you
in fact we'd rather you ring nine er but find out it wasn't necessary than you not to ring nine when it was necessary
so if there's any doubt use your nine system
right any questions on that
well that's the best thing cos i'm on a case a couple of weeks and i rang your police on friday night
yeah
and they came on tuesday
what was that
i'm not going to mention any names and all
no
he was round the friday night
yeah
and the monday and they eventually turned up on the tuesday
yeah what was it for
well it was just damage to my car
but we couldn't have any couldn't have any had they come on friday they may have done
not too late on tuesday
mm
mm
they said they'll contact the was out and it was forgotten
was it
well it must have been to arrive UNK
well i'm not it's not sometimes they have they wait for the local officer to come on duty
if it's
something like that they will do that occasionally
but where they fell down they should have told you that was what would happen
right
erm so that y so that you expected this sort of measure of service and if you were told the if you were told the circumstances you might have said well that's okay no problem
i mean you mi then you might have said well actually i want someone here a bit quicker and then they would have done something else
mm
would have told you
but i it occasionally happens though er it's not very good though is it
it's not no
let's think
no
you say about neighbourhood watch contact
yeah
the police
yeah
to observe them
if you're gonna wait three days at a time for the local copper to turn up
what's the point
that's bit too
the things is
some of them being UNK round at the time
no
erm yeah
you think UNK bad you ought to see some of the police stations in nottingham
carlton police station which is my police station you can wait twenty minutes for the phone to be answered
yeah
now we do know that's a problem the police service know it's a problem and the chief UNK come up with these er these performance targets where he's try he's UNK to the public that he's going to endeavour to make sure that all police telephone calls are answered within certain time periods
and we've got a very big UNK telephone system so that if it doesn't answer sit there with a UNK timing each phone i presume it's all automatically done and they get a print out at the end of every month giving the average time of the phone the phone takes to be answered
and then that's circulated to each division and if newark in the future isn't coming up anywhere near those standards or failing to improve month after month then he'll want to know why
and one of the things they're going to do is to UNK the switchboard that it'll you won't actually ring me up at all you might ring the telephone number for newark but it'll be answered at headquarters and they'll put you through
cos a lot a lot of the time is spent er by the switchboard operators just putting calls through to different officers
and you might be waiting to report an incident
mm
so what we've got to do is try and filter out that so that the incidents go straight through to the incident rooms rather than being UNK behind everybody who just wants to speak to the UNK to talk about the hinges that's just normally
mm
is that that's the problem the pile up of calls
mm
but if you do ring a police station and they are answered in order so it's just a matter of waiting they will be answered
but the switchboard has it will take them in order it's not just a matter of which button shall i press now
that's it
any more comments at all on the neighbourhood watch before i start
yes
er what's er what's the position about noise
can we do anything about that
it
er record players er record players
it's er doesn't actually affect me but i can hear it
UNK
is it er a UNK house or is
yes
it a pub or
yes er no it's the UNK house across the road
yeah
and they have parties about once a fortnight and well
yeah well
UNK drinking too
yeah i could say well that's not a police issue and then forget about it but that's not really a good response
no
er the environmental people at newark er at UNK and district council
yeah
should be able to deal with that for you
erm i think the way to deal with any anybody that's making noise you subtle obligation on people to actually mention it to them
mhm
it may well have been done
you see we d we don't know when they're going to have these parties
yeah
and you see if we ring s newark and sherwood up at the there these UNK going get the UNK
don't you
you know what there is
next morning
yes
that's the problem if it's a one off party there's not a great deal you can do
some people do ring the police
yeah
after one off parties
what i'm saying if it is a one off party there's not a lot we can do about that
yeah
some people do ring the police up and the police if we've got the time we'll come along and ask them to switch it down
yeah
the problem comes if they don't cos there's not a lot else we can do about that
generally speaking though most people will switch things down
i mean the street i lived once and er the police came to the party it did get switched down a little bit but er th the falling out after that for the next week who rang the police and you
yes
know it was a real big thing
yes
but there was no parties after that for quite a long time
unless people invited the next door neighbours then it wasn't too bad
but if it's something that's going off fairly regular
every saturday night
mm yeah if it's something regular
every saturday yeah
then there's a individual
from four o'clock onwards
pardon
from four o'clock onwards
if it's i as
an individual or as now as a neighbourhood watch although i mean it's not the main function of neighbourhood watch to do not noisy parties but it could do then make a complaint to newark and district council
to the
to the environmental health people
just we're talking about got two children a girl a boy
with the girl about fourteen
fifteen isn't she
yeah
yeah
is it a council house
i should think something like that really
is it a council house
there's only them two
yes
yes
well
i had to go round the other night saturday night and you couldn't get through the door
there were i young and girls and
yeah
and a lot of smoking and drinking and language and
yeah and while i've seen what's doing it
i'll just say that's it not
in a in an addition to er the er environmental health people though if it's a council house there's housing department will deal with that
it's like talking to that wall
you've got to keep on at it and it's like us
you've got to keep on at us sometimes
er
i've got to live next door to them that's
yeah
all
and sometimes it's er rather than ring up write a letter cos it's surprising how differently things are treated if it's in writing
well i'm not the only one this is the whole point i'm not the only one most everyone here's rang up about it
yeah
yeah well
phone calls can get forgotten about you're not far away as a phone call
drugs involved as well as well as
yeah
and it's
yes well singing
been in hospital three or four times
there's drugs in there there's drug in that house i'm sure
hard stuff as well as the grass
well i i'll what i'll have to do is have a word with the local police on this cos it's not something i can deal with tonight
oh no it was just
yeah i'll bring that up for you and see what it is
if they walk in there they'd get a right haul they'd have the lot
coming back to the council last year some time in may last year and er i was telling them about the noise and the situation at the time
and er i told them that er i wasn't p prepared er because they was there during the day as well it didn't used to across to catch the school bus and be half a dozen or so come back next door and stop there till about twenty past three then go back come back over as if he's got out the bus
mm
he was next door making noise
well i don't want
i don't want to dwell too much on this
i'm glad you brought that up really in a sense because if you complain about something very often you can feel o on your own that you're the only one that's doing that someone will take UNK on you
mm
but as a group of people er you can support each other it makes you feel a bit happier about complaining
especially if there's several others complaining as well
i suppose one of the things about neighbourhood watch if it worked properly is that you there's a group of you with a common interest and you could deal with a situation like that a bit better than you could if you were on your own
well when i was down at the er council that may i told them there and then that er i'm prepared to er let one of the council men come to our house about eight o'clock in the morning and then stop till ten and then come back again about two and wait till they come home from school which they wouldn't have come home from school but they go across the road and come back again double back as if they'd been to school
yeah
but they're not
er i offered it for about eight hours a day but they might send us somebody might
well keep at them
yeah
i think when you get probably fifty five and get them sixty retire why should you put up with all this harassment
but th this is
it's not fair is it
and i think that y until you can do something about this then you're not going to fight the crimes that occur
cos half of it's
well that's true yeah
children anyway aren't they
i er i used to have an inspector when i was on traffic and he says you take care of the little things and the big things will take care of themselves
that's right yeah
and if you do let the little
yeah
things slip
then i mean it has a knock on effect
mm
i mean you have no hope at all of
yeah
the big things if you don't tackle the little ones
because noise i mean it is UNK it gets on your nerves you know
you feel like UNK them
at the one direction it's these people next door to us i've lived there what twenty six twenty seven years and we i've people living next door six children and never a any noise to what we get in there
mm
ah but they weren't one parent families
now mrs
were they
mrs UNK
yes but they weren't on social security were they
pardon
one parent UNK
no
one parent family social security
that's where the
is
well i don't
one parent families
no
i think i think y with a certain you get an
yes
not unless
we get it now we're getting altogether
how long have they lived there
too long er
about three years isn't it
er
three or four years
i'm four year now
four years
four year
yeah well
but er you don't know who lives there
was that different
blokes living a going there you don't know who's there
yeah
yeah
well i can't really do much about that tonight but if you can leave that with me what i'll do is i'll have a word with er
saturday
see if we can sort that out
erm s certainly one of the ways is to keep
that chap was on that car horn
oh
i looked through the bedroom and this chap was standing on this mini jumping up and down
he got off the mini he that went flying up street she came out of the next door
they both got
a taxi to the
i was with her i was
she he gets out he gets her UNK he pushes her UNK under dancing like a
this is a party is it
no
normal
they'd been shopping
gardening and all
social workers
so it weren't them dancing on the car then
hmm
it wasn't them dancing on the car it was this chap who was doing it
it was just a chap
i'm sure
he was
no UNK on the car cos
the following morning i went out no UNK and there were bits of car all over the street but
UNK off
he did
i watch
got no idea
got no idea
yes i
alright for a
criminal
yeah
erm i've not done this before and i wanted to try it out with a small group like yourselves to see how we go on with it
what i want to do is try and find out we'll try and put ourselves in the UNK er position and then s see how we go about breaking into a house
that make sense
yes
the o one thing that w we have to have in mind though is that the this particular criminal that we are doesn't want to get caught
most criminals don't want to get caught but there are the odd exceptions who are a bit UNK er but we erm they're very rare and usually high on drugs on something like that but we're just your ordinary sort of down and out type criminal who wants to break in some way
doesn't want to get caught probably been in prison before may even be on a suspended sentence and if they get caught they're going to go erm in prison for about more than a year or so
er so that's what we are criminal we don't want to get caught and want to get some money and th the way we're going to do it is to break into our house
erm if we can just sort of work out in our own minds what i don't want addresses or anything like that so don't say oh i'll break into number six or anything like that but just anywhere in the area of UNK imagine houses yourself is to what sort of type of house we break into
when we say that i don't mean whether it's a four or three bedroom house i mean the sort of location it would be in whether it would be a middle of a terrace or a middle of a string of houses on the corner of a street or whether it would be on its own in the country somewhere or whether the back garden would back on to some playing fields or er the railway line or whether there'd be houses at the back
whether you'd break into to it from the front from the side the back that sort of thing
anybody want to start
an isolated place don't you
the more
isolated the better
one w yeah one where
doors are
there's plenty of trees around like mine for instance
why do why do you say that
well then if someone was breaking in and they probably don't go through doors UNK i've never really studied it but
well they do they do
they do
well if you if you can't see a door from the road then that will be the ideal entrance i would have thought
if it's
mhm
UNK by trees
so you'd go for a you'd go for somewhere isolated
mm
you'd go for somewhere where you can't be seen
mhm yeah
that's right
mm
they're similar in a way those
things
bloody council houses
ah you're a clever criminal
yeah i worked for fives years i've plenty of practice
oh you're h you're you'll be able to give us some tips then
yeah c s for five years
so er a anybody an any other sort of houses
no i don't think i'd go for a house that erm i wouldn't but those big houses of course it would have alarms wouldn't it
well it could do
oh yes so i might the one wasn't quite as rich
one with no on with no outside lights
yeah
yeah
and one with plenty of cover round it
are you sure are you sure that none of you've done this
that's a sometimes you're
most of the big boys they see it on television the next week they're
right so if we've got this
house then are w any ideas
you said UNK wh what about corner houses were there anybody
yes i corner houses
yeah
you'll go for corner houses
very high hedge
you know
and even if anybody saw you going down they wouldn't take a big deal of notice
yes
yeah
and so you're covered all the way
i mean take ours you're covered nobody would see you would they
yeah that's right
yeah
and er and i should er get in round the back
round the back
round the back
so w why then erm just see if we've got this right
if they're going for a UNK house or a house where there's plenty of trees and you can't see
yes
or a corner house and you're you've always left it open
definitely a corner house all the hedges
mm
are open
in a corner house and she's been UNK about five times in
yes
yes
mm
you see i think it's the time i think you've got to think about what time of day as well haven't you
i think
well yeah that's important what what'll we do go at night time or in the day time
yeah i think possibly i would go at night time
yeah because say in a village
you could go in the day mm
if you saw anybody strange hanging around during
mm
the day you'd think oh you know
yeah
yeah that's possible
wouldn't you
yeah
would we would we break into
we're all assuming here that the house is empty i take it
mm
would you break into a house that's got someone in
no
no
you could break into that one next door to us and
you know you could
please
i mean you could walk in anybody a lot of people's houses
yeah
television
yeah
and especially if there's a football match on
the thing is you've got to get into a routine haven't you
you've got to find
what do they say
something in the joint
case the joint
bothered to watch people
yeah you've got
work
where they are
if you can get a house where there's a lot of UNK where people's walking by
but i wouldn't where there's a dog
and
they're not going to notice one s stranger go in
how would you know whether someone's in the house or not
if you're keeping UNK on it
lights
lights
fire er UNK
have the windows open
smoking
what would the win
the bedroom win the bedroom windows are open
what would that
what would that say to you though
well i mean
if you could er
no i'm s what i'm saying is how would you know if someone's in or out
i've been keeping watch for a week or two
so you're going to be
when comes to the point
i should good haul
i'm glad you don't turn to crime
as a window cleaner
going in disguise
yeah
yeah oh yeah
if we were to
if you were to do all this
wouldn't you be better off breaking into a post office or business premises or a
yeah i
they're more secure
yeah
there's too many locks and
yeah
window cleaner
well if i suppose if your UNK be quite wise to that
mm
er it might be a bit o more than you actually need to
but you see you only want a ladder for the time being to make sure you get up i mean you can jump
you're going up a ladder are you
yes
mm
yeah
well that happens
that's what i'd do
that UNK that happens more than you think
oh does it
yes it's a well known
they never put money in banks do they
keep it in a
okay so we've got s we've discussed it a little while we've already got some i mean you're more clever at crimes than i have really
yeah
cos you
more criminals than
yeah
we have
but you're well aware that the best thing to do is try and commit crime under some kind of cover or
mm
away from people that might see it
you don't want to get caught you'll work in a UNK place you'll go for a place that's got hedges around it and where you can't see the door
you'll go for a corner house where you've got hedges and can't be seen
mm
so w the thing is we don't want to be seen
no
right so the first thing we as a crime prevention officer we well i look at anyway is surrounding areas of a house that can't be seen from the road
is there any hedges there that restrict the view to the house
now the choices i mean you'll have to look at think about your house and so you can is my house easily seen from the road or not
if it isn't then you've gotta make a choice of whether you want to be private or whether you want to run the risk of someone using it as cover
and it's that's your choice
the i would generally advise that you try and keep it fairly trim at the front
so that people can see the windows and doors
if anybody's having they'll hopefully report it
especially now you're the neighbourhood watch
the other thing we talked about is er whether people are in or out
the most of would go for a house where people were out not in
i think that's straightforward because if there was someone in they would report you straight away
you're UNK getting caught again
erm and we're not physical people are we
we're not going to actually try and UNK with someone we just want in and out with some valuable stuff
you brought up the special point there really that when someone's watching football match i think you said
there are occasions where people do go into houses er that's usually through a door that's left open
yeah
so it's if you're in you've still got to think about security and you ought to be UNK your doors if you can
erm
so what we need to do is keep the front trim
there's not much we can do with being in or out the building or is there
i mean if we're out at work we're out at work or if w we've gone out shopping or something like that
i mean has anybody ever delivered anything to houses
gone canvassing or
no
anything like that
i was at a meeting with er kenneth UNK name UNK
just happened to be there and he was telling the meeting that when he's canvassing going door to door he knows as soon as walking up the drive whether there's someone in or not
and i've done that and it there's not one thing you can point to and say there's no one in here because it's several things altogether that indicate it might have been there's no car on the drive there might've been there might've been milk still out
that's easy one that
er and it might be that er there's a space there where a caravan looks as though it used to stand
you don't actually have to know there's a caravan it's quite obvious when you've had one move it away
might be that
your grass is a bit long
it might be that everyone's UNK bin is out except for that particular house
several things that make you think that there's no one in there
so if we can do something that may trick the would be burglar into thinking there's someone in then he may well go somewhere else
i mean if you you're the burglar now and you're planning to break in a house and you're looking around at the different houses and you're trying to one of the many things you're trying to do is to establish whether they're in or out
then if it looks as if they are in you just go to the next one and look at that you know what i mean
mm
erm right somebody said something about dogs and burglar alarms
i wouldn't go where a dog was
you couldn't go was er i'm not going to recommend that everyone should go out and buy a dog
it's unfair on the dog if you don't want one then you don't want one
er if you want a dog as a pet that's fine i it will help
sometimes though dogs only bark when people are in the house they protect the person the owner rather than the building
there's nothing to stop you putting a sign on the gate saying beware of the dog
even if you haven't got one
the oth o one other thing er
i thought that was illegal
no
illegal
yeah
that's
why they brought these things out with UNK head on i live here
no that's not
legal to put
well i'm take him to test on that
that there's no
well he just pointed out to me
he was on i mean it wasn't it wasn't for any reason it was just a
yeah but
even have a dog any more but they used to have a dog and of course
yeah
they left it up
yeah
and he said no buy a badge now with a UNK head on depending on the breed of dog you've got and it says on it i live here
no there's nothing you can put any sign up as long as it doesn't
UNK
as long as it doesn't lead anyone into any kind of danger
i mean it's not likely to in fact the opposite is true
er another thing that i mean thought somebody told me about the other day er it's an old thing is er UNK drives
oh yeah
any body here
yeah
yeah
that sort of UNK a point that also you as criminals wouldn't
mhm
particularly want to be heard either
mm
is that right
so when you break in a house you don't you don't want to be heard you don't want to be seen
is there anything else that would put you off breaking into a house
you've walked up the drive there's no sign there's no dogs no burglar alarms
you can't be seen from the road is there anything else that might put you off
these lights
camera
pardon
lights that come on
there might yeah
anything
they can be quite UNK erm we haven't really established whether we're going at night or day properly have we
we had a bit of a mixture some would go at night and some at day
the important thing about night and day most burglaries happen in the day time
now that
when most people are out
that makes sense
people are in
having said that
you create less suspicion during the day
sorry
you're less suspicious during the day
you can be less suspicious yeah
cos there's a lot of movement
lot of movement about
the reason people go at dark is to they can go under cover of dark and cos they don't want to be seen
but the you know it's two o'clock in the morning and police car's coming through the village and see someone at that time they're quite likely to stop and ask them what they're doing
the other thing is it's e it's easy to find out whether someone's in or out
mm
why's that
at night
the lights yeah
curtains drawn
mm
so we're already there's people if we're going at night time we're going to go for houses without lights on
you don't always
i know when we go out we leave our lights on
yeah okay
we put all the lights on and draw the curtains when we're going to go out
say we went out
yes
at four o'clock and we weren't likely to come back till later
and the curtains are drawn
yeah
you see
mm
leave an empty
no but you do that for the reason
yeah
just
yeah
make people think you're in
you're in yeah
so if there's a burglar then he'll probably be put off by i mean if he really wanted to break into any particular house for a reason you might approach it but if you haven't got th no firm house in mind you've several houses and there's one house without any lights on at all and it was night time you may well go for that one first
think we've all got the right idea
mm
hope it doesn't turn to crime
there is another good way to find out whether there's anybody in you know ain't there
telephone
does so and so live here you
no
say no you've got the wrong
that does happen
yeah
that does happen
not very often
er what we're trying to do really is to try and stop the UNK thief
erm most UNK
UNK
burglaries
there's not many people er do observations or case the joint as you say
happens but they do try and go for bigger UNK i mean they'll not break into my house it won't be worth all that worth
it'll be a lot easier to go to work it's less hassle
er so that
see UNK they will not have a particular house in mind they'll have they'll just walk round till this one strikes them
mhm
the mind examine the way you that you've done erm if you sort of apply that to your own house you can actually cut down the chances of a burglary happening to you
er i mean i it was done very well
the UNK worked quite good i was quite amazed
quite common sense
er burglar alarms
is there anybody who would risk breaking into a house with a burglar alarm
no
wouldn't risk
not burglar
not unless you know all about the wiring and you could take it off yourself
yeah
no
so even if they weren't in and you to knock on the door the burglar alarm would stop you
mhm
well it's bound to
yeah
wiring about it and you can take it off
right
cos look at i mean in our street our area alarms going off
there've been smoke alarms
yeah
people still
mm
well if
if you were on a street then if you were a burglar and there's a house there with a burglar alarm on
ah but do you know whether it's a burglar alarm or a smoke alarm
yes
what from the
from passing
anybody going by
do you know whether it's a burglar alarm or a smoke alarm
only when it's ringing
yes
well i mean it's a bell isn't it
pardon
th s er burglar UNK a bell
there's different sorts
th there's different sorts and different sorts
is that
i don't know what you mean wh what are you t when you're talking about smoke alarm what do you mean exactly
well
do you mean a bell on the outside of the house
no
i'm talking about inside bells now
it's inside
i mean they open the door and bell can go inside can't it
just alarm
yeah
right so if we're talking about burglar alarms with the bell box on the outside of
the house
erm that would put most of you off
but
if the UNK running outside the outside the person
well could it er british standards say that wiring shouldn't be external so we're okay there
right british standard yeah
well isn't there a way there pushing UNK
down a UNK
yeah
w in the box
in the bo on the box to stop it from
ye well it can be done yeah
yeah
you know you know
yeah but i it has been done that but
oh they it at the UNK weren't they
the other morning at half past two
i know
rang for the police
and but they'd go gone
yeah it can be done
it can yeah
that's what they're doing put
it's er a kind of UNK that they use for UNK
yeah
it's in an UNK
yeah
er the
the dam the
that's right
mm
but the er but it can't be done on modern alarms now because the bell boxes they use are anti UNK and they probably have two or three alarm
boxes
and the
the criminals find their way round something and then the then the alarm companies stop it from happening
now the alarm
companies are always one behind but er if we're talking about houses not many UNK would try a house with an alarm
now you could in theory just put a bell box on the house to put people off
er if you were a fairly decent criminal though you may well have a look through the windows to see if you can see any UNK on the wall just to confirm it because by now you'd be thinking that a lot of these are UNK
aye look at look at the hall over in village
and they when the main street
some time or other you hear that court bell ringing don't you
yeah
do you know whether it's a fire alarm or not
nobody knows
no
oh you hear it it's rung for as much as twenty minutes while i've been walking round
or the shops in
yeah
but you don't do anything about it
okay then so
just along those
if it's a fire bell tell me ring the UNK
if it's a an alarm
well i i'll talk about
continuously
no real point then putting a bell box on
not having alarm so you put a bell box on
just a bell box
what with some UNK that will only go to houses with something like that because they think they see that you've got something worth having
well i've heard
otherwise you wouldn't have it
i've heard this quite a lot it's a it's a common
it depends what kind of burglar you're talking about
i mean the days of the black mask and blue and white jersey have gone
it's UNK suits and bloody
stocking
these days
i've not known
i mean you can't tell a burglar
i've not known many UNK break into houses with alarms systems
no i don't er
and this comment about that they think you've got something in the house worth UNK doesn't really come into it
but some will say that in UNK
if you worked for the probation service
you'll know
yeah well that's what it is
well i
burglar alarm cost a the whole system costs a lot of money to set up so if you've got in here it's not going to put that expense to set that up
well actually i think they're very cheap burglar alarms they're about three hundred and fifty four hundred pound
when you think about the wiring involved and the hours it takes to put one in i think that they're good value for money
hmm
it's about the same price as a video
oh they've come down in price from when i'm talking about when they first come first out they were quite a lot a lot more
i reckon the easiest way
expensive than that
yeah
and i would do it is to go during the day knock on somebody's door and pretend i'm selling something
and then say i want to go to toilet and then i should pinch something
yeah
mm
and it's done
unless they wanted to get
and then you could be going in
it's just a deterrent the same as what's on cars
yeah
only a deterrent isn't it
well they will they will if they really want to get in
what i'm saying if
you if you put yourself in the position of a burglar and y you're already you've done it you're already making choices
mm
you're already saying i'm not doing that one because
mm
mm
i would do a house like this
mm
mm
well what you've got to do now is think about your own house and in the same way you've just thought about it and say what is there about my house that would attract somebody to try and break into it
and then think how can i stop that from happening
now the burglar UNK probably the biggest thing but we can't all afford the i mean i haven't got one and i'm a crime prevention officer i mean by rights i should have one but i haven't
so it won't suit everybody you might not want in my case i don't particularly want to live with a burglar alarm
er because you have to switch them on and off and all this business
i'm sure i'd change my mind if i was UNK
the very next day i'm sure there'd be er someone round our house putting one up on the wall
s so w if we use the same thing that we've just done on our own house and say how can we stop it from happening might not get a burglar alarm
it might it might be though cutting the hedges back a little bit
it might be doing things at night time leaving the lights on to make it look as though you're in
drawing curtains
if you're away on holiday and can't do that getting a neighbour to do it for you to look after your house shut the curtains at night and opening them during the day
er it might be putting a sign up on the on the fence saying beware of the dog it might be having a UNK drive
er it might be having someone making sure the out of the way to make sure it looks as those there's UNK that there's someone in or out the house
some people even leave UNK on in the house so that there's not only the light on but if somebody does walk up the drive intending to knock on the door to test it before they get to the door they can hear a noise they turn around and go back
it might be having lights on like you mentioned
so when someone walks up with the intention of breaking in a light comes on i mean at one time it's not the same now but at one time when these lights with the UNK first came out nobody actually knew whether they were switched on or not
people had gone up to a house and been knocking on the door waiting for someone to come because the light had come on and they thought there must be somebody in because they switched the light on when they saw me come up the drive and these are visitors
so it might put might have put some UNK off that's not the same case nowadays cos they're so common
but the thing is if you're walking up er the UNK of a house you don't want to be caught and you don't want to be seen and you think you're under cover of darkness and then the big UNK comes on puts you in a UNK next door
so we're all we're all thinking very well as criminals
er it's just a matter of UNK it round now and thinking about your own home and i like you mentioned it's not if you are in you're still likely to be well not likely you still could be er targeted and the burglar who just opens a door and reaches in and takes
mm
something
yeah
so it's important to keep doors locked
the only thing you haven't mentioned is locks on doors yet
mm
er and i'll just run through this for about five minutes and then any questions and we'll go
but if you c if there's a burglar who got to the house
you've selected your house and everything's okay
how would you break in
what's the best way in
door
window
glass cutter
you use a glass cutter
nine times nine times out of ten the er door the back door or the front door has got a great big UNK of glass on top of it
yeah
is the top i mean i broke had to get in my own house when i locked myself out once when i'd been in the garden and i just got in by leaning through the top window and opening the bottom window so now i always lock the bottom windows i don't bother UNK the top one i open it
so you've got locks for the windows
so i lock the bottom window
yeah
so that if even if they reach through they're going to have to break the lock just to get in
so if you were a criminal then you would look for an open window to reach through t to open another window
to reach in yes i wouldn't i couldn't
yeah
do it
i
you'd use a glass cutter in the door
mm
or a window would you use it on
pardon
would you use a glass cutter in a window
or just a door
yes if necessary yes
it's a er it's a means of getting in isn't it
why would use a glass cutter and not just smash the window
well it so much noise doesn't it
noise
i'm not
just scratch
yes
all you want to do is all you wanted to do just strike it in middle of glass go round it just
i lived in my house for going on for a year
before i realized that all you had to do was put your hand through my letter box reach up and you could take open the UNK lock because i'd been there a year i locked myself out and i thought the only thing i can do is try and get in by putting my hand through
it was as easy as anything and for a long time i felt well at least i can get in that way and then i thought oh maybe i should you know doing anything about it but now i always go out of the other door
yeah
and bolt that one because i don't want anybody to be there when i get back
i don't mind if they've been but if they're waiting or
it's funny because we were having this conversation before we came in weren't we
yeah
er someone tells him that a policeman tells him the best way to look at it is if you were locked out your house
yeah
y your UNK in the inside how would you get in
yeah i mean
you're not supposed to leave your key in anyway
well no but er i think we're we've all got an idea how we'd get into our own house if we were locked out
mm
well i haven't really because i've got double glazing
yeah
well i couldn't get in my house cos i'd have to undo
you could really get in most houses if you really wanted
if i locked my door at night i was to take the key out never leave the key in
never leave the key in
mine's got
mine's locked and i've got a chain on as well
mine's
right
my wife will er at night time she locks all the doors she takes all keys out
yeah you're supposed to do it
she takes all key out
piece of paper shove a key out pull it out
that's it
i've still i've actually
something that's even more stupid than that
i've got two back doors there's a storm porch and the door to the house and they're both locked and UNK
i've even got five lever UNK locks
yeah
we've got two dogs we've got double glazing and the front UNK got a five lever UNK lock
yeah
and we've got no hedge on
we've got out back it's all sheltered next UNK got more for years to put them down the front my wife won't let me for the same reason she says if you blind yourself then any bugger can come in
yeah
but our front door is never locked
there you are
we go to bed and i say you locked the front door
mm
could
but i don't think they'll get in as i say there's two dogs
i'm always first in bed at night
all those windows
can i
twenty minutes later she
a lot of people point in it's quite important that you made when you said using glass cutter erm and you said about reaching through open windows
and i asked why wouldn't you break a window and you said noise
is there any other reason you can think of why somebody wouldn't break a window
why you wouldn't break a
why you wouldn't break a window to break a window why you'd go to the trouble of using a glass cutter
if you broke a window you could cut yourself
yeah that's about it really
in my experience and er it's backed up by research a burglar will only break glass if it if they can reach through to open a window in much the same way that
mm
you would look for an open window
mm
er they don't particularly like to make a noise but some do if it's quick
if someone has to break a window and knock out all the glass it makes even more noise
i mean it's falling on the floor
erm so if they do something with windows that makes them actually the open way they can break in is to break all the glass out and the way you would do that is to fit a window lock
so even if they made a little if they've got the glass cutter made a little round hole then reached still couldn't get the window open they'd be forced to break the whole lot and make more noise
er they can be quite effective
it's only a little thing putting window locks on you wouldn't buy a house now without a lock on the door but a lot of people still buy houses without locks on the windows
i'm afraid that you know those days are limited
eventually we'll all have locks on windows
fully insured are you
for burglary if you haven't got locks on
well
your windows
with certain of the insurance companies that's true yeah er it's always worth checking
i've got to mention insurance cos now you're in the neighbourhood watch you get a discount on your house contents
so next time your insurance is due tell them that you're in the neighbourhood
mm
watch
yeah
any sort of final comments anyone
er i don't think after going through everything we've said i think we've all got the sort of ideas that we could all make good criminals
er we know what to do
if we know what to do we can all look at our own houses and decide how we can alter them in not too expensive ways to make it a bit harder for the criminal
erm and r really that's all crime UNK about
it's all about looking after your house is about using the neighbours using the knowledge you've got to make it more difficult
any
when this was first suggested erm was couple of questions came back and UNK and i spoke about it was the fact that w are there or would there be any UNK for people who kind of belong to any neighbourhood watch like a brick through a window or because anybody who saw erm that programme on television
a fortnight esther UNK
and neighbourhood watch was mentioned
was that was a in the front garden
was that
i only came into the room and i switched it on and i there were quite a lot of UNK with people who
yeah it were UNK was it manchester
i don't know i just watched a clip
and she said you're nothing but a load of old UNK and how dare you and oh the language
because
yeah
these people actually set up a neighbourhood watch and you know any reason
well you shouldn't get that where we are
it wasn't
everybody was in agree i mean all them were all in agreement
yeah it wasn't a very good part
everybody agreed
of manchester it was
yeah
an awful part of manchester
erm
yeah it's it certainly is an
issue that would er worry a lot of people in a
yeah
inner city
next door
exactly that's
er which is better place big window
as far as i can see
not in the big window
no
why
sign their names and
mm
everything
yeah
there'll be no
having said next
it's a deterrent
ignore it they think it that it's just they
yeah
ignore it don't they
they don't do anything
yes especially cos you don't know what it's for half the bloody time she doesn't know where she is
she UNK you whatever
right erm
she just
well that makes
can i can i sort wind
i've given you these
yeah
green books
er they go into crime prevention in a fairly big way
have a read through them at your leisure
er the blue book is just a guide for yourselves as cos neighbourhood watch members
and stickers are for the windows
do take some more for your neighbours people who couldn't be here today
er distribute them round
the thing about the neighbourhood watch is that everyone in the area is a member whether they really want to be one or not to be honest
er just living in it
makes them a member
i mean there's no there's no fee or anything like that involved so the fact that you're all seen as members will cut down on any UNK you might have
i don't think that's a real threat in UNK to be honest
the worst we've had UNK wise with neighbourhood watch schemes is some people bend the signs and spray paint them but i think you could live with that
er but i don't think that'll happen in UNK
you never know some somebody walking home from the pub one night with a bit too much too much to drink might just bend the sign
but that happens to all street signs
mm
mm
occasionally
it's just that it does som sometimes seem
temptation
right erm i do wish you well with your scheme
thank you
er you've got a lot of work to do if this is got here tonight er just s spread the word tell them it's not as bad as they probably think it is there's no UNK needed or anything like that
and er i'd like to sort of thank jan on your behalf and all the other people for taking the trouble to organize this scheme and get things rolling because it will be a little financial benefit to you when you renew your insurance so thanks for that jan
and er unless there's any last questions i think that's about it
no i want to get back to see the sheep at nine o'clock
thanks ever so much for coming in
that's alright i've en i've enjoyed
i'm just sorry that a few more people
didn't turn at least there's more
yeah
than two
to be to be honest i it's been the presentation i've given tonight has been slightly different it's the first time i tried it and it was really successful
mm
i don't know how you felt about it
do that with two hundred people
no
in the
no
er it has to be a small group
er
it's not the fact we live on a council estate more likely to have
no it's not fact that normal go up the private estates this is probably your first time on a council estate the bloody hell it's come from
i know
actually i checked out all about
who was walking down to the telephone UNK and asked all the questions about the area so that i
well
you know
anyway that
yeah they are
yeah
i was in the lion fortnight ago sunday UNK and lads had been on this er bike ride you know for some children
mm
they parked their two UNK outside the round door over at the lion came in one ordered two drinks and he said i'll just nip across to phone
alright come back and the had gone
aren't they
i mean there's a shop
just here UNK erm does agricultural machinery and repairs and that
he gets broken into regular
mm
yeah gets broken into regular cigarettes and UNK
well when i was here they were dealing with somebody er for stealing salmon out of
yeah the co op
co op
yeah
and that was a real
oh it happens regular down this
oh well that's because nobody takes any notice about
that was that was a real big job the salmon thefts it were
quite funny they were going in all sorts of shops just stealing salmon
yeah
that's all they UNK
the UNK were expensive i didn't realize how expensive it was
wee you see that they lost a lot of
yeah well this before
big display up of salmon you know he took
allowed to take as much as you can
i dunno really
erm saw doctor last week
see if he's written i doubt if he's dropped a line
to me
er seventeenth of june so that's not last week's is it
no
he said you were going to change me on the medication
right well so he's done that has he
well i UNK i imagine so yeah
i don't know what to though
have you haven't got them with you
afraid i don't
oh that's a shame
he
oh he hasn't given you anything
no
he's letting me do that is he
yeah
oh well
well the letter will arrive very shortly so i'd be quite happy to do that without necessarily seeing you
so er we can write his initials is changing medication
see me in three month time
right did he mention anything else like UNK or
er he mentioned going to leicester
yeah well that'll be the what that's for yeah
ooh i suppose i it it's going to depend on how you respond to the change of medication
yeah
but i don't know what it is yet so er
neither do i
i just have to wait for his letter but i think the sensible thing to do would be to talk to you about what he's putting you on because a lot of these drugs are not without potential side effects
that's right
so that's something we will need to talk to you about before we just give you a prescription willy UNK
yeah
so now that's okay
now i don't think er the other lot have seen you have they
over the past week or so
no
no that's okay
the UNK i think is still are you about three a day
yeah
yeah
now and you've just had another prescription for that haven't you
yeah
yeah
i mean you may find it's not very easy to cut it down further until
i must admit i've been taking
yeah
more
yeah
because i have had a lot of hassle
yeah
with carol and
yeah
well i don't mind that i mean i the er the overall amount is still much lower than you were
yeah
and you are allowed to take the occasional extra if it is only the occasional extra
it is yeah
i'm quite happy with that
i really don't mind
i still want to have the UNK trend but i suspect until this is sorted out we're not going to get you off it altogether
and er and it is your chest is potentially the more serious one of the two anyway so
i went away for about five days six
mhm
days
i went to the norfolk UNK and erm i think it was saturday morning we went to have a look at a flat
mhm
and it were like i don't know what had happened but
mm
i didn't feel very well
no
and something like hit me from the inside
mm
and my mate was behind me and he's a he's a big lad and he just caught me
mm
and i'd gone
mm
how long did it take you for to come round
five or ten minutes
yeah
how did you feel when you came round
well i went to bed at er ten o'clock in the morning and i woke up at ten o'clock at night
mm
i mean it sounds more like a faint rather than anything with your
that's right
heart but er let me just check your blood pressure this morning
cos that has been a bit up and down
could you just turn thanks
it'll squeeze a bit
mm
mm
once again it's quite low an and er certainly if it UNK much below where it is you certainly can feel UNK and faint and of course the medication doesn't actually help that which is one of the reasons why we need to
i feel so
yeah
UNK
yeah
and
well some of that could be the tablets you're on
unfortunately i'm not quite sure what he's suggesting we put you on
well i brought all the tablets along
yeah let's see
yeah
er
i know it's quite a lot
there really are a lot here aren't there
er there's the er
chemical
well the yeah
well the UNK and the g the UNK is essential and you've got to carry on taking that
and i do take
the g t n you only take if and when they're necessary okay
the UNK you're already cutting down we know all about that
the UNK er won't affect your blood pressure and you really need to stay on that as maintenance cos there's a
i don't think i've got any of them left
oh no they've just run out yeah
i think you really should stay on those
if you stop them you'll be fine initially but there's a fair chance you could actually get a lot worse without them
that's the catch they won't affect your heart your blood pressure or anything else
from that point of view you're fi that's fine
but they certainly will help you sleep
mm
let's put you back on those
and the erm ni the UNK and the er UNK i expect are the ones he's going to change though the problem is exactly what to
yeah
i think i think we have to wait for the letter i suspect you'll probably find both those changed to some extent after that so er i think we really have to wait for that
seven ninety three
okay that's UNK i think the answer to your question can you get rid of them
yes i'd love to get rid of a lot of them but i'm yo you have got two ongoing problems both of which need to be treated so i think to start er cutting things out could make you a lot worse
whereabouts was this flat
norfolk UNK
ooh whereabouts
er UNK
very nice
yeah
very nice indeed
it's a different sort of life out there to some extent
twenty five pound
UNK
absolute
mm
do you think you'll go
er i've got negative
equity in
no
oh i see
so if i haven't i'm going
yeah
mm
it's a lovely place of the world to live
yeah
i've actually been down to norfolk this weekend so
you have
yeah
UNK which is near norwich we've got some friends living but er
yeah
i worked in norwich for a year and a half so i actually know it
and my work wife worked there even longer so we know the are area quite well
oh it's lovely
it is very nice
mm
i stay at my
mm
er we went to er the coast what's it called
mm
two miles away
yeah that's lovely
and magic
very relaxing
yeah
that's what you need every now and again
and i was i wa actually going to live down there
mm
sell the house or whatever but er there's this pal of mine and er he's going on for ten years
oh it happens it happens
that's UNK that up
right well see how things go what i would do is enquire in about a week whether that letter has come back and then we can arrange to see you
so i think we ought to have a chat about the sort of things he's putting you on and then what side effects or anything you might get from those but
yeah
we'll have to see
fine idea but
okay
okay
take care bye then
can we start off with your name
it's william isn't it

it er he UNK the he the UNK into the tail of the leading horse and he took them down the road in a string like a train
and i remember him once leaving up there with eleven
was that one of the main reasons that they started coming here for the horses
well no they came here before that
you see they used to come around and they er the UNK ones used to sell baskets and basket chairs and a lot of kind of er stuff made with and then
that they made themselves
that's right
and then there was another lot came
they were UNK
and who were they
now wait a minute

this one
have you ever seen UNK like that round about here
well i'm telling you they stuck it they had a sort of flat UNK cart and they used to stick it in and when they came there they lifted it off and stuck it in the ground and it was just similar to that only it was UNK
aha
like that
aha

mm
but of course the motor car all i'm describing what it was like in the horse days
aha
and th this er harry he came from the area er he always he was a great basket maker

oh yes very friendly no bother
no bother at all except
what
except there was one er that fell out with my father once erm jackie
mhm
that's the only one that ever i remembered but they were all and they you know they used to UNK their horses up there in that field up at the top and this billy that used to go round all the district and buy up all these old cast horses and bring them up there until he had a consignment gathered up
and they used to go to belgium they er walked them through to get a boat at newcastle and they used to got to belgium for
to sell the horses
horse meat
mhm oh i see he sold them and them they were shipped across

did they ever go for wool from the sheep
oh yes oh there aye there was ah but these this lot that i'm telling you about they were more or less traders
aha
but they used to get the odd ones that used to come and gather s what we call UNK again that was the dirty wool off the UNK pin sounds like that
and they would wash it and then sell it
aye that's right
and then they used to get they used to be in jackie he always gathered bags and
what type of bags
oh any type of bag
and he used to wash them all and er you know the manure UNK came in UNK bags then
mhm
and er he used to he had a contract with some big potato firm and he used to buy all the UNK bags in the locality and he used to bring them there to the end of the road and he used to wash them in the burn
and he got a good price for them with them being washed for to put potatoes in
he went to america in fact his widow was over it'll be about two years ago and she came and seen us and she remembered er me as a she was eighty six
i think it's eighty six and er she remembered me as a as a as a little boy when jackie used to wash his bags down here
she remembered me coming down to the burn and UNK the bags in the help to wash them
could you pass over the book again please
at the back it's got er you know a UNK of
oh yes
have you heard any of these words being used for the side of things by the tinkers
UNK
aye
aye i've heard that
it's just that some of these words say they might have used them i mean i've done the and the ones but i've never come upon anyone that's heard of the UNK
er
and maybe the way they said it
aye gr well i've heard of the a UNK that's what they used call ham
UNK
ah bit of i've had a bit of UNK
what like they call the ones call a pig a UNK
a UNK aye well they call it a UNK here er you see you see this apron
aha
well they used to call it a UNK
did they
aye
ah the professor here's from er the UNK university studied all the UNK in great britain
did they
and they discovered that the most UNK dialect in britain was in UNK
and they sent
that's right
and they sent a professor over here to study it
aha
and he was here
when the true UNK er way of speaking
that's correct
i mean they have words that UNK
aye
are very old shoes apparently
aye
it was we call them UNK
UNK aye
no but erm he says to me he says have you any expressions that you think's very UNK
and i says yes i says i've dozens of them
and er he says what is it
i says well i says i was reading a book and an old UNK that lived up at and she was about ninety six and this chap that was interviewing her well he wouldn't be interviewing her but he said she sat by the fire and she UNK and UNK until she nearly UNK
that's marvellous
and er of course another a another er expression was the wee UNK come UNK down the street
you UNK what was the

and a there used to be an old UNK wife old mary
she come here she used to come here with her man you ken they were tramps but er she was a great one she used to she belonged to the west UNK and she was a great one for quoting the kind of
UNK
UNK
yeah
but to be quite UNK as i've said to the boys when i'm away all this is lost
what i what i li what i what i knew about tinkers and that cos there's nobody there's nobody has any experience of what it was like
there's very few folk left that can remember the who the tinkers used to come up there and
it won't be lost now
oh well i hope not
because all my tapes go into the UNK of the department of scottish studies at
oh yes
edinburgh university they'll take copies of them and keep them there for ever as a sort of reference museum
i've got it aye
so you're on there
er you see when i was this would just be at the start of the first world war oh damn i haven't put a switch in have i
no it's alright
and er i remember they use to bring UNK with them and have cock UNK
i've heard about a UNK but you're talking about the hens UNK
ah no domestic a UNK domestic bird what they call game fighting game
and i remember when i was a UNK er being up there and they had they always had a box in the back of their caravan where they kept two or three hens and er they used to have this game bird
it was a what they call the fighting game or something to that effect and er the i remember once i he seeing them having a cock fight
oh boy it was great
were they putting money on it
oh now i don't know whether i wasn't to th er remember whether they UNK on it or not but
mhm
i remember them once having a cock fight
and this was where just in the
just over the no at
the top of the hill
aye
you come over the hill
that's right
aye
well you know where the th there's an old road goes up this way
aha
and over by the quarry
yeah
well there used to be a house there
aha and it's UNK there's no UNK it's just

that's right well that's where it and they drew up that old road with their UNK you see
oh i see
and they just put them they just stayed there

UNK skins
aye
this is about nineteen eighteen
yeah aye just after the first world war
aye
aha
and that's when you see during i can just remember previous to the war them coming there and then of course during the war there was very few of them on the road then and then after the war they started to come back and that's when this billy and harry and that came up from the side
after the end of the first world war and when the motor car came in did they still come along on horses
oh yes aye for a year or two but then you see they all got into kind of motor cars
what when would have that can you remember
oh that would be about the nineteen thirties
and they had cars at that time
aye
beginning of the nineteen thirties
cos at that time only sort of wealthy people might have had cars is that
oh still i remember that jackie er he bought an old car in and er for scrap like and he brought it up and he broke it up there and it was a and it was made in this car
and i remember this jackie and it had a most peculiar starting mechanism ever i've seen
mm
there was like a UNK in the UNK and you pulled a lever like that and it there wasn't a connection on to the like on to the UNK with a starting handle this thing was on the UNK and it was like a lever
aha
and it and it pulled it over and UNK it
it's only time ever i've seen that
amazing
what were some of the UNK you were gonna tell me about what you'd heard
oh well as i er as i was saying about th this aunt that stayed with me er she once er saw a well i don't know whether she actually seen it or not but she'd seen the results of it of a UNK divorce and this man killed this horse and threw his wife on top of it and that was him divorced

and that wasn't regular i mean they weren't fighting
on no oh no oh they were very UNK you ken never UNK with nobody or nothing and the funny thing you know they all get blamed for UNK and that but that was one thing they may UNK but never here
mhm
if they wanted to UNK they went away somewhere else
excuse me but did
no they never UNK locally
mhm
if they wanted to UNK they went away

and i says why
and he says you know he says if you die tomorrow he says they'll clean the boys out in death duties
so says aye it's time i was getting something done
so i just it used to be you see that it used to be w g and sons
mhm
that's when we all got together
aha
but then you see i put UNK out on his own and john out on his own and the
aha
so you see i'm only left with the
but i was gonna tell you about there was one day i was at for money and i'm coming up the road and here this chap was standing in the road and er kind of UNK a lift so i says to him i stopped and i often lift people in the road but er after he got into the i had an old bradford van at the time and he said er i said to him i says are you on a UNK holiday
oh no he says er he says i'm not on a UNK holiday he says er i'm just back from UNK
he says i'm an UNK
mm
you see and i says oh man that's exactly the very man i want to get into contact with
so of course i told him about you see we we'd UNK the level of the loch at the took four feet of it you see and it revealed this thing in the loch
so everybody was telling me about this so i went away over and had a look at it
and i said my god i says this is something very ancient
and i says it's an old lake dwelling and er of course i mentioned it to this chap just switch it off the now
the oldest plough in europe was found
the oldest plough in europe
let me see ah this is it
here it is right enough
aye this is this is it
and you see your thanks are due to a mr william
ah did you get a mention
the proceedings of the society of UNK
UNK
nineteen fifty two to fifty three
that's right
page one three four
i'll have a look at that then in er one of the libraries
aye and er you see i used to go over i used to go over on a sunday when they came if you on the er well you see as i told you this chap here
that you picked up
aye i picked up wait a minute
right
ah here he is
mr david
UNK college cambridge now that's the chap i lifted
when you were
for a lift giving a lift on the road
he was going to he was going to ireland to some UNK there
mm
and er i picked him i picked him up in the road and you see i just told him i says oh i says you're the very man i'm looking for
he's the last person you'd be thinking you'd be picking up
aye
excuse me
and he and he
and of course he was fair amazed
oh he must have been
and he says oh he says you know it you see we had some old boards that we took out and could walk across onto it
and er he says er he got a got him across onto it and he never spoke and he walked round about it about three or four times and he s turned around to me and says well
he says here's something he says we we've been looking for years and here's me UNK on it accidentally
he says i'll have to let professor know
aha
well that was on a tuesday i believe the UNK on the desk there
and er i had a letter back on the friday from stuart to say er according to mr 's description it was very interesting and could i possibly meet him at station on the saturday morning
so of course i went away down to the station and the folk came off the edinburgh train and that and this gentleman and lady were left and of course i approached them i says by any chance i says are you professor
he says oh yes you'll be mr
i says i am
and er he says er he says you know i'll have to get somewhere to stay is there anywhere where i could stay
oh says i aye i says you could stay in the village
i says they have a hotel there so i brought them up to the hotel and took them he went in and he made arrangements to stay there and then i took them over and let them see this lake dwell this UNK as they call it
and then they sent their students down from edinburgh university
to
to UNK it
no they were there for oh maybe eight or ten weekends UNK
where did they stay
well some of them stayed in and this UNK got the a bit of the worse for the wear aye here it is you see
of course this was all photographed at the time and they found the oldest plough in europe
what shall i do with you then
well i do you mean for me
yeah
well i i've come for b blood pressure
those
right let's have a look oh yes
that's right
tablets you gave me
that's right
i don't want to see any more of them
oh dear i'm sorry to hear that
after a fortnight i couldn't walk up the street without stopping for a UNK
they made you short of breath
ooh terrible
right okay
oh dear
and er i couldn't i mean i do a lot of gardening there were n no problems at all so i took them t well you can see what's left
so you've stopped them
i took thirteen and i've got some of me old UNK so went back on to them
i think that was entirely the right thing to do entirely the right thing to do
well i'm sorry about that
every time i sat down i went to sleep
oh well that's no good then is it
and er no
okay let me check what it is today
it i mean it has been going up rather high this has been
yeah
a problem of course
let
yeah
me see what it is and there's a chance it's actually down
yeah
because of the UNK but er
but it's two
let's have a look
weeks since i took any of those
well it's certainly right that you ought to stop anything that makes you feel worse
and
yeah
it's er
no pain at all
no
but you know walking i've had to stop twice
well that's no use is it
that's what
no apparent reason
okay this'll squeeze your arm a bit
any UNK swelling or UNK
no i've nothing any UNK nothing i feel as fit as i did twenty years ago
i've got two great i do i'm always cycling i never very seldom ride anyway on buses and i ain't got no car no car
and i feel as tip top i can eat i've no UNK trouble or nothing
yeah
i can sleep eat
good
your blood pressure is still up
yeah
a bit
yeah
it's not up an awful lot but it is still up a bit
and i'm sure it'd be well worth er getting this down no
dies are you back on UNK doing the trick
well i've been taking them yeah
what i what i suggest we do is we take this opportunity of having to review to sort of have a complete overview and actually do run a few er routine blood tests at this stage as well
okay
i would erm suggest what we do is we stop the UNK and put in something else you know just to keep you on i don't really want to have you on a combination of lots
no
of drugs
no
i'd rather just have you on one preparation and then we see what happens
now the question is what is erm going to be the most suitable for you
hmm
i think what we'll do is try this which is called UNK there you go that's an instantly UNK name for you
yeah
mm
okay but it does have the advantage in it it's a has it's a very clean drug
yeah
it's a very clean so side effects are very rare that's right now we i'm going to give you two sizes cos you need to start on the lower dose first
yeah
and what i would do have you had your UNK today
yes
okay doesn't matter your blood UNK still up
what i should do is take the first one tonight
yes
because what new drugs can do is they can put your blood pressure down quite quickly
which means if you're standing up you
yeah
can get rather faint and UNK
yeah
so if you take the first one immediately before you go to bed if your blood pressure does go down rather a lot it doesn't matter cos you're lying down you'll
yeah
be fine
and if you're okay you can carry on taking one in the morning
one in the morning
okay
and the seven days at the low dose and then i'd like you to go onto the slightly higher dose which is still a low dose
yeah
for the rest of the time
and then we can UNK check your blood pressure back
so
if that's okay that's what we'll do
yeah
stop the UNK
yes
take these back to the chemist
yes
and if you can see our practice nurse in a few weeks
yes
okay and then see me in about five weeks
right okay
something like that
then we can
how will
have a look at the blood tests
yeah
i'll write down what i want her to do
mm
we can have a look at the blood tests we can see what the blood pressure is
if you have any side effects from the new ones then you should come back straight
yes
away
right
okay
yeah
but i think i'd be very surprised if you do so
shall i know which is which in the tablets
yes they'll be clearly labelled
yeah
mhm
and i think i'll ask her to do an electrical UNK of your heart just for UNK as well
yeah
i think
okay
now then it's isn't it
that's right yeah
well i've been on them UNK for six year now
yeah i know but your blood pr i mean they did d they were doing you very well but blood pressure does tend to rise as you get older
yeah
and i think that's what
probably if it hadn't have been for sister helen and i would have never have been able to b catch the at all because i never came to see a doctor
you d then we we'd have er we'd have
UNK you by now don't worry
you think so
oh yes
ah
i'm saying years ago my old dad he were eighty nine and he never had a blood test in his life
well
pressure or anything
if you go back even
you think i could have some of that i pu i m UNK or something for dry eyes
i have got it on the prescription i had to get it doctor sent me to the hospital
yeah
and there's nothing wrong with my eyes at all they said dry
ju dry yeah i'll put one of those on for you
cos they're a bit UNK at night
yeah okay
if you only go back ten fifteen years it wasn't realized fully how many problems are out there
yeah
that don't cause people any symptoms until something happens and it's too late
that's right yeah
er that's becoming more recognized which is why we do more routine things on people who appear fa yeah it
yeah that's right
so as you say years at i'm
no i mean
so ill because i couldn't afford it
no
but i
well sometimes we UNK i think but anyway
so there's two sixes
yeah
the little ones there's only seven of and that's
yes
one a day
yes
and i said if you take the first dose tonight
yes
i j write that the first dose tonight
tonight yeah
and then
if i take if i take one at night
after that it's
have i to take another one in the morning
if you're okay yes yeah
and if you feel completely weak and UNK
yes
then we better see you before you have any more
that
has never happened to me yet first dose problems
no
but it's something to be slightly aware of so
and if i can see if you say you've had the blood test done in around i dunno two weeks at your convenience and then if you see me in about five which will be at the end of those which
so arrangements to have a blood test then
mm
in about a fortnight
please yes
yeah
okey doke
these the chemist can have these back
yes please he can then dispose of them
i'm sorry about that but er is this yours
well i wondered
yes i
yes don't forget that
i wondered what was going on really because i mean it just at least i can take them
yeah
it's
got the wife worried
it's not a common it isn't a common problem at all that
no
okay
yes
okay would you like to start then
right has everyone had a chance to look at some stuff since last time
much
okay sally ann have you had a chance to look at some of the things which we're gonna do today as well
i haven't had a look at any books at all but erm i was worried about
okay so do you want to run us through some of the things that we haven't really discussed in detail of what we're gonna talk about in here today specifically have we i mean i thought something along the lines of er the nature and extent of sexual variations in english or any other language you want
so in what way can it differ men and women differ in conversation and you can make it specific you can just discuss it and make very specific interruptions or turn taking if you want
on the other hand you could talk about things in general what the different aspects in the speech are
being in other languages as well
is this
yeah i mean okay cover the languages to show how they did it properly so if there is something else you want to bring in then that would be good
but i suppose it would mainly worthwhile concentrating on english because that's where most of the UNK from
er i've got some notes here which i can go through wouldn't actually be necessary but when sally UNK going through her notes if anyone else would like raise anything which backs it up or UNK with it or whatever then you know please you know UNK in and say whatever think might be relevant at the time
have you stopped the erm the
the don't before easter though
what
i'm not quite sure when the official handing in date for this essay is because of the fact that some essays have UNK from last term
i suppose that really probably is friday week three but i don't suppose it has to be
which reminds me
have i got your last essay in yet or not
i'm a little bit confused there and i can't get it out
okay
honest
okay
well like i say i'll mark the rest of them when i've got them all in
i can't really mark then till i don i don't want to mark them until i've got them all in cos otherwise it's not really fair so hopefully next week sometime
i this morning i've been running around and i can't get it out
what is it on wordperfect
hm
i keep getting and things like that
oh maybe could go to the advisory after i think they're open till five
mm
if you go there afterwards and what they say
er right okay then
right erm these notes are sort of based on a lecture that i went to when i was in sixth form erm and the theme for it is men and women do we speak the same language
erm so first of all sounds and pronunciation
er men tend to have a lower pitch on the whole erm th they're louder and UNK due to their physiological differences erm UNK once said that men try to talk bigger than they are whereas women talk as though they're smaller
erm it's been shown that women UNK for a UNK and sort of go more towards the
erm some women tend to have more pitch variation and they're more emotional so they're more likely to use encouraging UNK er which can sometimes be seen to be slightly UNK whereas boys think it's UNK to be emotional or UNK way so that if you're in school and you're asking people to read out in class erm a girl would be more likely to be more UNK whereas a boy would be a little bit more UNK and just sort of read it out and not put any emotion into it
and go to words of meaning erm and the descriptions of colours where men are more likely to say purple whereas women would describe it as UNK or UNK and go into more detail about the UNK than the colour
then erm names babies i if a baby's UNK timothy er it gets called UNK or nicholas gets called UNK which sort of ties in with the biscuits being called UNK and UNK and UNK and all this sort of ee things that you say to babies
but as soon as the n the kid UNK hits teenage years then he wants to be called nick whereas if the girl's been UNK and she's called UNK through her childhood when she hits teens she's still called UNK
so girls don't seem to mind the ee thing whereas the boys do
erm also if you look at entertainment like james UNK calls himself jimmy UNK is terry UNK so but then you look at people like charlie UNK when he was doing his UNK role he was c he called himself charlie UNK and when he's directing films he called himself charles UNK so maybe it's all like a bit of a serious thing
so maybe that implies that when do the kids have got that ee ending
then we go to the taboo language and if you talk about when you go to the toilet if you everybody excuses themselves to leave and that's both men and women and then somehow you have to say where you're going so the women are more likely to use the polite sort of UNK kinds of things like they'd say toilet or loo whereas the men are more likely to say UNK
and they actually say what they do when they get there
oh younger men are more likely to use UNK and be more explicit erm although they wouldn't use those sort terms to their father or elder men and the women are more likely to use UNK like spend a penny powder your nose and things like that
and then we go to grammar
women tend to use more standard forms er and men are more likely to use regional dialect forms
so that shows women are more status conscious and men are more maybe could be more concerned with their macho image and they associate the non standard with macho image
erm there is a study where they looked into erm men in the workforce and women and in the workforce and er if men worked together in factories it sort of UNK their speech patterns their UNK are UNK their speech pattern so they're more likely to use non standard
and then there was a study into and area of belfast where most of the men were unemployed and it was the women who were going out to work in the factory and it was found to be the other way round and the women spoke more of a non standard than the men did when the men were staying at home
it was the women going out to work
then we get use and interaction
women tend to use more questions which sort of UNK the effect of what they're saying so they'll say things like there we go and the men say things like let's go
erm women are more likely to use the words such as may might possibly perhaps which seem to be a little less UNK
in turn taking men have be shown to interrupt women more than they interrupt other men er and then there's the use of mm
erm it's been shown that men seem to er connect the word mm with i agree that's what they use it to mean whereas the women tend to use mm as i understand
erm so where do these differences come from
they come from the way UNK children er during the early school years boys and girls tend to have different activity the boys in the groups are in groups UNK and the girls and in UNK and UNK and they're sharing their little secrets and being loyal to each other and UNK away in little corners
so that women aren't taken seriously
so do we speak the same language
yes but with differences and we don't always the same message
and that's that
okay right
has anyone got any other things to add to that
no
there was a when we were talking about erm how er women sit there and UNK it's sort of trivial
said to be trivial erm which meant it isn't erm book says that erm cos women talk about things like erm children and husband and things
mhm
whereas men talk about cars and stuff like that
and that's it's not true at all it's just different it considered
right and we've got part of this linked in with the stuff you might have done on UNK hypothesis in the sense that er people talk about different things because they might be relevant to their actual lives
er and of course if you're in one group you might think that something's trivial and you might UNK another a group for talking about those things when in fact that group sees it as an important talk about it might see the thing that the other group hold dear to talk about as something trivial and to UNK
so yeah i mean that's definitely something that comes into it
erm what sort of d differences are there in UNK styles
i mean it's a thing you might want to talk think about or you night have read about things like UNK and er interruptions and UNK
and how erm men tend to ignore them they're like they're not interested and not going to pay any attention
right do you want to explain that a bit more about
well things that they the actually say anything which is sort of a sign that you listening understanding but if they delay it it's say it 's the women that UNK wanting some sort of suddenly realizes
right
that women uses use minimal responses anyway then you know like all males speak a male didn't use minimal responses
so it wouldn't be that they interruptions listening necessarily it would just be that wouldn't expect to have to
yeah right yeah
women use women use UNK minimal
responses but when men use them it quite often delay
i mean one thing that's mentioned before is about tag questions which is where you put on question to the end of your sentence as in oh don't you agree or isn't it or you know you know the sort of thing i mean
er now i mean one thing that a lot of the literature says is that this might indicate a power and another thing that the literature says
is that it tends to be women who do more of it
it does and say that erm you say that
okay
but i can't remember
this is one of the things that some studies have shown it to be the case other studies haven't
one thing that might be relevant to this is the fact that er one study came up with two different types of tag question they call the two different UNK tag question UNK tags and effective tags
now UNK tag is one for seeking agreement whereas an effective tag is one that shows concern to the UNK and according to this study if you looked and the sheer number of tags women did use more tags than men but in actual fact women used a higher proportion of the effective tags than men did
women used seventy five percent effective tags and twenty five percent UNK tags so in general their tags were to show concern rather than to actual seek agreement so it wasn't showing a lack of power according to this study
whereas the men had sixty percent effective tags and forty percent UNK which is still the same direction but to a lesser extent
which shows that perhaps a UNK in this situation perhaps the men are seeking agreement rather than the women are because the women seem to be doing it to actually show concern rather than to seek agreement which doesn't turns a lot of the traditional thing about tag questions on it head
pointed out how tag questions there's only certain structures you can put them in that were going to direct it rather than proper questions say someone who's asking all proper questions is he going to use as many tag questions anyway
mhm
and that sort of the
that's something else which you might find a lot of the time in er literature about interaction with children you might find that er where parents are asking their children to do something like if they're playing a game you might find some you'll find that mothers and fathers talk differently to sons and daughters er so you start off with a direct ac action like put that one there if they're playing UNK or something straight UNK put that on there down to er wouldn't it be a good idea to put that on there down to could you put that on there or let's put it on there
and you find more or more or less UNK ways of giving directives and one way of making some things perhaps a bit less UNK is to put a tag question on cos it's sort of adding a sort of pleading note on to it to ask somebody to do it i think
has anyone read anything about turn taking in conversation
yes
and how that works
sort of there's a model a UNK model and if it if it's if it's conversation is following a model then it's it means that it's running UNK
mhm
and you erm you know your next big and the mean a signals as to whether or not it sort of the UNK being offered
mhm
and you've just go to generally in single sex conversation it follows the model
quite often erm when it's men and women speaking the men will interrupt a little more erm which makes the women fall silent
whereas women hardly ever UNK
mhm okay
so in the two things that can happen in conversation to give it to make it stop running UNK are UNK and UNK and like some of them are quite difficult to tell apart but usually it's if you're UNK stuff it's fairly obvious
what's can you remember what the point in a conversation is where a speaker has a chance to become a new speaker
like it's
t r p
transition relevance point
yeah that's the thing i was thinking of the t r p like you say the transition relevance point
i mean that is like a point in the conversation where a change in turn taking could ha potentially happen
now when you get to a t r p what are the three things that can happen
i don't know if any of the li any of the stuff you read mentioned this or not
erm the somebody speaking includes erm address someone to make it really obvious who the next UNK going to be
mhm
or it you leave it open and one of the other speakers in the more than one or more of the other speakers in the conversation could decide to start to talking or no one could erm start talking the present speaker at the moment gets another chance to carry on
okay that's right yeah
okay has anybody else got anything more on that on that subject if we go back for a bit and just go back to the
idea of the theory which is something that probably should have come at the beginning but it doesn't matter too much
and like there are two different sort of schools of thought about men and women's conversation
er one is like the traditional school of though and the other one is like the feminist way of looking at things
er just to run through what the two what the two schools sort of think it will be fair to say that the traditional school thinks as follows
er in terms of syntax and pronunciation women were always thought of as being more careful than men er a lot of UNK in the past considered women to be very conservative in their speech they UNK to them
er men and women were always thought to use different specialist UNK that's something else that was said
er women were also said to be polite UNK and UNK which
what all of those
mhm
polite and UNK
UNK as in when they actually said things they did a lot of talking
i'm not saying this is actually correct but this is the traditional view
okay
except that women were UNK to other speakers they would let they would they were they would allow themselves to be walked over in conversation but at the same time you had this UNK of women who talked too much
i'm not saying that the same person thought of these two things at once but
okay
these are these are things which were all said
er said in an article that women used empty language
that was a phrase he used
so what so traditional schools thought that women did a lot of recognized they thought that women did a lot of talking but that a lot of it wasn't really any use
yeah that was just the ideas it had
whereas men talked more for function
er and then to contrast this you've got like the feminist view er well it's a just UNK a lot of these ideas instead of saying that women's talk was UNK they said it was more UNK and so the idea that quite often a lot of the features that are in this conversation aren't because women want to be UNK to the men they're talking to it's that they actually want to show some consideration to the turn taking or the UNK style that's going on
er in actual fact the speech styles aren't really comparable which is why you sort of get these UNK
er you fi what the feminist the schools says that a lot of languages minimize and UNK interests and achievements of women and UNK them by the way in which they use language and the way in which they talk about things
er and similarly the syntax of languages are often said to be UNK of women a lot of the way that language is structured and a lot of the words that you get in a language that's another thing that's said
there's one quite sort of ground breaking paper that obviously there's a lot in that people don't agree with but it was quite an important paper in terms of er in terms of feminist UNK and feminism in general
it came out o it came out in nineteen seventy five
and that was by a women called robin UNK and she wrote a paper called l language and woman's place
er the things that she said were that women used more hedges such as i think er hedges are sort of things that get put into the conversation if al allegedly if somebody wants to give the impression that they're not quite sure and they wouldn't w you know like i wouldn't want to say it for sure but i think that
er and then similarly to that they er were said to seek agreement by UNK she said they used more questions and more tag questions
she said as you said they s she said they used less UNK and more please and thank UNK
and also as you said the thing with colours they were said to perhaps use less basic colour terms so if some men were shown a UNK green some men would say and some would say whereas a women allegedly would say UNK or whatever
er now a lot of things in UNK paper perhaps people have UNK with since then such as the things about tag questions and hedges erm i mean some studies have said that if you look at the actual UNK of tag questions like we said before the actual function of it
that isn't the case
but still it's an important paper that sort of broke away from a lot of the traditional thinking and led towards a lot more feminist stuff
i mean you c you can't really read wh a book on this list about women's and men s language without finding the reference to UNK in the back somewhere
did she actually do research
er a lot
a lot of hers was UNK yeah er
some students were given shown some s some UNK
mhm
and they had to say which were said by men and which were said by women and erm most of the ones with tag questions were said by women
right
this women says that all
yes i mean in a sense that just sort of shows that a lot of people would agree with UNK in the sense that they think that women use a lot of tag questions and have that speech style erm i mean like we've been able to see and what we can say is that men and women's language is different er and it's even possible to say in what way it's different but the difficulty becomes when we actually want to say why those differences are
i mean some people say it UNK some people say it's UNK so you have to then try and go a bit further beyond the actual differences to find out what the reasons behind them are
you also find different cultures have different ways of having men and women's language
er some of the things which i won't go into in detail but a short list of some of the things which do differ among languages are UNK personal UNK titles UNK terms er UNK noun UNK pronunciation
er there's a book which i don't think is on your list but it might be called by UNK and UNK er which might be worth looking at
that's like full of about dozen or so papers each one i think if it's the book i'm thinking of is about a different community or a different language er so you might find some information about UNK where there's a different UNK structure
er children aren't brought up in the same UNK way as they are in this country and many other countries
er similarly in UNK think it's japanese you find that men and women use different for certain things er not because not because of terms of style just because they are the correct words to use if you are a man or if you are a women
er lots of languages have very complex UNK terms where in english they're fairly simple er i mean someone who is one of your parents brothers is going to be an uncle no matter what
whereas other communities will have father's brother and mother's brother and other ones still will then have different words depending on whether you're male or female
er the same things happens with UNK and UNK and other things and in UNK japanese again i think you find that the same words are pronounced differently
er again i think you can find some information on that in UNK and UNK
right er another situation where there's men and women differences is in UNK communities er you find that men and women's attitudes to varieties or language varieties or languages can carry so some men will try and avoid using one of their languages because they see it as a low prestige variety whereas some women will use it because for them it's a high prestige variety
likewise you might find that switching and mixing will change according to status of the languages
er there's another book which is similar to the other one in the sense that it made up of some papers by phillips steel and UNK and that has some information about UNK in it er and you find that some people er were giving UNK language a low a low prestige rate whereas other group in the community were doing the opposite and giving a high prestige rate or certainly a less low one er in favour of spanish a lot of the because it was in i think it's in south america i guess er you find that a lot of the locals were switching to spanish because it was coming the dominant language er because of UNK pressures and constraints and so on
er but a part of the community were trying to keep UNK and there's men and women differences in that
there's a UNK island and apparently they just because the men their sort of UNK the island all the men and you know they
mhm
and then they kept their language kept the language
right
okay did anybody get a chance to read the paper which was about conversation
i just wondered what that came up with as it's conclusion
w well it might be worth having a read of that
er okay what else
has anybody got any that i haven't really covered yet
mhm
and how erm but it probably got a little to do with the way groups actually organize
whereas the boys are more but the tend to give more
right
but the girls tend more equal responsibility and not
what differences do you f i mean have you got any specific examples there or
no er the girls sort of say things like perhaps ask her do you have any we could get on a bit more so they don't include themselves in what they're going to do
whereas the boys give me the pie get off my steps or something
mm
right
is there something about where one girl was using what would be boys language when
yeah
someone else came round to her house she was like you know get off my yard
yeah so girls are perfectly capable of using those when need be
yeah i mean i the important thing is i think the children do recognize the differences not that they don't notice the differences because they're like you say they're capable of using the other if it if it suits them
er i mean that goes back again to the articles which you might have about the way that parents talk to their children and you quite often find that then very quickly the children grow up speaking in a same way as the parent of that sex talked to the them
so if a child gets spoken to in a fairly direct way by imagine a female child by her father and the same female child gets spoken to in a not so direct way be her mother then even of this the child is likely to both version she'll grow up using female variety because she's she can UNK herself with her mother and i mean she knows that is the variety she's expected to use
i think can't really remember i don't know how father would use different language he's talking to his son or daughter
yeah that's true as well
er it sort of goes in four ways i mean the fathers talk more directly than the mothers whether or not it's a boy or a girl they're talking to
but they do talk more directly to boys than girls so it's sort of graded in that way
okay who wanted to talk briefly about what people are going to write about
cos we haven't really sort of said anything
has anyone got any i mean i you don't all need to write about the same thing or anything
er does everyone want to do a general essay or do people want to do a s a specific thing
general essays can turn into just UNK from the
okay so is there anything you've read that you all would want to concentrate on
erm well not that i've come across yet i'd rather do something that's getting the facts and then giving examples
mhm
i want top do something on what you noticed about and what you've got
right
right
er let me think
i'll just go and find out when the due date for this essay is and then cos if it is the end of week three then i'll say o i'll say it can be in week four sometime
but if it's due in when the project originally was which was week five then that
gives you a bit more time to decide exactly what you want to talk about cos if it has go to be in week three or week four then we really sort of like decide now what you're going to write about so that n cos next week is gonna be our last meeting on this topic so you really want to sort of give a bit of a presentation on what you're going to say
yeah i want everyone to do like five or ten minutes next week on what they're gonna write
okay i UNK just go and find out
what are they supposed to be doing by the way
what happens to the like project
it got cancelled
cancelled
it got cancelled
oh right didn't hear that then
there oh that's why we're not doing it any more so what do we have to do instead of having to do an essay
just an essay
oh they decided not to give us quite so much work
mm
oh right
so we is that why the
is that what we're meant to be doing this term tutorials
think so i don't
when do our tutorials stop
i'm really confused
we've got two more tutorials
what oh yeah week three and week four and
yeah
i'm so confused about what's going on
i think i must be not looking at the list or not reading half the stuff
the first who put UNK and i was going what
where did it say that
i shan't find the le you know the letter we got sent in the holidays
yeah
well mine got sent home and i wasn't there i was here
oh that's ridiculous sarah yeah
so
so i don't know
i mean i've got i've read it once and now i've lost it
and it might even still be at home but i don't know where it is i can't find
so i can't remember what it said in it
ooh i don't know
my supervisor doesn't know anything about writing an outline
yeah has that got to be in tomorrow
yeah
got to do a UNK tomorrow
why
cos he's a runner
oh excellent
put the history of UNK
yeah
so little blue brochure and
this is the study of papers written in the fifteenth century or something
history of UNK
i'm sorry if you're interested in this then go for it
you need a
what're you doing for yours then
i'm a bit confused
your doing what
historical UNK
your mad
what is it though what's historical UNK
is it like what we do in old english or not
cos that
yeah it is
that sounds excellent
right it's due in week three i think
UNK
er but as far as i'm concerned if it comes in week four that's fair enough but things after that then they start to get a bit upset
but i sa i said to chris when is it
she said week three
er and i said give or take a few days and she said yeah
so if it's inside week four then that will quite reasonable does that sound okay
okay has anyone had a think about what they want to do
i mean does anybody else know
sort of everything we've had so UNK been pretty general
okay if any of you wanted to you could always go out some tape recorder and people have a listen to it
but obviously if you're going to do that you'll have to do it during next week some time on the other hand i could give you a list of five topics and you could choose one
yeah oh yeah i mean there's five things five things in men or women's conversation t to do and essay about
say one about UNK one about topics and one about perhaps interaction with children one about er what or you could even i mean if i did er i did a list of that you could even do the same one you wouldn't have to do one each
you know you got your erm tag questions
yeah
might not be one of the question in it as tag questions could be
oh yeah
specific
okay er there's one title i've got written down here which i don't know if anyone's interested in
evaluate the claim that women are more d ob evaluate the claim that women are more UNK of the prestige UNK in their speech than men are
does anyone fancy that
let's if i write down okay the which i've just suddenly thought of were er
turn taking and interruptions and overlap and tags and tag questions topic selection and interaction with children which i think i just mentioned make sure you've got them down so we can forget them
er
what
what
what have i done
oh you weren't supposed to be able to read it
no we can read it but it's
it's just happened a lot this week
er so yeah you want to do some UNK tag things
yeah
okay i mean just ignore that one forget i wrote it
i mean on something like interruptions there's only so much you can say
er
yeah which is why may be general one might be more useful UNK it depends how much
whereas if you do interaction of children you can do it here
mhm
oh yeah i mean if you wanted to also link that with UNK situation or cross cultural or comparing it with other ones i mean that's no problem
language of the different to
okay
certain UNK language
yeah well if you want to that then that's fine as well i mean that tell you what the best thing then is can everyone put a note in my pigeon hole by monday in other words you've got the weekend to decide for definite
gives us just like a provisional title of what the essay will be on what your essay will be
is that alright cos then you've gone away with any ideas you've got from now which is probably none er and then it also means that i don't have to spend next week worrying in case we get to friday and thursday and you're still not sure what you're doing
is that alright
okay if you just sort of like think of a vague title which sums up what the things are which you want to cover in the essay and if you get it to me by monday then that that'll be quite good
you know about questions is it questions like sort of
well tag questions and er and questions in their own rights which i supposed seeking agreement is the idea
or with anything which is vaguely connected with that i mean that just sort of a UNK term for it
excuse me
okay so does everyone think they'll gonna be able to think of something over the weekend
okay and then if next week UNK if next week everyone can have okay w i think what you need to do f for next thursday is for monday to give me what you're going to do and then between monday and thursday try and read anything you can about that topic
i mean you could forget this list that i gave th b that gave you unless there's anything on it that is still relevant but find the things yourself on that topic so that on thursday next thursday you can each spend ten minutes talking about things which you've read in your topic specifically
and if anyone chooses the same topic as somebody else then you can do it together or not together or which ever
but if that can be a general idea for next week
okay
is everyone okay about that
book
er
where you where you
which one
on your chapter six and nine do you know what chapter nine
er
not off the top of my head i can't remember
was that was that theory
was it that
i can't remember what the off the top of my head no
chapter six is
right er
as questions lead to shouting and then UNK back to his then a little bit about language and an experiment that they did
right sounds like there's a bit on topics in there so it might be worth having a look at anyway
i shall be talking services today and dealing with clare from industries like boots and who UNK their waste waters into UNK for treatment
more broad topic now on the subject of water
and a subject dear to your heart i'm sure costs
cos i assume you all pay your water bills
and get a good supply from severn trent
erm severn trent is part of severn trent p l c severn trent water is part of severn trent p l c which is group of companies established following privatization in nineteen eighty nine
incidentally i've been asked to keep the talk fairly short to avoid UNK off
but i'm sure there's no danger of that
erm UNK we've had a number of changes in the water industry over the years
and i guess most of the people in this audience today would think of water being supplied by water boards
that always used to be the case of course
but there've been a number of changes over the years certainly prior to nineteen seventy four that would be the case water boards supplying water local councils treating the sewage and the rivers authorities looking after the river pollution aspects
in fact before nineteen seventy four there were over thirteen hundred agencies within england and wales which dealt with the sewage side of the business
some did it very well like nottingham for instance
always had a good sewage treatment works at nottingham
some did it reasonably well some did it very poorly
it was one of the reasons why the government in nineteen seventy four established water authorities
ten water authorities for england and wales
which amalgamated all these bodies previously dealing with the water as part of their business supply sewage treatment and river pollution control
all those amalgamated into ten new bodies called water authorities
but were still called water boards by the press and by people in general
and then in nineteen eighty nine the government decided to split up the water authorities UNK the utility part that is treatment of sewage and supply of water and split up a regulatory body called the national rivers authority
erm so now we are a water company not a water board any more a water company
erm but we still get called water boards or water authorities
so i don't suppose they'll ever get it right
the same kind of p l c as a world wide company
we've got a lot of erm subsidiary companies
we employ ten thousand five hundred people
nine thousand nine hundred of those in the u k
the other five hundred or so are scattered er throughout the world
mainly in europe and the united states
severn trent water limited provides services to eight point two million people
worldwide we provide services to twenty million people
so we supply more people overseas that we are in the u k
we've got contracts in new york we've got a contract in UNK worth several hundred million pounds
a joint venture there to supply water services to UNK city
we work in belgium we work in italy germany UNK india UNK and UNK kong
plus a few others that i can't mention
eight point two million customers of which i assume that you are some of those
and the three hundred thousand businesses throughout severn trent region
which is centred on birmingham and goes up as far as the UNK estuary and down as far as the severn estuary
we supply four hundred and thirty five million gallons of water a day and that's a lot of water
we've got a hundred and ninety plants
via twenty four thousand miles of pipes
some of which in good condition some of which in poor condition
and we're replacing all of those year by year
we treat five hundred and seventy five million gallons a day of sewage
which is a fair bit of sewage to treat
at over a thousand sewage works via thirty two thousand miles of UNK
now when we were UNK there were those i'm sure who thought it's a licence to print money
which it would be of course if you weren't a regulated body
erm all the UNK utilities like gas electricity UNK have all been UNK with a regulator to UNK the prices that are charged
and there's a pricing formula
the regulator for the water industry is UNK office of water services
and their director general a guy named ian UNK in birmingham and he looks after your interests as customers
he'll take he'll take his part if there's a if there's a dispute between a customer and the water company
and he also UNK the price very severely
you may not agree with that but of course the formula is the retail price index plus a factor of k
k being positive it means that prices are going up faster than inflation
and i guess you've all seen that in the water bills that drop through your doors
k was set at five and a half percent in the first year
so if in if inflation went up say seven or eight percent in the first year you're looking at prices in double figures
twelve thirteen percent
ninety one prices went up thirteen percent on average and in ninety one ninety two by fifteen percent
the increases have been less of late because UNK dropped and we've reduced our k value
but why should we all have to pay more money for water
it's because we're investing a lot of capital expenditure to put right some years of neglect i might say
we're spending over two million pounds a day on capital expenditure
to improve the water service in terms of treatment plant service pipes sewage treatment plants and the rest of the infrastructure
that capital programme was agreed with government before privatization
what have we achieved
well we are also monitored by other regulators
we have a regulator in terms of ian and office of water services
but we also have other regulators other UNK
we have the drinking water inspectorate that UNK the quality of water that we put into your UNK
and in nineteen ninety two ninety nine point seven percent of all the samples that were taken met all the standards
and the standards we have to meet are UNK laid down regulations
we have to meet fifty six different standards for the quality of water
if you're partial to drinking bottled water the report on which you might like to read some time
can't read the date on it
i've probably missed the date somewhere
april nineteen ninety one
and there's also an UNK programme on channel four about bottled water
fine people drink bottled water because they don't particularly like the taste of ground water
because of the chlorine that's present in that water to make it UNK safe
but the quality of bottled water does vary
they don't analyze it as often as we do
and once you've opened that bottled water then any bacteria which might be present may multiply
so if you do use bottled water it's UNK to put it in the fridge after you've opened it
interesting enough one of one of the controversial erm chemicals that people are concerned about with their water is nitrate
and there's a limit on the nitrate values in the supply that we give you
there's no limit on the nitrate values of bottles water
so they're working to different standards than that the water industry
so we're UNK by the UNK the water inspectorate publish an ann annual report see how well we're doing
and we're doing as well as anyone in europe
we also have another UNK called the national rivers authority
they used to be part and parcel of the water authorities and looked after the rivers when we were one big body as a water authority
but on privatization they were split off to be the UNK for what we put into the rivers
and what the quality of the water is in the ground in the in the rivers themselves
they look after land drainage and also er the UNK
so they're a UNK as well
our samples that we ou our UNK that we discharge to the rivers met all the standards on ninety nine percent of samples last year
which is the best ever we've done
which is not the impression you get sometimes when you read the paper
because if you read the paper we're called the dirty man of europe
implying that the water we supply is worse than what's in europe and the sewage UNK we put into rivers is not as good as the rest of europe
we are the dirty man of europe if you r if you read the papers
we are the only country that's been condemned in the european courts for failing to meet the e c drinking water standards
in terms of UNK
but why
why is this
i UNK my guess is if i ask the audience i may get an answer i don't like here
but if you go abroad do you drink the water out the UNK guess you d some do and some don't
but i would always ask is it safe to drink the water out the UNK
and the reps on the holiday co coach when they take you from airport sometimes say yes and sometimes say no
and so i resort to buying bottled water
but why is it that we're called the dirty man of europe
our UNK available that's why
we have to publish public registers
the rivers authority a public register which details the quality of all the sewage UNK that goes into rivers and it details the quality of those rivers
readily available you can go along to the n r a offices in nottingham and ask to see the register
you will not get that information if you go on the continent
the drinking water inspectorate publish an annual report
all the data is there for public inspection
readily available to pressure groups like friends of the earth and greenpeace
and they will read those reports and if we're failing anywhere they'll highlight that
i bought a copy in of last weeks daily telegraph because interestingly enough the press seems to be UNK on to this er not playing by the rules
anyone seen this
yeah
they went to erm a number of cities in europe of all the countries in europe and tried to gather the data to compare the quality of water in their countries to the quality in ours
some were good some couldn't produce any data whatsoever
and in two cases official that were supposed to give the data went missing
and that is the reason i think why we are called the dirty man of europe
because we're more open we're more honest the UNK the UNK there
yes we can do better and yes we are getting better but all that's gonna cost money
how expensive is tap water
well it's about fifty pence a cubic metre if you have a er a UNK water supply in severn trent which is about point o five pence a litre
erm bottle water is probably thirty forty fifty pence a litre
so in terms of price there's no comparison
but people don't but th they don't go for that they go for that because they don't like the taste of chlorine
we accept that and we're looking at ways of improving that taste of water
and in many areas we've done that
we're moving towards more UNK treatment for water
we amount of chlorine to maintain the UNK of it
i've pulled out a few press UNK as well whilst i was looking through some of the for this talk
the river trent not far away from here
again you'd think that the trent is er in a UNK state
river worse than ever it says here
a group set up not too far away from here in newark said that the erm it has been said that the river is worse now than it's ever been in history
well that's a load of rubbish
absolute rubbish
there is no way the river trent is worse now than and time in history
if you go back thirty forty fifty years
it was certainly far more UNK than it ever is today
they said that because they catch their fish
and the n r a have come out with the reason now saying that the river is UNK in the winter periods when the fishing seems to be off and the fish aren't UNK
that's the n r a's reason for the river fishing being not so good
but the u k has some of the highest some of the best quality rivers in europe
the percentage of rivers in the u k in the classes one and two which are good and satisfactory are far higher in the u k than they are in europe
something like ninety percent of our rivers fall in those categories
now the on the subject of treatment i now pull out a government report here because where do we get criticized from
where do we get prosecuted
we got prosecuted in brussels
erm e c court
anyone been to brussels
yeah
do you know what happens to sewage in brussels
i think it goes straight in the river
exactly
they haven't got a treatment plant yet in brussels
there's a report by the sunday times
er let me read this few paragraphs from the sunday times report
last week UNK by the sunday times visited the river UNK
which is the river in brussels
less than four miles from that's the he was the environment minister at the time
headquarters and found evidence that the river is one of the most UNK in the twelve e c countries
UNK depot UNK with s with UNK and weeds the sewage of the UNK capital flows UNK and UNK through two forty s foot square pipes into the UNK
it's a practice that britain abandoned years ago
a ten foot wide brown UNK continually into the blue grey waters in which no fish can survive and no person would dare to swim
every inch added to the rivers reputation as the dustbin of europe
and that was written in may nineteen ninety one
they have now put steps in hand to build a sewage treatment works
the first part of it will be finishing next years with another one in the year two thousand
but that's where we're getting criticized from
a place that doesn't have a sewage treatment works
i think UNK disgraceful
but there is pressure to improve standards even more in the u k
we have pressures to improve on water quality although ninety nine point seven percent of our water samples meet the tests
there's pressure to go even higher
and as you well know or at least i hope you well know as you approach sort of absolute sort of UNK limits the costs of doing so UNK out of all proportion
the same with sewage treatment
there's another e c urban waste water directive treatment
which will be enforced by the year two thousand requiring additional treatment for sewage UNK
in certain places
according to whether the are designated sensitive or not
and those are gonna push up costs
now the director general of the UNK is your friend
he's the guy who said the UNK of prices has got to stop
we cannot carry on increasing water service charges by ten to fifteen percent year in and year out
where would it stop
people won't be able to afford to have the water services if you carry on in this way
so he's declared basically a dispute with the n r a amongst others because he's identified that some of this UNK coming from the rivers authority
erm their job is to make sure the rivers are clean
it's a question of how UNK the ri should those rivers be
and how clean can we as a nation afford them to be
we could all have rivers UNK with salmon if you wish
but there's a price you're paying
and whether that price is worth paying is something only you can tell us
it's not for us to decide necessarily that we will we will treat UNK to a certain standard and pass the costs on to you because that's where it all goes to
we erm we need to consult the customers
and this is what we've done
now the current prices of water i'm sure you think oh it's UNK
the average price in severn trent is a hundred and sixty four pounds per household
now i guess from the UNK audience we've got here today that you pay more than that because you're living in higher UNK value properties i guess
correct me if i'm wrong
but the average price in severn trent is a hundred and sixty four pounds per household per year
that UNK with the rest of the water companies we are second lowest
thames is the lowest with a hundred and fifty two and south west is the highest at two hundred and sixty six
that's the current prices
so south west is a hundred pounds a year more than ours
on a day basis it's about forty five pence a day which is er less than the price of a half a glass of beer
or gentleman smoking there it's less than four price of four cigarettes
which i wouldn't have thought is UNK in this day and age
so when you look at it on a yearly basis and a compare it to what it was a few years ago yes it's gone up a lot
but where will it go to if we're building all these new requirements to treat water and UNK to the higher standards
at the moment the er the regulators ask us to go to the to the customers and this we have done and produce something called market plans
erm and you can all get a copy of this is you want to write to the water authority
sorry water company
your future drinking water and sewage services
it's just a twelve page document but it's the result of a customer survey which was carried out
we sent out fifty thousand videos to random customers
did anyone in the audience get a video from severn trent
ah well done sir
and did you send back your questionnaire
yes i did
very good
very good
and what did you think of it
i thought it was very interesting what the company or whatever you call yourselves nowadays was doing
mm
erm i think what UNK a lot of us is the quality of water we get locally
right
i mean could you say something about that
i was going to
ask a question but since you've asked me alright
well i'll c i'll that later
at least i'll try to armed with the facts
we sent out fifty thousand of those videos
you might well that's an UNK way of er of conducting a market research
but actually those videos cost s less than a pound to produce each
so that's fifty thousand pounds
but a pound a head we thought was good value
and then we followed that up with market research of five thousand customers at random
and we priced from what the customers told us what they wanted and then we would tell the customers how much that would cost we got a feeling for the support for certain initiatives
yes they all wanted clean rivers but then when they were told the price of UNK with the urban waste water directive they were less keen
erm they wanted er sewer UNK to be stopped
they wanted UNK from our pipes to be stopped
that probably was the highest priority of all i think
erm quickly
yes eighty six percent wanted a substantial reduction on UNK and sixty five percent wanted improved taste in the water
and there's a willingness to pay was high for those er for those benefits
the lower ones were improving storm sewer UNK and treating sewage even better so there was less there was less enthusiasm for paying more money to improve sewage treatment works
but it's information that we need or the director general need in order to decide what prices will be set
because we refer to south west again
they are spending a lot of money in the south west on cleaning up the UNK
they're providing sewage treatment plant which they hadn't UNK provided previously to send cleaner water into the UNK
that is estimated to have cost between four hundred and five hundred pounds per household by the year two thousand if all those plans go through
and that's without inflation
now UNK very low at the moment but if inflation took off again and got into double figures then not only would your pensions suffer but your bills would go up as well
we estimate in severn trent our UNK be two hundred and twenty seven pounds by the year two thousand
per household which is lower than three of them currently are
and how will you pay
erm historically we've paid most people have paid on the basis of UNK value
UNK value times so much er pence per pound r v
since nineteen eighty nine of course UNK dis disappeared
when the wonderful new system the poll tax came in
and so all new houses built since that date have had no UNK value assess assessment
and so you can't use that system
so all new houses certainly in severn trent region since that date have had water meters
when we consulted our customers on how they wanted to pay for water there was no clear preference
there was a slight preference maybe for water meters
water meters can be argued to be fair
you have some influence over what you use and so the size of the bill
erm but it's an expensive system to install
and severn trent hasn't yet decided which way to go
there are a number of UNK trials taking place throughout the u k
the isle of UNK being one of them substantial UNK trials there
to see if the installation of UNK on a large scale does influence the er the usage of water and if it does and if that shows savings in the amount of water people need then maybe the water companies can reduce their reduce their capital investment programmes to provide even more water
so that the cost
but it's early days yet and there's no there's no definite answer
but we'll have to find an answer by the years two thousand because the way the UNK written means that by the year two thousand we can no longer use UNK value
so we've got to find an alternative
most of our customers really prefer a system based on property type be it semi UNK terrace detached mansion castle or whatever
erm but whether we go that way it's not been decided yet
there is an optional UNK scheme and if you do live in a higher UNK value property and you don't use er above average amounts of water you'd probably you'd probably benefit from put a water in or have a water meter installed
so before you all nod off i'll just finish off
er it's a large business is severn trent er it's a growing business except we are in s in the water business in the u k water we are reducing numbers by about two percent a year
we're reducing our operating costs as well
but against that we've got these extra commitments in terms of higher quality which is again is pushing prices up
our managing director UNK says in his market plan that water services should be affordable and i hope i totally agree with that they should be affordable we shouldn't price people out of out of using our water services
and just finally i think compared to europe we've got a lot to be proud of
now if you want is it er is it the done thing to have questions
yes
right
i hope i can answer them
i er just my background is er the dirty water side of the business rather than the clean water side
but i'll do my best
yes
er what is anything is being done about supplying er UNK weather conditions such as the snow we had a couple of years ago
when the water supply UNK because there wasn't pumps
is it sort of beyond plan to
no it's beyond the cost i think
erm
put a generator in or som er
yeah
er a diesel engine to
we've looked strategic sites were looked at after that event of december the eighth
i remember it well
erm because we ran out of electricity on lunch time on the saturday
that was restored on the sunday just at the same time as the water ran out
erm yes there's been a been a long hard look at our er UNK to a shortage of electricity
erm that was strategic plans i think
we did have separate supplies in station
it was a completely unique event as far as we were concerned it'd never happened before and hopefully it'll never happen again
it always comes to a question of cost though
you know if it's a once in a hundred years event is it worthwhile providing all the backup equipment you've got for all the stations that you've got
erm hopefully we would be better prepared next time and that we can get in generators quickly if we don't already have them on standby
some places do have them on standby
some places never ran out of water
can you tell us something about the quality of water locally
erm a number of years ago we read in the paper that the UNK was being updated and
mhm
cost erm to improve the quality of the water
and yet after that was completed i think the water the drinking water inspectorate condemned it as being one of the worst qualities of water in the country
erm in terms of what
nitrate
in terms of UNK and other UNK yes
nitrate levels have been rising in the ground water in nottinghamshire certainly most of the bore holes for the last twenty or thirty years
and we presume due to our agriculture the use of UNK on the land erm not entirely due to that
not entirely UNK but that seems to be er the main cause of it
they have set up nitrate sensitive UNK in certain areas whereby farmers operate a different practice in within the catchment area of a particular bore hole
and more of those will come in because it's far better to prevent er not only UNK but UNK or anything else which is applied to land getting into water
because once it's in it's far more expensive to get it out
so there are protection UNK being there are protection UNK already in and more are proposed
what we've done in north notts is to sink some new bore holes
and we are UNK water supplies so that we can we can meet whatever limits are applicable or appropriate
but if you have a problem with your water in terms of taste or the quality then you must phone us up
we'll give you a full report on what we're supplying
no problem about that
nothing to hide
and if you've got some particular local problems we'll have a look at those as well
we are UNK we are we're re lining re lining four thousand one hundred miles of mains
and re laid seventeen hundred miles since nineteen eighty nine
in the town where i live all the mains have been UNK and re lined
the iron mains that were there
main cause of sort of UNK problems
what particular problem have you got
with your water
well the taste
the taste
it's just the chlorine
it's er partly chlorine yes but it there are occasions when it UNK like t c p
mm
that's mostly because of a reaction with the UNK in your tap
erm have you reported it
oh yes we were told that nothing could be done about it
oh well usually when you get t c p it's because the UNK reacting with a UNK compound within the tap UNK
and changing the UNK usually does the trick
erm we expect to see improvements on chlorine but i can't give you a time
we had to boost up chlorine levels actually to meet e c directives
i know the gentleman here thinks i shouldn't blame the e c for everything but erm
no
not everything
but we did have to boost up chlorine levels in areas because they weren't high enough
er can i can i just follow on the question of local water and the taste and quality of local water
erm you're a bit UNK about bottled water
but if i buy
no
i'm n i wasn't UNK
cos i
well
i buy it for my whisky because
if i buy if i buy bottled water i get with that bottle er an analysis of the water that i'm drinking
yeah
it's there on the label for me to see
well for exam well at least i know how much sodium i'm taking in or what
you don't really
you know what's on the analysis UNK because that's stated
but there's no there's guarantee that what you buy in the bottle UNK to that analysis
those aren't my words those are the words of which the UNK association
where do i where do i find the analysis for severn trent local water
you er either phone us up at road at nottingham or you call in to see us and we'll give you an exact breakdown of what's in your water supply
why don't you send a little list round when you have the bills out
because the UNK be impossible
you cannot you couldn't split up all our customers from birmingham on a bore hole by bore hole basis
it'd be impossible
yes
the figures you gave us at the beginning i seem to remember that you sell a lot more water abroad than in this country
and
no we treat more water abroad
pardon
we treat more water abroad
treat more
i see
because you employ five hundred people
mm
in other countries to nine thousand five hundred
that's right
the nine th nine thousand includes UNK waste which is a waste disposal company as well
it's about seventeen hundred people in there
erm and the there's we'll have some contractors as well working abroad
for most it's a lot of our services abroad are consultative
but we are actually running erm the treatment works on long island in new york
and UNK that
this is severn trent water international it's not severn trent the local firm as it were
it's important that the company that side of the business because e profits are there for the taking
we have to compete obviously
there's no competition locally
as it were apart from the bottled water that the gentleman there buys
that's why we're regulated
that's why we're regulated
but with the other companies that have been established and all water companies have done the same the way to increase profits is to go into er a business which you're in competition with other businesses and you stand or fail as to how well you do on that
but y the profits are there and you can make profits w outside of the control of the regulators
can i just ask you then in relation to your waste disposal business which is a fashionable diversification
pardon
yes er but most other water authorities have got their er subsidiary operating in waste disposal
yeah
don't you think that there's a conflict of interest there
because vast quantities of this waste is tipped it's land UNK
mhm
er and er obviously that does affect the ground water
well it shouldn't do
well er it shouldn't but it does
it shouldn't if it's tipped correctly and monitored correctly and controlled correctly
ah yes but it's not tipped correctly most of the time
as well i'll disagree with that
i mean there are problems with ground water in certain areas because of the UNK practices that have been historical
but in today if you if you had a new UNK site developed today
well then the control of that would be very UNK
yes but then thinking about those that have been running for some time
yeah
and there have been problems with ground water in some of those areas
not only in areas where there have been tips i might add
there are problems with ground waters in certain industrial areas where er factory premises have allowed UNK to UNK
there was a case recently in anglia er anglia water cambridge water company sued a leather works for UNK over the years to UNK the UNK
and you know the sums were horrendous
millions of pounds worth of damage
i mean they had to abandon the bore hole
and prevention is better than cure
you have to prevent these substances entering into the ground waters
because as i say if you've got to clean them up afterwards the costs are horrendous
you say that all new houses er have no UNK value are UNK
how does the average er charge for UNK water for those compare with the average for the other houses
i've no idea it depends how much water they use
well i know but the average figure i mean there
erm
there must be quite a number of houses in this category
there are
and it would be a good guide i think for people as to whether to have meters or not
well if you work out on sort of er thirty or forty gallons per head per day
erm per person yeah
you can work out how much water you're going to use
unless you've got a huge garden or a huge
yeah
greenhouse that you want to use tap water to UNK
but that's about the domestic consumption
but the more appliances you have the more washing machines er more appliance washing machines the more UNK and this is sort of UNK
that's gonna push the water consumption higher
is there any possibility of going to a separate system and using er non UNK water for all these other activities which must take up about seventy five or eighty percent of the quantities
probably a lot more actually
yeah
probably ninety percent of the water of more i would guess e erm is used for non UNK usage
and i suppose if we'd got a clean sheet and we started again we'd do it differently
er but to actually provide a UNK system now i dread to think how much the cost would be
erm i mean one way to do it of course is to say that none of our UNK fit for drinking and you all get bottled water then wouldn't you
well that was a seriously UNK thing at one time of course
erm a and the idea of having UNK and non UNK supplies is not viable anyway because the public health risk is too high
is it viable to reduce the UNK
yeah
is that a viable proposition
yeah that's what we're spending a lot of money doing as well
erm
but is it viable
well you'll never eliminate UNK because UNK is a global term for water that we can't account for
and it includes it in yeah it includes water which is UNK from customers premises
UNK the UNK that's operating at night maybe when the pressures
i mean one way we can accommodate that is to put pressure UNK valves in maybe and drop the pressures a bit at night
but that UNK figure isn't just the UNK in our pipes it's the UNK or the water that you can't account for going out of customers premises and factories as well
well at least this would be a good er on that wouldn't it
it would mean i mean we've just been involved with one of the hospital because there's an audit commission report on costs to hospital services
which said basically they paid too much money for water
and we got involved with the local national healthy facility i think they're called
their energy engineer got in touch with us very early on
and erm it was we looked at one hospital and quite clear over the years but there was an internal UNK somewhere
and we were able to find that for them
but erm reducing UNK is a i is a is a priority for us
but at the same time we'll never eliminate it completely
never
i think the average UNK about nineteen percent
if you add that to the eight ninety percent that needn't be UNK it seems to be very attractive to er deliver it in bottles doesn't it
well it out yet
it's something i've thought about but i guess the cost would be horrendous but they wouldn't i don't know
what would it cost to in for me to install a meter in my house
the meters are supplied free of charge it's er you can either o it yourself or you can get your local UNK to fit it
it has to be fitted in accordance with the bye laws erm and we give out advice on where it should be fitted
but the meters free
mm
probably thirty or forty pounds at the most
why do you charge erm at least for domestic premises seventeen percent more
we moved in the autumn from
mhm
and the charge the pence in the pound and i don't about the forget the UNK value
the
yeah
pence in the pound here is seventeen percent higher than that we were charged
this is for what
for water
for water
yes
for water and UNK well actual water is seventeen sewage is sixteen
is that a technical reason or is that purely money judgement
there were eight charging UNK in severn trent with difference p pence erm UNK values
oh so within severn trent i see
erm it looks like you've gone from a lower cost one to a higher cost one
mm
but if you go just across the river to anglia
you'll find it's a lot more expensive
especially on measured
if you've got a water in and you pay not only your water supply in but also your sewage out on the basis of what comes through the meter
so if you take a hundred gallons on a day meter you're charged for a hundred gallons of water going out as sewage er the anglia rate is double ours for sewage
if you go to marks and spencer or UNK
yeah
a tin of beans in the south will cost the same as a tin on beans in the north
well yeah
it's the same firm
we UNK we have UNK charges speaking
er this is there is some UNK the price for er measured supplies is the same wherever you are
it's the UNK value charges which were different
and i can't really give you a satisfactory explanation as to why that is
in if everyone had a meter
yeah
er as to what would happen to the UNK charges as against what they are at the moment
not as far as i'm aware at least not i've read as to what would be the effect of that
but if there was a reduction in usage if there was a reduction in usage because people had got water meters in then our charges or our costs for providing additional security er in terms of more UNK increased pumping etcetera would be reduce
and we would pass on those benefits to the customer
incidentally i don't know if you've been to anyone been to UNK
yes
because that's our a UNK which was commissioned last year to secure supplies for the east midlands cost us a hundred and seven million pounds
but it's a really good place to go to if you've got a any spare time and i'm sure spare time it's well worth going there erm you can hire UNK
er you can hire sail boats and er it's i i've been there a couple of times
i went there for the opening and i'm really proud to be associated with water because i think it's i think it's a wonderful piece of engineering and excellent
right is there's no more questions thank you very much mr
thank you
and a vote of thanks
mr president fellow members of UNK i on your behalf would like to propose a vote of thanks to john for the very UNK explanation he's given to us on the operations of trent water
er just one small question from me john
have severn trent got on the UNK yet for UNK up the water in brussels
well yes
not necessarily brussels but belgium we're got a joint venture company and we are sending our expertise to help them sort out the i think it's the erm the UNK region anyway brussels
so we've got an involvement there
so possibly that might reduce our costs
well hopefully
well thank you john for that very interesting talk and perhaps the members of UNK would join me in giving you that
some trouble fitting you in
UNK
nobody want their head cut off
no
UNK got UNK the last time
pardon
oh give us peace
there you go
UNK
i'll need to cut your dad's legs off and then he'll be the same size as you
do
ah you're kidding on
you're kidding on
right cheerio now
i'm in before the doctor
aye
thought they'd lost you there
well now what can i do for you tonight
er it's an insurance line doctor
just to keep me
right
it's my thumb
that's the excuse i've been giving and
mhm
that's the one i'm sticking to
how're things doing
alex has not been too well the last couple of days you know
yeah
doctor was in this morning
mm
er but i as i say there's nothing that anybody can do really
no it's
you know
just a matter of time
i meant to phone up this morning for an appointment for doctor but i forgot all about it
i really did of course she was the nurse came in first it was the doctor
mhm
then it was the priest then it was another nurse then the priest and she was getting a bit
UNK everybody coming in to see everybody
she'll be up the pole
aye
UNK you know
oh i wish they'd all bloody leave me alone
say something like that oh no
och aye
och aye
you must i mean she
she's no more medicine left
she's no medicine left
no not the stuff that you gave her anyway
right
that's and she knows she knows perfectly well what's happening
i mean she's not stupid
och aye
do you really think so doctor
she's not stupid
i mean she's lived long enough she's seen it all
aye
she's seen it all before
and they get very quickly suspicious when you know when the nurse is coming in and the UNK coming in and the
doctor's coming in
they're not so daft
we don't we don't give them much credit
no well
but they're not they're not so stupid
well as soon as the doctor mentioned hospital she was awfully upset
who d who mentioned the hospital
the doctor
did he
actually she had mentioned it herself first
mhm
she said er no i think it was the doctor actually mentioned hospital
i see you've been to the hospital or something like that
you know
mhm
with the records
aye
oh i'm not going back i'm not going back there
after that she was awfully upset
so i mean that day we had to tell a lot of lies you know like that
oh
no the doctor just meant that er y you were at the hospital
that's right
you've not to go back yet
oh just wait till it comes and see what happens
aye just
the doctor said something about a tube in her to stop the to stop what was it now the doctor said there's a tube they put a tube in her and they don't
try and ease the UNK
aye it's something about the UNK
and it would ease the UNK as well
aye
it's it won't it won't er
no he says it's
it won't stay like that
no
it won't stay like that
what they did was they took er on the inside there's er there's the liver in there er just at the end of the stomach
and what they did was they put a tube from here into the next bit of the stomach that comes round from underneath there put a tube across there
ah right
so they didn't have to go through this bit
aha
because that UNK all full
right
you know
so they put a tube across there
so the stuff coming down goes through there and then it goes into the rest of the tubes and away through
but that will last for a certain length of time
aha
until this grows down past that bit
or up over the top of that bit
ah i see
or it pushes the tube out of shape
aha
aha
sometimes bends the tube round about
aye
but i mean it might take another two weeks it might take another two months
you can never tell
but
aye
right
aha
aha
i mean she'll just gradually because this bit between here and the stomach is the bit that most of the food gets UNK in
aye
she'll not have much of an UNK because that UNK not working properly and it's not getting a chance to go through her
hello doctor
hello
well mr what can i do for you today
er it's a wee problem i've had for a say about a year now
mhm
it's er my face
and my skin
i seem to get an awful lot of it's like
aha
dry UNK skin
yeah
and i get it on my UNK down here
i can see
and under my UNK
mhm
and i've tried as many different UNK
what've they been
oh i've got them at the chemist that e forty five
mm
oh aye
all different stuff it's no good
no
and it's starting to get you know UNK me
right let's get it cleared for you
good
i think i left it too long
no
i should have seen you afore now
no
mm
what kind of things causes that you know
you'll need to watch your soap
aha
UNK
right
er UNK
right
any of these things that you use on your hair
aha
that can run down your face
your face
aha
cos these are the things that cause
yeah i thought it was soap
mhm
and i started see now they've brought out that UNK the moisturizer rubbish
crap
right
good
i've been buying bars and bars of that see
no it's er
rubbish
i said maybe that'll sort it
aye
anything like that at all anything er soap powder even affects some folk
oh right
aha
er liquid UNK are the same
er UNK
shower UNK and things like that
i use
all these things are all exactly the same
see
so what would you recommend that
we ba UNK baby UNK
aha
end of story
that's it
that's for the whole lot
for that does the business
the lot yeah
that's fine then
yeah
because it's got the it's the one with the UNK er UNK
aye
and all of this UNK they put in
that's right aye
it's the UNK one of the lot
that or the next best is er simple soap UNK
aye that's right aye
these two are the best
that's the best to use
they're the UNK to use
that's good that's fine
and if you do that
it should clear up
and you use this stuff for about a month use this stuff is quite soft
aha
you don't need a lot of it
it's almost as soft as this
this is highly UNK stuff
aha
er that isn't
this is highly UNK but you really see that
some like that and just rub it in
aye
just like that
see a wee drop like that'll cover that
that's right
right up to there
you know just a spot of that covers
aye you're aye you're not going to use a lot
aye you won't you won't need a lot
just a wee drop like that
mm
er that stuff UNK too
but er but there's the cream you get from the chemist john er won't be like that
and
i i've tubes of that e forty five
aye
and i UNK it
aye
no
and it's nothing
no
you if you get that stuff that'll keep doing the trick for you
UNK
aye just watch the kind of soap you use
aha
and watch your UNK
that's smashing
as i say the best is UNK baby
aye
or simple soap UNK
there're no UNK
there're no UNK in them at all
that's right
right
a anything that UNK like
aye UNK
aye
forget it
forget it
aye
okay
anything that's got even the slightest
aye
thing like that forget it
that's fine then
so you're still at
that's still the same aye
still on
well that's smashing doctor
there you are and that'll keep that right john
that's lovely
right thanks doctor
okay look after yourself now
same with you
right
see you later
cheerio now
bye
la
hello
well catherine
that's okay
not to worry about that
what've you been doing to yourself
i've been no i've been taking kind of UNK i don't know and i'm as tired as
