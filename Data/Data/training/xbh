pins and needles
you know how if you hit your elbow

for a wee while yes
for a wee while
right
right
is it four weeks then i'll come back and see you
see you in four weeks yes please
right thanks a lot doctor
bye
right bye now
er and in any in any event there are a number of things i tend to miss altogether if i want to er keep to timetable which i and i i'm sure you're all the audience or group or whatever you like to call it that will welcome an extension of the talk
i usually mention briefly on going into business on your own account working for yourself but i'll develop that later that that's one of the things i can dr drop out altogether if w depending on the type of group i'm with
so okay well we'll make a start and then we've got but my first remarks were a little bit so there we are
i did mention that er i'm a retired tax inspector and i'm very long retired i've been retired for thirteen years thoroughly enjoying it hope you too but your first questions w must be what the devil am i doing thirteen years retired tax inspector talking to you on a technical subject why on earth can't you get the real thing
the short answer was that when i was working as inspector of taxes i used to give these talks i was required to give talks
and the revenue got mean and decided it couldn't afford the time of serving officers and it left pre retirement council and other bodies with a gap to fill er the only other people who are er professional if you like who could fill it would be accountants and they weren't available
so they had to pull pa back people like me from retirement
which is fair enough because one of the things i mentioned about the benefits of er or the things we should try to achieve in retirement or secure in retirement is that if you've had a challenge in life whilst you're working then for goodness sake don't drop it when you retire
there is still the need for a challenge in life and a sense of responsibility or whatever you like to call it
and i find this challenging these talks which is why i wasn't at all sorry to be asked to do so and why i continue to do them and i enjoy giving the i enjoy meeting people i meet an awful lot of nice people
and i learn quite a lot myself but it does give me that little bit of a challenge that er i think is helpful in retirement
anyway that's by the way
but it so happens you might say well all these years retired i can't be much good at the job you'll be interested to know that i give talks to groups which include retiring tax inspectors
now you get the odd situation that an old UNK like me i'm telling people who are just retiring about er how to deal with income tax in retirement
i mention that not in any UNK sense it's only to reassure you that if i can do that then i can't be very much out of giving the wrong gen
i'm pleased to know that myself as well
okay
so that's the background of why i'm giving this as long retired er tax inspector the mean my own department has got a bit mean
now your second question must be where do i get my information from how do i keep up to date
and UNK enough one of my friends asked me only yesterday when he said what's on your programme for next week he said how on earth do you keep up to date
i say who's in
and it really isn't UNK it really isn't difficult to keep up to date er once you've got the background because although income tax does change it only changes annually it may well change more frequently changes annually
and this year there's been very little change altogether you may have noticed that or very little change at all
but i'm able to get quite a lot of information and i'm saying this because you too can get it
and there are a number of publications one of which i regard as my bible this is out of date of course tax saving guide on which tax saving guide
i could UNK with anything else everything else including visits to the tax office which i rarely do except to replace my er brochures and er things that i send round for information
so with that alone you can keep up to date with income tax
another one h have you met the magazine choice
it's aimed at people over fifty
er pleasure of young parents your rights franchise and dental treatment low cost homes competition
investigating the possibilities of work after fifty
well they do UNK articles on income tax insurance and investment and they're all done by top of the mill people
another one which may surprise you saga
send a granny abroad or sex and games abroad
we're still we're still going i haven't met it yet but
saga too does excellent investment income tax and insurance articles from time to time
thoroughly recommend all you don't have to be members we are members of the magazine club because all these are available in local libraries
er yes i was going to say something else about saga
when er i first was introduced to the saga magazine i read their articles on insurance and i felt that this is this sounds alright and we're now covered for insurance through saga it's through lloyds of course UNK companies for both the house and the car
you'll be interested to know i've just changed i've just renewed my insurance policy on my car which is an e reg v w golf diesel
it's a fully comp i'm paying a hundred and fifty one pounds
now i can't touch that anywhere else and i doubt whether anybody else can
now i'm not selling their services but er there are some er quite surprising er bonuses to pick up from er being members of this these er various societies
there's yet another one and i always hesitate to mention this one help the aged i think it's most yes
sorry can i just come back to the car insurance
is it for one driver or any driver
no my wife drives
yeah
well i pay three hundred and twelve
yeah
i admit i've got a son who's
right
twenty five
yeah
but er nevertheless
mm
incidentally i always do this and yet i must reassure you that i'm not a saga representative in anyway i'm just keen on saga and their facilities
i asked people if th if they would like a UNK copy of the saga magazine and all their brochures and they can do so by er members like myself we're asked from time to time do we know any friends who would like a copy
so i usually leave a er sheet of paper on the table and if you're if you're interested in getting a free brochure what i shall do at the end of the course is to send this off er together with one of the cards that they let me have and er in due time you'll get a free saga magazine
so i'll leave it about if you don't bother if you're not but er i think that they're er they're very good organizations
we don't now go on the saga holidays simply because they er or solely because you need to go down to gatwick to catch the planes and we're not to doing that east midlands or
anyway that's very much by the way
but i was saying about help the aged check your tax
they do some quite remarkably good booklets so don't rip it off by the heading and er nobody regards themselves as aged these days do they
there's an office in town opposite boots on parliament street and there's a great range of leaflets in there on all sorts of things
so please don't be put off by the title it says help the aged i ain't going in there
just have a UNK and have a look in and see what's
right now i mustn't be seen to be indicating in any way that er you don't have to bother with it all because they too put all out some excellent er booklets brochures i've got two thick pads of them which i'll let you circulate
just to see what's available
you'll be surprised what's available in the
and the changes in my day when i was working we'd have some leaflets but they were written in a very er sort of technical way
these are they really are good
the er you'll be interested i think those of you who've not met the er independent taxation changes that have come about there's a great booklet a great series of books on er independent taxation about people who are considering working for themselves there's some booklets
so the revenue themselves do er a really good information service and if you go into any tax office you don't have to go to the counter there's often a queue or you get this little card system which number system you're next
all these booklets are o on display just inside the general office right now another way contact my is in cardiff i know yours isn't up to local or if no it isn't it
mine is local but i don't know what will happen when i've retired
ah yes i yes i mean local
yeah the superannuation i've mentioned the er UNK general which basically
so my tax office is in cardiff now the quick way in to your tax office where ever it is and if it changes is you get the telephone number you get the reference room of salaries or pension department you ring your tax office quote your name the tax office reference although that's n these days isn't important but you must quote your national insurance number by doing that you get put through to the person who UNK a button and says oh yes you're mr or mrs so and so what can i tell you
it's like this commercial organization when you ring up don't you
they say oh yes sir we know all about you we've got
well you can do that by simply quoting your name national insurance number to your own tax office
and er if it's more convenient if you've got er a lengthy inquiry call into any tax office the nearest one i've even called into tax offices when we've been away for a weekend just to pick up brochures and things like that
er well not in any weekend because they would be closed wouldn't they
but i've called into other tax offices and they too can get on their video screen y th your history from your tax office
and then they're fully UNK with all your affairs and talk to you quite sensibly
that's quite interesting bernard as an ex tax inspector you go away and worry about your income tax over the weekend like we do
no well you're right except that i find it more convenient to replace my booklets if i'm in er cardiff on my weekend when i happen to pass a tax office i pop in replace them
okay that's enough about that
right i mentioned about er about questions fire away as you think about it
now the first main subject if you like or part subjects is personal allowances because they affect everything that er i'm going to say
now you may know all about personal allowances or you may think you know all about personal allowances and i thought like that
but they have changed in the last few years and there are some quite significant elements about personal allowances that you ought to know about one of which is independent taxation and this talk is actually personal allowances and independent taxation
now independent taxation as you may know came in we're now in ninety three four i've only just altered the heading because very little else has changed and i'm a lazy so and so i can't rewrite it just for the heading
the previous year was ninety two ninety three the year that's just gone
the previous year to that ninety one ninety two there was a change in the income tax regulations affecting married women only married women everybody is the same stayed the same
in prior to ninety one ninety two which is three years prior to now a married woman was entitled to the same as that it was they didn't call it basic allowance the same amount only if she was married of course and working it had to be earned income
and if a married woman in her own right had investment income she'd got money in a building society or a bank or what have you morning
then and no earnings she didn't qualify for an allowance at all because investment income then was her husband's
a married woman's investment income prior to ninety one ninety two was her husband's not hers
but from ninety one ninety two onwards a married woman was entitled to an allowance in her own right and it still UNK me knowing mrs thatcher was in office for all those years why it took so long for this to happen
so ninety one ninety two a married woman was entitled to a basic personal allowance of three four five which could be set against any income erm or investment
and the change now means that if a married woman it doesn't as i say it doesn't affect single women if a married woman now hasn't earned income using all her allowances so she doesn't work hasn't worked never qualified for a pension or does work but doesn't earn more than that and the couple have got investment income then it's sensible to switch that into the wife's name to give her income to use up her allowances
because otherwise the investment income stays with the husband taxed at his rate which could be forty and they're therefore wasting the balance of allowances the wife's allowances
or if a wife was earning working or had a pension and did use her allowances but the husband was paying forty percent the same switch of investments transferring income to the wife even though it was UNK at twenty percent or twenty five was UNK the husband's forty percent
or down the scale again the husband could be paying twenty five percent and the wife twenty percent and they could switch investments between the two
or between wife and husband we tend to think only of transfer from husbands to wife but er we do meet quite er a w er ladies who've got quite high earnings and they themselves are paying forty percent in which case they should make sure that any investment income of theirs is transferred to the husband so as to get the to either use up allowances that are not being used at all because of absence of the income or to benefit from these different rates of tax
they might run off and take it with them
well this is the risk you have to take but er and it's a it's a profit at this stage where er people are coming up to receiving lump sums in retirement and wonder how best to invest it well seems to me there's no better investment than to than to put it into tax free sources that you have available to you
now when i say transfer assets to er a wife it will also if you've got a joint account
it may be in the husband's sole name and maybe his lump sum on retirement would otherwise be going into his own account oh and they may say put it into a joint account
now with joint accounts the revenue regards the income as being shared equally whether or not the capital was put in equally the revenue says interest on a joint account is equally shared
and it may well be that an equal share of interest doesn't achieve the best result
so if you've got an account in a husband's name and it would be better in a wife's name close the account
if you've got a joint account look to see whether closure and transfer of the asset into the wife's name will give you a better result
it's no good saying to the revenue well half of it er my wife has half of this account therefore i'm not regarding it as mine
it has to be an account in the wife's name it has to be a genuine transfer to a wife so that there's no doubt about it but it is a on her account
but you can see that er for someone who has no a wife who has no income and her husband's paying twenty five percent or forty percent then by moving a say er twenty thousand at erm well er whatever percentage to fill up these allowances er if you're getting ten thousand or twenty thousand put it into the wife's name that they give us the interest is then hers if she has no other income it neatly can be UNK up by the allowance
does anyone have to pay any tax say on building society
well on building society in that your building society are have change too in ninety one two at the same time
prior to ninety one two when independent taxation came in banks and building societies were just taxed at source as it is today
but you couldn't get that tax back whatever your circumstances were
an odd situation don't quite know why there are UNK numerous odd situations in here er in income tax there's nothing fair about income tax at all
and building society anybody who has a building society account prior to ninety one two if they hadn't income really i they were silly to have money in the building society account because they were having tax deducted but couldn't get it back and at the same time as the independent taxation they changed the er tax system for building societies and banks which meant that banks and building societies were then deducted tax at the standard rate of twenty five percent and it could be UNK or UNK or not deducted in certain circumstances so back to your question anybody who has money in a building society now or isn't taxable should ask the building society not to UNK tax as they're entitled to do fill a form and where people can state that they don't they're not liable to pay tax building societies and banks will not now UNK income tax
and you'll be
and that's a mar that is a married couple
that's for a married couple but er anybody who hasn't income single person children
children particularly our own grandchildren i discovered er had got money in the building societies i mean we give them money for presents and throw it into a building society and i said what's happening about your tax
what tax
you know and then they realize that er in showing a building society account they just showed the interest after deduction of tax
and they n have now claimed exemption so any child or any person who hasn't got income using up all their basic allowances should apply to banks or building societies not to UNK their tax
could i just ask
yes
if you've not already opted for individual er taxation er and you decide to do so after retirement how do i go about doing that i mean does i if i invest er a lump sum in my wife's name we've got to have opted for individual
no
taxation have we
no
no there's no such thing as individual taxation
th well what i meant was er what did i mean
i'm not sure
independent
independent taxation
independent taxation
well UNK all independent taxation is it isn't an option it simply means that a wife from ninety one two is independent of her husband for all tax purposes
oh right
that's
all
automatic is it
automatic
oh right you see yeah
and from that day
never think about these things
from that day a wife's
right
a wife's income is not included in her husband's return
right
you do not now show your wife's
right
income
she is required to have an UNK a return of her own
right so i don't need to do anything for that
you don't need to do anything you simply you simply move your money into an account in your wife's name
in me wife's name
gives her income and it's balanced by her allowances and if you move not sufficient to for the income to exceed that then at the same time it goes into a bank or building society you apply for them not to UNK income
right you just fill a form in
at the building society or the bank or
you just fill a form in
yeah
building societies and bank and further
thank you
further to that i don't know whether anybody's got a recent notice of UNK i did
can you help someone to get your tax back
they're asking me
can i help someone to get my tax back
the revenue is so desperate now because of this change in banks and building societies have left people not knowing what the situation is and er there are millions i'm not UNK there are twelve million over two million pounds is being spent by the revenue on a new tax back advert sorry i did UNK the idea is to remind about ten million people on all on low income that they could claim back tax which has been deducted from taxed savings
and it is men and women people on low income and children you know your so bear in mind your own children and grandchildren if they haven't got income up to three four five tell them to watch this deduction of tax from banks or building societies
there are also these privatization a lot of husbands and wives bought these shares of privatization had it in joint names well that tax will have been deducted and can be UNK also so er this was a change that came about with independent taxation
have i dealt with that
er interest rates are going up and down
yeah
if y you s say that the wife's income i is three four hundred erm and interest rates go up and then you go over
over
what happens then
well the er official answer is that you will be authorized to UNK the value of all
it's quite simple save the revenue UNK of pounds in er overtime payments over the years but that's what they are
there's a great range of them all sorts of different letters er merely er UNK certain types of person
anyway back to main point so up to retirement quite straightforward no problem at all and this is why he could have gone on for donkey years without a return of income his salary goes up of course it's picked up in the tax tables his personal allowances don't change so they could swan along there for so many years without even looking at his affairs but then see what happens in the very next tax year when he hasn't had a return and may not get a return for a couple of years
in this case he has and they've an and UNK of course for this example it's all been put into a statement
now he's become sixty five so as you remember he UNK for the larger age allowances he UNK for the larger married couples allowance so his total allowances are of course considerably increased by the fifteen hundred pounds
but then he had no adjustments to make here he'd no other income to collect but here he's got three sources of income to be collected out of his on the pension only
so in the first case they've given him the first place they've given him six five allowances but then they pull back the total of those three
it effectively charges it because if you've got six thousand allowances and you withdraw that amount putting it against the total income it means that you're actually paying tax on those by deduction
but that's how the revenue works out how t to collect income where it can't operate a separate pay as you earn UNK system it UNK some of the allowances and effectively charges tax
so straight away you see what's happened in this case his code becomes two eighty one h whereas previously we've got quite a high code and yet his total income is er not er comparative to the change in code numbers and this is what has that effect that all that tax on all this income has to be collected against his works pension thereby causing a lot of confusion and difficulty for er people becoming retired
and as i say that is er fairly straightforward
now on to this business of a part time job
if you are w going to work part time or full time in most cases there would be a separate UNK for it in this particular example it's an employment where they don't operate pay as you earn i if use my old phrase no longer applicable i suppose a corner shop
if someone were to work part time for a corner shop keeper who had no other employees there would be no way of collecting tax at that employment
but of course if he worked for UNK where they've got a vast labour force a vast pay as you earn scheme then any income would be taxed by UNK as a subsidiary source so there would be another code number there they would actually be collecting tax at two sources but they would still need to allocate allowances it may well be that at UNK for example they've covered that by allowances in which case they pull back five hundred pounds there to collect
or they may have charged the five hundred at twenty five percent in which case they needn't then make any adjustment on his code
but you can see whatever they do it is still an adjustment within that same basic outline
still this little bit of involvement at a time when you think life is going to be much simpler
so this is why i emphasize the fact that when you become retired your circumstances are all always going to change for the worse as far as adjustments are concerned
so use the opportunity get a return make them take a good look at you and then you know you're alright and can go on for another couple of years and make them look at you again
okay watching time cos it's amazing how much time goes
i mentioned erm benefits of er of exempt income and i showed er a feature with this and i apologize that the fact that's it's tessa but i do this with tessa because it's the one way that you can illustrate the point i want to make
and national savings and tessa some of them not all they operate this compound interest factor now you all know what is what compound interest is it's you get interest on interest
but the advantage of the er tax exempt bit is that with these you start getting interest on tax that you haven't payed
this is what happens with tax exempt sources and by looking at a tessa and assuming you pay the maximum each year which are those figures and assuming that the interest rate stays at seven and a half percent it won't but it's seven and a half percent at the moment then this is what happens at the end of the first year you've put in your three thousand your interest at seven and a half percent is two twenty five and you would otherwise pay tax at fifty six at twenty five percent or twenty or forty which would be those figures but you don't
but because you don't that amount hasn't been withdrawn from that two twenty five so that in the next year you put in your eighteen hundred and at the end of that year you get interest on three thousand eight hundred and of course the two twenty five which happens to be three seventy seven so at that second year you start getting interest on the fifty six pounds that you haven't been required to pay
and this is what happens with this as the years proceed you're getting interest on the previous year's interest which includes the tax that you would otherwise that would otherwise have gone from your account in paying into income tax
so that at the end of the five years assuming you've paid the maximum stake at seven and a half percent you would otherwise you would receive the nine thousand back of course and at that rate you would receive two six seven one and that will include if you're a twenty five percent payer six hundred and sixty seven that you would have otherwise lost in that would have gone out in tax
or if you're forty percent you would have actually paid a thousand and sixty seven but because you didn't pay that because it's tax exempt you actually gained that amount of interest on the tax that stayed in with your account
so the advice is and i'm not an investment advisor it's because of the exemption you must always take advantage of all tax exempt forms of savings before you look at anything else
you really should because you get those advantages
not with all national savings there are some that don't a apply the compound interest factor you get the interest at the end on the sum that you put in at the beginning
it's where you get the interest on interest throughout the years and would otherwise pay tax on that interest and don't and the amount that you haven't paid stays in and gets the UNK the same as the interest
right in thinking you can only have one tessa
you can indeed only have the one tessa
husband and wife can have two accounts
and you don't need to put in the whole amount but then if you don't put in the whole amount or you withdraw the net interest which you're entitled to do then you're pulling away the build up aren't you
you're stopping the you're stopping it building up
hello shan't be long just in time for a UNK
if you've missed a year can you put in twice the amount the following year
er
for instance if you've missed your eighteen hundred on year two if you put in three thousand six hundred
that's a good question i don't know i don't know
i think the answer is no because it closes whatever the anniversary of the day you started that's the year
yes
if you start the twenty fourth of april
right
it goes to the twenty fourth of april next year
twenty fourth of april
and then it you on that day
just noticed on my little notice the shop
did you know that there's a building society shop in nottingham
and it enables you to call in there and they will give you th the details of the best building society rates throughout the country
it's a shop they sell building society information and they will invest for it
but er you can call in and they
where is it
it's on
it's the building society shop they will tell you what the rates are and what are the best rates
you can say well i want to do put my money so and so what's the best rate for me
or er understand i'm not entirely certain about that they do the same with they will tell you which are the which are paying the best tessa rates
have to be careful because i'm not an investment advisor i'm simply talking about the benefits of the tax exemption
if that happens to be investment advice well then so be it
okay quick question
ever so quickly
we can we can have any further in s sorry we can have any further during the conclusion session which is this is where we tend run on okay
small business you're setting up as self employed
yeah
could we talk about that some time
i'll do i shall i do it conclusion
later
yes
i'm run out of time now
because i intended to make now erm short of time
but the afternoon session conclusion
one is as far as i can see is to do this where we fit where we're able to fit in subjects that er we missed so certainly we'll fit it in on the on the later session
i really did want to talk about being in business on your own account as opposed to er working for an employer
okay

i've been helping everybody who's took that flu and i think i've
at last at last it's reached you

oh too bad too bad
she goes in a
och sure you're worried about her
aren't you
sure you're worried about her
right okay cheerio now
cheerio
like normal people have their computers set up so that they print out
before i went out i
you muck it up
i printed out
on purpose
i printed out
didn't i
yes i know but from wor works
no i didn't print out from works i printed out from diary
i went into diary and i printed out my appointments for next week
and i didn't get funny numbers and silly UNK cos i used a reasonable package and not wordperfect
so what is your problem young lady
oh there's no problem with me
did you want to print did you want to print something
yes she's
yeah i'm writing a letter to mothers i'm writing a letter to mum and i just wanted it to be
she can read it from the screen she doesn't need it printed out
yeah but she wants to
i'll write a letter to chris
and other people
yes
right
well chris
not to other people
right
so would we like to try printing something out from wordperfect
save that now sarah
finished
no but you save it
before you finish
can i just finish my sentence please
right
so i know what i'm talking about
yes
have i got to finish my sentence
how did your lesson go
i don't know
i haven't had time to think yet i've only just got back in on the phone and sorting out the printer
it was alright it wasn't i wasn't
i wasn't looking forward to it much it was better than expected
i managed to c to cover virtually the complete g c s e chemistry course in an hour and a half
and actually it was more than an hour and a half
it was an hour and a half plus about ten minutes cos those c ninety tapes are about five minutes too long on each side
erm i'm afraid UNK gonna be a little later than i anticipated cos that chicken is quite big isn't it
mm
also we seem to be awfully short of knives
we are
i think they must in the van
i don't think so
i noticed there were very few there yesterday
i haven't got anything to do the vegetables with
there were some not too long ago but
well i think they're in the van john actually or you've used them to UNK paint with and other things
could be
secretary
is that how you spell UNK
yeah
yeah
ooh
i was going UNK
two more to go
john
right
okay
would you like to save that
do you know how do you know how to save it
no
how do you save it sue
well i do f ten but er that may be set up differently you see
everything has been changed
i would try f ten
just press f ten
yeah
mhm
if you don't know what to do right
right
now this is set up differently cos this is set up very sensibly so that you can fill in who wrote it when what date and what it's about and when you try and find it later it's easier to find instead of UNK through lots of files that don't have a long document
yes and also take long time if you do the sort of volume of work that i have to do
now that's true
okay
so the date document name
what do you want to call it
if you press n
n
n for name it'll let you type in the UNK document name
erm what do you want to call it
UNK
letter to mum
mum
UNK
call it UNK then
is that how you say it
UNK
well it's your word you spell it the way you want
no that's fine
m u m s y
that's fine
UNK
right
erm document type
oh so if you press enter it'll come down one line
enter
that big key on the side
or return
that one
yeah
and delete to get rid of the s m
that's it that's delete that one's UNK
right
and then if you put your initials
my initials
without the full stops
so that's it
shall i do it in UNK
if you if you wish
how about s l p
why does everyone want me to put l in
it's really
i only want you to cos it'll make it up to three
that's fine
enter
and then t for author
s l p
enter
you can guess who the UNK is
s l p
and what's the subject
s for subject
letter
UNK letter
letter
erm
okay
and k for key words
what are the key words
what are what's the main point of the letter what's it about
love
okay
UNK l u v or l a v as the young lady over here says
l o v e
i said love
did you love
enter
wicked woman and enter yes
thank you
what does abstract mean
now enter again
oh
now document to be saved c s u mark sarah dot mum okay
now enter again
don't blame me if this ridiculous replace existing
yes
press y
yeah
yeah
saving
and now try and print it
now do you know how to print
shift f seven
shift f seven
shift f seven
hold down shift and keep it down and press f seven
and let's try and print one page
right switch the printer on
cos we're just going to practice
switch your printer on
black button at the side
right
mhm
now press
i don't like these high technology things
then guess one for page
hang on it's two for page actually
one is document press
oh two okay yes
p for page
some of us use numbers and that's probably why the printer prints out in numbers
whereas i use letters
right and what have you got
right
in a code
got lots of exciting stuff there
so what sort of printer do you think you're talking to
i checked it says it's
a dumb one
printing to that one
right hold down shift f one
hold down the shift and press f one
i just did
oh do you want me to hold
you have to exit from that first if you want to
alright we'll use the
do a different thing
pardon
f seven
will that do
with shift or not
f
no just f seven on its own
save document
yes
save document
no
no
cos you've already saved it
right
you might as m exit wordperfect
no
right
i don't know if we're going to be able to print anything here but let's have erm f one for help
as it says up here press f one for help
press f one again
and these are your function keys and what they do so if you ever need to know what to do f one f one and it tells all you need to know
what do we want to do
set up
so shift and f one should give us set up so first of all press enter to exit help
now shift and f one
right do we want to set up the mouse to display the environment or what
i think it's environment
never know with this
try e for environment
erm units of measure UNK
no i don't think it's this do you
no
okay so
no it isn't
escape
sue might know but she's not telling us
erm
it's set up printer
right where is where does that come under mouse display environment initial UNK keyboard layout location of files
so we're in the wrong set up
so escape from this and we'll go into initial set up i think
f UNK
f one f one
shift f
oh okay
go on
okay which one do you think it is
try f one f one again and we'll get
shift and f one
it's no
no just f one f one
it isn't that
f one
right and that tells us
it's shift f seven
right shift f seven gives us print
okay
right okay
so
yes but it tells you all the facilities of print
so f seven
so UNK so enter to escape from help
enter to escape from that first
cos we're in help
and now shift f seven
sh shift
oh
f seven
i haven't she pressed shift there we are
right
then just
now you're trying to save a document now
you didn't do what you thought you were doing
it said save document and it had a y there meaning it was going to do that if you pressed enter
you pressed enter
it doesn't on yours it does all this before you can get into print
does it
yes it does john
isn't it a UNK
so what you just put there is nothing
enter
you delete it
just press enter there
right
document to be saved
i document to be saved i normally just do f ten
right
but when you do shift f seven for print on this it comes up with all this
this is a this is a UNK
jus just press enter and get out of this
error
access denied that's alright
erm escape
now try shift f se hold down shift and press f seven
and what did we want to do select printer looks like a good idea
it's
it's selected a UNK
okay try that
k x p eleven twenty four
okay so press s
i b m UNK x twenty four
now you've got your num lock on
with the num lock on every time you try and go to the cursor keys arrow keys you put peculiar numbers in instead
so take num lock off
go up one
and press enter and we'll now select an i b m UNK
that's done that and now print page
just
p
put p
put your printer on
switch your printer on
well it's not working very well
okay
well this morning i dropped in my UNK there copies of things that i printed out all lovely
well what's gone wrong then
we didn't do anything
did we
no
i've done did nothing different to what i normally do when i
when i normally do it and it didn't do what it normally does
i haven't touched anything
have i
no
no
do you want to have a go
well i'll just do a little trick
if you'd like to get into if you move over that way
now if you'd like to get into the print menu again
remembering how you did it with a little help from your friend over here
and set it back to a to a UNK k x p eleven twenty four which will be on the list
and sue will tell you how to do it
and i'll set this up so it thinks it's a UNK k x p eleven twenty four
won't i
shift f seven
yeah
what's it say
it says creation date document name document summary in other words
enter
document to be saved
okay just press enter
access denied
access denied
escape
oh
erm do f seven
shift as well
no
save document yes or no
yeah
enter
what does it say now
document summary
okay
do try and print it again
we're trying to sort it out
shift f seven four to resume printing
shift f seven four
right
so let's cancel the print job we've got in
should we
yeah
star is all jobs
all jobs just enter s
cancel jobs
cancel which jobs
star
three
cancel all the jobs
yes
now they should all be cancelled
and select printer
UNK k x p eleven twenty four and enter
okay
print page p
am i too heavy
no
no
and we've got that document in at the moment
we don't want that
so we'll use the big
exit wordperfect
yes
cancel print jobs
yes
so that's just got out of wordperfect
we'll have to get back into wordperfect and load your file
and print it
w p
f five
if you do end it should go down to the end
do you know the file number
no
right well let's start
wait a minute wait a minute
now just don't get UNK
pardon
don't get UNK
i hadn't noticed that i was
did you think it was me getting UNK
so if you can try and explain to sarah what you're doing she'll know how to do it next time
i don't know myself
ah well
so
the file extension the one which i saw was dot mum
so if you set file mask and look for files ending dot mum it should pull it out
it's nice and warm on that
mm
sit in the chair
sit on the chair
mother
sit on the chair
mum
well what
the file
why don't you sit on the chair and do it
come on
can i stick the telly on mum
you've created a used directory
you know i sometimes find with some of my students it is very UNK to have their mother in on the lessons
you know they get all UNK sometimes
yeah i know you find it hard to believe but they do
have you found that file yet
no
would you like me to find it
have you got any idea what you called it
sarah
why don't you use ferret and find any files written today
so if you come out of wordperfect
well it might
if you UNK has that been UNK up with that in
how do you mean
no
the UNK switched on when that's pressed in
cos i haven't checked your
no
UNK thing for UNK
no
okay
right
no save get out of wordperfect
it's rubbish wordperfect
isn't it
right
you just enter
jus just ferret and it'll tell you what to do
make sure you're in c colon backslash
are you
no
well it doesn't make a lot of difference but er it might be an idea to be in c colon backslash
and then what do you do
set a floppy disk
do i just do c colon
c d space backslash enter
and your prompt now says check that your prompt is c colon backslash
set a floppy so it can be written to in drive a
ferret needs to know the date a file was written
so you now type f three will do instead of typing ferret
no sorry
yeah type ferret
and then today's date which is
backslash
no
space
space
today's date which is
o nine
o nine
o nine slash no not backslash slash
o nine slash o four slash ninety three
and that should find all files written today
it'll pull out quite a lot of erm
now just say no
it's in the instructions there say no to all these
but if a file comes up that looks like UNK file and you fancy copying it to that floppy you can say yes and it'll copy it on there
okay
and the other thing is were you running from the hard drive or from that floppy cos i didn't want the tape recorder travelling
people are like
right you don't want that one
or that
or that
have you got the right date
well hang on don't get rid of that what's on the screen
w p fifty one
well press f three
is it the ninth of the fourth
did you check the date
is it the ninth of the fourth ninety three today
friday april the ninth
which is the ninth of the fourth eighty three in english format
okay
i wonder if it does it in american format
it's always worked before
right it's going to do it ninth of the fourth ninety three
okay mirror file
no
you could sit down if you want
i prefer this cos it makes my back UNK
okay
mirror back
no
and it's off through the directories now
works UNK
no
works alarm
no
anything in works
no
p f m
no
these are all my diary files p f m
so that's another no
anything in p f m
oh wait a minute perhaps it was on the a drive
perhaps it was
it's not p f m
not that
or that
or that
no
saying no
try the a drive is that okay
well i'll try the a drive
erm i don't know how ferret works on the a drive
oh i've used it on the a drive before
is there a copy of ferret on that
i don't know
i don't know on that
oh okay i've got an idea how to use ferret i think
carry on
right
so if you change to the a drive
erm just a colon
oh
right and now if you type i don't know where ferret is
erm try ferret and today's date
ferret space today's date and see if it can find anything
right erm version of ferret okay
so let it go
let's look it up on c drive
erm no we don't want that so just keep saying no
or you can do control and c and it'll finish it off
hold down control press c and that UNK the batch file
right i will have a little look do you want to have a little look
i'll have a look
on the a drive d i r
oh dear
no backslash i'm sorry slash i'm sorry about that
d i r slash s which gives you sub directories
yeah
erm slash o minus d
that one should be o not zero
slash order minus d which is reverse date order

you've got one called sarah dot mum
and that's the back
which you and you've given it an extra name of UNK s l p
right and you can load that file
you've also got a back up file called sarah dot p k UNK
which it saves just in case we had any accidents and lost any of our files anywhere
so if you'd like to bring it down to UNK sleep
with the cursor key
that's it and enter
and then enter
to load that file
but that doesn't load it that just has a look doesn't it

remember how to print things
finished it
oh haven't you
doesn't matter we'll just try we'll just do a little
right okay right okay
we're testing the printer at the moment
what do we do to print
we press f one f one
f one
f one
f one
and then up there
and press
to see which one to print
f seven
right
no shift f seven
right
top one is control the next one is alt
that's your control key
and that one is shift
yeah
which you mustn't touch unless you're very sure of what you're doing
okay
the control key
so that one is print f seven
so first of all enter to get out of help and remember that you want
cos you're in help
shift f seven
so you press shift f seven and
and
you press two for page
no p for page even
i do two
so we'll get into
we've got lots of letters
we've got lots of letters
we'll get into the
print set up
print set up
right
f seven
and again
no
oh
okay try
and again
okay and again
enter
and again
oh yes
yeah good girl
erm
ooh ah i've just so what are we doing
i don't know but i'm getting pretty fed up with this
okay well we're supposed to be getting into selecting the printer
you seem to be looking for a file and you should be selecting
i'm it's a very i'm not used to this set up here and i i'm
there's very little difference in what you're doing now
well there is a fair bit john because i don't seem to have all this round about way at work to be honest with you
well
you don't do it properly at work
well i'm used to it now
so that's the way i like it
okay
retrieve
and that's right
right
now
f seven
you want to set up the printer
okay
right now press
select printer
is that what you mean
right so press s for select printer
and we're on an h p UNK two d for some reason
well that's the one i've got at work you see
right
right so
which is this is not an h p UNK two d
that's not a laser printer
it's picking up its printer driver from your disk which you had in which
yeah
is why we're having a lot of problems with this
alright okay
so if we set your disk
now before you do anything if we set it to pick up the UNK k x p eleven twenty four
mhm
from there
mm
it'll muck up your disk for work
and when you try and print out on your h p UNK two d
oh that's right
you will get rubbish coming out like this
that's right
so what i suggest is that we
we copy it
copy that file that we've got loaded
so don't bother about selecting printer
let's leave
leave it on the UNK
the printer there as it is
and we'll escape from that okay
we'll escape from that and we won't do anything
we've got the file ready now
so let's save it
on the c drive
okay
yeah
and then we'll print it from the c drive with wordperfect loaded from the c drive
cos when you loaded this you were in the a drive
yeah okay
okay
so save your file
i'm glad you know
save your file again
okay
right so f seven
f seven or i do f ten

and
c
and enter
well that was quick it saved it on the c drive
that's very quickly it went on to the hard

yeah
so come out of wordperfect now
f seven
save document
no
save document

exit wordperfect
yes
you said no
you have to read what's at the bottom
so do f seven again
okay and read what's at the bottom
okay save document

okay
and we come out of wordperfect now
so
yes
you want to exit wordperfect
y
y for yes and why not
and that comes out of that
now we take that floppy out

oh right yeah
okay
and enter
enter
and now have a look at your prompt and we're on the c drive and we're in the root directory
i do i know i sends UNK down your UNK
now if you'd like to type if you jus just carry on don't mind us this often happens
yeah
if you if you UNK like to type w p for we're perfect

and you have to come into it
there you go
right go down to mum
go down to mum
now r
r
now end
and now you can
and now
f one f one to see how you print
and what do you use to print
erm shh enter to get out of help
okay
yes
well first of all before you get there
well shh UNK let her speak
enter to get out of help
yes
and then shift and f seven
good girl
excellent
and then you go to pa
two
two
page two
oh page sorry yes
much easier to remember than two
the figures
ooh
and we're still not printing
i would think that your UNK version of wordperfect is thinking it's an h p UNK
yeah
right
so if you'd like to get out of come out of word oh first of all
i think i'd better go and check the chicken now
UNK let's select printer
so f one f one to tell us what we use to select the printer
do you know my hot
which is the
mm so's mine actually
shift f seven
so enter to get out of help
shift f seven
and select printer
and select printer
because this has all been UNK up too
this
right
also thinks it's an h p UNK two d now
so let's set that
bring it down a bit to a UNK k x p eleven twenty four
yeah
and enter
right it should now
page
and now if you try and page it might work
i don't know
ah there we are
now it's all because somebody has been messing about with
wasn't me
all that messing about getting the printer to change was came from not knowing where you are
that's enough of that
yeah
so that works
as long as we know now that it works
that works
erm
i want to finish off the letter now anyway
the UNK looks a bit erm a bit silly doesn't it
so we'd better we'd better sort that out a bit
erm first of all we'll get this ready for head of the form
so we'll just use the line feed one at a time
until it comes up to the next page
and we want that there's the head of the page
we want that just about on the black line
right
at the bottom of the black
so just there
right
and we put that in cos otherwise that'll come down and get UNK in the printer head
right
now at the moment it's still got its headed form set up here somewhere
so switch the printer off
and when you switch the printer back on wherever it is when it's switched on it thinks that's the head of the form
that's the top of the piece of paper
right
so switch it on again now
and next time you print it should think it's a k x p eleven twenty four and it should think it's at head of form and print everything out beautifully
so i can finish off the i want to finish off the letter now
now on that letter how was it printing out
you've got margins set at looks like one point three inches on the left and one inch on the
yeah
that's okay
erm have you put UNK in here or spaces
erm
if you do f eleven it'll show all the characters
it shows you what you've got here
you've got hard returns soft returns soft returns so you've got spaces in here
erm did you want your spaces in
i mean some of them have got spaces and some of them haven't
well it was like a new paragraph but i didn't leave a line
new paragraphs
oh okay
so if you go down to where you've got new paragraphs and just do enter
blank line if you'd like to go down and first of all f eleven to gen to get rid of these codes
yeah
and then you've got it back the way it was
you can just come down to everywhere you want a new
using this cursor
yeah using that
or that one or the mouse
now home
erm now what have you got there
have you got spaces
take out that
to there
er don't take it to the i
leave it to the
leave it set hard against the left
don't bring it over to the first character leave it exactly where it is
because
why
otherwise you'll put a few spaces then a new line and this will go
right so you just press enter
okay
and the bring it down
mhm
UNK version at work is set up very UNK
mhm
erm now right now see what you did
end will take you to the end of that line
if you press delete
right
now what you did silly thing
you where there and you pressed enter
what that does it puts a blank line in immediately before that word
you want the blank line there
oh right yeah
before the other
okay
right
okay
okay
and if you press end it should take you to the end of the line
alright okay i'll just finish it off
take your time
you can do a UNK of it
what do you mean
erm can you remember how to do print
yeah
what was that
erm n no f seven shift
or was it UNK
f seven
shift f seven good
okay shift f seven
and now
select printer
view document
v
no don't select printer
oh
cos we've had problems with that
v for view document
that's what your UNK going to look like when it's printed
alright yeah
so you've got nearly a page there so you could
yeah
put another paragraph or something in
yeah
and then it'll be ready for printing out
alright
so if you escape you'll actually while you're in there if you want to have a look at two hundred percent
try two for two hundred percent
you can read it a bit more easily
oh
if you escape
erm after that dear mum okay escape again
back into your document and we'll go up a bit
dear mum end
and put another new line in there
you should have a new line
what enter
yeah
right
okay
and now get down to the end of the document
alright
you can do it quickly with page down page down
right
erm and i use that one to go onto a new line don't i
right
erm
yeah
mhm
erm
now do you want a blank line
yeah
so another new line another enter
oh right
these two keys produce exactly the same effect
okay yeah
they both enter new lines
right
erm
now do you mind if i read this or not
would you rather i didn't read it
no i don't mind no i don't mind
okay
i'll show you how to spell check it
just gen general gossip really
we're just going to spell check it now
just finishing off
we've had a UNK to see what it looks like
it fits on the page
as well is it two words or one
two words
two words
well it's my day off tomorrow from cooking
i know i was just gonna quickly do this and i'll come and help with your dinner
so enter
i think it's quickly done itself actually
it u usually does
erm ooh gone too far there
erm
try tab it's much quicker
where's tab
oh
tab
i think sarah would pick this up quite quickly you know
i think she would pick it up ver is picking it up quite quickly
yes
erm
and would do very well at it if it was a sensible package and not the UNK wordperfect
yes it isn't it really john
no
i mean i'm fairly used to what i've got at work now
because i virtually use all the same functions all the time you know
yeah
capital xs
it's alright leave that
you're going to write sarah
yeah
okay so let's
bring it back to the top
just spell check the whole document
so f one f one
and where's it tell you about spell checking
erm
i can't even see
oh sorry f two
right
it's control f two
okay so it's f it's the top one of the four
which and this one tells you how to interpret them
so and they're all in different colours as well
so it's control and f two
so first of all have read the instructions on the screen
press enter to help
control and f two
right
mm
and now again the instructions are on the bottom line
you've told it to spell check
do you want to spell check one word a page the whole document or what
the page
no
we'll do the whole document
oh right
so d for document
right now forty two a
okay ignore that
skip
ignore numbers
it's skip on that john it's not ignore
so i just press two
right well hang on there was a little difference of opinion there
ignore numbers will ignore all numbers throughout the document and in case there are any others in there
skip will just skip what we were ignoring
so skip again
skip
it's saying sussex isn't a word that i know about
oh right
it's not in its dictionary
it doesn't mean it's spelt UNK
did you put the words in
no
oh
and press two again
yeah
yeah
and again
and it'll find the next so skip again for ninth
it's right now it's suggesting words
oh it's oh yeah
i got it wrong
right so which do you think it should be
a
a
okay so if you type a it will put weird in
now UNK what are you going to do with that
erm nothing cos it's right
yeah skip
right coursework
i think you can put it as one word if you like
it probably wants it UNK but we'll just say skip if you're happy with the spelling
halt
okay yeah
yeah that's right
is right
that's right
no
got a UNK
yeah it hasn't didn't have a UNK but argue that's okay
now how do you spell keyboard
let it suggest oh it's not suggesting anything
well isn't that weird
it hasn't got any suggestion for keyboard
right so we'll have to come back to keyboard and you can change it i think
can you edit
four
yes
so you just move your cursor along
after that o and before the r
how do you spell UNK then
it's got an a in
before between the o and the r
oh of course it's a isn't it
and again or do i put a
and again
and then put a
and you have to insert it before where you've got the cursor
so put the a in before the r
but you don't want a capital
UNK
UNK delete
okay
UNK wrong
exit when finished
you know it's a very helpful thing it doesn't tell what exit is
so you're stuck there for life unless a young lady from the audience can help us out here
oh you just
exit it says
press exit
we've finished editing we want to get back in
f seven
okay
no
you've got your f eleven up have you
no
no it's still going
it does that in spell checking
now i
okay
so you can skip that now
and it's checked the lot
mm
so independence was right
yeah
okay
and it's found it's found most of your spelling errors and it's counted the words for you
there were four hundred and fifty three
god it's like an essay
an essay
now one of the things it didn't do was it didn't pick any of your UNK errors out
mm
erm what it counts as a spelling error is if the word isn't in the dictionary it's a spelling error
now if you use t h e i r when you should be using t h e r e
oh yeah
it doesn't throw it out as a spelling error cos it counts it
oh right because it's a recognized word
yeah
but you can get grammar UNK which would check that and throw it out and say that's not right
so any key to continue
and you do have a t h e r e or something up there
so if you go if you page up several times to get to the start of the document
page up
which is that one
oh sorry
okay page up
now somewhere i think near the beginning there was a there
so it's not in that lot so page down to the next one
erm right when there are is that correct
no
no
so put your cursor on the i
get rid of the i r
oh
okay that was a space
so UNK delete to get rid of the space you've just put in
use your cursor to come along
that's it
and delete
oh
then go along one and
alright and bring the cursor down
now there was an aren't somewhere that you had
erm or a can't
the aren't was okay
haven't
haven't
there
right okay
so right
and that looks okay so page up to the start of the document
and now save it
because you've now got it the way you want it
oh right yeah
you've just checked it all
so you can save that
remember how to save
no
f one f one
f one yeah
f one f one
and now where's save in that lot
erm f ten
now so but you're still in
enter i can
en you're in help so
never remember that
okay now then n long document name UNK still UNK
enter
so enter yeah
still s l p
save it on that
yes
now what you're trying to do is UNK the old version that we had
mhm
it says replace this one you've already got one called that do you want to write this on top of it
in this case we do
but sometimes
yeah
you might not
so if you just press if you if you pressed enter it's got the no highlighted so it wouldn't automatically replace it
cos it's trying to be safe
mm
the default the thing it'll do if you don't select something is no
mm
so you have to change that deliberately by typing a y
right
so press y
so save it say y and it'll save it
so that's saved now
if we mess up the printing we've still got that and we can come back to it
right
and try and print again
okay
so now you can turn the printer on
it's on
is it on
right excellent
and try printing it
right
remember how to print
erm no
f seven
that's very
shift f seven
good right
right set
and this time we'll
printer
we'll have a UNK first
that just have a look to see if it looks okay
and we're on let's have a look at the full page
three
that looks fine
that looks okay doesn't it
right
okay so escape
escape
to get out of the UNK
and then we want to print full document
so one
or f is easier to remember for full document
p for page d for disk c for control
was in here
well what
i don't know
feet
feet
what was what was wrong with your little bit of wordperfect
oh it's n cos it's not like at work where things don't go wrong at work for me any more
pardon
you were saying that the problem you the big problem you had at work was with your printer drivers
no not any more i don't
it's the same problem you had there
not any more i don't
well
cos you know about avoiding changing printers
so the problem was caused with bringing a disk from one machine to another
mhm
i know
with a different driver on it yeah
but apart from that apart from the printing let's forget about the printing aspect
how did you get on with the rest of it
what did you think of it complained last time
no but if i if i talk by myself it's going to
so
sound really false isn't it
yes
how did you get on with the word processing this afternoon then sarah
who suggested that you that you should have a go
mother
what did she UNK how did she how did she suggest it
erm well she said would you like to go on the computer and i said fine okay
so she showed me her bits and UNK and things like that
the hardware the keyboard and things
yeah
how to turn it on
yeah
what else did she show you
erm basically how it works
erm
how does it work
how do you turn it on
erm by the switch by the telly
so how many switches to switch it on
i didn't go i didn't go through a proper sort of UNK thing
i honestly didn't i just brought it up
oh i'll let it be known that your mother is a very good UNK
she's good at teaching people all sorts of things nice and calm and patient
not like some who are shouting shift f seven and shut up and you know the sort of person
she's not like that at all
she's lovely
make a good tutor
there's elaine UNK
i didn't i didn't do any
on telly
there's elaine UNK
i didn't do anything really john
i just brought up the files
and went really straight into sarah typing
so you set up wordperfect so she with a blank screen for sarah to type on
and a new document
did you set did you choose the document name
erm yes i did
i thought that i'd created a new directory but i didn't
you used
thank you were on the you were on a drive
so you typed you set it up
and nobody noticed that it said a colon and not c colon
cos nobody ever reads the bottom line with the poor computer
well i do
trying to talk to you and tell you something
i do it's just that i
people are just interested in shouting at it aren't they
no i was just
simply just not UNK much on the screen really
right
sarah just wanted to type a little letter
mm
i didn't actually feel in the mood to show her
ah well
bits and all
answer that question
well i thought i was going to have the computer here for the whole time of UNK stay you see
well one of these days
so i thought that there was plenty of time as this is my first day off from work
tonight
this is
i didn't want to be thrust straight into it
tonight i'm going to transfer wordperfect from that one from the three eight six to the x t so you'll be able to find it
okay
so when you started typing how did you put the address in
oh that was a bit of fun wasn't it
i thought that would be a bit of fun
how did i do
how did you put the address
the address
in
forty
getting across to the right hand side
erm i moved the cursor
mhm
yeah she did a load of UNK to start with
oh yes and then i done i did er i put forty two a north and then i went to put street and i wrote it in typed it in but it went underneath forty two a
and i thought ooh so
that was clever
i shouted mum
you set up set an UNK then
no but the street was in the wrong
or a hanging paragraph
was not on the same line
no but it was it immediately below the forty two
yes
mm
so you set up some sort of UNK
if you press f four
right if you're doing something just doing a straight bit of text which
mm
was just straight typing
mm
and then you suddenly want to UNK which is say come in five s five spaces
yeah
five space
yeah
bars to set it in
mm
if you press f four from the margin f function f four key
yeah
it sets in automatically five spaces
yeah
right
and it UNK round
right
so it gets to the end of the line and it will come back and adjust itself and go under the
yeah
the
the first line
yeah
UNK
mm
all the way down until you don't want it any more
mm
and then you put a return in at the end of that and it goes back to the margin again
okay
it's clever that
what do you think of the little hearts every time you put an enter
i wondered what was going on
by the end of the time when i er did the address i had about ten hearts all over the screen
well with most word UNK
so i did f eleven and revealed the codes and deleted it all
very good
mm hard software and s
i showed her that
yes we tried that
and software
hard return and soft returns
hard return soft return
yeah
well with most word UNK you don't use return you just keep typing and it automatically says well i won't fit this
it UNK round that's the expression
wrap round
mhm
and that set up still
most word UNK won't show when you've got a new line character
when you press enter it stores a character in your file
it says right get on to a new line
most of them don't show it but you can set it to show it
so i've set that one to show it
okay
oh stop UNK my fat
UNK your fat what
i'm not
UNK
i'm just UNK
can you make it clear
hip
for the tape that it was not i what squeezed your UNK
fat or otherwise
it was her there
it was i
so a lot of problems just getting the address in
not really
oh no
oh no
well let's say let's say was it quicker was it would it have been quicker writing the address by hand
oh yeah it wa it wasn't a big thing that was a major mistake
it's alright it's alright
not getting it right first time
it's all about learning basically isn't it
exactly
you learn by mistakes that's
it's all learning yeah
right i did
in every aspect of life
that's right
life is learning
learning is life
life means learning
once you got started
life is hassle
life is problems
when
opportunities
and once you got started typing the main part of the letter you were alright then
mm
just about
i just whip UNK away
took about an hour and a quarter to do but there you go
actually
can you remember how many words you did
four hundred and fifty three
i did show you how to do
how did you find out
you tried to catch me out there didn't you
you said how many words did you do
four hundred and fifty three
no
pardon
i did show sarah how to do the UNK to delete when she made a mistake instead of
mm
instead of leaving it
well not only instead of leaving it but using she wasn't quite sure she was pressing delete and
it did no i had an e on the er
delete does work
the cursor i had an e on the
delete does work if you use
it UNK
the cursor key in fact
delete will delete
whatever character is at the cursor at the moment
UNK delete or UNK one and then delete
onto the character
oh yeah
right
i'm going out now
cos i remember you saying on the x t that the delete key wouldn't work
UNK delete
what are you going to the UNK
yeah i just want to get some orange juice
i'll come with you
is that alright
it's fine
can you take this home so you can finish off the tape
preferably talking about wordperfect
or something structured
we've only got about three minutes to go on that
and it's half nine now
so what did you think of the session altogether
what did you think of having two
i think
two tutors at one time
well
did you think that worked
no probably it didn't i mean
right
you see the thing is
confusing because you've got two people bringing in the ideas
yeah well you see john's got about twenty five years' experience with computers on me
i'm still a UNK sarah
no i'm just saying it's harder for me it was harder to have two people UNK me because i you were coming in with suggestions that you know already you weren't like then john was coming in
i know i know yes i'm sure i'm sure but you kno that's right
but in actual fact i think that for preliminary erm instruction i'm i would be better
because i wouldn't confuse sarah with a lot of UNK
what was the main point
but
in your session
me
mm
the session that you started with sarah what was the main
oh because i didn't tell her enough about the keyboard and the
why did it all go wrong
why was it wrong when i came in
well because i always feel that you want to
no before i came in it was wrong
you couldn't print
no it wasn't
you couldn't print
oh i see what you
so
mean oh you're talking about i thought you meant
how why had that why had that gone wrong
what do you mean why had it what do you mean why had it gone wrong
what had caused it
why wasn't it printing
oh because i was on th i UNK it all
and it
okay cos it cos it started
drive
off on an a drive
yeah
and it was picking up printer drivers from the a drive
mm
not a very intelligent package
a load of rubbish
i mean i er i mean i had a lot of trouble
what do you think of it compared to UNK word
today
sort of when i first started using it at work
mm
i was always getting it
what's that
that's all right it's what
bit scary isn't it
okay so has anybody had a chance to look at some of the things er
okay so if you want to talk about what you've got
was it you two who were gonna go UNK and UNK who were gonna do the talk
hang on you can
you can
i can get
chip in
chip in
you all the responses and things like that
say i agree with that
and i'll keep quiet and all to myself
okay go for it
are we still doing anything about i've got to i've got some UNK information about
yeah
first
i've got this yeah look
ah no we haven't discussed it yet
oh superb
we'll discuss that after you've took a look at
when's your interview
next week
er it's supposed to be due in friday week three
but i think sometime during week four
oh that's good thank you
yeah
right so the thing is if we talk about what you've read and then the idea is that if there's anything out of you've read that's given you an idea for an essay then you can do that
thank you
and if not we can think of something more specific afterwards
but we'll go through what you've read first and then try to work something
a definition sort of
says it ready to make UNK judgements about personality e g you can tell he's anxious by his voice is in inverted commas or she sounds very strong minded
and this type of UNK link has led to various experiments
at the first experiment of er i think of this kind it was er in nineteen sixty
who had done it already despite the english french UNK and how they felt about each other
and er they felt had little prestige and that the french peop the french canadian speakers had little prestige in their own language
but er e english er UNK were favoured more than the french ones even by the french themselves
and er o despite that sort of just said something about the
procedure but we'd already done that
so
there wasn't really there wasn't really a great deal of er sort of stuff here but it was more about sort of language and shifts so i had to like shift through it and find the bits
right
that were more er
well these sort of languages often considered to be the central UNK to group UNK and er official agencies like government an and things like historically support group language UNK
and er a although we usually associate language identity with minority groups linked with minority groups er it's quite important that we don't erm dismiss the UNK it has in majority groups as well
and it quotes quote from nineteen eighty four
who says that the best UNK of future social behaviour is past social behaviour all things being equal and er as any assessment of UNK of a UNK scene will profit from an historical awareness
anyway er
oh yeah that's right
it says he believed that the historical awareness will help any UNK scene to profit
an analysis of what people have done is likely to be useful not only in UNK what they're likely to do but also what their UNK needs are
he's just saying that in a group if we look at the historical background of the language it helps to see you know how what the strong points are of the UNK and what we need to be UNK on
er if we're to understand the dynamics of language in our density and how it exists in the minds of ordinary speakers we must consider the real life record
so he looks at island and america
he looks at island er and the irish language and in america he looks at UNK e UNK and the value of the historical record in each
erm he also states that the UNK of language does not mean the UNK of an identity
and essentially identity UNK around the idea of political boundaries and groups
and language and identity is not UNK er UNK link
so if you know language and identity need not be together cos identity is er essentially political as opposed to UNK
but is common that they both are together in that way
er right he says on the subject of UNK of identity and language and why and why not language is maintained he UNK and the UNK and na UNK speakers
vis a vis UNK
UNK served as a UNK for jews
and na UNK did for the jews
when the UNK of UNK thus becoming the language of israel UNK and na UNK became somewhat redundant and er in his survey of america
in his study of UNK in his study of m the u s he found that seventy five percent of the s people who spoke na UNK couldn't give a reason er a proper reason for passing their language on to the er children
because i they though it was in competition with other varieties around and it something t it wasn't necessarily to do with the fact that erm they though it was less it held less prestige in the community
it was just that erm the other varieties around were competing too heavily against it so they thought what's the point of passing it on to the children
and er let's think that's it on that
i think
cos there wasn't really much
okay
on it
i did the maastricht one well as which is a bit more to do
the maastricht you know
yeah tell us a bit about it cos
okay this was a bit better this
right the situation in maastricht up till the nineteenth century was that it was described as a di or UNK erm UNK community
with french and standard dutch as competing high varieties and the dialect of maastricht as a common variety
which is like the third of the UNK
what was it german and french
no french and standard dutch
and maastricht was the common variety
and er the dialect today whenever this experiments was which year it was but it said today
the dialect is still very unlike dutch itself on levels of UNK and UNK itself
you know it doesn't it doesn't like look too much like the standard dutch
and a funny thing is it's not limited to social class within holland itself
i it seems to be functional so you know you get like lawyers and farmers and all sorts of people using it
so it's a the tests it was a match UNK experiment and the tests er tested sixty four people who were aged the ages were fifty five plus thirty to forty five and fifteen to twenty
they were sort of equally distributed in those ages
and er process was er match UNK so it was you know they were list they listened to three different people well th they thought it was three people it was one person doing three ac the three accents er UNK sorry
and er it was the process was analyzed on a list of personal tracks
and er oh there was one other thing
the match UNK results were interesting because instead of the typical prestige of the standard language and the UNK of a UNK you know a if you did r p and say er UNK you'd probably get people saying that their r p was prestigious but the UNK was sort of more you know y more friendly and more attractive accent
er it was found that the status items were about the same for both
so there wasn't a great difference bet the status items of things like honesty and er leadership and stuff like that
the items weren't greatly different on scores between they had a little graph
but st standard dutch won on leadership but the other status items shows sort of scores that were very close to each other and they're not significantly different
that was it
okay that's
okay what have you
got a bit from erm the match UNK erm it helps to show the stage in attitudes
how they were towards peoples of other languages or language varieties
erm you know it just says about how they carry it out about subjects assumes that er the samples
and judgements are made on intelligence personality and UNK and particular UNK and although they're only limited speech samples erm many subjects judge them
erm
sorry what were the erm things that related to personality
intelligence and UNK and particular UNK
and then it was saying about quantitative and qualitative measures
quantitative measures may allow a discovery of pattern in the situations which might otherwise merely be seen as random variation
not really talking about the issues just
yeah i mean if you're looking at quantitative things it's really you know how much actual how much variation happens whereas qualitative is you know what the actual variations
UNK
UNK
you know what the actual quality of the variations are
okay
erm
judging occupational UNK a hierarchy and what this is must be determined erm differently for every culture being investigated
and second one is a book by
UNK and he sheep says about the canadian UNK social UNK
w e UNK who was the one that match UNK technique erm and basically he's just kind of saying about the technique that it shows UNK between the degree of UNK ability and UNK
erm and it's sort of erm features that are expressed er like intelligent and then intelligent er it UNK to what extent subjects perceive speakers in a particular language as having desirable or UNK with which they may or may not wish to identify
erm and this technique can trigger UNK shared UNK images of a UNK community and reveal the degree of UNK erm for the different erm languages
and then the other one is the one that i got from the library by UNK
erm that's a b bit too but it's about UNK english
UNK
okay
UNK then
erm
who's this book by
UNK l u h m a double n
UNK english is one of the surviving non standard regional UNK of english in the united states and it's associated with the residents of the UNK mountain range
erm it's a community isolation because is like mountains around which makes barriers against physical mobility that can't really be moved round that easily
erm so they just kind of stay put and so the UNK because it's just such a physical it's in physical and social isolation
erm and then it's talking about standard variety that it's usually the standard variety that's accepted as the proper one when compared to other like smaller varieties erm UNK and stuff
the low status UNK are associated with UNK negative prestige
erm UNK english UNK from standard american english in grammar UNK and UNK
erm and then just generally language is far more than just a means of communication
it UNK our social experience and UNK us with social groups from which we draw our UNK
erm and none standard language varieties are associated with those social status groups erm they acquire status evaluation their speakers
erm the speakers on the samples are either UNK or bi UNK and erm the UNK listed are in between standard american english and the eastern UNK sub dialect of UNK english
there's four bi UNK speakers two males and two females erm who are also actors and UNK speakers UNK of UNK erm and then it g and then it goes into the different factors of UNK english
but we don't really need to go into that do we
no
erm oh and here's a quote
in almost any country standards speakers and non standard speakers view the former as more successful intelligent ambitious wealthy and educated
the status of items that were looked at er educated and UNK intelligent UNK wealthy poor successful unsuccessful and ambitious and UNK
and solidarity items were UNK good bad sympathetic UNK friendly UNK honest dis UNK and UNK and UNK
erm they were eight speech samples
without taking a breath
erm and they were also asked where the where they though the speaker was from
so the results that were got is that the UNK speech was high in solidarity and low in status
and the standard english was high status and low solidarity
so the UNK of UNK english speakers is that they're not very intelligent they've got a lack of ambition and success and a poor education
erm and the two the two females in the solidarity UNK they it was constant the d there wasn't any change erm across the two UNK but with the males there was a significantly higher score in solidarity when they were in the UNK
erm so the er UNK people were erm not am ambitious and not educated wasn't it
low intelligence lack of ambition and success and poor education
that's about it
oh the UNK serve to strengthen ethnic identification and group boundaries
in such social UNK differences become important boundary UNK that require careful UNK
good
you said that some of their actual differences in speech
yeah
erm it's talking about UNK reduction
what does it say
what reduction
UNK
UNK
yeah
is it an UNK
yeah UNK of the off UNK on a word such as my which becomes ma
okay so
the sound at the end of my er it would seem to have like a UNK
what's the difference between a UNK and a UNK
er i not really sure it depends on what you mean in that particular context
i mean in som in some ways in the word my it might have part of that symbol you write with a j in it
you know might be part of a actually a UNK rather than a vowel
and it could be the fact that maybe that's getting reduced
and as i say they would
erm
they just that was the only example they gave and said that as the word
well it well it could b
right i mean it could be that the th the UNK from first vowel in the UNK to the second one and that that's gone off so you're left wi with a
no yeah
i guess it's probably just that he UNK up to the second part of the UNK has been UNK so you've just got the first part of it left
mm
so it's a single vowel
then another thing was UNK ing
that erm instead of saying UNK they pronounced it as just n
in words such as building UNK and nothing it would just be an n on the end like UNK
erm they dropped the final UNK in a co if there was like a UNK cluster at the end of the wor word
so instead of saying kept they'd just say UNK
erm of a UNK erm like x in except so they'd just say except
erm and of initial like instead of saying them they'd say just say em
erm oh yeah UNK of a for what's that with an a and a u
er ow
ow
which makes yeah which makes for of our and are
UNK of i for e so instead of forget you know i for e so instead of saying forget you'd say UNK
and
rising pitch in UNK sentences
that's all
right okay
have you got anything
yeah
go back to UNK bar
do you still do this title an all
erm i think so
what are we going to do
what's the
right
UNK gonna be
well there's three there's three different ways of going about it i guess you could do
a UNK just come through the
oh god
when you left the door open the wind just blew
said it in
it in
right
erm
three ways to do an UNK
we should return to that book
oh right
sorry
na don't worry
i did the one from the book list that was erm giles and howard
aha
no i didn't
i did which one did i do yes i did
you did
giles
well erm he's talking erm language convergence like erm shifting your sides match
as people are like
erm convergence erm they describe as individuals shift their speech styles to become more UNK that of those with whom they are UNK
and the UNK they make are made on several different levels erm they might become more UNK in their language in their pronunciation their rate of speech their pause or UNK length and their UNK
mm
nothing
and erm also in what they're saying the UNK of their self UNK
what they actually say themselves i suppose
erm and it's talking about this er accommodation theory UNK accommodation theory which has one main assumption erm that all the things i've just mentioned about pronunciation and speech rates and things erm they all occur in order to encourage more interaction between the two speakers
erm so in assuming that in these sort of situations the speaker and the UNK erm quote share a set of interpreted procedures which allow speakers intention to be UNK by the speaker and correctly interpreted by the UNK
erm then it talks about similarity attraction processes erm and there's theory similarity attraction process theory proposes that quote the more similar our attitudes and UNK are with others the more likely it is we'll be attracted to them
erm and speech convergence is one of the many methods of becoming more similar to another person so that you erm get rid of your UNK differences
erm
so was that the convergence theory
that was convergence was when you shift your speech style to become more like somebody else
and erm similarity attraction
oh
theory
sorry
is that more similar your attitudes and UNK are to somebody the more likely it is that you'll mutual attraction
and so we can show that by speech convergence
erm convergence reflects a speakers desire for erm to get the listeners social approval
erm because once you've got their approval that increase the attraction and the UNK of what you're saying and UNK but i don't know quite what they mean by that
erm in general people desire approval more often than they don't so the general tendency in conversations is for people to UNK to each other in many situations
erm are you keeping up
just about yeah
erm many factors effect what type and extent of convergence happens erm and these can include the range of the speakers UNK the probability that there will be future UNK with the same UNK erm the status relationship between the two participants and whether there's any UNK of previous shifts made by the UNK in the same conversation
erm and then it says that somebody called natalie erm wrote in nineteen seventy five that the greater somebody's need for approval the greater their tendency will be to UNK with a style
erm and the way this is most often shown like the th type of UNK they do is that they erm change their UNK to match that of the other person and their pause length is made the same
erm then it goes on about quite a bit of this erm perception and UNK of the speech style er talking about er martin and giles
subject UNK perceived er speaker as pr prestigious and UNK and they perceived that there might be future interaction with him perceived his speech is more similar to their own than subjects who were told nothing about the speaker
erm and the difference in appraisal between the groups of people that knew about the speaker before and those that didn't know anything they say it is important to the similarity attraction
erm social exchange processes this talks about the rewards and costs of convergence up against each other
erm the similarity attraction model tends only to UNK to emphasize the rewards of UNK
erm i e an increase in attraction or approval the other person
but there are costs involved as well and these include the increased effort you have to make in conversation erm and loss of perceived integrity and personal group identity UNK yourself to match up to them
erm yeah and they say that er before we actually erm do a speech convergence for want of a better phrase erm that we kind of weigh up in our heads quickly the rewards and cost of you know alternative courses of action
and so from a choice of between x and y we're going to choose the opt option that we think UNK the chances of a positive outcome i e approval
erm so UNK speech acts should therefore incur more potential rewards for the speaker than costs
erm the rewards they're talking about depend on which hat level your convergence occurs at
erm and they give the example of erm a job interview accent in a job interview
where it's two males male applicant and a male UNK and the prospective employee has a less prestigious accent than the UNK so it's quite likely that the prospective employee would shift his accent towards a more that of the employer due to his relative need of approval so much more than vice versa
and the rewards then would be that erm from the UNK point of view he be you know UNK as more intelligent self confident UNK all this sort of thing make him say determined erm more understandable to the UNK obviously and also the there he's more likely to be well liked by the UNK and that's because of that not only his voice but the content of what he's actually saying is gonna be more UNK looked upon
erm then it talks about the opposite
oh sorry that before that er erm shows about how this erm convergence from UNK to sort of pr prestigious or r p accent is known as a upward UNK
and then it talks about the opposite accent and it gives the example of there'll be an industrial dispute in a small family business erm and there is possibly a greater need by the employer to win the workers' approval
erm within the limits of his UNK he'll shift his accent down towards that of the workers erm shows them cooperation and that's known as a UNK convergence
erm UNK convergence are generally done to reduce embarrassment between people of different UNK
erm so it makes a common basis of communication
mutual c convergence can also occur with upwards UNK by person and that's completed by UNK towards the other
that's generally if they both desire integration so it's not just done on the part of one person
erm so they're saying that erm speech convergence is generally erm quite UNK perceived
that's about it really
right okay
you haven't got anything else to add before we talk about
okay as i said before i think there's sort of three ways of doing the essay
you can either think about doing one that is very literature based which i supposed might end up being sort of a rewrite of a lot of the stuff you can read
or you can do a vaguely experimental sort of thing
now there's two different things you can do there's one which you were originally gonna do when it was a project
mm
which was to like actually do an experiment which might be a bit time consuming now and you might have to do
yeah
if you want to do it you haven't really got you probably haven't got the time
haven't got the time
the other thing might be do just do a questionnaire asking people about their attitudes to accents and UNK and
yes mm
languages
and that's something which you haven't like got to do a lot of recording for you haven't got test conditions you've got to think of some questions and photocopy it
mm
mm
and then if you want to read some literature and talk about some of the things which once you've said what questions you want to ask you'll want to read some stuff you've either read a lot of it already the stuff you've done today is useful and do a bit of your essay saying this is what the literature says so we did an experiment to test this aspect and here's the results we found let's discuss this
erm
so based on match UNK
that's what it's gonna be about
well i mean you can't really you can't do much you can't do much about
you can't really do that though
the best thing would be to s sort of say i don't know but the sort of thing which came into my mind were questions like you know which accents do you think
yeah or i mean which accents do you think people sound more intelligent when they've got i mean it's not that's heavily match UNK cos in match UNK people are doing it without knowing what they're doing
in this
mm
we're asking people to make an informed choice
mm
and people have got to be aware of their prejudices
but
when they're answering
yeah everybody's got some sort of accent that UNK on their nerves though haven't they
yeah
that they can't stand and there's another one they think it's nice
yeah i mean people don't always agree on those things
mm
but you actually find some trends
mm
across the board
mm
er which also really doesn't look as if actually asks you cross section
yeah you've gotta almost ask say you keep getting an accent erm oh i don't know say UNK accent or something that people don't really think sounds very nice
mhm
then you've got to go and try and find somebody from birmingham saying and erm
yeah i mean
mm
if you can actually try and find one
i mean it's probably a good idea to make a if you do a questionnaire to make a note of what accent
the people you're asking have got
yeah
and that way when you analyze the results you can sort of say well we found that say birmingham was very UNK erm but you can say that wasn't i mean if everybody in the whole sample
had been i dunno a very then you can say oh so it doesn't really show very much
but if you have a reasonable cross section of the country and your result was still that birmingham was looked down upon as a low status accent then at least you can your results so
would you have to say why
why you
well i think if you can come up with some suggestions you don't have to say why
y you can say why you think it might be
some of it's the erm actually could we put something like that in the questionnaire what don't you like about it
yeah definitely
erm
mm
but the thing is
see if you can actually quantify it or if it's UNK
yeah but i mean sort of UNK them
they might of oh sorry
but because they're not UNK
yeah
they might not know how to say it
well
they might
in some ways the way that people describe things
the words they use
i mean they're not a UNK but the words they use will say a lot about what they think about
a lot about what they think
i mean if somebody says i used to people finding UNK people might say oh i find it UNK but it doesn't really mean anything does it
mm
and s i mean that's a sort of non UNK of the people use but you sort of
i suppose you have to into something UNK then
and you have to work out what they mean by that
er i mean it could just be that they don't like it so anything which they don't like is UNK or
mm
whatever
i mean
does that sound like the decent thing to do
yeah
should we all do the same questions
i get together
yeah
on the same
yeah
i think you should all do the same questionnaire and the same survey but then if you can write it up separately
yeah
yeah
so d do you want us to do like tables results you know
i don't
or just write
er it's up to you i mean if your results i mean you're not going to have loads and loads of results
so
no
i mean doing a couple of tables probably won't be that hard work cos it just be a case of a list of UNK or something
yeah
or a list of scores
but i mean it's up to you if results are very simple you can sort of say oh well sixty percent went this way and forty
mm
went the other way
i mean it's up to you to display the data in the way that you think's best
okay
erm is everyone okay with that
yeah
mm
right the best thing to do
should we do it now
the questions
think of some now
because if you should think some now in the next five or ten minutes and then if during the next week you meet in the week sometime
mm
to organize this
do we do we want
and if you get
to sorry to interrupt
i was gonna say
sorry
do we want to erm go i mean obviously we want to go away and i'll do it with my friend and you'll do it your
mm
friend and you'll do it with your friend
erm but do you want us to keep our own results or do you want us to pool all together
i think you should pool together
say we could do ten each or something like that
yeah that would only be
yeah
thirty people's plenty really
yeah okay
something
right
er i might say if keep a little check list of whether each person you ask is male or female or how old they are
mm
what accent they've got i mean th that's plenty to do
yeah so yeah they've got to add some conditions on top of this things so it's like should we do an age range thing
or is that gonna be too wide
well
i think one person who is in their thirty or forties or two people so you know you can't really quantify that very easily
yeah
mm
er so you might be best just sticking to people who are the s around the same age you know eighteen to twenty two or something
is it best to do sort of a say if a question which accent do you not like
is it best to do a series of accents and get 'em to tick or get 'em to
yeah like multiple choice ones
cos if you get em if you put a bo a multiple choice and if they're not actually think they just like look at one and oh i don't really like that all i don't really like think about it
yeah they put an idea into their heads don't you yeah
yes
yeah
yeah
it
has this property of i you do put a list of accents it's a good idea to put other at the bottom in case there is
mm
one you haven't mentioned
mm
because
there's so many though aren't there i mean there's that scottish accents which i love but other ones are a bit kind of difficult to understand you know
yeah i mean if you sort of put scottish accent then you're probably going to
but
lots of scottish people
what's a scottish accent
well there just think of it as being very different don't they
well yeah
i mean
course they
yeah
er so you might be better of leaving it open
or leave it open for some questions if you want to test a ps specific thing in another question then try and test that
mm
erm
a thing that's really about accents that if you say to somebody what accent don't you like
they might really dislike sort of a standard english accent sort of
but they don't yeah
standard sort of middle class thing but the pre thin they might not think of that because people sort of quite often think of that as not being an accent
yeah
which is quite difficult
yeah well it's on all the radio and t v and stuff isn't it
yeah
and they don't think about it or
mm
or you could think it also true that i think wh what you think you're supposed to like as well
yes i mean
you're keep being told that's the way you're supposed to
sorry
if you did have a list it one of the list b c english or queen's english or something that makes people know what they w what you're trying to tell them
b c accent yeah
er whereas if you ask somebody to name an accent they'd probably think of regional varieties urban varieties
but they don't think it is one
rural ones
do they
well you could you could do you could
putting a say if you put
i won't join in this
say you put what accent do you not like
and put a line
and put in brackets e g you know how you like give an example for them to fill in and say e g b c
yes
english something like that
well what you could do is put in brackets somewhere a list of accents you can think of so that if people really don't know what to do
yeah so you've got a list
it's not your list of choices it's not going to have to take box form
but they can just look through so they can say i can't think of an accent let's have a quick look through this list
yeah
yeah
er
and that way you can include you can even include sort of very upper class varieties which are sort of
we could ask them actually where you could put where are you from
yeah
and then say do you perceive yourself as having an accent
yeah
as well and so that UNK over whether they you know that UNK over this thing about erm views of other people j the way you
yeah
somebody else up you've got a massive accent but then turns round and says well so have you
so there again perhaps try and find somebody who's from where they've said they're from and they might be ticking this box you know
yeah
another thing that might be worth doing as well i mean don't make it too complicated we ought to about which things to put in
if you want to say put the name of an accent down you wanted to put say birmingham and then say how would you rate people who have a strong accent from this place on a scale of one to five for UNK honesty the things which you could
yeah
yeah
yeah
scale of one to five for each one with one being er
but yeah i mean it's not going to be quite so true because they're gonna think well when you write it down you think well actually it's got nothing to do with this be really clever
but and that takes away that initial reaction
yeah
have to put something they're gonna have prejudices and
yeah that's right
er but we like say don't want to put everything in cos it would take you a while to analyze that but that's another thing you might want to put on
how many questions do you think
i don't know i mean i think if you had a double side of a sheet of a four that was well UNK out and stuff that would be
er you wouldn't want to make them you wouldn't particularly have more than a dozen or so would you
no
no
but i mean more or less so you'll probably get a feel for when you've got things
yeah
i reckon your sort of timetable for doing this wants to be early next week to meet to work out exactly what questions you are gonna do and UNK make a questionnaire and perhaps later on in the week wednesday thursday friday start to ask some people now on the friday this time this we this time next week you c
you can talk about some of your results in here and we'll discuss about anything that's gonna be problems we'll discuss how you're can write it up and how you want to display the statistics if
yeah
you've got some complicated ones
er and then you can write it up sometime during week four and hand it in sort of wednesday thursday week four would be quite good
okay what do we have to do a methodology project as well
i don't think you do
or do you
to be in when
by end of week four
yeah
three sides
three sides
it's not bad it's
mm
just a
we're gonna have to be doing that at the same time
well i mean i a asked christine yesterday and she was saying that because this isn't a project any more it's actually supposed to in the end of week three
but you know i think if i say to her hand it in week four then
mm
she won't mind so push past week four she might
yeah
we could do the first bits and about an hour really this weekend not at work or anything
no cos we've got the first two bits we've got the rational for the experiment and the method
what do we have to do
we just have to write one side on the rational and one side on the method and the third UNK on the results
but i mean we don't know h how long
we haven't got eight
so we can do the first two
no he's gonna give us the other results
erm
we can do the first two and then
two
it's on that were you there the other day when we got that sheet
yeah is on there
yeah it's all
okay
on there
oh good okay
but why do we do the experiment then
oh i dunno
okay so we you're really gonna have to sort of do
meet on monday
monday
so
so if next week c you can at least of started
three hours a week
to the questionnaire er but we definitely have done finish finished making the questionnaire i mean gonna have to
well yeah cos we want to get out and distribute it and get it back
yeah
can do it on monday and we can people will have until friday then to ask
yeah
yeah
yeah we'll do it on monday
what have we got
well i've got three hours from straight from nine fifteen in the morning so i'd like a bit of a break actually after that

india UNK northern part of india on fifth of february thirty six
and when did you come to live in this country
in april nineteen sixty one
did you live an in any other countries in between the two years
no i came from india straight to england
what was your occupation in india
what did you do
erm well i'm a trained teacher but er i didn't get much experience in teaching although i had obtained my degree in teaching in nineteen fifty eight
i've forgotten all the years now it's so long
fifty eight
i graduated in fifty seven so it was one year's in fifty eight
then i couldn't get a job
i joined erm college again to start on my master's degree because it was just an er gap filling gap like
so eventually i got a temporary job er in ni end of sixty which lasted til er february sixty one
er but by the time i had my UNK so i thought may not get a job again better to try the luck somewhere else
so i got er experience of three months now that was really very nice experience which i always wanted to be a teacher although i didn't join here
so i came in april sixty one here straight from india
that's that was all the experience i had which you say experience of life
the rest was all college life
what about the rest of your family in india
were there any other teachers amongst them
no
we were three brothers
er two of us are here now
both are of us are in business
he's he in UNK in UNK and the third one who is younger to me elder to the third one he is in canada
he was here before but he UNK to canada
he's working so none of us er in any profession at all except er just earning our living
did you come here by yourself or did some of the members of the family travel with you when you travel
no i came with my brother actually younger brother who is canada now
but my father was here before i came
here in walsall
here in walsall and my one of my cousins was here
how long have they been here
erm my cousin left india in nineteen fifty six of fifty seven
he went to UNK where my uncle was there
my father ha has got one brother only there two brothers
er he was living the other was living in UNK
he UNK to UNK erm before i was born and my grandfather died in UNK
i haven't seen my never saw my grandfather and so family has been out of the country for a few generations now
er so two of us came in sixty one the third one youngest one came in sixty five
where did you live when you first came here whereabouts
erm i came when i came in england i came here
er i stayed at erm that was the house erm belonged to my cousin he still lives in that house
he di he's i think he's the only person who never moved out of the same place
normally we keep selling and buying the properties
erm father was living there as well so i er didn't stay long er because we hadn't got a job
what sort of house is that one in
it's a terraced house and er it's double storey two floors up and er it was well used at that time because the reason was one er there wasn't much accommodation available and secondly it is the custom amongst our people that who's ever er is in need we have the person like the two of us came from india my brother and myself so we di couldn't get a job
we weren't charged any rent
we weren't charged anything for the food so we were there as guests although everybody else was working but we was given the most comfortable er room to stay so it there were quite a few people living there because of this reason that er people coming from outside looking for a job they would automatically er obtain the accommodation without being charged for it
what were your first UNK of walsall
not very good
because er when i landed er at airport er one of my relations was living in er UNK
i went to him first
he was living in a modern flat nice flat well UNK nice furniture in there and er you know the difference of midlands and south india at that time was tremendous
erm i liked it very much it was nice and in april
er he wasn't at er in when i came so i left my bag out here on the stairs
i went and to just walk around the town
i was sitting in the car park and i appreciated the area very much it was nice clean area but when i came to walsall it was UNK and dirty area i'm sorry to say that and er but i had no alternative but to stay here because my father was here i had no money and er i thought because of relations job prospects might be better here than elsewhere
but unfortunately couldn't get a job
so
what sort of work did you try and get when you came
any sort
any sort
UNK work labour work for th nothing was available
so what did you do
what was your first paid job
erm eventually er one of my teachers in my school had UNK to this country and he was living in UNK at that time and he was working in a bakery
so i wrote him a letter told him i'm here i can't get a job so he managed to get a job for me
that was bakery near to the london airport north
it used to be airport north at that time small house on the edge of the western side isn't it
no listen we'll say it's north say north side of i sometimes losing direction in this country
because erm sun goes round very often it starts in the winter
erm
so how long were you doing that
i stayed in bakery for two years
erm the working conditions weren't very good and the behaviour of the officers wasn't very UNK
because i had come straight from college it was really difficult for me to tolerate that sort of behaviour so i managed to er convince the workers to form a union
so i had to they said oh you were the shop steward
so i was shop steward for there for one year and a half and er eventually because of the row between the workers myself and er the management er although we obtained a lot of facilities for the workers a lot of facilities
there was time when they had to UNK er give some sort of er incentive to the foreman to give them a good time then it was the shop stewards who would give the workers to the management who will do the o overtime
so that sort of situation we obtained in a year and a half without going to going on a strike
but er eventually i found out that er i can't er work UNK here because if i stopped for er fighting for the benefit of the workers then er they will think that er i have been UNK or something like this and if i keep fighting for them then there's no peace of mind there's always struggle so i thought i'll leave and the second was that i wanted to bring my family into this country and i wasn't saving anything while leaving them because that's a bit expensive area and er the person who got the job for me he said let's migrate to yorkshire
it's very cheap ov houses are very cheap and both of us left the job and down there
here i was erm getting about er seventeen pound a week
when i wh went to yorkshire in we lived at leeds i couldn't get a job and eventually i got a job er in a electrical firm
i used to er wire the erm was a tube fittings
it was lamps and i was getting only ten pounds a week there which was just enough to which erm er expenses for one person
then i UNK to luton from there
i shifted to luton
i thought i would get a job there but i couldn't for a few months and er my wife and two children joined me there and my brother's wife joined us there and two of us bought the house in luton
and eventually i got job on a UNK
it was a very nice firm
i enjoyed er very much that it was job
erm but erm then due to certain reasons of erm er it was again er bit of struggle between myself and my colleague and er i had to choose to leave
because er management erm to his side actually
i made a mistake by telling them the truth actually and they said you have admitted your fault
so i said do you want the truth or you want me to yourself
he said i want the truth
i said the truth is that he reported that i was sleeping at night
i said the truth is that everybody stop work at twelve and we do our paperwork and we're normally finished by two o'clock and if you come to the factory by twelve o'clock you won't find any machines working and if you come at two o'clock you won't find any UNK working so that is the truth
he said all right you have admitted you've been sleeping so out you go
so i had no option
and then er there's a long line of changing jobs and eventually i came to UNK
one of my had a house which was actually a shop previously but it wa was on the back street so his suggestion why don't you go into business
and we opened a small shop there and in a whole week we couldn't even sell fifty pence worth of sweets
so i came to walsall again when i left walsall i never wanted to come back to walsall er because of two reasons
one was i didn't like the midlands
secondly i had so many relations
they used to drink a lot of beer in groups which i didn't like myself
er it was er their social evening but for me i wasn't er very enjoyable
when i when i came here i saw a shop in which was for sale
it was just er you may say UNK brought me here which i never wanted to come to this place
so i thought let's try
i went to the agents and it was for two thousand pounds
i said well it's not that dear
so i said i'll look at it
so we bought that shop for two thousand pounds
i er managed to find thousand pounds from here and there and borrowing from each other and thousand pounds was given UNK to me
er the sale figures were quite good and that
but i had a very bad experience there again
first week we took only five pounds while the er previous owner was doing very well
at lunchtime ooh shelf
a customer comes in and he was my wife i didn't have er UNK then i was clean UNK because after coming to this country when i couldn't get a job i thought that this might be a bar so which wasn't right but we did it
so it was again a great disappointment for me but er we carried on this struggle
we were well established for even three months
but i'd been working nights to live on
i used to work four nights and er working all day in the shop working all night in there
it was er UNK factory wheel UNK wheel something in UNK or wheel manufacturers something like this
i've forgot the name
erm nice place
the conditions of work were very good were very good doing ten hours every night
forty hours in four nights
so it was an UNK struggle and within three months we were doing well in shop and i left my job and since then i'm in walsall
how did your wife and family settle down
they were moving with me all the time and er the eldest child was four year's old when he came to this country and er two and a half year's old the girl younger to him
er although they've been moving around with me but er they did very well in their studies in the end
er i had very bad reports of work er from the eldest son
he used to go to school erm mr i think that was the headmaster same sort of name
er and he said he's very weak in his studies
i said well there must be some reason
he said change his company then try that
well we did
he didn't want to leave his friends so we found a job in the shop for him packing
i used to pay him incentive
so that worked
now he's a doctor in he's a senior UNK in erm er hospital UNK
you must be very proud of him
oh he's er he's done very well and the girl she's a dentist
er she has bought her own surgery in er UNK but she comes from er sh she's married she's got one son and she's expecting another baby any day now
er she's married in leicester they live in leicester
so she travelled from leicester to birmingham all day and they would of then erm had their degrees from birmingham university
erm while your children were here and going to school in and all that did they have any instruction from the temple any extra UNK in anything
no
in language or culture it was just
no my children didn't have any although there's er school going on er being run by the temple all through these years
but er because we were see we i always had a UNK struggle for many years so that it wasn't er tell you the truth i didn't erm UNK much time towards the children it is their own effort really that er they did very well
erm can you tell me something about the temple in that area in caldmore its role in the community briefly perhaps
some things that
erm well temple in caldmore has erm played a very important part in the life of the UNK community people in the si er families here
er number one that is the only place where we normally can meet
er people do go to pub they do meet but it's not a family outing because our women don't go to pub it's not socially approved
so that is a community place for us as well and that is the only place we can where we can learn about religion other place because this is a foreign country wi who has got a different religion than we are and there is no other institution will which will ever mention any of the reading apart from which is so it has played a very important part
when i came it used to be a very old building which belonged to british UNK club previously and er UNK bought from them
we were running in that building er our day to day duties
then in nineteen seventy two yeah april seventy two i think we opened the new building
then there was a extension to that
now we have recently added two more halls to the existing building so it's er quite er bit of accommodation there for different er duties
we extended er this er temple by buying the houses around
altogether i think so far we have demolished er six seven or eight houses near to the boundary to add the space to the car park and for the building
now we've still got four or five houses in er which are owned by the UNK temple
that's at the back of the temple
at the back of the temple yeah
the gardens are er adjoining adjacent to the er grounds of the temple
what about the old people in your community
how are they sort of brought into things by the temple would they have special
we haven't got any special er way of er preaching or teaching different age groups
er that's a sad thing and er our children normally learnt about UNK our religion just by as they go in life
we don't teach them specially er they just er learn by living in the community because er mainly UNK is about life how to live a decent healthy er social life which do doesn't finish here which leads to eternal union with god
so that is er oh so it's a part and parcel of day to day er living
erm perhaps children young people english young people and children of a similar age have more freedom more social freedom
does it cause problems
er it does cause problems yes
it is causing not just lot of problems for us now
because er we have different set up
there are advantages and disadvantages of every set up in every society er which doesn't fit into the er british er social structure
the marriage a traditional marriage doesn't fit with the western structure because our children er we like arranged marriage
they see that the british children can have their own way
we see that er there is no possibility our children can have because unless until they move around so freely as the western children do move that is the only way they can choose the right sort of person as a as the UNK for family
but again we said see that er although british children have a lot of freedom the rate of the success in marriage isn't that great not very encouraging
so then again we have the reservations regarding the success of the system
while we see that more UNK succeed although there so some of them might be just dragging but er a at least they don't become a headache for the society as children of adult er parents or children with one parent we don't have that problem
so we do feel that er while children feel they don't er have the freedom we feel that er a very nice system which has been socially used for is being UNK because we are living in a different set up
so we are far apart from each other
erm did you ever face any racial conflicts here in caldmore when you came
mm i do still do
still do
mm normally er people who can't afford hesitate to walk around
i do hesitate myself because if i walk around normally i have to suffer a lot of abuse by not by people by who are walking round but the people who are passing by in the cars etc
and youngsters normally er when they pass by they will certainly say at your back something nasty and so er there is no way just have to an tolerate it unless until we want to end up in behind the bars
has it become worse or better since you first arrived here
erm it has become worse in a way that er we did i did experience some sort of er racial UNK er with the youth but the middle aged and the er m older people were very er UNK i had to ask er when i couldn't find my way ask my way to certain places and er there was an that er the lady just walked by me er with me and she said i'll have to walk with you can't find it
so she was going to the opposite direction actually and i insisted that i don't want to take her that long she would have to walk back again
she said no you can't find your way
but now the situation is that if er we stop and ask the way somebody very few people will stop and say it
but i don't blame them for that if the situation is such that er the ladies are scared of the strangers whether he's er coloured or probably the er or white people as well
and there are so many UNK cases which in which coloured people are involved so er everything is contributed to it
er there's such a change tremendous change in the general attitudes of the people
see when i came in sixty one i remember you know b c cinema
the buses used to start from their to UNK and there used to be a place where they would leave newspapers and they put a er box there by that and people used to take out newspaper and put the money into the box and er you can't dream of that sort of thing now
you leave your door open and while by the time you turn your er back around er something is missing
this er this is a lot of difference
it's not er racial or something like that it was just the general standard of the people which has so much changed
erm tell me about caldmore green itself now erm the shops here seem to cater so well for the asian community er is this really so i mean do you have everything
yeah erm when i bought the shop in nineteen sixty six in caldmore we were the only coloured people as far as i can remember
i don't know was there in clothing business but in UNK certainly we were the only people and there was another shop in er which used to belong to er who now and er the most popular shop was in er near to the er church
but that belonged to a white person who was who could speak UNK very well i think he wa he has been living in india for some time
so that was most popular very busy person and er since then more and more shops er have been bought by the UNK and now i think er we cater for every need and there are some pubs as well which have been bought by the asian and the last straw i think is the conservative club and bought by mr and two of his er partners
so
what are they going to do with that place
they're using it as at a as a club
as a club
mm as a club yeah
erm would you say that now you can get everything you need in caldmore without UNK further UNK or
erm the situation isn't er the same as is used to be
erm big stores selling all the asian er stuff now and so they don't depend on the asian shops UNK er the west indians used to depend a lot on the asian er grocery stores because er of er things like erm etc
the people most of the er sh big stores not even in the they don't sell even now those things
but er the consumption of those er goods have reduced a lot because the new UNK er i think don't bother to eat those things
so the eating habits have changed a lot since then although we have shops which cater for every need of the UNK community
but UNK community isn't that dependent on them
the asian UNK er women are er they differ a lot in every way to the western erm female
one thing they are very devoted wives
they cannot er although i it's not that er that sort of erm UNK doesn't exist UNK in the indian asian woman
er there has been cases where er there has been er some sort of erm affairs between men and women but the majority and psychological er think way of thinking that er the asian woman always think of their husbands only nothing else
er a they are dependent on them in many ways b if they desert they're not acceptable to this society
so we teach our daughters that er the first and foremost duty they have to perform in life is to like after your husband and UNK and bring up the family and the economical side contribution from the er female is secondary although they claim it a part as well erm as economically as well
do they go out to work
most of them most of them do go out to work
specially the indian women
erm the UNK women they have started UNK out now
er we've been in ten years in this shop and er for those ten years i have experienced a lot of er difference in the attitudes of UNK women as well
they have started working and er they have started going out to work in the factories as well
do you think this is a good thing
it is a good thing
er it is a good thing as a health thing because they at home they didn't get the company
it was boring for them and now they go out they spend some time er amongst each other and they have time to chat around
er wh when you earn something with your own efforts it also helps the money you get earned by somebody else
what about language difficulties do the women
it's tremendous
er it's very serious
er they're getting on well because erm er we live in a close er society
we're they tend to buy houses where er others there are already er houses of the same community
so we don't experience that difficulty but otherwise it's very serious
it's very difficult to communicate
what sort of jobs do the women do
it's mostly sewing job in the clothing factories low paid
is it local
local yeah local
do you get your supplies locally from
we
the area
er we do get locally as well and from outside as well
there are people UNK coming from london who supply us the goods and er there are some goods which are manufactured in this country some are imported
the majority of the are made in leicester
you've got such a wonderful UNK down there
i was looking at them
well we have to keep variety to make something
there are UNK are there as well for the women not
yeah
bother them quite so much
erm recently this er asian dress has become very popular er you know in india it's a country
UNK women wear these UNK trousers and er
the women used to wear UNK and i have never seen a lately with anything but UNK but now they have started wearing the UNK dress
so it has become a fashion now
er instead of buying ready made er dresses i suppose which wer became er very popular at one time with the indian girls and the UNK girls
UNK girls used to wear er trousers underneath that
we have stopped that and now they are making their own most of them are making their own fashionable garments out of the loose material we sell and er some ask the friends to make for them
are they warm enough
it always UNK me that they never seem you know very warm
no they're not but they've been getting on all right really
it's not very warm
they wear more or less the same sort of er material through the year
er sometimes i always laugh i say it's funny when erm it's about twenty degrees outside they're still wearing the same dress and when it's minus fifteen or ten they're still wearing the same dress
but erm they put on certain warm clothes on
erm a few months back i was interviewing someone who lived in the area all their life and she said that the UNK temple had distributed some e c erm butter i think it was
is that so
yeah erm when you know when they send the free butter previously they sent butter cheap butter to the big supermarkets so the UNK charged something for this
last time er it was er free distribution so they needed someone to workers for that and UNK temple offered their services and er i think they did the job very well because mostly we get a lot of volunteers round and er many times i went their there was quite a big queue er five or six people were serving at the same time
they undertook to do it for the whole of the caldmore area did they
i think they did yeah because i don't get much time during the day er to go away from the shop but er i the only job i mostly do is when the visitors come to the er temple i have to go there explain about UNK
but er other you can't do everything i o that so it can er
do you get many visitors to the temple
yes we get many visitors
we had a teaching training class today
they came at ten o'clock
i take er UNK in the morning er in schools so i wasn't today
i finished assembly at a nine thirty ten o'clock i was in temple and er worked there til twelve
do you instruct them
mm i explain them what we're doing in the temple what is our religion like
erm tell me about these UNK in the school
what do you do
we've been feeling for some time that our children are feeling that they've been left alone because er when they come to the temple they are too young to understand anything which is being explained from the stage because er the speakers or the UNK have to cater for all the age groups and normally it's for the those who understand already understand about UNK
er so we wrote to the heads of the schools and they were quite willing to accommodate er us and then i found out that er UNK are already taking UNK for a few years
so its been quite helpful
i w we five six minutes we worship the way we normally worship at home
see UNK worship is remembering god that's all
er see when s when i say worship it er it sounds like er playing some UNK or something like this but there's no ritual in the UNK faith it's just remembering god
so we erm
so there are no set prayers or anything like that
yeah set prayers
see first er line of er is the set prayer then we go add to that er say first full hymn is our morning what we call the first line we would call the basic er say route of the er UNK that's the magic which erm er which erm con controls the er eternal er power
see it brings takes us near to god so eventually it helps us to er unite with him
so we UNK that at the er assembly
then i for a few minutes we've got only fifteen minutes so about twelve to fifteen minutes and i explain them the historical aspects
just simple
it's not er a really a teaching which er is important it's just that they know that er we have a UNK assembly and since then er i have found er they have a type of great moral courage they're proud of themselves
gives them more identity
yes it does give them more identity
see the first week i went to these schools they couldn't speak a word of UNK
wouldn't dare to
it wasn't that they couldn't speak they didn't no how to speak they didn't no how to speak but they couldn't
i had to repeat very simple sentences six seven eight ten times before they could repeat it
now it's spontaneous
so it has made a lot of difference
i enjoy it very much
your home life in india how does it compare with here the sort of home you had
it's very different very different
i come from a village it's like er erm a lion in general a lion in cage
a lot of difference
so when i go back although i didn't go back since nineteen eighty three because the situation is not that favourable since then i felt that i'm out of the cage
although i've been here for a long time i've got my house got my family here i've got comfortable living although not er UNK but er normal standard better standard than i could have in india
er but because i was born in the country lazy i was
i look at erm the countryside probably because of that
er the industrial life i never experienced before
it's more busy no relaxation
over there we do work over there we do work here but er we always work in a relaxing way over there but here always tension
and that's the difference between the UNK er situation and the country situation
it's a lot of difference
i think that's the right
born at hundred and twenty two willenhall
one of a family of six and me elder brother was me UNK me dad had a little business in the keys in and er they were hard times and me elder brother we used to go and work for him because me dad said he must and er from after school i used to go and perhaps do the UNK or a bit of filing the odd jobs and all that sort of thing and i grew up with locks and keys and files from twelve even before i left school
i didn't leave school till i was fifteen
i said to me mother i ain't going to work for me dad like our albert did
i'm going to get a job on me own
and we had a neighbour named and he'd worked at e t n s all his life and had some influence and i mentioned it to him and he asked me asked me if he could find me a job
he asked the masters and they said you can come for an interview
i went for an interview at e t n s in now where it is and er they said can you start today and i said no
er so er no that wasn't no
started at
started at that's right yes and er i did and er they put me in the machine shop filing UNK and those times they had to be all cast over the UNK locks and all that now they've made for us and all that
but er i did two or three hundred four hundred five hundred a day and i got fed up on it and i said to the UNK one day if you don't change me from this job i'm leaving so they says oh we don't want you to do that best UNK we've had
so a fellow named mr worked at he was a neighbour i got talking to him he says i'll mention it and you can come
i got this job in the machine sh in one of the lock shops and er for a fellow i worked for him and er after i'd been working for him they wanted me to work for somebody else but this fellow wouldn't let me go
he says he's my bloke he's gonna stick with me
so i had to work with him till i was about twenty or twenty one or something like that you know
then i was able to er go for my own self you know and er i went on doing locks one thing and another best i could and all that sort of thing and i worked for a bloke what was in there er be a little bloke but he was the best UNK in the shop and i went to help him and er he used to give me all the to do and this and that and the other
he had separate orders each UNK and at this time i'd done all the UNK whatsit er and this and that and the other and i said what's next
he says there ain't nothing else next and er so er i stood there and i said this kind of like this i've gotta do something so er i went er to pick UNK up down the back but before that he said here you are he says i put these ready all you gotta do is put the UNK in those locks you know like
and he says i says listen young man the locks i ain't gonna put them in and this is true and he said well if you won't do that you'll do nothing else at all
so i stood by the vice for quite a time and then i went to pick something up turned round told you do that you'll do nothing else
so i left and er went out the shop
i asked the UNK i says can i get out
he says you're out and i not yet i said
well i went home and i got another job and it then i went back i says can i have me card
he says yes if you're paying me a week's wages and i says i can't do that
he says well then he says you could or you couldn't you haven't served a week's notice
it's one or the another
so i had to serve a week's notice and i went down this er what's the name of it
where i went to work down there and in a month they put it was amongst a shop of about sixteen men and they all had separate orders and the men had got little lads working for them you know
but there was a foreman in the shop but these did their own job er and er in the about three or four weeks and i'm only a kid erm they had me doing separate jobs you know not for a UNK or anything and er they used to they give me odd jobs as you know like to help the men and er it went of like that in till i was eighteen or nineteen well twenty that time you were day become a man
er one time the UNK had a rise from ni eighteen twenty to twenty one a man it was a big rise but the UNK union they altered it from to twenty and a half twenty one twenty one and a half three rises before you went from a lad to a man's raise you know
well that happened and er i was man and er they er brought me all the odd jobs that was going about and they used to go down the warehouse and er there was a fellow there well a woman more than anything UNK where every thing was and in no time at all they showed me where the things were and er i er young it was in my memory and in no time at all the men in the shop used to come and ask me to get them something from out the warehouse for this and that and the other
and in no time at all erm they were all more or less depending in some small way on me and i was just absolutely UNK the situation up you know what i mean just suited me fine
and er after a time they wanted to know if i'd take complete charge and i said well yes i said but what are the men gonna think
and they said we don't mean to be over the men but what we mean is for you to come down the office no what the office wants as regards orders and be responsible and pass them out to the men who you'll think who'll do the job best and all that and that's what we mean
so i said alright i'll do that and i did
and it meant that i had free access to the whole of the so much so i had a key to the bottom of entry in er access to the firm and i could get in when i liked
they put complete trust in me you understand what i mean
and er i'd got a key to get in from the works into the office once i was inside but that was access to the works you know and er i er i en i enjoyed it more or less and i must say the firm to some extent looked up to me and i'd only got to have a UNK machine stop where the girls was working on this machine and the UNK shop and all that sort of thing and i was able to go look er down and say look here i want this
well whatever they was doing they'd drop and do whatever i said it and it was the same with the UNK shop you know
mind you these was instructions from the office to me telling me what i what they wanted and i had to carry it out
and er then i should go to the UNK shop and ask them if they could get these done today and er well we got this on i said no but i we want it if you could leave them on one side and erm i used to er i became if i might say so and i'm not UNK or UNK or anything michael i'm trying to tell you the situation as it was and er i was a very important man to and er they er got me er at one time to er figure out they used to make what was called UNK locks
it's rather surprising to you but they used to sell them in UNK for sixpence
they had to sell them for three and threepence three UNK
and they were sold in UNK for er sixpence
er you can't imagine this i don't suppose but nevertheless it's true and in a time the men in the shop they was mass production you know what i mean and they wanted this or that or the other well i had the authority to go down the machine shop and tell them look here so and so wants this you do that
and we had four UNK in the works and i had to go and sort out the i'll tell you about the find the castings that these men wanted for their lot take them down to the UNK and tell them in priority which i wanted you know and er all that sort of thing and erm i hadn't used to do any making any locks hardly at the end you know i had i had before but er if i might say so er i became mo the most important man on the factory you know
and er i never heard or had any more ways than ordinary
this was in was it
yes that's right in that's er that's where it was my lad and that was the entry as i used to get access from remembering it ain't quite like it was now my lad
but there was a big door well i used to get in the entry from with an ordinary key used to go up the b up the op big opening and open the big doors from the UNK you see what i mean for the rest to come in
and erm there was half a dozen shops and quite a few spent most of me life there
i le i left there starting to work on me own
as a matter of fact there was about i got four month in this one particular shop and there became sixteen men in this shop that was working for me and er we i UNK a bonus scheme
oh two or three years before only it turned out after a time that the men were earning more money than me because i the bonus you understand it was a good thing for the firm it was a good thing for the men
it was a bad thing for me strictly speaking because the men became as they was earning more money than me and this is complete fact
erm i had a go at one of the UNK
i said look here you've put me in a job i reckon i've done it alright the only thing is it's me that is the worse off now
i says i'd like a rise
they said oh that's alright
well it came to the and it was in the shop and they said what do you want
and i said a pound and they said what
i said a pound
they said we'll give you five shilling and i used this very i said you can stick that up th wear it in your UNK and that's the truth
and they looked like that and i says what i says they've caused these men to earn all this money i says they're earning more money than and that's all you're gonna offer me
and it brought about the bridge michael
i said
i said er UNK come from manchester
nothing at all
no nothing at all about the lock and two years after closed and it was because of this because the men on the phone told me so and er anyway brought about the bridge and er i er accepted it you know what i mean it was that was it i'd done it myself
but i was walking in the market place shortly after only about just over a week after and i met an old fellow who had retired from hello graham
what you doing
not much i says no i'm out of a job
he says what
i says you hear what i said i've got i explained a bit to him he says i tell you what there's something going down he says they don't make nothing there he says but they buy anything and everything
he says it's come to my knowledge cos er they want this and that and the other
so he says you ought to go down there you can mention my name
so i went down and mr at that time was mayor of willenhall a very influential man and he was er over and er his son had to became in charge but anyway i went to see him it was mr and er about it and he says er well we got er a order for four locks here he says er i wonder if er you could quote me for them
i says well i'll have a look and quote
i says i'll let you know sometime today or tomorrow and er anyway he was expecting me to say at least two or three or four weeks you know er because i'd put the situation i had no tools no nothing and erm i er had a look at it and i thought what i could do and i says i can let you have them in a week
what
he says i can i can let you have them in a week
he had an old brew house there and on the side of the sink there i built a good UNK bench about like that square put a vice on it you know
and i'll say this now they was in business there UNK and i knew them like that they says any machinery come here and use it and they'd got UNK and all that sort of thing and with their help you know i had these four locks and did them and took them down in no time to m to er to and they was UNK because of the UNK of them you know and they says er we can always find you UNK to work if er this is the case
so i er carried on with what they found me with this in the brew house and then er where did i go from there
you went
then i went that's right me
i would've me brother and i would've got a pub in erm excuse me asking these questions because it's a bit vague you know
that's fine don't worry
and er
and er in the piece of property at the back of the pub down the opposite side of the road down a lane you went on to and there was a football field couple of football fields there and prior to this they'd have to if they could use this little place as a UNK room and he said yes
well when he said i could come it was er september
so i worked down here and nights up there preparing it and all round this place was coat UNK and that where they all hung their things and i had to knock them down you know what i mean and fix me own benches up and er i'd got a little UNK and er sufficient for me to start
and then after a time we er had the er electricity took up the yard and into the shop and then we was able to buy a little machine you know what i mean and it went from there
and i supplied ooh couldn't tell you the firms
as a matter of fact a UNK fellow named lived in here and he was a UNK to er george he's one of the best biggest UNK in the town anyway they're on this erm now and er he was going round for orders for UNK of his for his firm and somebody one day asked him look here we've got a little awkward job here you know anybody the can you do it
oh he says we couldn't do that he says that now he says i couldn't get that done for you
but after a thinking he says listen leave it with me i'll see what i can do
so they did that and he came and sorted me out
i dunno how he knew about me
but he came and sorted me out and i asked i said i'll see what i can do and i got hold of it and i did it for him
and he was bringing orders right left and centre off of his clients
england ireland scotland and wales michael no doubt about it
and in no time at all i didn't have to ask for jobs i'd got more than i could do you know and er i was still very well taken care of in the shop
it was a lovely shop bought it up here up but me brother left the brew left the pub and er it meant that i had to get out you know
well with about forty visits to er walsall the council and different other departments
yes that's right love
two friends of mine and they says er c can we find you a place in our that's right love
er arthur and er played for walsall football club arthur but er they little shop there
i cleared that and fixed the vice up and they said i could do that and i used the and that in their place and er then they had to UNK the premises completely didn't they
i mean they'd got to be out for er couldn't tell you christmas or something like that
poor mr died and
mr
they had to come out and
UNK arthur had retired
his pal his UNK was retired and a few months after arthur died so it left me the one and the owners of the property they give me notice to UNK and no messing about er and when i talked to them they give me twelve months rate free to erm get out
and as i say i was able to get in touch with me brother and fix this little shop up there and er no i've said that i've er i've er
you don't come
eh
you don't come
famous london fair
but er
the ship that the queen sailed on and princess elizabeth
i'll tell you about that in a minute and then er i er had to go about forty times for permission
that side of this ro industrial this side is residential and that's strict you know what i mean
but this premise was there at that time and by oh i had to go to a great extent on a number of visits and they er granted it me on UNK grounds and there's er i was only looking in the back of there the other day and there's one there now
cos there's er due to retire d in nineteen forty two nineteen eighty two a three year licence to own that premise there
you know this is how it was first and i only come across that but how it went they felt i was genuine i suppose and they could trust me and they left it as it was and i had me own building
i had er i sent the dimensions to the firm at UNK and er i had to go to the bank and borrow the money because you see the money i paid if i don't pay cash i'd gotta have six months delivery
and they er i ordered this the one saturday and two weeks after they come and put it up
that was how it was two weeks after and er
it was otherwise six months if you don't pay cash
if i don't pay cash and er been the best thing i ever done and its been sufficient you know what i mean and er all the people there ain't nobody in this town that i ain't worked for sometime or other
all the odd jobs they've sent to me and my stock in trade was special purpose items or UNK requirements
i never ever had a running line as i could offer anybody although you know when the museum come when i had orders for two or three dozen
if i had an order for thirty six i'd make thirty seven you know what i mean
cos in case there was a mistake and on one side and i and i had quite a number of things accumulate in that way you know
but i never ever had a running line although they did have an order for so many like that and i'd keep the patterns and the UNK and if they wanted any more later on you know i used to do that sort of thing for the sake of me customers and all that
and er they er went around the town and if anybody wanted anything it this applied to local UNK and all that sort of thing
when they was doing the decorating and that and a lock went wrong oh take it down to dick and er they'd bring it and whatever i was doing however important it was just because they'd be finish the decorating at night and they wanted to put the lock back i'd drop what i was doing and do this for them
and i was gonna tell you this
i don't know whether you'll think i'm UNK but that isn't the case but i never ever UNK it and it a great deal of respect for me you know and i could see that and did appreciate it and i know the people appreciated it just the same and erm it's gone on from then till now but about i retired in seventy three i was sixty five and i said i'd only do what anybody wanted for me cos they had me in for the tax and i never ever heard twenty one i think it was or thirty one in come and i'd go before i could satisfy them at walsall but er i'd got not got enough money to be taxed in the bank which was true
please understand me but no thousands of pounds is er taxable see what i mean they've never i should never applied and they had to send about oh above twenty returns yearly return
i was up till three o'clock in the morning very often getting these prepared because they wanted them as quickly as possible you know and er it was the same when i don't know when
mm
where are you now
yes well er i was saying er it was this mr i think it was but it was to do with er a big firm in at the time and they wanted er some locks at liverpool
there was a big firm in UNK and there was a big firm in london
it was er international company UNK like that UNK and er they asked me about it and i said i'll see what i can do
so er what was it er
you made them
and er that's right and they told me what they wanted and er that's right there was a hundred and fifty five locks
five different kinds for different parts of the ship
about thirty in each suite to differ and a master key and as i say there was five UNK and they had to make a key that'd open everyone of the fifty five
yet there was five separate master keys to each suite
this is applied because of the wards you understand what i mean
i had to keep more or less the leverage more or less the same because you couldn't differ them and er i er had that job to er do for and er it was the h m s gothic and they was going to south africa and er when er they was on in the middle of south africa on the coast one of the UNK died
queen's father
george the fifth
her father
her father died and they had to come back from their this particular and come back
but i made their locks for h m s gothic
hundred and fifty five locks five UNK thirteen a suite approximately and er a master key to each suite and a UNK grand master to take the whole lot
and there was some sliding door locks and some er lift up locks
erm some of the doors slide like backwards and forwards and some UNK on hinges which is er totally different do you understand
he used to at his brother's shop
but it was my it was my UNK requirements
this is what they wanted and i undertook to do it and i tell you all me life i've been able to and have done that
yes
i know you hadn't finished them had you when they was ready to set sail
no
and they sent a big from down there
oh ah
doctor had to fit fetch a little parcel
yes when they was fitting them on the h m s gothic they sent they UNK and i asked if they so i stopped work all saturday and this er big er were it
yeah
from UNK to take these two three lots and he could put them in his but anyway they were all gonna be done
when he were down the town hall
they were all done and it's coming back clearly now
this is perfectly true and he thought he'd be back the same day and he wasn't
but because he wasn't i worked as hard as i could until dark about night time to get them done for the next day
and he says well i can wait till tomorrow better than going back and coming again
so er i went down the red lion in willenhall and fixed him up for a night's UNK didn't i and the driver and then er i worked on worked on and on and was able to get these er done for him to take back to fit this ship
cos it was due to sail on the same day on the sunday you know what i mean and er it was these locks as i'm telling you about and her a very famous firm and er my correspondence come from london because he had offices was there you know and erm our erm i've been at the service as i if i might say so but in most people it's surprising how it UNK round and er the jobs that i've had to do
they come once from UNK church
it er they'd had a fire there and they wanted to know if i could replace the lock
i said certainly
well they'd got the skeleton that wanted a big brass lock but er oh you know lovely and er it was more trouble getting the thing through the pan to get er the case than putting the UNK in it if you follow what i mean
but it was for the lock from the people you know and he got round like this and this is the god's truth as well again he'd come to me from america and er they i had to make locks for certain people they called them UNK status symbols there in their own houses you know where they put this lock on and anybody as he's got one like that you know and from america to dick in willenhall to make them
we've got some
but this is the truth mi michael
we've got some of those big gate locks as well you made one of
have you
those as well yes that you made yeah
yes
yeah
yes well as i say you're coming into the shop and i don't know what was in now i couldn't tell you but anyway
and the lighthouse locks you made
yes the lighthouse locks
the lighthouse locks yes
oh the lighthouse locks that was wonderful
i made UNK locks for li UNK all round the world michael
this is the truth my lad and the first i made for was for the that just off canada is new UNK
new UNK there was a lighthouse there and er because these people worked together you know
it's the same as everything and everybody and because er they were satisfied with it they wanted some more and they took the old lo lock off and put some more on what i'd made see what i mean
and i made locks for UNK i'm not UNK my lad and they'd li locks for UNK pretty near all round the world
and onto ou round australia and that and i mentioned i started in new UNK yes
used to be lovely to go on a trip with him
big er houses you know
you'd lose him when you got inside he'd be examining the locks on the doors
ah
i'd say where UNK you go
oh he's looking at that lock there
you mentioned also a bit once when i came before about the erm the lock for the cricket ground
was it lord's
oh yes
lord's yes
i made four locks for the gates on lord's cricket ground er and when i'm telling you this and practically without exception they must've er got to know me and they come for what they wanted
couldn't really tell you what it was now but i made four locks for lord's cricket ground
there was four gates on the ground apparently
they was gate locks
you wouldn't call them like UNK locks or you know like UNK as you fit in the door or anything like that
it's what the customer required gate locks
they'd gotta be secure as you could imagine and er not easily picked if you follow what i mean and er yes made i made four locks for lord's cricket ground
did the big companies like parks and UNK and so on
did they come to you at all
yes they did but very seldom
they er they used to come at the first and i'll tell you this and i it's my opinion they got one of their own men er i'd UNK them off you know what i mean to do their own odd jobs
it was much more convenient than putting them out see
but i have worked for the UNK and UNK in the very first instance yes
why do you want to say UNK then what
when you were working at what sort of lock were you making there
was this was the coin lock coin operated locks was it
er well they made
the re the essence of was they made more or less the UNK requirements
now the UNK and union locks they'd got a certain type of locks that they produced and it was all done with a system you know what i mean and more or less come to assembly and er they did that
but these firms as i said they wanted this or that or the other and with er because of this fellow mr he did nothing to get it out of his so it just happened you know what i mean
and i'll send that to dick and he'll fix you're up and saved them going to the lot of trouble on their own er ground
money was particularly no object you follow what i mean people in that kind of business
i never ever charged enough never ever charged enough but they said dick will fix you up you know
and their odd jobs they'd probably got men in their own factory to do it but no they sent them to dick and i er used to UNK
and er i was well known if i might say and proud of this michael
well respected and they'd all er have a word me anytime and i could go into any office you know what i mean and er yeah
they was UNK locks weren't they
we worked in my shop that's what i was telling you about
there was quite a few men and made more or less the UNK requirements and when i was in charge there was sixteen and they about in two or three parties er you know and they'd make different kinds of locks what was ordered and not particularly er UNK or UNK er what the customer required
didn't they make the slot locks
yes
that's what he wanted to know
yes and er i er they got me on that and i'd er seen a bit on it before hand one way or another but i went to a place and asked them if i could er see and er they showed me and explained it the er the way to er
cos you could put one coin in or two and er sometimes th there was UNK and pennies then
well you put UNK through it th the gap was too wide and it went right through
if you put a penny in it was like that michael whereas a penny could it come like that and held it
it moved two things which put it into operation you know and er i could turn the UNK and it'd get the whole thing going it'd get you inside it'd register that it'd been when you shut the door as soon as you shut in the toilets as soon as you shut the door the penny dropped down see what i mean
it was you opened it and come out and shut the door and you'd lose the penny then they'd got to go through the same operation with another penny you know what i mean
and er i erm i organised a lot of that sort of thing erm by er it was exact measurements and UNK and you know like erm yes i couldn't remember a lot now but er a lot of people if i might say so used me you know michael my knowledge and skill and i allowed them to and i'm not complaining
well they're used to them slot locks on the toilets aren't they
right
yeah
where did you learn most of your skills as a UNK
was it at or
yes
or bef before then
yes because i went to i only had a few weeks at er and that was and i wouldn't stick that
i says i want to learn UNK so i went to and i don't know what it was whether it was my attitude but they asked me to do this and i was so good at it so they started finding jobs for me and it was at and i was anxious for knowledge and i tell you took anything on which is important and the big firms didn't
as a matter of fact i'm saying earlier on that the big firms send them to you know to er
they were mass production
whatever want or could get oh bring it here we'll do it
they used to come to dick see
wh what sort of hours did you work when you were at did they did they change
only or
over the years
no only ordinary
and what were they
well we used to work from eight to half past five and then from eight to half past twelve fifty two and half hours when i started first
but er you know it come down to forty six and usually only do about thirty eight now that is UNK like and er it's only half a week
but when i started it was fifty two and a half hours a week yes
and er the half hour was er erm we had nine and a half five days that was er from eight till half past five i don't know but it was fifty two and a half hours from eight till half past twelve on a saturday and er
did you get breaks during the day
were did you
oh yes
you did
you always er
about half past twelve
you always had a i had a dinner time half past twelve to half past one every day and er you was allowed to have a cup of tea
as a matter of fact a lot of the firms provided the cup of UNK you could go and get one you know what i mean
i think at that time you had to pay for it but you could go and have ten minutes UNK like that and a cup of tea
it weren't er just all you know there was a certain amount of er thought attached to it and as i say the people was er accepted by the UNK and er respected you know what i mean
but there was always them as just wanted to come and do nothing and pick the money up and that's what they had to sort out the firms
and i don't think that's changed now do you
i don't think it's changed but that has applied all the while my lad
yes
yes and er if i might s oh i er don't know i've been to bloody shop meself but i ain't sorry about it cos i've done what i've wanted to do and i've enjoyed what i've done and erm the authorities they UNK me that on er hardship grounds there as i say being on er residential premise and er they showed me great respect and er
too old to travel on that's why they
the local council who i wo i call it used me but not in er whatsit sense er it's helped you know it's helped them and er whatever it's become well known if i might say so in locks i'll go to dick
were there a lot of erm sort of small workshops like yours a few years ago when you
there were
started up
there were
there were
as a matter of fact when i'm talking about let me see er fifty years ago there was one up at every back yard that's the truth
and er used to go
i'd got one didn't i that's right
but erm
what why do you think they why do you think they've gone so many of them
why do you think they've disappeared
well er the reason was erm technique and science and they'd they all the firms or who was in business had to make locks their own way you know what i mean and use the best facilities they could get hold of but science and progress came into being and they cou they made what you could call locks erm repetition
er they had a lock made it a good lock and sent it to all the clients and this is what we can supply and it used to meet the needs of clients and they'd er they'd erm buy it and it kept them in business you see what i mean
and then other firms did that and er they was the same people nearly got their own lines and it was worse that was so they got onto the same lines and er the competition became then financial
there used to be nearly every
i say the competition then later on became financial
them as who could make it a bit cheaper see and all that
but you said erm certain things could be we had a machine once and you'd got to pull four or five UNK
when you had pulled five UNK there was an article produced
each time you pulled a handle it did one job and er couldn't tell you really now what it was you know but er you'd pull the five UNK in a few minutes and the damn thing was done
and er another UNK cost ten times as much and that to produce
did you see much machinery being brought in while you were at
no
as a matter of fact that what they were lacking in and we er we had a UNK and er we had a UNK and er horizontal UNK for turning and a UNK when i say UNK i mean UNK wheel and that's about all we'd got in the shop
yeah but it was old fashioned wasn't it
so it was all ha hand work was it
yes
yes it was yes it was
when you went to the UNK you'd gotta hold it in your hand or get a UNK a UNK to hold the thing on pull put the drill in
when you had got to go to the UNK wheel you'd gotta hold the things and UNK wheel them and yourself
and er
oh yes it was very old fashioned
when you wanted to do something with the keys or operate er horizontal there was a machine and you had to go to the do it yourself
and each man or perhaps been one or two men doing the one jo the one order and they was each responsible for their own and then you'd gotta put your name down sometimes for a machine you know
i'm on next you know what i mean and er oh ah old fashioned time yeah
but it was a it was a good place to work you think
oh i shall never regret er i don't know but i'm just perhaps one on me own but er it couldn't have been better for because i was a UNK and er i wanted to learn and wanted to get on and they allowed me they allowed me to do what i wanted
i was very happy
never ever had half as much wage as i really should've had and i say to that's never bothered me
i've never ever i say this very UNK been in debt and as long as i've earned enough money to live i've never bothered to put any on one side strict you know strictly speaking and i've been happy to er live and er that's how i've lived me life
right
i think that's that yep
right
but in the first instance as i say we i was one of six children and er i don't think there was one working while they was i mean they was all born before there was anybody old enough to work you find that's and our albert me dad had albert up and he er never give me mother any wages for albert
he used to give albert some pocket money and he was satisfied but me mother wasn't
and i said to me mother i says look here when i'm old enough to work i UNK i ain't going to work for me dad i shall get a job on me own
i says he ain't doing on me what he's doing on albert
i says i sure of that and er i left and went and got into a row over it
but i went down harold i tell you and got the job
i couldn't have gone to a better place because they'd got most parts of the country and one thing and another and i fitted their bill to a tee
and they called me more or less er to do the odd jobs you know and in the brew house as was here i fixed i told you once i fixed a bench up it was as tight as could be and put a vice on it and all in here this shop here they says you can come in here anytime and do what you like and er
some friends at here they er was in the woods line and er the UNK ernie we went through little london school together and he says anything we can do anytime richard you've only gotta say
so i could always go up there and i used there little drill for one thing and another in the first place and er built that premise for me there did and i did er
in the shop and
he used to go to a UNK places er that as knocked down or well i couldn't tell you the kind of job but often there was some locks on the premises was er perhaps needed repair or he wanted them to be in before he could leave the job and say here you are that's the job done
and he used to bring anything and everything and that's not joking to me and er i'm proud of that
i was able to accommodate him at each time you follow what i mean
i'd make it me business to er yes and course it was to his trade good jobs as he'd done for customers had it done so well they told somebody else and it brought in trade see what i mean
when you were working up the shop up the back erm where were you getting your su supplies from i mean like were you were you buying castings did you need to buy
oh yes erm er i er i had er what was the what is it those in the you know
you used to have a casting
aye
and er
er
dennis
dennis and sammy er
sammy and er
you used to have your castings from there and then you have them off ernie
they i had them of ernie oh that's er that's a good girl shilling a pound brass castings
now brass is a pound in weight now never mind about shilling a pound
ernie
ernie house
the top of er there was somebody named was sold coal
right on the corner by the i believe the
there was a post office on the corner opposite the post office chapel post er opposite the UNK chapel and er up the back yard there was this premise it was behind a pub called the UNK and erm i rented it out there and er that was UNK to and the castings was a shilling a pound and er
they'd do they'd do special one off things for your would they
yes er that's been the essence of what i've wanted is er i've had to have what i've wanted by hook or by UNK and i don't mean UNK in a bad sense i mean one way or another you know what i mean and er i did job for the UNK same as they did jobs for me you know and that's how i've gone through life that is michael
helping one another and
three brass UNK there
you had three brass UNK there
had dennis
and er
ernie
you see
and then were
i could perhaps take a little bit of paper like that and i'd find
but they were all local weren't they anyway
i'd find
oh yes
i'd find something as er pretty near to what i wanted you know and i could perhaps and did use what's called UNK a lot you know and er warm it up and UNK it and put it onto er something to make it to what the shape i wanted you know
so you made you made your own patterns
and then the UNK cast that you know and another ca time i wanted er a projection you know and er i'd take a casting
cos they used to have gates with er two or three inches apart you know and i'd gotta have a projection
well i could go to the casting and asked him to put the pattern in and fire it for it to cut the sand out like that you know so that the UNK run in like that and you'd got the big head as you wanted you know and er it'd take you like castings with the machine and all that sort of thing it was all hand stuff you know and yeah
they'd have to be filed before you used them would they
oh i could go used to get them on the UNK wheel and er square them up with a pair of sliding UNK
michael i've had to work very exact my lad and these things i'd got the sliding UNK and put them on and they'd been the same at the front as they have at the back and that's the UNK as well
and when you've er loose them in the fore end or the front of the lock or do anything like that article as it's in when you lock it out it's gotta fit just as tight when it's locked out as when it's in
which means it's gotta be exact all the way round you know what i mean
and these are all part of er
and have it UNK up and then you can
that's what i used to do
they'd gotta be as i couldn't go to them
no
how did you learn to i mean looking at some of your locks they're sort of very fine
yeah
i mean did you did you learn this as you went on or did you did you
no it was er it was er oh how can i say er i used me head and er if you follow what i mean and imagination and er i could envisage what perhaps people wanted it was in my own mind and i'd make it up some way or another
you could call UNK if you like and er but UNK did apply my lad and er once you'd got one you could have er one cast and dress it up and you'd got another one you know what i mean
you make a thing as is gonna do the job and it's no problem then to get castings off it and all that sort of thing
but in a lot of instances to answer you i had to use me UNK
what i want and er how to get it
i couldn't tell you how but it i cos you'd i don't want nothing but when i did i'd gotta use my UNK to get something that i could get one or two or a dozen or ten off you know what i mean and i gotta make it and a lot of times i made it out of wood which was easily er you know treated
then you could get a piece of wood very rough understand me and then cast and then you could get the cast in down to UNK you follow what i mean and then er you could what you want
but i started off wood nearly in every instance
cos they used to send me er l er orders locks on drawings and six or UNK six or seven pages and that's all i'd got to go in see what i mean
well i'd start with wood and er get something rough to work off and then use me head as i say get it down to the requirements on the on the paper and then start to produce eventually you know and er
you used to have your keys off
eh
you used to have your keys off
yes arthur
oh i know
arthur in UNK
yes
they're one of the keys best keys men in a friend of mine
he was a we belonged to the same shed
he used to come to and i was a member of UNK for sixty years and er anything i can do richard you know
and i used to go up there and tell him what i wanted and as far as keys and anything like that got sent to me he would
erm UNK he's he was in the paper a short while ago eighty two were it
UNK evans
yes i think so
you know and he's eighty two now and er that makes him about five year older than me but to tw i'm talking about twenty thirty year ago five make no difference then you know and we ha had the same understanding
he knew as he could come to me er he used to bring me lock keys of all sorts and er he could get the castings or the patterns or what it is like that and he knows i could fashion them to fit the lock and all that sort of thin and we were very
so you'd they gave they sent you the UNK did they and you'd work them up
oh yes oh yes erm and i'm on about er on about for one thing but you'd be surprised er it's the biggest and most elaborate trade of any in the world locks and keys i say that very firmly because er there's no limit there's no extent and you there might be required anything and as i say er i er i had these locks for the UNK and that you know and er i thought i mentioned it before i made fifty locks all different and i had to number them and keep a record of them and er i had a you had the keys on a wire numbered one up to fifty and they was for big UNK you know what i mean and er they could go in one ward i'm on about places where they'd have twenty or thirty people you know and er there's only one bloke could get in there
be a different master key for the next ward and all that sort of thing
there was fifty and there was five UNK and three UNK and i had to get a piece of paper and er make a when you get one two three and then five you could have er three two one and five four three two one you know what i mean
then i could have two a one three and four three two one five do you know what i mean
and i had to make all these er UNK out and er i made fifty that i thought nobody could pick
there was no michael it's just only way co mind you could only do these on one sided because when you turn your key the other side it's gotta be th exactly the same to do the job
but this was because it was one sided they used to lock it from the outside and there was a catch on the inside as they could put in
they only used to ever lock the door from the outside and er i er had to make er fifty and as i say number them one up to fifty and er then they'd perhaps on a odd occasion they sent me an order for one the number the number
and then your metal you used to have to hadn't you
yes and er but erm that was one of the most famous in my opinion
it was only a one sided lock which is completely and totally different to an ordinary lock er working both sides you see what i mean and er i er i'd got to er make a key number thirty nine just like that see but i had it and i could find out what thirty nine was and i could make them one and send it and knowing it would fit see and er when they had different people working there you know staff things like that not a lot of orders but er somebody else come
they might want him or her to have a key you know and er and just ran the keys up on a thing like that you know what i mean they was never out of the person's possession
it wasn't er it wasn't good to leave them about you know what i mean and er oh er yes it's been very important if i might say so certain things as i've had been called upon to do and i've been happy and proud to do it
when you were working at were the union important at all the lock making union
oh yes i've al i was always in the union
as a matter of fact er yes i joined at sixteen on the union when i was a kid and er i've always believed in it and i encourage others to do the same
and when i er went to go on me own er i still wanted to keep in the union and i went down the UNK union which was in the market place and they said they er we couldn't we couldn't have you in the union if you go on your own erm there's another UNK or something was something that you'd have to join or something like that and be on your own
well er when i er when i er i couldn't remember much what it was now but whatever the union fee was when i started on me own to be er satisfied of cos of circumstances i might need money you know i thought it would say the union fee was a shilling i had to pay one and six half as much as whatever it was and i did do
never ever been out of a union er till i retired cos i always paid these fees and er yes
you always felt it was er an important thing to belong
well er i didn't want to be out of it or awkward or off it or anything if it was right and i felt that it was right i'd UNK to that whether or not you follow what i mean that's how i've lived me life michael yes
was mr at the union in those days
yes oh yes
you see until er he lived in er you're on a about fifty or sixty years ago you know yes
i we live in then up to UNK but he lived in you know and er
were there any times when the union was when the union was quite important
when they helped to solve a problem at can you remember any instance
well er as i say i've always been a union member but then when i was self employed it was different and i kept me fees up for a to somewhere i don't know what it was but er when er yes when er i was coming to come on me own and i went down the UNK to see about it and they said er what did they say now they said you couldn't do that whatever it was and er we'll have to do this and that and the other
and i er i had to er see a solicitor or something
not er to pay but a bloke with knowledge to ask him what was my rights you know and all that sort of thing
changing from making locks
changing from being employed to being self employed it's a big change that is you and er and er the union the union helped me and er told me what i could do and what i couldn't do and all that sort of thing
i had to pay some money i just forget now very little but er as i've said half a dozen times now i always wanted to do what was right you know and i aim to do that
that's how i've er that's how i've gone through life my lad that is
well james what can i do for you tonight
it's my knee again
