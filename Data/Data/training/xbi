it's at you can feel the slight in there
ah
just there you can feel that feel that feel it catching
but that's UNK than it was before
so that's good
now what we'll need to get you doing is some exercise to strengthen up the muscle across there
and pull that UNK tight together jim
what i want you to do is just with you sitting just now just lift your leg up like that just hold it with your two hands
and just do that
about twenty times a day
now your UNK be sore when you start doing it because you this muscle has to get UNK up again
and let that UNK get joined up
but as you keep doing that every day it'll get less and less and less painful
and after about a week there'll be no pain in it and you'll be doing it no bother at all
and that UNK grow over the top of that UNK and it'll get rid of all that for you jim
okay
well that's so as you're going to win after all
you're going to win
er what about the UNK now are you still
er could i erm have a prescription for
aye sure
i'm still on the forty
the be you still on that
do you need them
no that's just
no you're all
it's just i don't have any UNK
right
now then if you do these wee exercises jim and then come back up and see me in about f say four weeks
let's say four weeks
okay
and we'll just check that out again and make sure that that's all got UNK over
you're at number two
yes number two you haven't gone and left home since i saw you last no
no
you're still at
but that's good i'm pleased
that's well that's since january
aye
it's been really slow
cos yeah er it er it does worry you
and er if we can get it to just well a wee bit of rest we get to the stage where it er starts to get soft again
it means we can get the muscle to grow over the top and bury that underneath and let the whole thing get back to normal
okay
but just nice gentle exercises
no UNK up and down
eh
okay
yeah
just do it nice and gently and that'll come back to normal
right thanks doctor
okay
thanks
right
bye
okay john cheerio now
so you've got you know that sheet
right
yes
so there's s six five
right number five is actually at the bottom of the
yeah
pile you've got there
sorry can i bring you
yes please
thank you
that five there
that's right
so that go that goes there then really does it
no
that five there
there's another five
five
no there's another five
this one
no not that five
for it's got forty seven at the bottom is that the one this one
that five
right
that goes
under the there yeah
right got it
you're not gonna say anything are you
let it be noted that j head of was actually in the room at the time of this meeting
right
from what i can recall from last time we met the purpose of the meeting is to actually pick up on the training program
and review where we got last time and to plan ahead erm for the future
it's also part of the investing in people process of putting together a flexible training plan which is one of our action targets erm from that
now what i've actually also got on the photocopy and i think i've even got less sheets than for this one i think i've only got three booklets
it's part of the i p i actually picked up rather UNK erm some things from the tech erm that actually take me through the various stages of i p
so that erm the self assessment erm number one how to plan for the future is just a business planning aspect of i p
three is the training programme which i'll go to the UNK in a minute
four is the appraisal section
and UNK evaluation
so i had a quick look at them
erm and they look quite good but UNK i could have done with them after the first workshop
mm
no but how much do you think they cost
a fortune i expect
how much do you think
three hundred pounds
more
a thousand pounds
more
eleven hundred quid apparently just that
but we only
who's produced them
it's
erm the people who our training UNK just gone to i p l
UNK
somebody anyway
and
oh andrea
yeah
andrea
have you got them insured
so i've got
she was staying with the tech wasn't she
was she not
er i think she was erm UNK a bit when we saw her wasn't she
if you give that s there's one there if you give me mine back i'll give it to ray
there's actually the self assessment brochure
erm takes you through the er sort of background to i p
so if you'd like to hang on to that
that'll sort of give you erm where we should be at the minute
with this and talked about the rest of the books
may as well er hang on to that and that
d don't lose them
is this something all organizations in north yorkshire are getting
i'm not quite sure i think most organizations have a certain amount of sum of money if i can remember from the workshops
other than
public sector
that's right
yeah they get financed
mm
but they've a they've given us that because we can't get any of the help
with the sort of the interpretation i took on it
plus the fact we're in partnership with them etcetera
so it was a bit of a
but i mean even it obviously doesn't cost them over a thousand pounds to produce and i we wouldn't have bought it anyway so in a sense it isn't they're not actually losing much by giving to us are they
not really but the UNK thing is looking at
yeah
erm i only picked this up cos i went to the workshop on flexible training and that happened to be there
she didn't even say this is what it is
yeah
just as i walked out the door there was that there and i said oh what's this
so she said what it was and then looking through it actually certainly we could have done with a UNK i could have looked at the flexible thing before we came to the meeting because it
mhm
it actually really is a step by step guide to how to put a flexible training programme together
erm for i p
which as i say i've got on the UNK at the minute and er which want to look at
mm
but it's quite interesting really
erm take some time to have a brief look at that
so the paper you've got in front of you from the last meeting then
the top two sheets are almost a summary for all the staff that i never actually got sent out but it has been to the staff consultative committee who gave it a nod
without spotting the deliberate mistake
which was that four point one wasn't included in the papers that went to staff consultative which was the general list of things that we pulled out from the UNK last time
erm to that point of view
and you've taken as well
nobody picked that up
er
well that list was
yes because it's in the other list the other papers
yeah
that went to c s n t
ah right
in there
and e what i'd put on what i'd said to her erm i think i'd put on here you know re refer to section five on of the UNK list and she'd all she'd typed in is where is section five of the UNK list i couldn't find
and i hadn't spotted it
erm so that's b that's the list from there
i want to know what work with UNK ed is
UNK ed
i taken one thing i think there's one here UNK
mhm
on that bit is and i know it's gonna be included is er your training in european issues
that's for the information group
yeah and i know you've you sent a note round about it as well didn't you
yeah
and she and she sheila
that's in response to UNK er UNK
i see
she was from that note if you have you sort of left it to her to organize the training
kevin also mentioned the other day about group work for e os
was that had we and i know we mentioned it when we met last time but was that really we're including in e o work with the unemployed
mhm
mm and presentation skills
well it was all it was in with presentation skills
skills as well
co cos julie mentioned that again to me as well for the training for work
e os
yeah
doing group work
mm
yeah
so i mean i was debating whether to actually send this out i might wait and see what happens
from today and whether or not we make much progress
but i might send this out just as a holding a holding note anyway
erm
i think that would be a good idea so that
yeah
people know some sort of progress report isn't it really
generally what's going on
that's right
i won i wonder about on interviewing skills for all staff
mm
the interviewing course for careers officers isn't really strictly speaking interviewing skills
i don't know whether it's worth putting it as a separate
what do you want to call it
just careers guidance
cos it's about the whole it's not just about interviewing
it's sort of that and it's not really a skills course
i mean we c we can leave it like that but i if people then wanted to go
alright well tell me what you call it
well you could put interviewing skills that would be for employment officers wouldn't it then
mm
and then careers guidance i think covers it
and it's called enhanced careers guidance
i think i can live with that
individual careers guidance actually
which i suppose is
interviewing skills
but it's not i mean it is quite theoretical so it sort of represents it wrongly
so it's enhanced careers guidance
that's what it was called yeah
for individuals
do i mean i don't know whether we'll keep the individuals on the next one cos people did talk about group work
yeah
the other thing is with employer legislation update did we decide to do some training on that or did we decide that we would produce a handout
yeah we did talk about that
or did we decide we'd do both
i think didn't we say we'd cover it as part of an e o workshop
mm
because that was the sort of
oh right
thing that was that was coming into
right ho
okay
i know that the UNK of guidance is in that list and from the brief discussion we had at the careers officer's meeting this week about UNK of guidance i know we're starting off the process by having representatives come to a meeting on the eleventh of may
but it's such a broad issue that any opportunity we do get to have a broader discussion for more individuals to contribute their or have their say you know again on a workshop or something i would very much support that
we had actually got that in for that september
mm
on we got a date for that on the c os day
workshop
yeah
oh good
mm
to do
right that's fine then
but it was about i there were three things on the day so it should be an hour and half a couple of hours
yeah
in september and then after that
it's it it's more than sort of a ten minute slot in a staff meeting
yeah
you know to feed into a rep though
yeah
isn't it
yeah
i try to think of the three things we'd identified for the for the fifteenth of september
erm one was careers one was careers guidance agreements wasn't it a review of that
yeah
i think one was UNK of guidance
yeah
and i can't remember what the other one was
was it an update on the
mm don't know
no it's i c g conference isn't it the fifteenth of september
is it
there won't be that many going though will there
to plymouth
do you reckon
well she er who usually goes sheila
jayne
a wednesday
well i've got i c g conference on the thirteenth to the fifteenth but maybe it's er maybe it's just as iris is away for
oh i'm at UNK university
it's usually on a starts the friday till the monday doesn't it
must be maybe it's just the boss is away till the fifteenth
oh i've got it here evaluation
oh right
er careers guidance agreements and a g
ah that's right we said would do it
yeah
well that's actually written down here isn't it
is it
yeah
c o workshop
fourteenth and fifteenth of september colon UNK of guidance
oh right yeah
yes
yeah
i always thought you were
well done jayne
well done jayne
do you want me to play this to the lot on the way to UNK next week
i think you might have better things oh do you
right
okay
erm just UNK on this the business and financial management list that's down here are actually negotiating UNK erm to get twelve to fifteen grand off the management initiative for the region
to erm run some business and financial planning management courses
so steve and myself are er have done a done a bid that we should know today whether or not it's going to the main group and if it goes to the main group there's a great chance it'll be accepted
if it doesn't go to the main group it won't be and we may have to do something ourselves
what do you mean the main group
sorry there's a UNK of the national management initiative
right
of looking at them and trying to do a bit of s sorting out
right
erm and if they accept it which includes cathy UNK erm jean linda and the guy who's running it who's name UNK me or something like that
erm he'll erm if they accept it it'll stand a chance of getting them to the main group
so we should know that but whether it'll allow how many of us it'll allow to go on it i don't know
erm
cos there'll only be so many from each authority i suppose
yeah
in the region
erm okay
but it might not be the sort of thing where numbers need to be i mean
mm
it's not gonna be the sort of thing you need to go into small groups and discuss
no
in a sense is it
it's more the sort of erm lecture style delivery i'd have thought would be appropriate so
mm
you it may be reasonable
actually one other thing that isn't done but then i know it's gonna be done on divisional basis is the appraisal training
you know this
appraisal interviews things
well appraisal training
which you know i know
mm
harrogate have they've done theirs
mm
but i don't think anybody else has
i'm not gonna do it like that because if i train everybody some people might be trained and it's a y a years before they're UNK
i'm gonna do it in small groups as we get to people
so you're still gonna do that sort of three hour training
i don i don't know if it'll be three hours i mean ideally i know it should be it just depends how we can fit it in
but that's what i'm gonna try to do
maybe with groups of us as small as sort of six to ten
cos otherwise UNK have it so far in advance of their appraisal
and i don't think that's appropriate
mm
so you see there'll be within the division erm well five of us UNK
so we'll all identify the next two people we're going to UNK and perhaps get that te group of ten together you see
right
and then that will take us for a period of about probably three months cos we're saying we'll done one at least every six weeks
well perhaps we could e t and f we could fit into that
i was gonna ask sue if can i
mm
sort of fit the adult careers office into that
yeah
when are you gonna be starting
i don't know
soon because we just we've nearly finish i've nearly finished doing peop well bill's still got to do diane i've got to do cath and then we're ready to start
i've got a appraisal
yeah
should we include our ones in that then
our
well we did decide
did we
yeah
mm
we had some discussion at somewhere that we decided that erm to include them in the divisional training yeah
right
if you could cynthia
otherwise i'll organize something
can i have a piece of paper
but they will but they will be UNK by who will UNK them then
well if it it'll be julie neil or alison
right
just one
were any of the adult careers officers including the harrogate one actually fitting them in you see
i c er i can't remember
no
er deborah did a sheet with everybody on who was going to be UNK who
but i can't think what she said about the adult team
i mean the b with the training but i mean
yeah
they weren't
well i mean she no i don't know no
but i imagine it'll all be people on that list who were involved in training i can't remember
cos if it was as long as three hours then i'd expect julie would have had to program them in for it wouldn't she
mm
although i did ask deborah to include
oh well perhaps she did then
i'm sure she would
mm
okay
anything else that's missing
can i just go over the page onto the number six that says what we've already done
where it's already got a c g just after is that the c o c t one jayne or just a careers officer one
that's just careers officers
there's a separate one for UNK teachers
if you remember it means
yeah
paper
i haven't seen anything sent out about that careers
i've got it with me
teacher one
has it gone now
oh the UNK
has i has jim sent it out do you know
i don't know i sent in to him
yeah i know you said
cos i haven't done anything with it cos you said you'd send it him and i couldn't decide whether i was supposed to send it ahead or he was
no it was going in the book
he said it was going in the level two book
ah right
i've got the information about the c os one today
so you
right
can send it out
right okay
erm
we're seeing jim a week on tuesday aren't we
well we were
oh
unless we can shift it up here
because i know have to go to dorothy 's UNK council
UNK as the expert witness
let's get cath up
let's get cath up and erm we'll er
where did you think it was then allen that meeting
york
oh did you
oh right
if that UNK been cath that would have been a real turn up for me wouldn't it
can i borrow a tap a minute
okay smashing
thanks
you don't know the trouble we've had actually getting this
this coffee
i though the UNK eye coffee
i think it broke the filter
morning cath
morning
morning
liz has got some stuff for you
hang on
oh right
that's what i'm just looking for hang on
one of the things UNK working on for us is the training records system
erm h how's that getting on cath
training records
erm halfway
which half
the top half or the bottom half
well er i don't like to say i don't really know
erm maybe about three quarters
computer writing it
yes it's going on to word processor
yes
mhm
yeah
yeah it's a slow job
er let me just check
so is that is that last year's training
for all the years
from when anybody started the training goes right through up till the last bit of training they've done
right
so it isn't really an upgrade
yes
at the moment
it's er
but you don't have it
i don't but it's lying it must be lying on my desk
very time consuming
dorothy could perhaps fax it up cos i had it typed out yesterday so we could do it
shall i do that
shall i give her a ring and ask her to fax it
well cath could do it
what's that
could you fa could you ring dorothy
yes
on top of my desk there's a ha there's one of these
one of these inside it says to go out
to go out to go out today
and it's about the c os c e d software training
oh right
and there's three pages
and you want it UNK back here
yeah
right okay
i bet it's not there
sorry
mm
it's alright
right so maybe before we go any farther with this er if we just before we do that
there's nothing else to add
the paper that went to er c s m t erm was really a similar one but just partly with a bit more erm details
and where we were with investors in people
erm so that we may well have to link in to the training programme and go back and check for instance in three where i've talked about the business plans
have we actually got any training for those nine points there that say you know are we doing something on UNK i know the product UNK developing
but do we
yeah
need any training for that
do we need any training on consumer evaluation
do we need any training on erm if we change the line management of the UNK team do we need any training on next
picking up after t two m
erm anything on UNK libraries and anything on reviewing the c e g framework document
so we'll have to i think keep going back to these throughout the year and saying are we erm are we doing it
i mean some of those some of those are already done aren't they
i mean the marketing our guidance is the product specification one
that's on the list already
where's that
marketing our guidance
i think that relates to
oh right
the product specification
and
yeah
there is evaluation plan for this year is meeting on the fifteenth of september so for c os there's some work on consumer evaluation
in sc with s the school
clients
that school and college clients
but perhaps not with the other groups there
yeah
the next one it really depends what changes we make but any changes will potentially have training implications won't they so
mm
that's right
next we could probably i mean UNK looking after that one isn't she
yes
there there's been a she asked us to do something in relation to employer awareness campaign
yeah
you could describe as training
did you do anything on your marketing employer awareness er
on that no
mm
is that worth repeating that course do you think
oh i think it is
yeah
it seemed to go down very well
yeah
if you can afford another four hundred pounds or whatever it was
you were on that were you
yes it was really good
i thought it was useful
don't let's go there again though cos i spent all day making coffee
you won't get bill there again
you won't get bill there again no
why what happened to him
he got his car stolen
he got his car stolen
got his car nicked from
it made the news local news actually that
did it
i h well not h personally
bill's UNK car was used in a robbery
but the actual erm carry on they'd had with it
yeah
apparently was on the local news
cos they had a bit of a chase or something didn't they
mm
yeah they used it to get away
why did they choose bill's car i wonder
as in
it's probably old
no it's not no it's a erm UNK
or UNK or whatever
yeah
it's quite it's not that old
it was a UNK car so it's only a couple of years old
oh it's a lease car is it
it's not he'd just bought it
oh it's not a lease car
mm
just changed from a UNK t
anyway we'll have to i think revisit those nine points as w as we go on because that's
yeah
part of the thing
obviously then we need to pick up the appraisal system and i think what i'll have to do with that is as the targets UNK co start coming in erm we'll have to set up some sort of system preferably i suspect UNK
that will actually i'll be able to put the targets or the ideas of the targets onto computer and pick up any UNK training from that
do you will you get the training from the targets though because certainly from i mean UNK only talking about two appraisals so far
mm
that we've actually talked about training needs as part of the
mm
appraisal
but that's not really what the targets are focused on
very true
mm
mm
the UNK targets are focused on things that are within that own persons control that they can do something about themselves straight away
without any sort of training implications really
mm
mm
i don't know
but anyway the idea we have to fix up some sort of system that picks up the targets from that
yes maybe
mm
erm going through that four
erm the document we're gonna look at in a minute talks about training entitlement so we can maybe pick that up
we s talked to cath a minute or go about the full training record system
erm that should mean that UNK get a copy of their own UNK entitlement
whether you i mean a the problem with that is keeping it up to date on
mm
to u on more than an annual basis from this end
erm but you know we'll obviously try and do that
erm four point five talks about i mean we talked about everybody charging all over the country doing various visits
four point five
and the competence UNK came from that training course i was on that's saying everybody as well as having a job description you've got to have a competence ch UNK for that er helps you to develop the training for the job depending on the competencies you need
and that's gonna be a bit of a er challenge i think
but we obviously have to do it just for the levels of job
erm so we've maybe got a dozen to do for the service and i'll have to look at that and go from there
and then when we had the UNK as i said
and then the cost benefit evidence of need i drew out a f a paper
erm on the back i think for each course we'll have to try and fill in
but again that's i noticed erm looking through the particular about the organization er sheet is actually there's something in there about that as well
so maybe if we could just flick through this before we go on and start to pick days and who's gonna do what
from that
that's right investment in people limited
in conjunction with heart of england training and enterprise council
no it's this one isn't it
okay
now one of the things i think we need to do and i put it in there and it's pa it's part of my appraisal system is to do some work on actually UNK to training
for people
and do we say to everybody who's in the organization erm you are entitled to x amount of training each year
somebody was telling me that
thanks anne
somebody was telling me that erm some careers service it was steve i was talking to in the car the other night
some careers services er they have twenty days entitlement to training each year
UNK
he was saying they're entitled to twenty days training each year
i think until i actually get the records system up and running and do a check on how much our people are doing erm it's difficult to say what our if we have an entitlement what it is
and i think it's a fairly you know suck it and see
mm
stick your stick your finger in there see which way the wind UNK
is that twenty days pro UNK
well yes
i mean th this is the problem with part
well probably yeah
time staff
because erm
they need as much training
yeah
they need as much training to do the job effectively
if they only have ten days that's er not very much
mm there's also the fact that some people need
if you include
more training than others isn't it
yeah
yeah
i don't know whether i like this word entitlement anyway
oh i'll go and tell the boss he can
oh jayne
put it in my appraisal
i don't i mean it's sort of like you know everybody has a right to this
well i don't think anybody has a right to anything in particular
are we trying to get
i know i know i know and i appreciate that's it's a you know maybe a bit of a controversial view but i think UNK a bit of a
well
strong word
i perhaps in terms of if you think of it in terms of like the employer of the day well we've paid an external trainer to come along it's actually costing us quite a lot of money
there's all the additional costs in terms of people's salaries and travelling expenses
mm
and so on
i can understand that obviously we've got to be cautious about that sort of thing
but in terms of induction training to make sure someone can actually do their job
yes yeah
i think they're entitled to things like that
yes
yes
but maybe not UNK
cos i think we've got a responsibility to make sure that we give people
mm
the support and training they need
but that that's because it fits into what we want people to be able to achieve
i it means that we're making people
erm we're giving them the appropriate and suitable skills to be able to do their job
yeah
yeah
but i don't see that as being the same as an UNK
but that's what all training should be really isn't it
i mean all training should be towards the aims of achieving the business plans
i think it's the word i'm unhappy with sue
i'm not i'm not sa
UNK yeah
entitlement
ah it's not UNK you know it's not s something that i'm prepared to stick my neck out and say look you know i don't think that word ought to appear anywhere
it's just it's just a view that's all
mm
i think it's from the UNK point of view from our statement of purpose business plan yeah we do want people to achieve certain things and therefore we provide them with the training to be able to do that
but looking at it from the other point that's the you know the word entitlement comes from you know i think i'm entitled to twenty days' training but whether i need twenty days' training to be
yeah
able to do my job i might need thirty days' training
mm
it's just the word that's all
i thought you were gonna say it's derived from the latin
i think what you're really saying though is that it's probably a mistake to actually look at it in terms of a number of days
and i think that's a very good point because you're actually i the what you've actually said is you're entitled to training to enable you to do you job UNK
and i
do your job
yeah
think that's much more sensible approach
yeah
i suppose there's a certain amount of personal investment as well
you know i might want to do some training which is n doesn't UNK
mm
isn't necessary for me to do my job but because i have a personal interest
mm
and i think sent me on that course you know
yeah
but erm i it's i think it's the word entitlement the fact that it's anybody's right to have this
right
or to have
mm
that
i think it's a bit strong
a and to say twenty days when somebody might need much more than that somebody might need
mm
less because it's the type of job that they're doing
you know
mm
such as f er for example a word processor clerk or may not saying may not necessarily need so much training as
but doesn't it often work out though that the people who erm need more training often are the ones that have UNK going on training in the past
oh well that's up i think that's up to us because it fits in with in our aims and objectives
you say
yeah
you need this training to do your job
mm
yeah
s i mean t y you see what you could work more towards is almost a sort of an agreement wi with individuals isn't it
mm
mm
and although you know whether we use the word entitlement or not it could
mm
actually work both ways
cos i can understand if we didn't handle it carefully it could mean people would be more demanding and say i'm entitled to go on this training
mm
whereas if we're very careful about how we put the message across it could actually do the opposite in that people see that they're entitled to a certain basic level if you like to enable them to
yes
and every time they put themselves forward to go on to a UNK on a training course they've actually got to think through and maybe justify to their line manager
mm
erm this im this training day is gonna help me be better at my job in this and this respects
or your line managers
i think
can say to the individual this training course is gonna help you do your job better in this
because
and this respect
and then that can be reviewed afterwards and so on
mhm
mhm
so it could be helpful if it's
mm
handled properly
yeah
mm
and i think that it is it would be a mistake to look at in terms of a certain set
number of days
cos it will one thing that personally
and also what's available in the year
yeah
i mean it might be one year you want
yeah
thirty days training and then the next the next year ten
yeah
i find that people tend to not put themselves down for training courses
i don't know if this is the same in other places
but erm careers officers particularly put themselves down for visits to
mm
colleges and you know different places
and the visits seem to be more popular and often quite a few careers officers will put their names down for that
and i think in terms of UNK that if we had that you know if you're saying people have to justify why they're going i think they'd all more or less say the same
you know that often sort of getting some first hand information is the
mm
best thing to you know boost your you know how then how do you decide that
and a
one person needs it more than another
and UNK in a careers officer's view the other day that seeing as though they'd worked there twenty years ago they wanted to go back and see how it had changed
mm
mm
as a reason for going
yeah
i mean i think that in terms of visits
they could have thought up something better than that couldn't they
i think in terms of visits that er an entitlement might work with visits for careers
yeah
mm
officers but i think in terms of other kinds of training courses that they're slightly different
and more an individual basis
i mean technically we do have an entitlement to visits in that janet was reminding me the other day that we said when deborah was here that everybody was entitled to four visits a year
erm two to h e i didn't realize this two to
h e two to f e
and i think that was on the basis that we were UNK that everybody visited the local f e college or you know sort of yorkshire scarborough harrogate got their UNK and s and selby when whatever
but that we took the view that you know people were entitled to go to an h e institution and keep up to date with what was happening there every year
erm i mean i have some concerns like cynthia about the number of careers officers who suddenly appear when you say there's a visit to hull university and we've got people coming from all over the county and it's costing us a fortune
what
but you say something like the employer marketing to employers and certainly the employment officers we had quite a number on that course didn't we
it was mix like
erm it was a mix yeah it was a sort of erm a half and half
was it
mm
yeah
i know the first lot of bits i got in were all employment officers
and i was thinking hang on a minute where's
there were a number of careers officers
i though that it was really
yeah
was a bit
mainly particularly aimed at employment officers cos that was where the lack of confidence was coming from
yeah
in the original request
i think it was i think it was really
yeah
sue yeah
mm
had an interesting discussion at a staff meeting on wednesday though
some UNK constructive criticisms to help us UNK the college visits
they were
mhm
actually saying there should be less visits
mm
fine
and that m some colleges didn't need visiting every year
mm
and s some suggestions that i said i'd put forward to janet about UNK nominations and so on
oh god
can i just move on cos i think the first thing we're gonna pick up on this is this entitlement business again
so if we look at module objectives
which is sort of the first
page in
second page in keep going keep going
mm that's it
right
right i mean this tells you what the you've past it jayne
i can't find it either
the first page
front page
it's just before unit one
that's it
left hand page down
oh there
right i've got it
right
mm
i mean this talks about what this particular booklet does and why we're saying it would have been useful to have had this probably for our last meeting really
but erm it doesn't really matter
so this talks about putting together the comprehensive training and development policy and training plan that we need to get to get i p to demonstrate
and it talks about writing measurable objectives for all training events
something i don't think we particularly do
erm and introducing regular training and development planning throughout the organization
which is what we said was one of the key areas we need to do for i p
and then defining the business benefit for all training events
there is one there is another one on evaluation that i think erm i'll give to ray because he's doing that evaluation thing
he's doing that now
yes
and then get him to
mm
take us through that the next time we have a
mm
a group to get together
which i suggest is after that workshop
sometime if we can spare half a day
erm sometime in july erm is it may the UNK may the next one
i the one he's going on to that i can't go it's the third week in july
oh right so maybe plan the meet again after that
or
okay so the first bit then is actually the policy
and they talk about on page module three unit one point five
there
actually writing out to our members of staff and saying this is the policy that we will have
so you know saying we s fully support the policy that erm the line manager's gotta UNK share responsibility with the individual
taking UNK point all new staff get the induction programme
erm we're linking with the relevant staff association erm just some general er points about how we identify and evaluate erm and put together the training plan and settling once and for all about the national recognized qualification
saying what we'll do for that
and then over the page it actually then puts through gives us the quite nicely erm a document that we could use just to send out and do
if we wanted to pick this up and said this was an idea
now i've actually done this in the past
if you remember a couple of years ago
er three or four years ago for two or three years
i actually put out a quite a thick document that i think could be classed as a
mm
training and development policy
but we haven't done it for the past eighteen months
it was good
and it strikes me that this is er a starting point
for the beginning of that document almost
now what it actually says i think jayne in the erm no it doesn't
no er
we if you go to back to that first page under induction it says a training has a mandatory contact
yeah
content but it can be UNK extended to meet special needs
why what does that mean
well i think it basically means everybody does wha we've asked them to do which is the work UNK content of the first week
and after that if you've got special en
oh but if you've got special
entitlement
okay
sorry what page are you on now
well i've just i've just quickly gone through it and said the documents that are blue in this copy
black in
black in most of them
actually give you something that we if we decided to put out to our members of staff seems to actually cover the erm the needs of er the i p
can i just ask about the evaluation
are you saying that that's in this next workshop
yeah
is that the thing that's in the next workshop
yeah
so we don't really need to consider that at this stage
yeah
do we want a five minute break
yeah shall we have another coffee
good idea
yeah
that's what we'll d
to try and finish for half past twelve if we can
fine
cos we've got this thing after that
what time is that
well UNK coming about half eleven he said
so he'll be joining
oh is he
this and then we can pick up
erm
good cos i'd quite like to be off for
well half past three
i'm thinking we at the latest we can
great
brilliant
finish if possible before that
and they don't the t q m UNK be er i don't know what we're gonna do with that
right
so we've got the i think that to fulfil i p requirements we've gotta put out some it would be useful to put out something like a training and development policy
we'll have to look again it's interesting with the nationally recognized qualifications and records for life bit that we already do some of this
but it actually UNK i think saying that you know we'll give so much funding where they're wholly related to the business and then whatever
we've said in the past it's been fifty percent full stop
for those people who bothered to get in touch with me
mm
so you've had some haven't you for seven three six o or something
did you not get that did you not
oh right
no
anyway we're back we paid everything
from open university to word processing courses
over mine
oh well they don't do advanced degrees
no that's too advanced cynthia
but we don't
if you're that advanced you have to pay for yourself
mm
the support as well i'm thinking of something like mary's p g c e that UNK her sort of UNK for that
yeah
and she's doing other things through work that you know i'm i mean it in theory it's sort of giving some support to
well more than in theory i suppose
because she's using her work as evidence for getting through
yeah
yeah
and so on
i want this in for when me and jayne do this management training at er at grammar school
this year it's gonna be a two hundred percent funding cut
for me
a hundred percent funding for more than fifty percent of the day you know
so i mean i am suggesting that this appears to be a ready made useful document that forms part of a at the right time we put this out to back up the rest of the er the document
it maybe might be appropriate jayne to go to the next staff consultative committee as the next er
unless i can manage to be off sick again
yeah you managed that
yeah it was quite pleasant
thank you very much
it was quite a nice meeting actually
and you did discuss libraries
in that didn't you
very briefly they did in the end cos everybody else m jumped on the band wagon
yeah
so you shouldn't feel alone in that
but they'd had a pre meeting when they'd tried to drop it out
yeah
erm joyce i think had tried to drop out the things that were only relevant to individual officers out
mhm
and erm but then they'd all margaret and erm everybody had jumped on the UNK and said
so it'll come up at the next c s n t
yeah
deborah did actually say to me she thought that harrogate might feel i think it's to do with priorities for the
yeah
UNK isn't it
yeah
so i've just made a note the next c s n t i'll in the report back from the staff consultative committee there's two or three things we need
yeah
to pick up
we need to pick be clear about the erm allocation of time for UNK for the careers guidance agreements as well
mm
that was mentioned
the other day wasn't it
that's right
yeah about time you got skills to pay really isn't it
funny enough there's a course just coming downstairs about schools
how w how organizations can identify what schools will pay for
mm
mm
i've just put it to the boss to see if he's er
mm
thinks we ought to go
anyway so that's the first stage of that
i think we need to actually go back to erm or develop the stage one thing and increase what we've done
unit two talks about training objectives
and i know one of the things i picked up off the course was it
no
no
no
no
erm one of the things i picked up off the course is technically every training course that we have should be written in a way that identifies erm unit two point four i'm on to at the minute
nearly there
the erm actually says that every training course should have some sort of objectives and performance and standards and measurable objective that presumably we can then pick up in evaluation
what was
that's an area that i'm a bit unclear about
yeah
are we suppose
yeah
mm
are we supposed to be using the pre course questionnaires that i've seen a couple of times on all course
well eventually i think we'll have to get to that to that standard
erm er i mean er technically it should be something that's done centrally
and i'm trying to i've tried without success
and i'll probably have to look at a you know s cath and i have to sit down and say look for every course this needs to happen
there needs to be a
mm
pre course questionnaire goes out
whoever's running the course needs to fill in this particular form
mm
mm
for you to then add the rest of it
mm
and then after the course there's gotta be a post evaluation form fed out
you know the
mm
line manager does an evaluation on the day but then back at base we do an evaluation for the line manager
i've just made a note for the employer's thing jayne
yeah
to send out er a form to each member of staff so they go and talk to their line manager about it and share what's gone on
erm and try and get cath to do that for every course
mhm
that's
erm
that's what i was thinking because
mm
in terms of the evaluation that we already do it tends to be about the course itself
the sort of content
mm
as it with a view to actually altering the course next time
yes
erm
but
we don't actually do anything to i mean sometimes you get comments about the way that it's helped people
mm
but it's not exactly measurable even then
no
so
i mean technically i think what you're supposed to be with every course
erm is almost to go back so that i don't know who's on the course but UNK course for example
clare
clare erm would go back to the office you or UNK or joyce i mean preferably UNK would sit down with her and say right clare what have you learned
blah de blah de blah
in six months later or three months later would then diary date to say come back again
alright what have you done in the least three months that says that you've used the course benefited from the course that sort of thing
now i think we do that UNK
mm
one might one might say one might say rarely
that with
mm
all the courses that
yeah
that we do and the courses that everybody goes on i mean you'd you you'd just be spending all your time sort of
evaluating everybody
checking up on people and evaluating
well that's why i say i don't think it has to always be sue
no mm
me cynthia
i it's got to be you know somebody within the organization
admin assistants for employment staff
you know UNK for whatever the a d UNK and yourself and you share the depending on what the course is you would share the load out
if every course er made such an impression as that one the other day we'd be
well that's right i mean i think it's like a lot of things isn't it
it seems a n and this when i saw this i thought oh my god you know the i p gets bigger every time i look at something
mhm
different
erm but i suppose once it gets UNK in the system it's maybe not so bad
i mean were we talking about you know i suppose a quick five minutes feedback but then you know five minutes in three months time
cos the key thing with clare is she's don she's obviously gone back doing a lot but who's gonna follow it up in three months time to see
mhm
what's got UNK
yeah
in the system
yeah and yeah
it's a cultural thing isn't it really
getting people to change their approach and expect that with training expect to have to analyze what they what they thought they're going to get out of it why they should be doing it
mhm
that's right
and i don't think we do it so much with the erm careers service training but with the careers teachers often we've got them doing action plans and things
mhm
at the end
and you get the feeling that they'll sort of go back to school and college or wherever
mm
UNK actually sit down with them and go through it or review it
mm
at a later date
we also tend to write objectives more for those course
at least we did for the longer
yeah
courses didn't we
and presented those at the beginning
that's right
which you tend not to do so much for the shorter ones
which is what this is all about really trying
mhm
to say to people if you're coming on the course this is what you're going to get
talk to your manager about personally and you know corporate objectives and go from there
so i think that's something that we we're going to have to
and it may well be that we'll have to you know make sure everybody who's running a training course gets this particular
and tries to fit in
mm
with it
with regard to action plans one course i went on i think it was with theresa ad er it was adrian is it adrian name
the one with
i know who you mean yeah
UNK men
and er we all had to do an action plan at the end of the course and then three months later
mm
the action plan was actually sent to you in the post
mm
yeah
yeah
you know with the idea that you sort of should look at your action plan and say
yeah
mhm
well have i done this
what have i got to do
yeah
now sort of thing
i think that ha has to be in on if you're on a slightly longer course than that a day you
mhm
know
yeah
but i remember that happening
yes cos UNK was two days
it was it was really good
it made you think
it made you think didn't it
yeah
mm
mm
mm
so i mean i think we've got to go into this for all the course
erm and then er you know using this particular this particular module
perhaps we should decide that it's a high priority to actually do a proper job like this
and therefore be slightly less ambitious about the UNK range of courses we're going to run
we're more likely to achieve this
well
if we are slightly less ambitious
yeah
i think the only other way of doing it isn't it is to say we won't do it for every course initially
we'll give it a go and we'll
mm
you know some
mm
whoever's
you know whoever's running the next
yeah
yeah
the careers course
yeah
for the
yeah
erm software one which could possibly have
you know we'll ask liz or
yeah
we'll ask liz to do it and give it a go and then talk through it
and then or we'll say if we get a UNK in i don't see why we shouldn't ask graham
mm
you know it would be interesting to get graham when he does the next t q m thing to do it
so i agree it may well be a pain in the neck but it may not fall
no but it will be
obviously
obviously interpreted your er but i think we'll have to work towards that and i agree sue i think there's two ways either saying you know we don we do it for everything or
mm
which i think is a lot to answer for w we do one
mm
or two and have a look at it
and see how easy it is
i mean the idea of course is to try at some stage and run a trainer UNK course so that we expand the number of people who can who can do the training
which we've got
you know the fur the further we get away from
the trainers course the less inclined i feel to be able to do it
but
but su are you going on this one
i'm supposed to be
yes
i've not
oh jolly good UNK be the most up to date one
november you said
now i yeah that's right november
cos there was one in july and i UNK it would clash with holidays which it probably does so the november one i'm trying for
i'll ring them up and see if they've got any places left
well cath can do it for you
i've got the booklet with me actually
will you let me go again on the basis i made a cock up the first time round
mm
erm
when we but we already do quite a lot of this anyway
i mean the whole
yeah
thing about objectives
i mean you can't run a course
i always try to write objectives
no
but i think the things is isn't it to a certain extent with the i p it's UNK it
mm
and it i think the evidence
and having and having a procedure and a policy
and it's the evidence that a you've got to produce to say that i've got to demonstrate that the training that we do has objectives so that they can go back and say to cynthia you went on that course in whatever what were the objectives for it
mm
can you identify why you went
what were the objectives
what did you learn
how was it the next section goes on to analysis section three i think
unit three
yeah
mm
unit three
module three unit three
have you got it
sue
yeah
i'll speak to cath before she
yeah
goes and see if she
this goes on to measuring erm training needs analysis
now is you remember last time we said we wouldn't do this at the minute because we erm we've got erm a
it's appraisal
UNK
but it goes into picking it out of er i and i think maybe when we do decide to do another training needs analysis
after we've got we said we'd get the appraisal system up and running didn't we
yeah
mm
er we'd do that with that
so unit four talks about how to plan erm how to plan it which is where we're at the minute
really and the type of documentation that they're that they're on about
actually can i UNK back
yeah
to er the training objectives
what page
what's your page
er module three unit two dot thirteen
and there it's got about erm measurable objectives and it's saying ensure all managers can write measurable training objectives
organize a workshop or training session if necessary
so i'm wondering if we need to have that in the training programme
well i think
as a sort of starting point after
yeah
the workshop you know th next i p workshop you were saying about having a meeting then
if that should be in the form of
yeah
well what i'd like i think i'd like people to do is go away and read this and see if it makes any sense when you've actually sat and studied it
erm
that UNK you've c cynthia saying that reminds me of the other thing that came out in feedback
from appraisal and the training that you did the other week
mm
is training in target setting
mm
mm
which you could link in target setting and objective setting and so on
you could put together as a package couldn't you
mm
it's the measurable ones and training that i'm just not i don't know what that means
well i think it means in the sense if you look at the example they've given here
well an objective is always measurable
yeah
if you've if it's smart
if it's smart
yeah it should be
if you look at the on sheet unit two point seven
at the bottom and the measurable objective here is reducing the number of complaint UNK
by fifty percent within three months
yeah
that's the sort of thing i mean
i think it would be very difficult to do that sort of thing
for us to do
well it may be
but it may well be with something like UNK workshop that she ran with graham
well i didn't it was UNK workshop
i didn't do anything
well UNK workshop
that the measurable objective might be that people who are on that course d go out and do x
which is why you s when you set it up you've got to say well what are people going to do at the end of the workshop that demonstrates that they've learnt something from it
yeah but then how do you UNK if one
of your objectives is that staff should be more confident in erm in their employer work
in things like cold and how do you actually measure that
i mean the only way measure it i suppose is by talking to them
you won't have any sort of numerical
i wouldn't have thought that you'd have any numerical erm
but you could say that whereas at the minute because people are frightened the don don't go out and do it they now you know will go out and do it
yeah that's wha but i mean
but would you then
UNK not UNK or
mm
no
you're not gonna say
visit fifty firms after this
no
no
cos i mean you'd have your employer plan for the year anyway really
but there are some staff that we assess their UNK of employer visiting
okay only people in their part two but
yeah
you could actually measure an increasing competence
could you
if some i well you could i mean if you went out with someone and you thought they were pretty UNK talking to the employer again six months later and say oh they're a lot better
oh right if you were measuring them yeah
yeah
yeah
that's true yes
yeah
but then that would mean that you'd have to have assessed people in whatever it was they were going on the training course before
yeah
they went on so you could then actually
it's easy with part two people isn't it cos you're measuring them and assessing them anyway
but how many part two people were on that course
i you know if we took that course as an example and wh what would
i don't know
be the measurable objective
there was a part one person on the course
but not i don't whether there were any part two
yeah
you see a this is what i feel is
yes i don't disagree it may well be we want to talk to somebody like adrian
and say come in or graham even
mm
although we have to pay for hi we have to pay for adrian you see
i mean UNK two hundred pound a day
is he
and that's internal
he's quite good at it
but yeah i mean i might talk to adrian and say alright come and do something on measurable training objectives for us
but we do it
from
here
er
yeah
we do it in the aims and objectives don't we cynthia
you know the three year plan
we say these are these are the objectives
this is how we're gonna measure it
yeah
mm
but a lot of the training doesn't actually have a definite something that's sort of a number because it's actually getting people to do the work that they're already doing in a slightly better way or to feel more confident
mm
about it
yeah
yeah
erm
that's still measurable
it's not easy but measurable
h but how i mean how would you for example l like the interviewing further interviewing skills for the performance
how would you go about measuring that other than talking to people afterwards about how they feel about interviewing others
but there is no i there anything wrong with that as a way of measuring
time consuming
yeah
but you could say the measure would be have they gone away and done it
and their line manager
well they've got to do it anyway
yes
well no they don't well yes they do but
but if the line manager if in theory the line manager is taking feedback from them on immediately after the course and then going back to them after three months or six months
and actually talking to them reviewing it
then you are building up evidence
and maybe that it is in line with some of the central targets of their appraisal
that you're automatically gonna be reviewing at six monthly
mm
or ye at least yearly intervals anyway
mm
it's just gathering the evidence isn't it really that's difficult
so if it if it was
but then that has to be fed back to
yeah
if it was sort of part of the
but then information from appraisal is being fed back centrally anyway
if part of the appraisal was to look at what people had
been trained in over the you know the intervening period
mm
and to make sure that was recorded i mean how they felt about you know how that had helped them
then
mm
you know that could be a sort of central way of getting that back couldn't it if it can be that sort of you know comments about being more confident being able to get on with it
yeah
that sort of data
yeah cos if there's
cos you might not record that normally
no but if we sa
but if we made sure that was recorded somewhere
i don't know
i still think maybe we shouldn't be doing as much and we should d be doing a small amount better
well could well be
the problem is i think if you actually
m measure what we do sue i think the part my observation is that there's too few of us doing it
mm
therefore it falls on all of us all the time
which is why i say we run the trainer UNK course
mm
and then you can you know i mean technically we have expanded cos if you look in a couple of years there was me and you doing it wasn't there
mm
so we've now got you know five of us round the table and ray and karen and whatever
and i think what i want to do next is actually go through the list and just check who's gonna who's gonna run it
and then see how that comes from there
but i don't think we ought to do this for every course
no
initially
i think we i think you're right we probably do need to run a workshop
maybe with somebody in to just give us a go at it
and then introduce it
and i think by the time we get to
mm
this time next year yes i think we'll be doing it for everything
but
mm
we're gonna have to build up to it
wonder as well whether some of us should be putting as much energy into training teachers and perhaps we should stop doing that and just concentrate on our own staff
well i thought it was interesting the boss said yesterday at partnership board and i suspect he been saying with david that erm you know the gap in provision for careers education and guidance in north yorkshire is training teachers
mm
but i don't disagree with you
i think it i
oh no
said you know my views on that
mm
that the burden for this falls on us
yeah
almost totally
mhm
and i think that's wrong
that we don't get any l e a assistance to actually er to do it
yeah it's always a really isn't it
well the advisors do nothing do they
other than sort of do a bit of admin
mm
so i don't disagree with that statement
especially when you're trying your people
i mean
right
so point noted cynthia i think on that
but i'd like people to go away and read this
does it record body language
right so as i said point taken but i'd like people to go away and read it
yeah okay
and erm we'll follow that up
duly noted and warm UNK sense in your direction
so
that'll now appear in dictionary
as a as a UNK expression
what's that other word that UNK used
UNK
i was wondering will that appear
yeah
slightly too many UNK there i thought
so the next thing's the trainees analysis that we said we'd pick up on at a later date
erm but it does include on module three unit three point eight
the er the team UNK matrix
sorry can you say again
three
unit three unit mode module three
module three
unit three point eight
the team UNK matrix
it's upside down
there it is
oh it is yes
ways up
that we have to develop at some stage
i don't think i quite understand this UNK
well it's a training needs analysis jayne so that everybody you would say first of all you would look at the job of a careers officer and say right what competencies do they need to use that job
so you would then
oh right
you would then list the competencies down the
the top
the top
along the top
and then tick off what they've done in the gaps
oh i see
at that individuals gaps
so you would link all your employment officers in there do that and you would see form that whether all your team can er had induction for instance and who hasn't whether all your team have erm can do interviewing
er you know are competent UNK and if they're not whatever
mm
p i think that'd be that's really useful actually
mm
it's interesting that team briefing thing on there because that's come up a couple of times recently people have mentioned about erm team briefing as a sort of management system
have you come across that
i don't really i think i might have come across that before once when i was doing my placement on actually
but erm i know a student who was at b h s near she was saying how she'd had training for er delivering team UNK
you know it was something that b h s had you know
mm
gone into and everybody had been trained in this sort of team briefing system
and then at UNK the other night you know the was saying about team UNK too
i mean i mean we have office meetings you know
but i was thinking if we you know if i knew sort of what the sort of philosophy was behind it i might be able to incorporate that into the office meetings and say we were having team UNK
well anybody want to interpret
well my understanding of team UNK very quickly is to give you an example after c s m t what we should do is one of us should actually write down the key points from c s m t that you want to communicate to staff
that is then UNK out to line managers
who then deliver that team brief in the same way to all members of staff
so that all members of staff get key elements of communication at the same time
in the same way
mm
rather than as we probably do at the minute is you may go back and have a staff meeting
whereas sue may go back and brief bill to go and brief whereas jayne writes out to all her senior officers
and you do it six different ways
the idea is that there's one sheet of paper produced with the key information that's delivered
at the same time preferably to all people within the organization
the other different thing i think is that it's more of a one way communication
not exclusively
no
but it's very much passing information down
well actually
yeah
when i first heard about this it was at 's engines
mm
where i did my placement
and they had a system where erm they got this information and they it was that they i think there was something about the time element it had to happen at a certain time
mm
on a certain
mm
day
and this information was fed to them
er but then everybody in working at 's had the opportunity to feed back
mm
to the managing director who was available at a certain time
mm
so you know there was this
mm yeah
sort of system for feedback as well
mm
and questions
i came across i can't remember
where it was but i came across somewhere where there was a UNK and people at a g on a given sort of in a given week could all just go and use this UNK number and ring up and they'd hear a tape recording
you know
yeah
and have a UNK you know
be available for people to phone you
an oral newsletter
yeah something like that
i'd go back to this though UNK
the erm
sorry fine
no yeah
andy 's coming along to the next c s m t
right
to brief on the team briefing method they use in UNK
oh right
right
that's what he did on his management
i but isn't UNK one of those authorities when they're all in a pretty central place
or is it one where
they've got three offices
they've got three offices
mm
anyway
got our friend
be interesting to fi to look after their i p
well i sent you the report didn't i
mhm
well i sent you the initial report just to show you what
yes
what rubbish quality
but i've got the full report
right
which is better
this i can't help thinking with this UNK that we've talked about doing this UNK thing and we've perhaps
perhaps been a little bit UNK of it because
mm
we know it's a quite a job
yeah
but i almost wonder
er looking at this if it's actually a lot more central to what we ought to be doing
because i think if we did this and we actually thought through what competencies e members of staff needed to have
mm
it would help us UNK the training provision a little bit and really target the training provision
i think it could be really he it it'd be worthwhile actually investing some time
surely this been done before
well careers officers and possibly employment officers as well
well you do it to a certain extent you've got descriptions
no i don't mean go the UNK i mean
nationally
nationally
nationally
looking at n b UNK and what have you
it must be well it must be it must have been done and er UNK in involved in that isn't she
yeah
mm
yeah but it
i'm sure it must have been
yeah
and that's be a good thing
there was something coming through recently about that
there was something about the
i don't know i mean i think it depends how you d whether it is as formal as that or whether you almost do it by saying to er to half a dozen careers officers and half a dozen employment officers fill that you know fill that in
no
wouldn't it fit nicely into the appraisal system
mm
well that's the idea as well you see
mm
i mean you know if you're UNK when you're talking about training needs if you have something like that it's obviously much more formal isn't it
it helps you focus on exactly what
well i mean it's a bit like the you know the
objectives
did someone just say that
yeah
yeah well that's UNK based training isn't it
yeah
yeah
anyway that is something we'll have to develop i think for all levels of staff
erm some time or other
erm in the next six nine months
as i say we're being slightly UNK
no alright then
are you saying that we ought to do you're gonna take this
i think this fits into information systems actually
it also
well it should link into that UNK well no i was think that
and
it should fit into you know that big really
you know the thing that you're talking about that cath is doing
you know maybe th that record of training that actually needs to be analyzed to fit into this framework
mm
rather than actually just being purely information courses you did
oh yeah
oh yeah
yeah
erm something else i just thought
what did you just say
management information system
i said i think it fits into the manage
i was thinking about that project and erm but it is total is totally separate
i was being UNK
oh i know service specification it fits into as well
no it doesn't
staff need to be competent at le certain levels to
product standards
product delivery yes that's what it's called
no i'd already thought that
i'd already thought that through sue
i'd thought you know it's wider than that
it's much wider than that
the key to everything
do you think it fits into b s five seven five o
spelt
if you think it's so important how can we do it
well i'll go and lock myself in a hotel room next week
could you call in on my cousin just to let her know how i am
i don't disagree i mean i again it's a key it's a key element to actually UNK the training in that i mean if you're going to do it properly it all fits into you know
i think
the appraisal as i think jayne said the appraisal said i'm competent to do my job in these
hm
but i'm not in this
mhm
therefore part of the appraisal is setting the target to be competent in the job
i
and y you're quite right we actually don't have a list of things particularly i suspect for employment officers
i think we do for careers officers
and i think you do that in a different way
but i think for employment officers this would be really useful in the actual development
mm
if we set ourselves target
hang on we don't i don't think do we have a job specification for employment officers when we're recruiting
no you could be i think you could gather together that information fairly easily for all
mhm yeah
for all staff
and then you could get to use it in the
i think we ought i think we ought to ask alison if she's come across anything
mm
yeah
in her you know meetings you know the national
employment officers
i wonder if we could set ourselves a target that we actually include something like this in next year's business plan
but we say this is the these are the UNK levels of our staff
so that it would be a means of comparison of our organization with a competitor
to say have your staff got these competencies
that does sound like product specification
it does fit in with sort of specification and
yeah
product delivery doesn't it really
when you look at it like that
yeah
mm
it was just why i'm i mean wi the last meeting we had took me sort of three pages to write what we've got to do and each item that we've got to do is sort of a couple of sheets of a four
so it's sort of
lot of things that we need to do cos
but
you'd specify everything
but this is very broad headings isn't it
and for e for UNK for employment officers you would have induction you would have interviewing skills and you would say you know we would also we'd be able to see of the training records what interviewing courses
yeah
they've been on
erm you would have vacancy handling erm you would have
telephone
telephone answering the telephone
employer work
erm and i we can UNK i mean they're fairly broad headings
yeah
that you could then discuss in an appraisal what level and you would have the record system to actually say well you've been on you know the employment officers who went on that marketing course
mm
one would imagine you would you would now say they and have done some evidence to back it up that they're now competent
mm
so you say they're fully competent
yeah
so you'd say they're fully comp
mm
because they've done this course
mm
and they've done the employer awareness campaign and they have an understanding
mm
mm
mm
i think it's fairly broad headings that which is why i think it
yeah
it
it also gives you a guide to entitlement doesn't it because if you're saying you expecting
yeah
at this then they have a ti entitlement to training
mm
to get them to that level
mm
so it gives you helps with that
mm
as well
targets yes
you know you might say that
that's right
taking that on you might say with interviewing that you know you've got to do an interviewing course every three years
mm
so you would go back people like shirley who's probably did
mm
maybe done something
mm
four years ago right
mm
you're due another
mm
mm
another session
i don't think it would be
no i think that you're right
too difficult
mm
to do it and i think even looking at the competencies of careers officers you'd probably be able to pick out broad headings
mm
mm yeah
well you could go i mean you could
rather than rather than thirty six pages of that
yeah
cos i don't th i mean looking at this it's one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen competencies there
and that's for an engineering department's head of engineering so you i doubt whether a careers officers
shall i go and ask her
yeah go on then
e and also you know that course that they're doing for employment officers that b tech course
mm
yes well i say
i mean you'd probably you'd get you'd get some of the figures from there
the eight the eight competencies on there i would suggest
and presumably the competencies of careers officers are in the part two
i'm sorry is that what you said
i mean i was picking the competencies off that er display and marketing guidance UNK skills group work library and information work and equal opportunities
mm
you could pick those
like here there's you know just sort of induction and things that are common
yeah well everybody does the induction
yeah
yeah
mm
and if people change pace you know they need induction as well so
especially seeing as we're moving away from the with the with the four to six progression for careers officers we're moving away from continued assessment post part two
if we set something up like that it does give you an opportunity to revisit the competencies that were supposedly achieved during part one and part two
has the word revisit entered our vocabulary now
i'd like to
we do not want it in the dictionary
yeah but it does rather sort of fit the bill doesn't it
it's useful
mm
i mean let's not reject it if it's useful
no
just a little point
that's it
well i was hoping it'd be interesting i mean i thought this was one of the key things at the training day i went to and i picked
yeah
it up again here so i didn't mi wish to discuss it like this so as i said it's gonna be twelve months' time
but erm
well you wanted to do it anyway didn't you
yes i it's in it's in the list i did
well it may not be providing we can actually pull out some still
this isn't hard i don't think this would be hard will it
it's easy
just doing it
i don't think it will be hard it's finding the time to do it properly
but it may be that what we do is as you say that we does that guidance thing give general broad headings
that one
erm i don't know
i mean they certainly UNK the c the number of competencies and made them stopped du hopefully they don't UNK e one another as much as they did
mm
so it's been tightened up a bit
but i mean are there even broader headings on that
i don't think
so what's a
oh well there's the a b and c isn't there which is
mm
is to do with and d
is there an e
i think it's sort of employer education sort of guidance and more sort of UNK skills it's those sorts of UNK i think
mm
mm
i've actually done one of these
i worked for last summer and they did this there and total quality management meetings
mm
and they used to work through whatever you'd done whether you'd done word processing that sort of thing
so and it worked there it was very good
mhm
yeah
mm
but it wasn't
so you did it from what basis from as a worker
yeah as a worker
you filled you own in
no they came round
my manager came round and she just said erm have you done word processing
have you answered the phone
have you erm filed and that sort of thing
she just ticked it
w and then at a later date she would er UNK it and see what else you'd done
and i was only there for four months and
did they actually check on the level of competence
yes she yeah she
so did she and w when she said have you answered the phone did she actually sit and listen to you answer the phone
yeah and she'd phone you up and see how you answered it and that sort of thing
mm
see that's the other thing we were talking about monitor i monitoring the standards and targets
actually doing that ourselves
you do that all the time but it's remembering to actually
we had a lot of discussion about that didn't we
record it
yeah
yeah
yeah
that you'd done it
a few things
mm
erm that'll
yeah
that on
erm stand this is
yeah standards for guidance workers
the key unit
work with others manage
and then there's this one as well
an overview of some of the tasks
oh i had a copy of that
do you think it would come i you know that project that erm project bid that we put in for
yeah
well that's it isn't it
yeah that's it then
UNK the money the bid that we put in
oh right yeah
the bid that we put in for erm looking at i mean wouldn't it wouldn't it come into that to a certain extent
and not that you think you we don't
i think they've been told they can't have the money
i think they told they didn't have any money for it
so nobody's got any
but they've then gone back and
i asked derek yesterday
at the
i wondered if you might ask him
there's very little in there about UNK which is one of the problems with it
yeah right
yeah
oh well that looks as though we've got the careers officer one
as a kick off point for that don't we
it does mention UNK
what's the left hand column
erm it's careers officers careers teachers careers UNK er depending on where you are
like this is for an l e a careers service this is secondary education higher education etcetera
oh
oh they're the careers officer ones
yeah
mm
mm
and that be more complex than
yes
other staff wouldn't it
wouldn't be too difficult would it
well cos you can take a lot from a job description anyway and er job spec
could you
it's alright we're just gonna
just stick a note yeah i was gonna say photocopy them
should i go down and get
well if you get one of each for us all and one for ray of that page
yeah
hang on a minute
is there anything in there that UNK the
no i can't well the only thing that i can't i can't you kn you know the core objectives for your course
yeah
i'm trying to UNK you've put me on the spot now
erm
actually it's got employment officers in as well
oh it's got employment officer
yeah and information officer
i can't remember what the headings are
it doesn't seem to say anything
i was just thinking if it was on a page you could have got that
UNK the same time as these and then you know we would have all had one for reference
but i've seen it and sort of
i mean i favour the using that because of the s i mean i like the idea of UNK the competencies
i think it's good
we could we could probably summarize that
the this is that everybody i mean everybody sort o you learn them don't them on UNK year
i mean by the time you get to a two years
it's excuse me can't we make up our own language
do we have to use
do you have to use somebody else's
i mean surely there are people in the careers UNK
no competencies are UNK
what should we say instead of UNK
no i
it sort of keeps a sort of continuity in it and i mean i do think when we get to the end of the UNK year you've sort of really learnt all the areas
you know
well those of us who did our UNK year sort of over ten years ago
took you ten years
yeah
i'm still on my i'm still on
if you can get one for all of us plus ray
that's one two three four
no just get one for me
cos me and jayne share the i'll give that to ray when he comes
yeah fine
well that's well that's been useful actually
yeah
cos we've done that solved that now
mm
and we've got to take
and we haven't got any for clerks or managers we haven't done
no
managers well
somebody needs to
leave you out of it
it's then we've got of course and once we've got it we've gotta take on board the implications in relation to what the training we provide is in relation
yeah
to the competencies
are we actually training people to be competent
yeah
or are we training to do other things
yeah well that's what i say you've all gotta go back to business plan haven't you and
yeah that's right
the objectives of the organization and i mean i l i think a lot of the things we've got up actual do relate back to everything that we do
erm so i'm not unhappy and about competence as well
so i'm not unhappy about the things we've picked up
where i think you are where you get into problems with that are things like UNK training negotiating well UNK training is that a competence based thing or not
well it probably is isn't it
mm
UNK skill
mm
yeah
yeah
mm
if you had UNK skill down for everybody cos we all need to have that
yeah
then anything like that would come under that wouldn't it
sort of general
negotiation
personal development
negotiation skills UNK and sort of thing
so if i get the UNK to actually pick out those for individuals on this check list we'd have it wouldn't we
well which ones
the ones that we've just
yeah
well i felt that careers the careers officer one it would be better to use the erm the UNK year competencies
because that one on there had counselling and group counselling and er things like that on which aren't really things we're familiar with
you know phrases or terminology that we're familiar with
no but i think that the other stuff gives you
well all right then what i'll do i'll get them to do that anyway
as a starter for ten
mm
and then we can alter it
but couldn't you do one that takes the competencies from the UNK work book and puts that down
no i can't
you know they're just changing don't you
well isn't that book
that this book tells you what the new ones are
yeah
we just can't
can't find at the moment
we've got so many core objectives we've got like a one and it's something like
yeah
there's fewer than there were before
is there
it used to be about thirty six didn't it
ah it was ridiculous
yeah
core
okay can we move on please
yes
erm the next stage is going on to unit four which is the actual training plan which i think is where we're at today
erm which on module three unit four point four at the bottom left
where
that's it
oh
which talks about de UNK development plans team development plans personal development plans and signed off at each
level within the organization
level organization
erm
this is the
she was good yesterday
was she
yeah she actually said something
first time she's ever said anything at a partnership board meeting
which was which was done to saying yes i agree i think it's brilliant
and she's written it
she'd written well she didn't been consulted
i mean there's a way an you know there's a consulting and consulting isn't there really
mm
did you go and see her
yeah
bought me lunch in the garden centre
she oh that is that one where she expected you a week early
she actually didn't spot the fact that it didn't have the addresses on the er
and she's a quarter of an hour late
no because hers did have an address on
oh right
anyway so the organization training plan
erm which i suppose our main focus would be introducing i p wouldn't it
erm and then what we're actually going to invest in it
well i think ours would be broad i p and t q m i think i mean
and we would be actually investing ten thousand plus this year
god
i wasn't expecting benefits
well i think that's the difficulty
i think because this is all expected benefit in cost
yeah
mm
and i'm not sure that we can identify that
you can you know you can't do it
no
but you can say because people are working more effectively therefore they're more cost effective
yes
because if somebody's been on an employer marketing course and the feel happy about it they're more likely to do mor employer visits in one day
i'm not sure how that fits in with UNK like you know but you know what i mean
expenditure rather than income isn't it
whereas if you were a commercial organization where let's say you were selling a product then you'd expect to see a cost benefit in actual returns
whereas our only cost benefit is more better value for money
right
in terms of salaries
yeah
expenditure and so on
yeah i mean if y if you were a double glazing sales person and what were the figures that they ex they think that about one in ten
oh yeah
they think that about one in from one in ten you get something
so therefore if an em an employment officer visited twenty employers in a day instead of ten er they might have two contracts instead of one
mm
but because we're not that sort of organization
mm
okay
so this one actually goes through from the organization to the team which deborah will like through to the individual
so that from the what su what sue might happen
thinking about it you're saying the appraisal thing don't actually link in with the tree the team
from the targets from the appraisal
yes
you wouldn't actually get the training
yeah
by completing one of these you probably would
it would link the two things together
yeah
yeah
mm
that yeah
the other thing is with the UNK f if you w if you were looking at a UNK chart with a certain member of staff and identifying that they were incompetent
do you want some more
i don't want any more
i think that's the first cup i've had this morning
but they were less than competent in certain areas
then that's more likely to be a target
cos there are things they can do themselves
i'm not sure i still think it would come out in the section about training needs rather than necessarily
yeah
it's interesting trying to get
yeah there's one from UNK
okay
mm
i should think people other people would be much more feel much more competent as well
you know you were saying after that training day admin assistants do have this
yeah
yes
to link in with the target
it's more specific isn't it
yes it would
i would find that very helpful
right so on top of all this we've actually got as UNK mentioned quite a few times we've actually got to keep the damn thing UNK well after introducing all this
and i think continue to deliver erm the training erm so far along
mm
now it's quite interesting w i went to erm an i p meeting with on the course that you were sick
mm
and then jayne filled in the first day
that i missed yes
erm lincolnshire
mm
were there
and they've been doing it eighteen months longer than us
didn't seem to
be any farther along
didn't seem to be any farther along
were naive enough to think they could get through it without having an appraisal system which i could not believe
could not believe he expected to get it through without having a formal appraisal system
and had been UNK when they'd had a sort of a mock assessment
dog
and looking at this i think obviously if this is the level they're going to assess at
mm
it's fairly ha fairly high standard isn't it
yeah
a fairly high level and we've got a bit to go ourselves i think
mm
erm but this seems to be
when are we looking at
a n a UNK guide for
yeah
for actually moving
which is why really at that th for the development funding they did the didn't particularly want i p supporting because it is so structured and a lot of it is on a plate in a sense
i mean it's all very that it's there it's actually putting in place
but a lot of the thinking through has already been done hasn't it really
when have we said we're likely to have
well i said christmas
yeah
erm with a view to saying really providing we've got it in by the first of april next year
yeah
erm i won't be too unhappy but the idea will be of course not t not to go in if you're not gonna get it
mm
mm
cos i think i think that'll be a real UNK and plus it'll
cost us about three grand
yeah
but they do sort of come in and give you some idea don't they
yes they'll do a pre assessment for you and cath who's our UNK come in and say yes no
is she our new person now
yeah
is she oh yeah
and i said to her i've seen her in july sometime or june or something like that
to actually erm i'd gather the evidence of how far down the line we are for her saying that would that would be a six monthly check
with six months to go to say well we've got this evidence
erm yeah twelfth of july
and i said i'd try and put some evidence together of exactly what we've got
mm
by then
the assessment is really th them talking to the staff isn't it
well that's the problem but i think a lot of this will be the evidence we'll need to show what we're doing
there is there's a lot of in that at erm cos erm
you know it was i wasn't really pleased about but it was a good evening
andy was there who's the i p one of the i p people and he was saying exactly what it was but it was much greater talking to people than paperwork
yes
on the assessment
yeah
is it seventy five twenty five
something like that
but they're going to say if they're talking to liz presumably the trainer as well as a person you know what
as well as a person
as an employee
you know are you doing objectives and showing your objectives
yeah
when you're doing courses
mm
as well as saying to people when you were on the course could you clearly state what the objectives
UNK we have known them through the period their firm through the period of time quite a number of years and we can UNK er UNK to their integrity
and you are an independent body
that's right yes
i'm sure you'll UNK without me saying any further
yes
so john
thanks very much
over to you
thank you
erm right well we've got the lights down we'll perhaps er use some of the slides er later but er if i can just introduce myself by saying that some of you will already know chris this is the er nature of our business
er we are involved er quite heavily in local authority and teachers generally through unions and through other connections so erm some of you will have seen us advertised anyway
er there's the general insurance side which is based in UNK and you may have had to contact them on previous occasions for quotations for motor and er house insurance that sort of thing
now on erm the er insurance er the pensions and life side then that's my particular area and obviously i'm based in birmingham for that although i actually live in derby
so er i b basically go to the office one day a week that's my admin day and the rest i tend to work within this area
er i suppose erm er the most of the people i've seen in the last ten years have been people either approaching retirement planning for retirement or actually at the point of retirement and er we've obviously looked at this course over a number of years and we try to sort of UNK it down to the basics of things that we think are important er and that we think will be useful to you
erm so i'll start by looking at some of the er factors
now in this first session i really want to look at the way that er financial planning will affect you once you once you retire it may be that's the sort of area you've not looked at in detail
well i find nowadays people are much better at planning their retirement than they used to be maybe because people are more aware of the fact th they won't necessarily be teaching till sixty or that sort of erm age
and er certainly in teaching there's been quite a big change over the last ten years in the way that people perceive retirement
i can say that you know lots of heads and UNK ten years ago would have said to me well what is a pen i mean what pension do i get
do i get one from the state or is it going to be yes where does it come from
and people have actually moved quite a long way in the direction of actually working out their own finances
and erm i think that er will be proved this morning by the amount of knowledge that you er have between you
so er if i can just have the lights off at this stage please
lights off
thank you
focus it in for you
right
perhaps by er the blinds as well that might help a bit
that one's possible at the front
right thank you
i think it's the other one
no it's the other one
it's all going so UNK this morning isn't it
give it a chance give it a chance
right thanks a lot
so er you've all UNK well so far
so er as you can see there is a UNK logo on there and that actually refers to the fact that we are regulated under UNK er rules that's the financial UNK and managers regulatory authority
now don't worry too much about that because er UNK itself is a fairly new organization and er it makes mistakes
as you probably read in the quality press UNK are always being taken to task for er not spotting investment groups that have gone too far er and er when you get the collapse of something like the UNK group erm which you'll be aware of perhaps was the er sort of boxing and UNK type route that was taken by the man in the UNK bow
and er i think somebody said to me beware of the man who UNK a UNK bow during the day
er this was
a boxing UNK who UNK you should only wear them for er n evenings obviously
so er that s er that firm collapsed and people lost money and er that's why UNK is there er to try and protect the investor
but er i think a golden rule must be when you're looking at financial er matters is er make sure you know who you're dealing with
because if you want to if you want to beat the system you can of course
i mean er UNK can do its regulatory bit the same as the police can regulate or the or the government can regulate but only within certain er parameters and if somebody really wants to UNK then they will UNK anyway and er we've go we're in a very sophisticated position where the directors of b c i were able to move money from one continent to another and it meant er it looked as if you'd actually got money in three separate areas but in fact there was only one lot and it was being moved rapidly
erm but that sort of thing can always go on so er i mean as far as you're concerned are a major UNK are er obviously a reasonable choice in that we are accountable
any major UNK must be in the u k because er they are exposed to the public view if you like and if there are any errors or UNK then they're likely to come up very quickly
so erm a golden er rule must be avoid small operators
that type of thing
they may be absolutely fine and if you're going there for a number of years you've probably got no er problem with them but of course the smaller the organization the simpler is it is for other erm factors to creep in
er now on another topic i will go back to the idea of regulation later you'll see that life expectancy is obviously important and er when you're looking at retirement i mean it's always been described as the longest holiday of your life and it certainly is that and life expectancy is rising all the time these figures have actually been UNK
so you can actually er say that someone at sixty five will live slightly longer than the figures on the on the board here
these are provided by the actuarial statistics er section of the life office and they're actually very accurate
erm but erm you'll notice first of all that there is a difference between male and female UNK
erm we won't go into a discussion about that this morning but there are lots of reasons why females live longer on average than males
can you narrow it down to various UNK on the er UNK
oh absolutely yes
cos i've heard one
well most yes it may have altered yes
i mean actuarial erm a lot of it is er not open to public view of course life offices have their own views of it
and if you went to general accident and looked at their actuarial tables they might be slightly different to other groups but in that sense
you're right
there are risk factors involved
for erm head teachers if you retire at sixty you can have fourteen sixty five you've got one
right yes
that's er for
head teachers yeah
i remember a i remember er an a h t came out with some figures five years ago which may have prompted some early UNK then
er
doesn't seem you've got too long once you've finished
er and i mean er a lot of that's perhaps the release of stress so that you know you've been under pressure for a long time and then you take that away and it may actually be detrimental to but er it doesn't obviously the figures are a little bit odd
if you if you look at the figures er for that male age fifty and add on the twenty three that's seventy three
but if you look at the sixty five and add on the twelve it's er seventy seven and of course if you go on to the actuarial figures actually get better as you get older in terms of actual UNK
so that if you've been really rough and you're ninety nine you can look at the figures and you've still got nearly four years left
but don't forget these are these are actuarial UNK and er we you know the thing about beating the system this is often down to your input as well
you know whether you're relaxed whether you're from a long lived family so on and so forth
i am not here to discuss that now but i mean it's just to make sure that you know that things aren't planned for five years or ten years but possibly for a lot longer than that
cos the we er did get people contacting the office to say i've got a lump sum i'd like to put it somewhere for a couple of years and er we always wondered why they're thinking of a couple of years
are they going to spend it suddenly in er two years time or are they expecting not to be around in two years time
so i mean think about it as long term planning and certainly for those under er sixty the long term becomes extremely long term because er you know you're looking at perhaps a third of your life er which is er still to be accounted for
er so these er are er the state pension arrangements and you've had a speaker on state pensions anyway
i think these have got to be slightly updated with a new er with the new rates that have come through cos that was right on six four ninety two
we haven't updated the slide yet
but the main thing is i it starts at sixty for women sixty five for men and of course that's erm important when you come to erm planning because er if you've got er a male retiring at say fifty eight he's actually got seven years to go before he draws state pension
and for a female it may be possible that she's not going to get a full pension anyway she may have er had time out not paid contributions right the way through etcetera
so a lot of the target planning i suppose that we've come across is people saying well when i retire i shall actually go down to half salary at best that's assuming th that you've actually made half about half salary on your pension being forty UNK or whatever
you've still got a fair gap to make up between that and your salary
and er with that in mind it's possible that people do want to top up their income because the one thing i will stress to you is that you don't want to have to start having to back UNK er when you retire
you don't want to have things erm at a lesser level than you er started with
so when you're planning your retirement make sure that you give yourself a reasonable standard of living in terms of income
er it's no good saying you'll turn down the central heating and you'll only take one holiday instead of two that's not really the purpose of retirement and i think you've got to be objective about what you're doing with this
er you'll find that we do have actually have a calculator which we can send out with a retirement pack and that actually gives you an UNK to actually remind you about the things that you might forget erm with regard to erm things like er holidays er erm say medical expenses er fuel expenses erm club fees t v licence all those things
if you've not done that exercise yet it's quite a useful one to find out what figures you come up with
and er that will give you an objective starting point for what you actually need
cos what you actually need isn't just your monthly figure is it
it is the er sort of er five hundred pounds that goes out your bank account on direct UNK it's all the other UNK during the year and even er you know gifts for children pets in the case of some people if you've got er large dogs or whatever then you know there's UNK bills food etcetera that you know is probably UNK at the moment but not when you retire
so try and do that as UNK as you can and don't forget if you've got a partner do it together because we i do get these won these reply slips back and you can often tell who's filled it in
especially if under clothing it's got fifty quid you can assume it's the chap
er who's probably thinking well i do need some new boots for the garden but er
but er if you put it in together you come up with a more realistic erm assessment
these things alter UNK you know i mean it's incredible that the sort of and yet that they both work
if you get somebody putting six hundred pounds for holidays i'll be thinking mhm you know they're not going to be able to do a lot on six hundred pounds a year but when i actually get to talk to them i find they've got a caravan and a friend who's got a site in north er in north yorkshire
and actually that's quite a good budget to do sort of er four or five weeks er you know UNK a year
and yet somebody else might have three or four thousand down and that's because they're UNK off to er foreign UNK a few times a year
so it's all down to individuals and that's why it's important for you to do your own budgeting exercise
and of course if you're finding that there's a shortfall there then you've got to try and look at your you know assets your lump sum etcetera as a way of erm er trying to cover that shortfall
erm right
so on the tax area first of all you've got to consider whether you're a non UNK a basic rate UNK or a high rate UNK
well as you know er to be a basic rate UNK you're paying twenty five pence in the pound apart from the er the new rate you know the first two thousand five hundred you get at twenty percent which came in at the last budget
higher rate well you don't start to pay that until you've exceeded the twenty three thousand seven hundred plus your personal allowance so y you your basic rate of tax goes to twenty three seven hundred then you can add on your basic allowance and for most people if they're earning er a single person twenty seven and a half and married person twenty eight and a half above that you're paying higher rate tax
and er of course in retirement it's unlikely that anybody will be paying higher rate tax unless you've been very lucky on your pension provision
er but erm the fact is i if you're a non UNK obviously we've got to take a different view of the way you that you might invest money
that's not unusual because i quite often find that one UNK not working and therefore they're not using up their tax allowance so at retirement or before i can move money into their name and there are good reasons for doing that
erm you notice here that the amount is didn't alter in the last budget
erm so erm what i'll do is just indicate the amounts as they stand
now obviously this is three four five and that's UNK that's available to each person so if it's a married couple they'll each get that amount then there's a married UNK allowance which is worth seventeen twenty and that can be moved either to the male or the female or split er under the regulations as they stand
obviously normally the high rate the higher wage UNK would have that er erm er allowance
so that would make erm er five one six five as a married man's or a married UNK allowance as it's now called plus the three four five
so actually it's quite generous in terms of what you can earn before you actually pay tax
don't forget you don't pay any tax till you get above that level
you'll notice at sixty five that the allowances go up and the er by getting to sixty five you're UNK by a larger personal allowance and a larger married UNK allowance but that starts to be UNK at fourteen thousand two hundred
er which used to be a problem up until about three or four years ago when independent taxation came in nineteen ninety
now independent taxation means that th that you've both got an allowance of fourteen thousand two hundred before age allowance is UNK but for teachers who're you know retired early er some years ago and they perhaps got a pension for themselves a pension for their wife then obviously when they got to sixty five quite ou because it was calculated as a as er one total it actually UNK their allowance quickly
now by some UNK on this you can often get the income to sort of fit both sides if you like you know by putting income to each side you can avoid losing your age allowance
now once you get to fourteen thousand two hundred your age allowance is UNK
one pound for every two over the limit and you're UNK back to this level of allowance
er but it's worth er you know UNK a little bit on that if you can
erm if i could just stop there for a couple of minutes to er make a point about er independent taxation
erm if we've got erm er a couple say age sixty and they've got their personal allowances er as usual er let's assume that the UNK retired and he's getting an income of five thousand two hundred let's just suppose
so we know that his er his five one six five allowance is fully used in other words his tax allowance is fully used
er in fact erm it could be perhaps plus some investment income as well let's say that his wife though er she he's go he's got the erm five one six five allowance so he's going to pay tax on whatever else he UNK in other words
if say the female has got an income of only er two thousand a year she's got er an UNK allowance of fourteen forty five in other words erm that er three four five allowance isn't being used now i mean if we put ten thousand into his name erm we would er suffer tax at erm say twenty five percent on most of it
er so er let's say that the ten percent rate applies er mind you ten percent is a long way from where we are now but it makes the figures easy to look at so er let's say that he's getting ten percent gross on his return on a building society he'd actually get seven and a half percent net er so on his ten thousand he's going to earn seven fifty
okay
so that's his ten thousand investment income well that's fine you know no problem and there is a marginal rate here which you could in fact UNK a bit of tax on twenty percent
but what happens if he gives it to his wife
well er firstly he can even if it's his money give it to his wife as his partner and she could then invest the money and because she's not paying any tax er she could get a ten percent return so she could actually get a thousand pounds on that ten thousand and that would be payable gross
so immediately they've made two hundred and fifty pounds a year er bonus by having the wife's er name on the account
now the way that er gross accounts work is erm er fairly straightforward
you've got a form r eighty five which is available for bank and building society investors and if you've got er a gross account then er you have to agree with the revenue that you are not going to be a UNK in the year that you take out the er r eighty five
it's no good if you think you might drop into tax later
avoid doing it because the revenue are checking one in twenty cases and if you've got a partner who's likely to pay not to pay tax that's fine if they are likely to roll over into tax then don't use an r eighty five
the simple way there as you've probably been told by your tax officer here is just to UNK it at the end of the tax year
you know if you've got any un a balance that you can UNK then do it then
er there are other ways of getting gross income obviously
and er one of the ways you can use is er national savings income bonds er which are er okay but they're the trouble is they're at a variable rate so at the moment they're paying seven percent so that's on national savings income bonds so that person would get seven hundred a year at the moment gross and of course er you don't need to t to fill in an r eighty five for that type of investment because it's not a bank or building society account
erm the problem is that people who were in this account two years ago were earning thirteen and a half percent well say eighteen months ago
and of course with the reduction in the erm er interest rates then those have come down quite UNK
so it's a bit frightening when you think a pensioner's money may have been in that account at thirteen fifty on a on ten thousand invested and now they're down to seven hundred
if that was paying some important bills they'd be struggling
and er i can remember several cases years ag you know so going back two or three years where people were debating with me why didn't i put more into national savings
cos i was using that issue at that time but we always make the UNK that if things change you may have to alter your mind about where your money's placed
because obviously it's linked to u k interest rates and therefore you suffer whatever goes on there
it's not all negative of course i mean the fact is we've got low underlying inflation at the moment and that means that i a seven percent return and if the inflation UNK less than three you're actually it's really reasonably profitable
but of course UNK one thing and UNK another thing and i think the problem with most er forms of income type investment is that we spend it it's not a problem it's just it just happens
but when you spend it when you're spending your income you're not UNK your capital so this person in five years time although they've had their income which may vary between seven and thirteen percent their ten thousand is still ten thousand pounds and obviously that would have UNK in real terms against inflation which is the other problem
so the point i'm trying to make is that you can't rely on one product to do the whole job
th f for a tax plan that's what i'm on at the moment and that's a useful er device
erm so think about if you've got a non working partner or somebody on a low income to spread the money er so that you has anybody already done this er you know prior to retirement
yes er perhaps one or two
yes
i mean i er i it's more well known than it used to be
but where it isn't well known is the people who ought to know and that's the pensioners you know th perhaps er your er parents people er older than yourselves who are drawing state pension and er the advertising seems to have gone UNK
cos there's millions and millions of pounds that the revenue have got rushing about which should have been UNK to er investors
er and of course it's people like erm my mother and father who never look at er things like that unless i actually point it out they won't actually know that they're allowed to UNK tax
you know particularly you know the female may have only a state pension you know the part state pension nothing else coming in and a lot of these accounts are still net not gross so the revenue have got money to give away and they're quite happy to do that UNK providing that people tap them on the shoulder
so if you've got any elderly er relatives or people who want or who you think may the trouble is with relatives they always think you're UNK this is a UNK
you ask about money and wonder why
erm but erm that's a very important point and er just remember that you have actually given the money to the other partner technically in terms of tax anyway and er that er can have an affect on things
because i gave my wife some money obviously because i pay tax she doesn't she's at home with the children she didn't seem to object funnily enough you know i said i'll move this money over to you
and then
you know you can invest this and we'll have a building society account we'll have a gross account
yeah fine
so anyway er i mean being a keen UNK i borrowed a UNK last year you know a big v twin beautiful bike i went up into derbyshire and had a you know ride on it and thought well that's not bad see i've always had british UNK and i think i might g i might get one of those so i came back in the house put the UNK down and said hey that UNK not bad i could get a decent one for about two thousand you know about nineteen eighty you know nice le UNK two
and she said oh yeah where are you getting the money from
i said well you know out of the out of the bradford and UNK
she says that's my account
i said but yeah i know i gave you the money for tax purposes
she says well she says that garage is in a hell of a mess you know and that UNK standing there doing nothing
so erm have a problem trying to get it back
that's right yeah so i eventually managed it but it took some negotiating
do you have to give the capital sum to create this income or is there ways of income from a set sum of money to the other person
no
no er not really
the revenue want it paid into an account in your name or a joint account
they
yes but can that just be the income or has it to be the whole capital
er no the whole the whole capital should be held by you and paid to you or your or i in a case of a joint er couple because er once it's paid out it would become the tax it would become the t the taxable interest of whoever received it
so really erm er you'd have to be a bit careful if you were doing that and er i think the revenue would be pretty UNK about you holding money and paying it to a third party
were you thinking about a child who could own er
no i just i just question
you know i the splitting of income
mhm
between spouse two UNK erm
it doesn't matter
to transfer the lump sum so that income goes to the one with the
no not really not between not between a married couple no
no
but i mean obviously er the er
or can you just put the income across
yes
so you know four thousand
you can
you can but i'd still advise it goes to a joint account rather than to er another person's account
because i think the er the you know the revenue would think it was a bit odd that somebody else owned the money and you paid the income to another party
right that's what i'm asking
how do what's the method with it
do you have a joint account for the for the
yes
lump sum interest UNK goes to the joint account
right
and is then split between the two
yes well er if it's a joint account and the UNK i if it's a joint account and the UNK generated from that account then er it will be er treated as one going to the UNK er you know half of it going to the UNK half of it going to the non UNK
if it's the non UNK owns the account in that case then she can pay the whole of that thousand pounds into a joint account for them both and they can both use the income the revenue aren't going to b bother about where the money's gone providing that it's received by the person who owns the investment
i think that that's the key to it
mhm
that so somewhere in i in between you've got to be receiving the income that you generate
otherwise passing it on to a third party but you're not in the case of a married couple
obviously the point is that y it's still within the er UNK of the er couple itself
if that's
but if you set it up jointly you can't direct all the gross income if that's what you're thinking you can't say well i'll have all that income gross cos my wife's got an UNK allowance you've got to split it down the middle in the case of a joint account
so generally to make it to make it straightforward i tend to er differentiate so that i've got some in the ta the non UNK name up to the limit and then a joint account perhaps which will be UNK by both of them er for instant access that type of thing
er i'll perhaps go back to that later cos it does come into the way that money splits
when you say joint account do you mean building society
yes
er a building society or bank account yes
joint account
well er a building society i don't know whether people realize but there are limits to the amount of protection you get on large sums of money
yes
yes
i will actually l er go into that
i'll cover it now
thank you for mentioning it
say if you've got thirty thousand in you'll only get protection on
twenty
it's the first twenty
yes under the building society protection act if the society fails you're protected up to twenty thousand and you'll get eighteen thousand back there's a ninety percent protection provided they're members of the building society association which all are er virtually even down to things like the clay cross and the UNK railway they're all members of the building society association so they're all covered
er but if you have a joint account you're actually covered erm to forty thousand because i it would be seen as two separate accounts so that each hold twenty
er so that's okay to an extent but obviously we've got an approved list of building societies and banks which we never used to have but we've realized that er since b c i p particularly and the housing market as bad as it is there are some building societies and banks who may be in difficulties and if they go down erm then they may not be taken over
because y don't forget that in the past building societies have always been taken over by you know sort of friendly merger
but the halifax said last year that they wouldn't take on any wounded soldiers so that if er a society went to the wall and its debts were bad then nobody may step in to s to actually erm solve the problem if you like
er so don't do quite correct to say beware of putting too much er of your money in one area and er even with building societies it's risky
but er if you stick to the sort of er top ten you know the sort of alliance and leicester the leeds permanent the halifax the erm the sort of UNK then you're unlikely to get into difficulties
i think where people are more at risk is where they've gone for UNK in th er you know that's the tax exempt savings plan and they've chased the rate through the papers you know the erm and they see that the s the wolverhampton building society or the UNK and
cheltenham and UNK is offering higher rates
yes but c and g are actually very good er very sound er on their er ratios they're pretty good but erm some of them aren't so good and you know be careful when you're coming to invest in building societies i'd stick to the major players at the moment even though you may get a premium by going to a smaller society
because the smaller societies often f charge more for their loans and give more erm to the erm to the investor
but of course erm you know the erm the smaller the society the more risk there is in terms of UNK
generally speaking
so erm it is worth mentioning
erm and banks incidentally your protection is seventy five percent of the first twenty thousand er which is where that b c i figure came from do you remember all that thing about fifteen thousand is your return
well you'd have got fifteen thousand whether you'd got twenty thousand in there or two hundred thousand
that was the basically the problem and people weren't aware of that at the time
er so again it's a matter of security and so if you've got lots of money in one area better to move it about
building societies are a bit naughty in that they're regularly advertising rates at over fifty thousand pounds the UNK do it for one in er my local paper
and i pick it up and it says UNK building society and you can see about half a percent er premium rate on fifty thousand pounds and you think that might be worth going for somebody who's got a lot of capital but is it really because if you've got fifty thousand in there you are at risk
and i can just remember what john major said about the local authorities who'd er got into b c i
he said the extra half percent was actually er a risk return of course you know it wasn't explained perhaps as well
you know local authorities aren't expert in looking at company law and the way that finances work
so i think people got caught out quite badly at that at that point
erm i think we all got to trust building societies and banks and we still can providing you know the limits and er and er the constraints upon er upon those financial institutions
i mean i can't see the government allowing a building society to actually get into erm er a case of UNK i think it the i think the building society association would force a merger but it may be on very poor terms or er you know whatever
but hopefully er we're past the bottom of that UNK
j just one last thing
th i thought i had it clear and now i'm slightly confused as a result of an answer that you gave and i'm not quite clear again
if i invest part of my lump sum in my wife's name
yes
er so we can take up her full allowance
yes
sh she will
yes
be able in fact to take all that
and suppose okay well let's imagine just for a minute that she gets three four five as interest
yes
take
now the interest that three four five
mhm
the account into which it's paid does that account into which the three four five interest is paid does that have to be in my wife's name or does it have to be a joint
no it can be in joint names
but sh that is still allowed then is it
if it's i mean
yes
i thought you see it would have to be in her name because she has
no not necessarily
to be in receipt of that income as far as
yes but then when that UNK paid in half of the UNK taxable when it's assessed for you and half would be paid gross to your wife you know it's a UNK it's a different it's a different er
yes this is where i'm confused if you want to take up
can i just a minute because i've got the same feeling
and i think what bob is saying there is only one account but you'll have to UNK two accounts one that is giving rise to interest in the wife's name
yes
which is taxable
yes
on her if she's liable
yes
but the interest is then paid into another account which is in joint names
yeah
yeah tha that's if you want to use the income of course
it doesn't have to be
right
it can be UNK it can be UNK in the same
yeah i understand that bit
yes
it was the question of making sure that we didn't pay tax on any of that three four five
well
i thought that if it went into a joint account i had to pay tax on half of three four five
you would you would you would
but if we've used up her allowances er i you know it i if you want to keep it separate if it's simpler separate that's okay
right
if you're near the limit then it's probably worth it
right
you know to keep it separate
right
i mean some people want it for income so if they want that sort of fifteen hundred pounds coming in and they both want access to it i'm quite happy to pay it into a joint account providing it doesn't actually give them a tax problem in
right
other words if half the interest is er is erm deemed to be the UNK and therefore taxable if it's a working account it's never likely to get much interest on it anyway
no
cos the money will come in and go out
yeah
is that better
yeah
yeah
yeah
tha that's after it's met the tax liability or not
that's right
when it goes into the joint account
yes
yes
it originally arose through the wife's account and was covered by her allowances and then the interest was then paid into a joint account
yeah
and then only half of that was the wife's
yeah
by that time she'd absorbed all her allowances therefore it didn't matter whether she'd
that's right
that's right
i mean you've got to be careful at the end of the tax year that you're actually okay on that ground er but and you can make a declaration to the revenue if you're over the limit it's just that i mentioned that because some people like a joint account for it to be received into so that they can both spend it basically
cos i mean i'm i quite often use that as UNK income because if i allow it to accumulate in a gross account in a year or two it's actually gone beyond the
right
the personal allowance
yeah right
and that can make you a problem
you've just got to keep an eye on that
er right so er capital gains tax
now this is a tax which hopefully won't affect that many of you here but it is it is UNK a tax nevertheless
and er its er main UNK are er on er owner occupied homes private cars life assurance policies gilts etcetera
but erm most of the things that you will be de now the thing is about properties that if you've got a second property for example or erm you know that's not your primary residence you would be liable to capital gain on a disposal so if you'd bought the house for ten thousand and you sold it five years later for twenty then the gain er on that would be the twenty er the ten thousand that you'd gained less any UNK from nineteen eighty two and they would then er look at that as an allowance to use against it
so your first five thousand eight hundred would be used against it and then any e excess over that would be added to your tax bill in that year in other words it would be assessed as income in that year
don't forget that you've got an allowance each and it's not likely to affect many people except where you've perhaps been left something that you want to dispose of or a property that you want to dispose of in which case there could be a capital gains liability
but don't UNK don't forget that you've each got an allowance of five thousand eight hundred so something jointly owned you've actually got a double allowance and you get that allowance year so if you've got say an er a liability for shares of ten thousand pounds let's say that's your capital gains calculated liability you can do five thousand in the first year and five thousand in the second year and that will keep you below your capital gains tax allowance
yes
erm you mentioned property
erm your parents'
yes
is it therefore better for er a parent our parents our parents to give as a gift the house to both people in order to claim both allowances
yes
and there is a little UNK there as well and th if they if your parents are allowed to live there rent free even though you own the house you won't be liable to capital gains on disposal er if they if they actually pass the ownership of the house to you while they're alive and then you continue to let them live rent free as i understand it you w there would be no capital gains liability on disposal
is does that seven years
no
that's inheritance tax that's a different er a different er matter really
er this is capital gains which is a different type of tax
so it's just one of those things that you should know
i mean capital gains is liable to er a yearly review you know you've an allowance for each year and the capital gain is on the property on the value of the property from the time it was purchased to the time it was UNK
er whereas erm inheritance tax is an allowance which is given once and i'll explain what that is
but as far as that's concerned er i mean the house can be passed over to you and would then become er you would own the house but er unless you dispose of it there'd be no liability to a gain and er of course at that time er if your parents in it rent free at the time of their er leaving the house then you could then dispose of that without erm er liability
would that assume your parents are actually living when they gift it to you
yes
and it becomes inheritance tax then if they die and leave it to you in their will
right
right
yes
er th but don't forget that if they make the transfer if they give the house to you is that what you mean yes
there would be a seven year rule on that
yes
yes sorry yes that would be a potentially exempt transfer
yes
erm so that's true that if they give you the house it is it is an inheritance tax problem as well
er so looking at inheritance tax er the house the estate the car capital etcetera all count towards it
having a will help
and with the current allowance of one hundred and fifty thousand pounds er is reasonably good in that if you have a property worth say seventy or eighty thousand and then you've got assets of worth perhaps forty to fifty thousand you'll still be under the limit
now it's not your problem
inheritance tax is not your problem it's your children's problem
so er i mean you can actually say to your children well okay you know if i we die tomorrow in a road accident there'd be a liability to tax erm and say the UNK worth two hundred thousand then fifty thousand would be liable to tax at forty pence in the pound so there'd be twenty thousand pound debt to pay to the revenue
now that twenty thousand pounds can be paid er it has to be paid before UNK is granted
so there'd be delay in UNK unless the children have got the money so they have to borrow against the property or they have to raise money to pay the bill
so erm you can actually get round that by erm either reducing the estate which is the simplest way of doing it so one thing you can do is spend your money which isn't a problem is it
if you hundred and fifty thousand
and er fo for that reason er you know lady got through three UNK and i think she di died with a few hundred pounds in the building society and if you get the timing right that's the way to do it
because er i mean a lot of children these days i think about my parents it's their money they spend it and i don't really see that it's important for it to be passed on to us but in the case of a large estate it becomes more important if you're looking at sort of two hundred three hundred thousand estate then there's going to be a lot of erm er asset value which would be taxable
er now you can make er you can make UNK in your lifetime obviously you can make small gifts you can make UNK up to three thousand pounds a year which is your annual your exemption if you like and then anything over that is liable to the seven year rule if you die within seven years of making the transfer then there is a there is a erm declining debt er tax wise
but erm don't forget that all these things are erm a little bit dodgy at your ages i don't think you should be making big transfers at this stage simply because you may need the money
if we go back to that first second slide if you're still alive in thirty years time you may actually want the money that you've UNK to people ten years ago and erm that's the problem you've got
so i don't think i should be saying if i was working as an advisor on your behalf i don't think you should be making big transfers at this stage because it's always dodgy
i mean you may need to recall that capital later
if you needed a non urgent operation say a hip replacement or something and you didn't want to go into your own savings er you know then you've obviously given away part of your assets
there are other ways round it as you can imagine
and there's a lo there's a whole industry built up about inheritance tax planning where you actually write something in trust for your UNK and er that's simple in that if you're in good health now you can write say a twenty thousand pounds inheritance tax cover under trust for your children so that's paid outside the estate it doesn't make the matters worse and mo most UNK at retirement it's simple to do because you might pay it on an annual premium or a regular monthly premium and it might cost you twenty or thirty pounds a month but at least you can forget it then
you've made some provision for your children it's written in absolute trust for their benefit
on your death the money is paid directly to the children they can then pay the UNK inheritance tax bill and everything's UNK
er but of course you've got to fund that yourself or at least that's what most people think
er but in our london office apparently they do a lot of inheritance tax planning because of the size of estates and they actually invite the children in and say to the children look you know if erm you die the estate will be UNK by forty thousand because of tax er if you want to make provision the er the contract is still written on the erm the erm UNK lives but it can then be erm paid by the children so your children can then pay the premiums
the only technical difficulty is that it's difficult in a family where there's two children perhaps one's well off and can pay and the other can't so you you've got technical problems there
but there that that's one of the routes they can use
another one that you might consider is joint UNK in common
has anybody looked at that
er joint UNK in common this is where
somebody did mention it john
oh did he
oh right
but don't forget there are there are er technical erm difficulties with that as well in some circumstances and joint UNK in common er you've got to look carefully at before you make any decisions
that's giving away half the estate er half the house value on the first er death
so you just be a bit careful on that one
erm right so passing on then er are you a cautious or UNK investor
what is your tax rate
erm do you want income or capital growth or both
well for most people erm i mean they say to me i don't want to be the UNK man at UNK hill in other words i don't want to save in retirement UNK but you are intending some capital growth as well cos if you don't have capital growth you don't protect your investment
are you cautious or UNK
i can usually tell by when i when i'm doing a fact find reply obviously you find out whether their erm position is erm simply building society or national savings investment or whether they've gone into shares or unit trusts or investment trusts and you can see at what level they're operating and of course if they've still got their money under the bed then
i refer them to ken UNK in UNK ash who's got a specialist company on that behalf
so
erm so cautious or UNK i think most people don't i mean i've got UNK on my form but it never gets ticked because nobody's UNK when they retire
i mean the time for you being UNK was earlier and i mean when you retire you've got to think about capital er protection as well
er it's okay to say yes three or four thousand i'll play about with and i think UNK be good for the next five years that's a different matter but if you're dependent on something for income and security then you can't really take a risk profile on your money
course erm i guess we deal a lot with british telecom and er and erm er UNK and people like that er well g e c now
they erm they tend to perhaps have a different attitude if they've been given company shares because they're handled shares er fairly regularly and that's a different matter erm i mean erm are there many people here who have UNK issues
ha has anybody got as far as british telecom shares or british gas or electricity
yeah so i should think quite a few
i mean i've filled in a few forms for them but i mean probably you're a passive owner like me in the sense that i don't go and actively trade them er i keep them in a long term investment and that's it
so er shares are relatively high risk ad obviously your tax UNK important as well
so that's the first consideration when i'm looking at somebody's investments how do they view their own investment strategy
erm consideration two
your home staying or moving any debts other than a mortgage should you pay off your mortgage
anybody got that question anybody like to consider that one
yes
well you see mortgages are a pretty dodgy subject really because you've got so many er different er variables on a mortgage but the m but the basic erm pattern of mortgages is that if we've got a ten thousand pound loan over ten over say twenty years so that's twenty years there
and this is what's called a UNK er type profile
what you actually do is you pay off the loan gradually over that UNK period of twenty years so you get from that point to that point and it's sort of level to start with you're paying mainly interest off and not much capital so when you get a statement from the building society you still seem to owe virtually the same that you started with
and then in the last sort of seven to eight years it starts to decline quite rapidly because you're actually paying off the capital at that stage and th that's where i may meet somebody at say fifteen years they thought their mortgage would run to age sixty five and they actually retire at sixty they've got five years left and they're about there
and the question normally is well do i pay it off or not
well erm a lot of your tax relief under the UNK system which you're aware it gives you tax relief at source up to thirty thousand has been absorbed up here that's where most of your tax relief is so down here the tax relief on the capital element is nil and of it's only if it's only about three thousand outstanding i might say well get rid of that you know just erm er cash it and then you've got the l you c can forget your mortgage commitment altogether
you won't make a lot of difference
cos i do find people with UNK mortgages actually erm er a lot of them pay over the odds so they might be paying seventy or eighty pounds a month anyway to clear the mortgage so mentally they've already made their decision to actually UNK the payments on it
erm so that's one thing to bear in mind
erm on the other hand if you've got ten thousand on a an endowment basis this is a different matter
now an endowment is obviously based on a principle of interest only on l loan so over the same term of twenty years you've only ever paid interest off the loan and you still owe th a after twenty years you'd still owe the building society ten thousand pounds
er most people well quite a few people will have an endowment mortgage is that right
yes
now what happens here is that erm normally you'll have a er an endowment attached which erm has got a sum assured and that sum assured may be about six thousand say and onto that are added bonuses
and those bonuses
each year can't be taken away once they're added
and er again when we get to year fifteen i get one or two clients who say to me well actually the norwich have just sent me a bonus record through and i've actually got nine thousand in the pot already i think i'll pay the mortgage off
er now of course erm that would be a pretty dodgy thing to do because of er the way the norwich work their bonuses
and er most of you will be aware that where does most of your money come from on an endowment
terminal
terminal
right
and norwich would be delighted if you UNK early because that means that their pool their main fund is not at is not going to have to pay you any terminal bonus
so they'll only as attached and your sum assured and thank you very much
because your bonus is really a used to be around about five percent but if you look at them now they've UNK them which means they've reduced them
always read UNK as reduced erm so that you
you've got erm three and a half percent say per annum er plus erm a UNK which is perhaps five percent of additional bonuses so it looks better but it isn't really
but i mean basically that sort of contract you want to complete
even if you decide at the end of the day that you're not bothered about the UNK tax relief you want to see the back of this loan keep your endowment running because that's where the real meat of the contract is
and erm although there's been sort of all sorts of stuff in the press have you seen all this stuff in the press about endowments
it's ridiculous
i mean over the last two years it's been shock horror headlines you know will endowments fail to UNK the loan are endowments good value and i ke some of the journalists i've read bef over the last two years have actually completely reversed what they said t two years ago when p e ps were declining because of poor share markets and bonuses were coming through quite nicely on the endowments they said oh endowments are the thing to do
that's what you want a decent endowment it takes out all the UNK and er the they've big reserves and of course the minute the endowment starts to look a bit poorer it's switch back to p e ps course i've always said that p e ps were a good idea and the charges are much better now than they were and i'm just thinking of the poor chap that's read the paper two years ago over his tea and UNK on a sunday and thought mhm good idea i'll take an endowment and two years later it's the same person saying aha no pretty bad news an endowment
i mean as usual with financial UNK er i it's somewhere in between i mean endowments are having a bad run at the moment and that's because they've paid out such excellent bonuses in the past so if you've had a maturity in the last four or five years you'll have seen how good they are
but they can't matter
in other words er they weren't trying to sort of UNK it together to actually UNK your UNK your twelve thousand pound wh loan at the end of twenty years
they would actually give you a fairly good sum assured
now what's happened the problem would be for your children who are faced with erm building societies and banks who are red hot to sell endowments because of the better commission value to the company and the endowments to make them competitive have actually been structured so that it's the minimum premium the minimum possible premium
and that means the minimum possible return
so even at ten and a half percent UNK if you look at the latest figures it costs you thirty pounds a month for an UNK star low cost super UNK endowment but at the end you're only going to replace your money if you've got erm the ten and a half growth rate ten and a half percent which is unlikely i in current circumstances
so if you've got children looking at mortgages just tell them to be careful and that i think really my advice would be to for anyone starting off a new mortgage now to definitely go for UNK until they've sorted out what they're doing because if you cash an endowment within two years if you can't keep up the payments if you lose your job then y you get nothing back
so you could have paid a company five hundred six hundred pounds and have no surrender value whatsoever in the first two years cos they'll take their charges out on a twenty year a twenty five year contract
so to my mind er the people dare dance should have been yourselves er i mean some years ago where your jobs are very secure you knew that you were likely to see the end of the term in e employed
that's a different proposition
but er i unfortunately they are sold as er a sort of er a sort of a major positive factor in house buying
and i mean i know the screens are UNK in the halifax and the bradford and UNK e even as we speak and they do this fabulous analysis you know you can see that to go for the UNK is not as efficient as the endowment but it's all a theoretical exercise
and i think for youngsters it's much better to have a UNK and then maybe change it later on to a savings type mortgage
erm but er that's a bit of an aside th i think i think it's important because i think the old the old style endowments were much stronger
the other thing is you're probably getting l a p r that's life assurance premium relief on any contracts that were taken out prior to nineteen eighty four
and l a p r is half of the current tax rate so you'll be earning twelve and a half percent on your has UNK any pre eighty four contracts
right
don't forget that if you alter your pre eighty four you lose your tax advantage
march i think it was
sorry
march eighty four
march eighty four that's right yeah
er and er anyone who's got that sort of contract take my advice to keep it
so even if you do UNK your loan on a building society account er don't forget that erm er the erm building society will then want to charge you for keeping the deeds of your house
cos if you take them back you've got to keep them somewhere and building societies and banks are charging much more than they used to for actually keeping safe deposit
so just work out with your building society whether they'll do it cheaply
or if you've got a solicitor who is handling your legal affairs then perhaps they do it er for nothing or cheaply
i mean y i think the charges that banks are making in order to make up some of their losses they're going to be passed on to the average investor you know the average client so erm you know the halifax will do it free i've heard recently that they are actually charging for er holding your deeds
and some of them actually cha make sure that you have to keep your house and contents insured through the society which again can be more expensive
so er just beware of what you're doing when you when you course you can actually keep a mortgage a account open in other words you can keep it open on a pound a year whatever it is with the halifax
and they will actually keep your deeds erm work out if it is cheap enough to do it that way
if we leave that supposing you UNK up your mortgage which with an endowment mortgage
ah
but a top up mortgage of course isn't because you can't
no
you can't get the tax benefit that you got originally with an endowment
right
mr
keep their UNK low
now there is one window and i'm glad you mentioned that because you just reminded me that you can get fi good fixed rate loans at the moment
y very good fixed rate loans
erm if they if you've got a heavy mortgage and i'm not suggesting that many of you will have a heavy mortgage it's not a bad thing when you're retiring to fix a rate because we've not been able to do that for a long time
and at the moment the building societies and banks are chasing business they're really desperate and er they'll give you a very good fixed rate
now i've got some tables in the car and if you'd like me to fetch them during break i'll leave them on the table for you
because i just fixed my mortgage for four years with the halifax and it's a total UNK fixing mortgages by the way if we you know because i don't know where interest rates are going to go but i fixed at seven point seven five percent for four years
you can get a seven year fix with UNK at about eight point five percent
that's over seven years
if you go for a ten year fix bank of scotland are doing it at about eight point nine
that's ten years
now you can see what's happening
shorter term fix at very low rates medium term fix medium rates and so on
now what you've got to do is to think well if you've got a mortgage over er i wouldn't think you'd consider this if your mortgage was under twenty thousand it's not such a big
liability but if you're getting beyond that you've got to think well is it worth me spending money to actually erm er get the mortgage fixed
erm it i think it is because i think we're in a we're in a dip if i can just go off the idea of conventional investments at the moment
but this is the interest rate dip we're in here i mean we've seen we've seen i reckon we're somewhere around here we could be either side of that but i think what we're going to find next year is that the chancellor because he's had to keep interest rates low and he's UNK the economy er you're going to find that eventually he's going to have to push interest rates up to control inflation
because everybody de everybody's denying inflation is there
and it is at the moment because nobody's buying any goods
but the minute we all start buying goods again it's UNK an endowment
i think that the UNK companies out there have not made any profits for about five years and they're desperate to return to er an even UNK and they are going to force up the price of goods and services as soon UNK possible and we'll pick up the bill
and inter interest rates will have to come up to control er the rate of inflation if the government UNK its normal course
so i think there is a case for going for a fixed rate
how much does it cost
well if you're going with your own society th it's about two fifty to three hundred
i mean the halifax charged me three hundred pounds for this and i've already got a mortgage with them so they don't need to do any sort of er in depth surveys or assessments on the house
so i rang the halifax and er i said i'd like this fixed rate please
i said erm if you're already a halifax customer what's the charge
cos i thought well he'll probably say you know half to you
you know with being a halifax customer
she said three hundred pounds
so i said oh er is there there's no discount for being a halifax customer
no
i said but you've not got to do any work for this
she said well that's the rules you know that's how we're doing this we're offering a fixed rate for three hundred pounds
so i said okay yeah send me the forms
she said do well you don't need any forms cos it's only you we're only going to alter it on the computer
only going to alter it on the computer anyway
so she says if you just write me a letter and get your wife to sign it we'll do the rest put your three hundred pounds in the in with your application
so i thought this is money for old rope you know
but er there you go you pay your money and you take your choice
er i mean y the i if you are moving from one society to another then obviously er you will be charged and there will be the two hundred and fifty pound fixing fee plus whatever else
so y i've got to weigh up whether i'm actually going to make a profit over four years or whether it's going to be but i'm not doing it for that it's not so much making a profit as the fact that i can secure the loan for four years and know that i haven't got any extra to find and when you've retired if you've got say seven years on your mortgage and you're thinking well if mortgage rates go up erm i could get UNK you know if they doubled again then you could actually fix on that assumption
but erm it is a risk because you don't know whether they're going to go up or down
and er we could all get it wrong and we could be in the e r m i if we go back into the e r m then er you know if they UNK interest rates across europe er then we could be okay
but i mean a fixed rate is a bird in the hand really and i think they're quite good at the moment
so i'll bring that list in for you to have a look at and you might spot your own society in there and give them a ring and see what they they've got on offer
er okay so i think that er covers mortgages but if you've got any house if you've got any house improvement loans which were taken out anything like credit card debts anything where you're paying er a high rate of interest then i think you should get rid of those every time
you know cancel any of your big debts because it's going to help your budgeting if you know that you've got rid of a lot of er
bits and pieces
erm and er you can then budget accordingly
er right i'm just having a check to see whether UNK is it half past ten
yes
er ten forty five
ten forty five so we've gone a bit
ke the k UNK boiling so at the most convenient time john if you'd care to
right
okay
yeah
rather than the clock
okay i will do
er i'll just talk erm just talk briefly about emergency access money cos this wi this covers one point i in the next session
erm it's to erm reserve er for UNK obviously i i'd use a building society or bank to cover holidays and domestic needs to set up hobby or retirement applications so we'd always say leave a fair amount in the building society and the only thing th advice i'd give you is one stick to the major societies and secondly if you're looking for larger investments use a postal account
anybody got one yet
right
okay
they're getting more popular
and er certainly i think they're good value
erm postal accounts have got er a definite er advantage over other er methods of er building society UNK
purely because you've got no staff
i mean the cheltenham and UNK the UNK erm the erm bristol and west they've all got no staff they just have a computer and er and erm they send you er everything through the post
but the rates are obviously slightly better than you will get elsewhere about three quarter percent above an ordinary ninety day account and the main advantage normally instant access on these accounts
so where if i'm putting twelve thousand in for sort of a holding fund for individuals i might put three thousand into a local society so they can pop down to the nottingham building society for any bits and pieces and th the bulk of it can go into a postal account to with a better rate
but er i would warn you about er accounts which obviously tie your money for a lot longer than maybe six months or a year because you're always at the mercy of the er of the er building society then if their rates turn down or if you want access you've got UNK and i think if there's no point in chasing interest rates through building societies generally because if you take an average over five years there isn't a lot of difference between one society and another
and you know what's happened i mean there's a lot of UNK involved where they get you into an account that if you read the small print it says ju rates guaranteed until june ninety three and as soon as june ninety three and as soon as june ninety three comes around your seven percent becomes five percent
so you've always got that thing to think about
so with building societies generally it's got to be somewhere you like somewhere that you you've got instant access to stick to the major players
i remember one teacher retiring several years ago in nottingham said to me er he says i'm sticking with the nationwide me
he says
well why's that i said
well when i cycle into nottingham they let me keep my bike in the branch while i go shopping
and that's
rather than replacing the push bike
erm just before we break erm it might be worthwhile just having a look at a few examples
and erm we won't have time to go through all of these afterwards but if i hand a few round to you what i'd like you to do is er just have a go and jot down some of the er solutions that you would provide
put yourself in the position of a financial adviser for the couple that you see these are all theoretical couples obviously theoretical individuals and just jot down on this the sort t
mr
can you go UNK or single people
yes yeah
but er i think it doesn't really matter whether it's erm it's er you know relating to your own circumstances it's more l it's more ab about just solving problems really
can i just ask about the postal accounts at this stage
er where do you find out about those
er postal accounts
well you can get them in the financial press erm usually the telegraph on a on a weekend or the money mail or the any of the UNK any good quality paper or you can buy some of the financial guides that you get in er in er UNK these days
i mean i use things like money management and they're quite useful erm but er you don't need to erm er spend a lot of time looking round
there is a building society shop in nottingham isn't there
yes
and i think they can do quite a bit on that
yeah i will
i'll try and find you one
yeah oh there's a good one
right
some of these are extreme examples some not
and er once you've had a look at that you can er perhaps break for coffee and we'll have a chat about it after the break
right erm so we'll er just start with a quick erm er look round what people have decided on for investment er in individual cases
so i if you can er give me the background if i ask you to sort of give me a bit of background for the case i'll write it up here and i'll write down the solutions and see what see what you've done
er okay er so has anybody done erm er let's start with erm er miss has anybody done miss
yes
yeah we're half way down it
oh no right yes okay
er so if you can start us off
thank you to the local authority i'd
yeah
i'd defer it
i'd defer it
i
yeah
get to make some more
yeah you can't really defer your pension you have to take it when you retire don't you
i don't think you can defer it
can you
you can defer a state pension but it's not really that viable
can't you do that
we thought you could
not with er not with a local authority pension as far as i'm aware
i wouldn't recommend it anyway
put it back into your pension fund
er
to grow to take
you can if it's a if it's a private pension yes you can do
but you can't
no let's assume let's assume that she has to take it
i don't think you can
i mean nobody's ever asked me that question before
sorry
can i defer my pension
anyway if we can start with er with the position as it's there you know if we can take that
er two private income
shares
right
okay so she's getting is it ten thousand from lloyds
five
yeah five from private shares
five from her pension
yeah
so she's got an income of ten
she's got her own house
no mortgage
no mortgage right
lump sum plus redundancy money of twenty grand
yeah
building society deposits twenty grand
yeah
and value of eight grand
yeah so she's
total forty eight
so she's got forty eight thousand right so er what was the inter er you would question the instruction
cos she was
she she's got a modest lifestyle
that that's your ten thousand a year income she can get by on that er this is interesting cos it's all shares
i when i wrote it i thought well she's inherited this from her family and
yeah
that that's ongoing income so what would you suggest there then
i think a world UNK
world UNK yes
i've had that before
send her round the world three times
keen and UNK
okay so if you can give me some suggestions that might actually improve cos we've got to be seriously thinking that she's fifty six this is the other key to it
mhm
and she's got a long time to use this money and okay this might be sufficient now but will it be when she's seventy five so we've got to make that money work so
something to pay but tax
that's right
yes i mean er something to er UNK or er UNK and UNK is a bad word isn't it really
avoid
avoid
avoid
avoid tax yes
yes
or tax planning
anyway erm the er what were your solutions then to that
you started it so you know
well the first one we got kicked on the head because take the pension
oh right
erm
no okay can i pass that on to somebody else yes
i've done the lot
keep your bank account in credit
yes
get a tessa
tessa
right
p e p
p e p
p e p
keep five thousand in a local instant access building society
fingers crossed
put five thousand in a top ten postal account
yes
put the rest in unit trusts with a long established firm
yeah
unit trusts
right
okay
so
index linked
er right another suggestion of index linked would you recommend that as
reasonable
er well i'll put those down so let's find some of these because obviously you won't have met them all maybe
but erm certainly erm i think that was erm a very good response to this because erm obviously we've got er a g a fair selection here you've got erm building society instant and top ten postal that's the postal account there erm tessa p e p and unit trusts and possibly index linked certificates and i'll go back to those but i mean certainly that was a good er a good spread and i think er you know you should be er thinking well you know this lady's going to have some safe growth in the in the future
erm and obviously she's used to shares she's not going to be worried about unit trusts or p e ps cos she's already had er a lot of share er a p e p share income here anyway
so she'll be quite happy w to spread it like that
erm the only thing that erm i thought she might er do was erm er something else on a ten year basis because she's only fifty six i mean that's relatively young so would you possibly suggest anything that could go for ten or more years
an annuity
erm
with profits annuity
with profits yeah
or endowments i was thinking of rather than a
but she's no children why she doesn't want to actually
no but an UNK purely savings if it's taken as a as a maximum investment plan or a or a an i a pure endowment
and he's erm when we were thinking about tax planning i was thinking that if a qualifying endowment if it's run for ten years the one big advantage is that it always pays without deduction of tax
so it's always t tax free cash and any tax free cash that we can accumulate would be very useful
because you've no idea in ten years time what your er position will be with regard to income and tax
i mean for a start we've got twenty five pence in the pound tax rate where will we be in five years time
thirty percent
thirty two percent
so any tax free cash that she's got might be useful
i mean i won't go into detail but i mean she could do endowment she could do it on a maximum investment plan basis to back up her p e p erm and save regularly through different funds
so i mean that was a good solution
er any others for miss with any other alterations to that
any other suggestions
can i ask a question
yes
i didn't know this one
erm if you're buying an endowment policy is it possible to put er put it in as it were paid up or do you have to find the premiums out of your income
erm
you can you can make a single premium contribution to it
ah
that's a useful point actually i i'll cover it now cos er the lady over there mentioned an annuity the two can be done together
it's called a back to back and er the insurance company issue two contracts
they issue an er they issue an annuity which is erm er if you're not sure what an annuity is this is a temporary annuity and they might say in the case of miss they might say well what about a ten year annuity
er in actual fact it's a ten year contract you buy er a nine year annuity and the first premium goes to the endowment when you put the money in so let's say we er put a thousand pounds in the first year and that UNK on an on an annual premium
now the next nine premiums come from the annuity and that UNK in here
now at the end of the ten years of course the erm the UNK here erm is completed we've actually funded the policy right the way through so it's now a qualifying policy tax free down here and the annuity has been exhausted so that's gone so you've used one to fund the other
and at the end of the ten years of course that's all tax free cash
the annuity is actually quite a attractive because there's not much tax er liability on an annuity anyway only a very small proportion and for her in this situation she could actually make a single contribution of say eight thousand pound the maturity from the endowment and actually buy this sort of contract straight off
in which case she doesn't have to worry about funding from income which is what your question was wasn't it
yeah
she doesn't have to fund it from income
and it would all be funded from within the contract
er they're very good in fact i mean even the erm if you look at say the result from clerical medical over ten years erm fifteen thousand invested er currently er returning something like forty three thousand over er the five the ten year term so that's not bad
you know well over double your money which is what a building society would have done it would just about have doubled your money over ten
but of course the problems are with this contract that it wouldn't suit everybody one because you've got no access for the ten years you've bought the contract up front and if you want access to it it's very limited and of course if you cash an endowment early as we know it'd damage the er the income sorry the growth at the end of the plan
er but we can write these with some f flexibility and erm there is a deferred income version where you can run it so you were say you didn't need income five years you can run it for five years then la then leave it erm and just take the annuity income as er as er regular income
so you can actually move it about a bit but it's not that flexible a contract
but in the case of a younger person looking for er very secure growth it's not a bad thing to do
so erm miss i mean she's an easy case to do really
what
cos she's got loads of sorry
what sort of return would you get over ten years on a gold brick
UNK
jewellery UNK
er hard to say because you're moving into er specialist areas like commodities
erm i mean we don't even look at the figures on those because it's not the sort of investment that we would actually consider erm useful for a for a longer term investor
i m she's a little bit different in that she could erm take erm a UNK into something like that
yeah
but commodities are high risk by the nature of er the UNK of the market
and i mean recently i came across somebody who'd got some part UNK in UNK and of course the diamond UNK gone into rapid decline because of the er is it UNK and the russians er breaking up the de beer market
and you can you can have that thing looking very difficult very in very short time
so i mean she'd have to be a very speculative investor she'd have to be right up to er UNK for her to think about that
er but i mean as to returns i mean you'd have to look at specialist press for that erm
yes
i mean i've got some indications in er a couple of books i've got in the car er but erm again i've not been asked that question you know what's the UNK return things like that it's a little bit out of the ordinary but you can find the figures
yes
can you explain p e ps
don't know about them
right okay well i'll do it now so we don't so we're not UNK going through this cos i mean if you don't know what a p e p is it's worth looking at now
so a p e p is erm er introduced by er mr UNK who you might remember some time ago had er a job as the chancellor and is now working part time in the city
yeah
he does get p paid more than two pound fifty an hour as i understand
i mean i l the UNK system in this country is absolutely delightful i mean you don't need do you when i mean the UNK in reverse and things are going UNK wrong and they wheel on mr UNK to explain what he would have done
had he still been in control and i'm thinking god how do they how on earth can they possibly go and say that you know
it's like it's rather like asking henry UNK to sort of er give us some advice on foreign policy in UNK in south east UNK or whatever
i mean i it's almost an UNK with society
isn't it
to bring back people who erm you know perhaps have had their time
and ask their opinion
anyway six thousand into a standard p e p now er p e ps are erm er an instrument which were basically to do with shares originally and the shares were invested in u k companies and er the real dividend value of a sh the share the shares have a dividend and the real value of a p e p is the dividend yield
now if a go if a company's got a high dividend yield it might be about six percent gross
and of course it'll be four and a half after it's paid tax you know if you've got any tax credits from your nationalized shares you'll see those come through and y you've got the net return
now p e p allows you to er allows the managers on your behalf to UNK the tax so a lot of the funds are geared for income and when you're retiring income geared p e ps are excellent news
now the e the early versions were erm a lot less er flexible they were the UNK and if anybody's got an original p e p they'll know that all the dealing transactions all the adjustments have all got to be noted and filed and if anybody's had a lloyds bank p e p since nineteen eighty seven they'll probably have a compete cabinet full of paperwork by now
which you don't have on a UNK modern p e p because they can be written through investment trusts unit trusts single shares for three thousand or specialist er self select p e ps
self select p e ps are a little bit different is that when you the managers give you a choice of shares and it's rather like pulling the handle on the one armed UNK you say right i'll start with er i c i and i'll back that up with b a t and you leave them in for as long as you want and you pay a charge when you move the shares so you can actually control the p e p
er very difficult unless you're into the share market er on a regular basis but erm if you want a p e p er i i'd certainly say they're worth having and certainly for some of the people er in this room
but don't be erm er led into doing growth p e ps necessarily because growth p e ps really won't give you much of a deal
if you want a growth type investment such as i don't know far eastern fund or something like that or a or even a european special situations you n you might as well not use the p e p because they wh you get about one percent on er a growth p e p
and that's not going to be of use to anybody is it
you're not saving any tax on that on that difference
so a one percent dividend yield not worth writing as a p e p
but what they've done is they've actually dis distorted the rules on p e ps as time's gone along and the chancellor's allowed them to do it and the UNK are getting more and more elaborate and er i think they keep knocking on the revenue door and saying er we we've designed this one is this okay
and so far the revenue have been going yeah go away go away
and er eventually somebody will spot it and realize that they've actually moved well away from what p e ps originally were
you see one of the rules is that you keep money in cash until it was invested
and UNK kept saying well er if we don't feel like investing it this month can we keep it in cash a bit longer
and if we're keeping it in cash can we buy some gilts or can we buy some fixed interest UNK
yeah okay you can do that
so now a anything goes in a p e p
which is great while i while it while it lasts
what does p e p mean
personal equity plan
you can have it nine thousand if you pay six into the fund and another three thousand
yes
and then three thousand in that's the single share p e p in any one
and you need to choose a p e p manager per year so if you're already with one p e p manager you've either got to buy him out and give it to another p e p manager or you can you can erm er choose another one each year in other words i do a different p e p each year with a different manager and that keeps everything moving so that you've got a good spread
some of them are getting very elaborate and you're seeing the stuff in the press for things like ten percent gross yields has anybody seen those
a absolute scream they are
but i mean they actually do work er ten percent gross yield and erm if you asked me to explain how they get the ten percent i'd have to use some notes they gave to me cos it's cos it's complicated but they use UNK and they buy in er in the shares and options market and erm the company i'm thinking of actually own the shares but you take options on them and they take commission on the options they also take dividends er and by the time you've read the UNK it sounds a bit like you've fitted all these petrol UNK to your car and you're driving to nottingham and the tank UNK it's that sort of
it's that sort of theory
but there's a it actually does work it actually does work
i m i mean we have approved these schemes i mean th they are nothing to do with direct share ownership
i mean you might have about forty percent of the fund in shares and the rest will be input options UNK and all sorts of complicated devices
but basically as far as you are concerned you can get that sort of dividend yield which is brilliant because i y as a tax payer if you can te ten percent erm the fund is written as a unit trust and you'd be paying seven you'd be paid seven and a half percent on that one so which one would you choose
have it written as a p e p and it makes good sense
but i think the UNK are getting rather weird now and i think that the in a in a future budget when the chancellor's less pressed i mean p e ps really weren't a priority this year were they
i'm sure he'd got a few more bits of paper on his desk than what shall we do about p e ps
but when he gets round to it i think he'll control them a bit more closely now you can invest in that sort of fund quite safely and although it won't give you any capital growth because if they're giving you ten percent income obviously the capital UNK going to be limited but er if it's the income that you're after not a bad thing to do so i mean at the moment i may actually combine one income type er p e p with one growth and income where the where the perhaps the yield is about five percent
er the original criticism if you can remember it was all the ch all the stuff about charges do you remember all that
about you know the horrible charges and they were UNK badly charged i mean lloyds bank you reckon they could UNK ten and a half percent in its first year to actually break even you know because of the initial charges setting up fees etcetera
now that's pretty heavy going
it wasn't lloyds fault it was just that they were UNK with the original p e p regulations about reporting and er so on so they had to charge more
so it if it's an ordinary unit trust your initial charge can be somewhere about five to six percent however a number of companies have realized that they can discount if you if they've got your s if they've got your commitment they'll discount
so in some groups if i say right this client's willing to commit himself for three years minimum they'll discount the initial charge down to about two percent
in some cases down to nil if we take a five year contract
in other words if you come out early you'll be charged erm er a sliding scale
on that five on the five year one if you come out year three you'll get three percent exit charge
now we've been asking for this for years
because nobody likes to pay up front
i mean it's not fair is it really
i mean you're taking five percent of your money when you first go into the fund and that's an exceptional er amount of money that you won't get back but if i if they're saying well we'll invest the whole lot for you but you've got to keep with us w then y you've got the option
and if in three years you decided the performance was less than adequate it would be worth you losing two percent to come out
now having said that i mean the late long established er unit trust group i mean as a as a company we've got to be very careful who we use we've got an approved list erm in london and in UNK we have erm a department which UNK products and those products come onto our approved list when they've when they've fulfilled a number of criteria
are the charges reasonable er is the performance good is the managing group secure
and er a number a number of other factors
so once it's got onto our approved list we're pretty sure that we're really in the right area
and that would be you know companies you're probably already familiar with you know people like m and g erm UNK erm er
erm anybody who's into unit trusts who will perhaps recognize some of those names
and then into the investment trust and UNK er and erm er let's see people like that
so w that's constantly reviewed
not that i do it i mean if i tried to read all that stuff i'd never leave home but i mean they actually give a an advice list which we can then comply with
so as far as you're concerned p e ps have got a tremendous part to play at the moment and i do recommend that you take advantage of them
two years ago difficult for me to get a client to move from a building society because they were saying well i'm getting about nine percent with the abbey national er why should i take the risk on a p e p
well the risk now is staying in abbey national because your UNK down to about four percent net
and the dividend yield from a p e p can be anything from sort of five to ten percent and the potential for capital growth
and it's tax free
and it's tax free
but you've got to make a mental leap because i mean for the last five years things have been pretty horrible since eighty seven really i mean we've only had the pick up in the last year
but it's an act of faith to say well i you know well i'll go into a p e p
but if you look at the low risk a aspect of a p e p and you also look at the low charges it's got to be worth looking at and certainly in terms of spread for miss worth erm worth considering i mean she'd be er a perfect investor for that
some years a tin under the bed was better than UNK cos they were
that's right
except er i mean i'd say that the income funds actually performed quite well if you didn't look at the capital value
you see i mean i i've got lots of clients who've had capital l er income led funds on this sort of thing for years
and i mean if they'd not looked in a paper in nineteen eighty seven eighty eight and realized that fifteen percent of the fund had suddenly gone missing cos it had you know dropped they they'd have still got income from their investments and if they didn't need to cash it then it would have been no problem at all
the funny thing is that er if you look at the better dividend funds in the year of the crash the dividends actually went up cos dividend yields from companies were good in that year so people wouldn't have lost out their income would have been quite stable
er obviously if it was in decline terminal decline then your income and your capital would fall as well
but i mean we've had five years of bad UNK performances and in UNK er economics i think if you look at the sort of post war boom
UNK we're then we're back into i wouldn't say a boom er that's not really the right description but we're certainly back out of the er woods as far as erm er shares go in the u k
erm whether it'll be a sustained erm recovery is another question but i think you can take the view that you know you will you will get some mileage out of share performances in the next couple of years
even the banks
er the share prices are higher now than they were months ago
that's right
that's right
and i mean the banks have erm er r really been an i indicator of economic performance and that that's the case
that it
quite a quite a shock
yes
to them i think
yeah that's right
so if we can have a look at another case er did anybody do erm excuse me mr and mrs
anybody do
no i didn't hand one out
erm
mr and mrs
right okay just start with mr
er he's got a pension from the local of four thousand
yeah
erm his wife is self employed has got four thousand but it's not
so it could come up could go
no mortgage
and the building society savings of twenty eight thousand
right so erm what do we do with that then
s cos they needed a secure income didn't they
yes
er what's the
i mr 's got four thousand
yes
so with the married man's allowance he's got he's well under
yes
six five
and his wife has something like er three four five
yes
er which may or may not be there because we don't know how much her income is
i think we'd have to ignore that allowance
yes
and just assume that she she'll just about use it erm
er okay
er well in that case then i put eight thousand into a building society for easy access car holiday whatever
yeah
and i put twenty thousand pounds to give i mean i took it that she would use her allowance er i took it erm as twenty thousand pounds to give his wife as high a possible gross earning
yes
and so divided it that the remainder went to the husband to take up the one thousand one hundred and sixty five
right
right
so you could actually erm put something in joint names even and it would use up his allowance
i mean if you took that ten percent it would be two thousand a year from
yes
erm and if that was so
yes
roughly half of that could go to him
yes
to make up his allowances
right
a and the rest er
right
that's fine but how would you do it
er was it just a high rate building society or
no i would put it in gross earnings perhaps erm half into national savings
yes
er and look round for something else
right
so national savings that's not a bad decision cos i mean national savings are absolutely secure and the other thing is that you don't need to put twenty five thousand pounds in to get the highest rate you'll get the highest rate from two thousand pounds upwards so it's very good for small amounts
so it's excellent here but we know that it's at a variable and i think the problem that you were probably facing is how do you secure a better rate than that
erm you know the answer must be that erm er just before i answer that i mean has anybody else done mrs and mr
anybody else do that one
we did it but it was very similar
right okay fine that s saves a bit of time
but i mean the thing is here that the twenty thousand pounds if it's invested er into national savings you c you've got another ten thousand and you could look for er a fixed return
now normally fixed returns we do use you know like guaranteed income bonds guaranteed er returns but unfortunately if you look at the halifax list or the er any building society list their fixed rate returns are very dodgy and they're round about sort of er six and a half to seven percent at the most erm if you tie for three to four years and they go up to about seven and a half maybe a little bit more if you tie for five years
now i'm not too sure whether interest rates i'm not very keen on tying interest rates you see i think we're going up again perhaps within the next eighteen months so one way round is to use another type of investment and you could use an offshore erm fund er building society stroke investment fund er which would actually give you a better rate
has anybody used offshore funds at all
right
er
was that a is that pure building society investment or
no it was a bank UNK fund
a UNK fund
right
erm
jersey
jersey gilts
and an and what was your opinion of that did it work or not
the cheque keeps coming
yeah
there was a problem with UNK funds about three years ago and t s b ran up against the problem of falling UNK yields and trying to maintain the flow to the investor which they did but th they failed to tell the investor that they were having to erm sell gilts and er trade under market value so in fact you reduce the fund but there are halfway stages and i mean at the moment i can get round about eight percent plus on erm er offshore funds
and they invest outside u k and you're p perfectly legal to use these and as long as they're UNK and investment board regulated you're okay
so you could put some money into er an offshore fund
something which is regulated and i is part of a major organization a bank or an insurance company you're pretty well okay
and that eight percent plus could then be paid into your account
but it's likely to be more stable than the u k because if the u k rates continue to fall they'll move their money into erm other er UNK
it'll always be a sterling fund but it can be moved into other UNK or into gilts as your fund obviously is
so there is that flexibility there
so that's one of the few options you've got at the moment
i mean fixed rates are dangerous because once you've fixed if interest rates then go up you've lost out on your er return and you can't get your money out anyway so i mean at the moment it's really erm er very deeply into the cycle of low of low interest rates
okay so now that was fairly straightforward erm let's have a look at another case
mr he's interesting
we've got mr
yes
right
mr
not very much on him though
no
i've got him
right so er right if you can start us off with mr then tell us the
well i've i didn't look er erm i can see UNK in what i've done now you've been through the other
well it doesn't matter
yeah
i mean if you just tell us what you
well i thought he should put erm er about ten thousand into a building society er type investment
right
of some sort
i'll just set the scene for the others in that he's er fifty five isn't he
he's just come back from australia
yes
and he's in inherited a family home so he's got a home to live in but he doesn't earn very much does he
no but he's got a hundred and twenty thousand nest egg
so he's got three thousand pounds income and he's got a hundred and twenty thousand pound nest egg
yes
i've concentrated on investing the nest egg really
right
okay
so you've got ten thousand into the building society
yes i think he needed something quite secure and accessible
yeah
then er i thought perhaps he should go for erm something that's er will give him a good income but er
mhm
growth as well so i wondered about er say thirty thousand in investment trusts or perhaps
yes
with a p e p you see that
yes
thirty thousand split between those
yeah that's fine
and then i well if it's really income he needs i thought he could look at an UNK portfolio for the eighty thousand say forty thousand in er UNK and forty thousand in UNK
right
so er sounds like you can act as UNK investment manager for this man actually
erm er but er yes so eighty thousand to er in equity portfolio and that would give him a yield of maybe erm you know four percent something like that after tax deducted so er let's say erm say you know er say three thousand two hundred from that roughly and
p e p exceed the limits
er yes it would
we'd have to put most of it into investment trusts
yes
and just use up the p e p
unless it was his wife as well
yes erm
he's single
yes he's single
and of course he could use it up in subsequent years he could move some of this into a p e p
so er that would er
and he'd get a little bit on his building society wouldn't he
right yes you would yes
i mean he'd perhaps get erm you know er let's say four hundred pounds a year on his building society so he'd have some extra income er four five just over five thousand pounds a year that's
more than doubled what he's got
yes that's right er i mean the thing is you don't know how much income you've got to generate really
no
and er in within that as you know you can actually er go for er the higher income if he wanted to he could push the income up on the hundred thousand say we could make the income round about seven percent if we wanted to do
seven percent plus
which would give him seven thousand a year rather than five
so er there's a fair bit of er i was interested in what you said about equity UNK erm the er thing is you'd have to have that privately managed wouldn't you
yes
and private management means that you would go to a bank or UNK and then you would pay them an annual fee and there would be other charges you know for selling er and buying of shares
yes
and my er feeling is that under say a hundred and fifty thousand that y that you're going to find the charges are quite heavy because it's not a group investment it's an individual investment
erm some of the banks actually lay off the charges to some extent but i think he might find that a bit expensive to run erm and of course they'll take their charges even if they don't make a profit for you
as often as not
a s and quite frankly er you're going to have to be a little bit careful
i mean you could use group investments i mean what you did with the investment trusts gives him a better spread
yes
lower charges and i think you could perhaps use other funds to erm er increase that
er but erm certainly the UNK okay i mean he's got instant access here investment trust and UNK and if he needed the income he could certainly get it
i mean you've got quite a lot of movement in there and you could do quite a bit for him
i mean i imagined he was working in UNK court you know pulling pints of UNK and er
possibly er needing a few bob to er you know tide him but that that's fine
did anybody else do mr
we thought about him buying some property and letting it out
yes that's not a bad idea
he could become a landlord
so you could put him into property erm but erm i don't know if he'd been in the u k for the last few years whether he'd be that keen on commercial property
would you like the whole of the UNK development for a hundred and twenty thousand
so t
that much
it's quite UNK
it is a good time now to buy isn't it
yes it is a good time to buy mr yes we ought to encourage him to buy
so property and he could rent and the UNK income then could er be used er as a as a useful form of income
so that's a possibility
erm so any other possibilities for mr
we thought he might find the house was too big for him sell it and buy something smaller
right yes he could do
get some capital that way
yes he could do
or he could marry a rich sheila
a wealthy widow has a lot
yes he could start corresponding with miss
run a guest house or take
yes run a guest house yes
right okay
surprising he can get rid of the property by you know sort of letting the building society or someone have it have the capital out of it and use that capital as well cos if he's single he's got no dependent well
yes
we assume he's got no UNK
yes
so he could actually have the benefit of that money as well
right you mean like a home income scheme
yeah
yes
er very wary of those really and we're not recommending them at all
er but that's only because of the erm the difficulties of erm er of ownership of this sort of thing
i mean you u some of them used to be the growth roll up you know the
the debt rolled up against the value of the home and once it gets to seventy five percent you lose the home or could do and of course people who took this out it was before the housing collapse you're in difficulties
so unless you're very elderly and you're living in a very er splendid dwelling it's probably not worth it
i mean i if we have ten thousand pounds we could put four thousands into an annuity and say six thousand into a p e p to give a simple example and the p e p could then accumulate value over the te over the five years let's assume it's a five year one but it could be ten
and that would give him about eighty pounds a month at the moment
so that would be a guaranteed eighty pounds a month and at the end of five years we'd assume that the p e p had actually grown enough to give him his money back you know it's because this because it's a temporary annuity it would be lost after the five years
it's not a lifetime annuity and that would have grown to replace his er capital
so he'd get the ten thousand back
they're quite flexible because he can actually take the income from the p e p if he wants to increase his er income as he goes along
in mr 's case i'd probably write it for longer than five years probably do a ten year one
the UNK is at the moment is that annuity rates aren't too hot cos they've gone down with interest rates so er i think maybe that i'd hold off doing that until later and use other types of investment and then maybe at maturity roll it back into erm a er single premium annuity
that's an alternative
now
i have a gut feeling against UNK
i don't like things that disappear and i don't like
and you can't have your money back
no
once they've got your money
actually they do work well i mean there is there is one scenario where it does work well if you're elderly and you're in good health then UNK are pretty good value because they look on their actuarial charts if you're an eighty eight year old and er make an assessment and say well for every ten thousand you give us we'll give thirteen thousand a year
so you've not got to live that long before you're into profit
you've got to make sure that you're in good health and you're a er UNK and UNK individual so if you're from a long lived family erm i once er made a mistake on er delivering one of these courses and er i think erm there's an elderly lady used to work on the course do you remember miss
oh yes
and she's a super lady
and er very straight faced in fact and she was sitting at the back of the room and i i'd just said to everybody i said nobody here's got a life purchased annuity have they
you know cos i knew everybody was far too young
and er this hand went up from the back you see
and i thought oh well that's interesting
so it was miss
and then i and i made this bit of a UNK i says oh you must have got a very good rate cos i knew she'd been retired years and years you see
and everybody fell about laughing realized
but er i mean er she was in a perfect position to do it i mean she'd been retired a long time she was in good health and obviously an annuity would be perfect for her er where it wouldn't be for a younger person so i mean life UNK not got
but i think you're right on temporary UNK they are good if the UNK good
the ones that i did two years ago which are giving a return of something about er nine to nine and a half percent a year plus the potential for return in capital will actually be very good
i mean th they've done better than anybody than everything else because as rates have come down i can go back and see a client and the national savings has fallen and the building UNK fallen but the UNK still UNK away
and it's horses for courses it's secure
it's a bit dull but it does actually provide you with a level of income that you want
and what you don't know is the question mark is at the end will you get your money back or not
well sometimes if i'm doing er say a sixty year old to sixty five he's got his state pension to come in at sixty five so even if the p e p hasn't quite recovered he might just decide to leave that where it is and then his state pension comes in his income is then made up and off we go again
so the thing is with all financial planning that you try and keep things very flexible
and one of the UNK may actually be to say well if we've got this guaranteed income we can afford to do something else with the rest
cos the problem is that th even di share dividends aren't guaranteed
i mean banks and building societies whoever can cut their dividend rate and you suddenly find your income falls dramatically in one year
so an annuity can't fall once you've bought it it's guaranteed so you can see there are advantages to it
and er it's a matter of getting the right mix
so i wouldn't be entirely suspicious of an of UNK but at the moment the er the erm temporary rates aren't too good
er right so er if you take just one more example and then i'll have to get back to er what we do
did we finish off mr
anybody have an alternative for mr
no
erm what about erm another case have we got another case that er we haven't covered
nobody wants challenge me
no i mean it's not it's not that it's just that if you've got if you've got anything you want to say on these cases then it's worth bringing it out now
you've not mentioned premium bonds
is it worth putting a certain amount s just in case just in case
by seven percent on ernie
UNK just been down UNK by the way to reduce the ou the ac the average now is less than seven percent
it's gone down to about five point something hasn't it
i in line with interest rates
now there was a theory in the south of england that when one retired for the first year you dumped most of your lump sum into premium bonds on the hope of a big win and then after the first year you invested it you see having taken the big win
cos if you see the theory was that if you left it there UNK er obviously the money UNK in real value doesn't it because you're getting no increase on it
so i mean to me it's a pure UNK
er absolute UNK
so i mean erm i was going to say put money on the grand national but you can't really do that can you
but as far as far as erm the er the investment in premium bonds it's got to be a UNK it can be nothing else
and i mean i find some clients are really lucky you know they've got a few UNK bits of issues and they keep getting fifty pounds here and fifty pounds there
every time i come back from my holidays the first thing i open is the premium bond win
yeah well you see
won three times since last summer
good god
yeah do you want sell your
enough to encourage one
yes
yeah i think i think really the er the er overall view of it is that it's not serious investment i mean it is just pure UNK
er and i mean if you want to buy you know a few hundred of it then fine you know you could b it'll do the job you know if it's not a thing that er
er you wouldn't include it on your list of UNK
no not at all
otherwise you might be desperate to get UNK to do something or get away on holiday but you're still waiting for that big win
it's a
wait for ever
yeah you w yeah that's right
so er to look at it er another way w i i'll stop before i go back to the erm slides because i want to show you a few on you know erm er the way that money's worked over the last forty years but if you look at index linked certificates cos somebody mentioned that are they worth having
that's national savings and to my mind the only good issue they've got at the moment and er once you get with index linked certificates they were originally the granny bonds that were launched er in the early er late seventies early eighties
and er they erm were there to provide additional growth on savings and it was it was the inflation the r p i plus a b a bonus which UNK out at three and a quarter percent per annum
notice this is the sixth issue
yeah
the fifth was better
that's the one i got
yeah
i mean i did what i could in the fifth issue but you just run out of cash that's the trouble but i mean the sixth issue is good
your maximum investment is now ten thousand pounds each
wouldn't recommend masses into it but because it's no income potential and it's not that flexible you've got to keep it for five years to make it really work
but if you do keep it then the results should be pretty good
having r you see i've had clients saying to me well i'm not sure about this one
you know i like the other stuff but this one's a bit UNK you know
and they'll quote to me that UNK at two percent
okay well you've got two percent plus three and a quarter that makes five and a quarter
and that it has to be paid before UNK is granted
so there'd be d issue so it's tax free
four fi five and a quarter tax free you've got to put an awful lot of money in the building society to get that sort of return haven't you
you're thinking that the gross is round about seven percent
so you think well is that a good bet
i i'd suggest that it is a good bet particularly if you think that erm if we do get rising inflation er in the next year we could be i mean the projected figures are round about er by the middle of next year round about five percent
this is from various investment houses in the city so five percent plus three and a quarter eight and a quarter percent and i would bet any money that interest rates haven't gone up that quickly
y i mean you they might have risen slightly but you won't be getting that sort of investment return you won't be paying any tax and you're guaranteed your money's absolutely safe
and if we do get a period of rapid inflation because if one looks back at seventy four seventy five with inflation running at over twenty percent a year stock market out of control erm and er and er building society rates very poor erm you know seventy four begins to look a bit like ninety four to me
erm but i mean obviously it's a different situation and the chancellor's still got some UNK to do but we could end up in rapid inflation again because we haven't had it for ten years
i mean i've the figures on here i'll show you in a minute doing absolutely brilliant
for the last ten years we've been able to retire and keep our living standards up
i know it because i see people regularly that retired five years ago six years ago seven
they're fine
no real problems if they've been sensible with their money
but what happens if we get that sort of period again
er you see r p i linking on your pensions is brilliant you know there's no question about it
nobody in industry has actually got an absolute guarantee i mean even the british telecom schemes said they'll pay they'll pay the rate of inflation if they feel they can afford
but that means at some point they may actually go below it
not likely but it could happen
so you're fully index linked
now d don't forget index linking is not the same as salary increases and in a time of rapid inflation prices go up salaries go up and the government can interfere in any way it wants with the r p i index
it can take factors in and out
it can take in mortgages it can take in property it can take in other values so that r p i is a very much a UNK figure
it's like my wife saying well it costs me a lot more at sainsburys than two percent you know increase over the last year
and that's true
er so it's a UNK index
so when you're retired you've got to think that you're not salary linked you're only r p i linked
and that's where these certificates are the only guarantee that i can provide which will actually say well if we get fifteen percent inflation in nineteen ninety seven they will pay fifteen p percent inflation plus the three and a half percent three and a quarter percent bonus
so you can see it's a very good contract
it may not look it now but i think it will be over the next five years
at the end of five years you've got the option er and you can er then extend the er into the erm er next issue if you wish or you can go on the extension rate which isn't usually good or in index linked UNK case they'll perhaps give you UNK but no er bonuses
so it's perhaps better to UNK
i mean the old index linked certificates when they came up i put them back into the fourth issue and then the fifth issue and so on because the bonuses are better
only er national savings are worth keeping your eye on because the government's very keen to make a few shillings out of national savings and you might get some good issues in the future
erm so erm that's the one i'd recommend at the moment
the fixed r the fixed rates really aren't worth going for
so by the same token i assume building societies are also starting paying something over inflation rates issued
yes erm building societies i mean i think you're thinking about their equity schemes aren't you
erm yes
those are a bit those are a bit of an UNK er area
i'm not stopping people doing it because people ring me up and say should i do it
and this is where you the building society offer you er the rate of erm er return on the stock market erm and er a bonus on your account if it doesn't make the rate
er have you seen those
er alliance and leicester did one and they they're offered to investors in the building societies
just be a bit er bit er wary of them in the sense that you don't know who's managing the fund er because it's their money it's not your money they don't actually invest the money from you it's their money they're investing
and they'll give you the profit if they make it
it's to keep you invested in building societies only they they're UNK because all the money's going out and they want to keep their erm their erm deposits up so they're offering these schemes and they are quite good there are no charges as such but er you'll get the value of the fund that they've made or you'll get a say two or three percent bonus per annum on top of the er share rate er if you keep it for four or five years
so they're not bad value but i again i wouldn't UNK it because we don't know what the schemes will actually produce and if you're going to that i'd er most of the schemes are limited to five thousand minimum
erm i'll have a look at some of the other er things that you can do with your money cos time's getting on
erm this is the inflation figures i talked about briefly
in nineteen eighty two a loaf was thirty seven p and in ninety sorry eighty two thirty seven p ninety two it's fifty four p and er i'm UNK informed by er my wife that you can actually get UNK less than that if you go to the er large supermarkets where they're UNK the bread to get you in the store obviously
but that means that UNK not really gone up that much
er beer er seventy two pence in nineteen eighty hundred and twenty eight pence ninety two
and you can see here the affect of er forty six percent increase in the price of bread seventy eight percent on beer eighty four on cars and r p i has moved up seventy nine percent
so if you're r p i linked not too bad
but those figures are tremendous compared to the figures i used to have because we update these every two years and the ninety ni eighty to ninety figures were poor and the and worse than that between er you know the previous two years
so don't think that they'll hold necessarily
inflation the effects on your pension you've got the engineer on a level er annuity and the headmaster on er an index linked annuity
erm er in other words index linked pension and he's n virtually doubled his money between nineteen eighty and nineteen ninety
and that means that er you know the UNK has actually worked very well
erm so if you're getting another job obviously you've got to think that you may not need as much income er if you're taking the early retirement well obviously you may be more income dependent and do a personal budget going back to that pro UNK if you spend a bit of time doing a budget you will find it beneficial
you'll know what you're spending and where you're spending it and you then control you p your finances a bit more accurately
cos when you're working you don't really have the time or the interest in actually seeing where the money goes
er can you tell me please er how i can avoid a particular charge
erm i wanted to do a personal budget so i went along to my bank and i said i want to close all the erm automatic payments that you make on my behalf
yes
and they said sure that'll be thirty pounds
well don't you get a monthly statement
well yes but i wanted them to do me a list you see
oh i see
and i thought thirty pounds was rather a lot
oh it is a it is a it is a lot of er money to pay
yes
i mean usually you can identify them from your bank statement
i'll do it free myself
yeah it's a bit expensive
i was thinking if they would charge me fifteen
yes
i wouldn't it would have saved me a UNK
right
but i thought thirty expensive
yes
yes
the direct UNK that you've been paying for years but you're not sure where they go to that sort of thing
that's right
yes
yeah
so this is not to do with the price of eggs it's to do with erm eggs in one basket and er obviously er the basic theory with any investment advice is don't put all your eggs into one area er in one basket if you like
if the ship goes down or the basket gets broken that's what happens
mixing the UNK there but er basically don't take a risk on one company or one product
and er keep a spread
erm short term investments just a summary
bank accounts building society national savings ordinary account investment account er national savings which isn't bad if you want small amounts of money invested but er access is a month
and tessa
now you're all familiar with tessa aren't you
you all know what UNK are
er tax exempt special savings account from the from the banks and building societies
you can invest up to nine thousand pounds over five years er rates vary with the society unless you're lucky enough to have a fixed rate
and the return should be quite good because you're not paying tax on the on the investment if you cash early then you pay tax on it
so it's a five year investment
er but if anybody's got UNK running at ma UNK er retirement i'll inevitably keep them going cos they're normally half way through now some people have made three payments with tessa there's only another two payments to make that's only another eighteen hundred and then six hundred in the final year
so it's worth keeping those going
er if you fully fund a tessa at nine thousand we'd estimate around eleven to twelve thousand back and not the sixteen thousand that was projected at the top of the cycle about three years ago
erm UNK ought to have been shot for their tessa advertising
you know the people who rang me up to say hey sixteen thousand on nine over five years
not bad
but of course they were quoting at the very top of UNK rate and since then it's gone right down
in fact UNK got a few things wrong because they've now been taken over
er but erm er nevertheless the fact is that the tessa is a good investment providing that you don't need access to your money and you're going to get a tax advantage from it
erm capital bonds they used to be good rates they they've deteriorated really national savings certificates well i've covered index linked the only one i'd really say er isn't super unless you're a higher rate UNK is the UNK issue which is paying under six percent it's not really worth picking up for five years
