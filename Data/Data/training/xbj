yes you've got the jersey gilts haven't you
no
did you buy yourself
i bought three quarter percent
right
seven
right you bought those through the national savings UNK
erm yeah
now er i if you're buying gilts individually you've got to know what you're doing unless you want to hang on to them to the end of the terms cos gilts are government UNK and they have the different rate rates of return different maturity dates
and the only way to really run gilts if you're serious is to actually trade them
and a trade in gilts is just as complicated as shares not for the small investor
now i've got a retired accountant in nottingham who spends his days trading gilts but not what i'd want to do
but he's got all the charts and he knows what he's doing
but basically a UNK has got a fixed rate of value at the end and the beginning so it's worth a hundred pounds day one a hundred pounds day you know whatever h how many days it's in force if it's a five year UNK it's worth a hundred a hundred pounds then
in between it can vary depending on interest rates and the market
so UNK traders actually s buy and sell gilts in order to make a profit
and er sun life who're a who er you know are favourite for er for er gilts management er were busy buying index linked gilts about twelve months ago when nobody wanted them
cos th er index linked gilts were po were we very poor because against interest rates they didn't give you a lot of guarantees obviously you know interest rates were high index linked gilts were er already UNK
but i think they'll come up well in the next few years
but what they'll probably do is sell those before they actually reach their premium
they'll probably sell the gilts on then re UNK in other investments
but it is complicated and i er mean really for the average investor unless you're a non UNK because the in er the income from the gilts is gross it may be worth er it may be worth a non UNK holding gilts and er getting a gross yield of maybe eight and a quarter nine percent
that's fine
but if you're trying to trade them you come UNK cos you you've got to make all sorts of er predictions about interest rates
mind you might be better than the chancellor at that but er
you know
it's a difficult market that
so let's have a look at the effect on in on building society investments and other inflation the effects on it
erm between nineteen seventy three er and er nineteen ninety one UNK in building societies gave quite a good return actually erm gave four thousand three hundred and ninety eight return
er r p i was five seven eight so in other words r p i ahead of building society rates
so in the longer term building societies don't do well
you've had five years of UNK results in building societies they've been really exceptional
but i think those days are now over and anybody who's been in building societies there's now a feeling er that things have altered quite a long way
erm asset backed investment well we've covered shares investment trusts p e ps property gold coins
don't know much about gold coins erm i mean i suppose they're a UNK asset
but er i've just finished treasure island with my daughter that's as far as i've got
erm
er property er very much a variable you don't know where you are with property really
i mean it's it can be a good investment and maybe the time is now to go for it but of course it's er hard to release er your asset if it's a falling market
because people are finally trying to sell houses
investment bonds we haven't covered and they are a variation of a unit trust really but they're issued by live companies and you can do other things with them and they have got tax advantages
one of the better ones at the moment are the with profits bonds where you're guaranteed a re returns rather like an endowment if you buy it as a single premium again
and they are quite useful if you've come across those from UNK g a
er they're quite useful
and good for income as well
er UNK on investment returns since nineteen forty five
if you had a thousand in a building society and a thousand UNK you'd be a very happy man in nineteen forty five i would think but if you look at what happens between then and nineteen ninety the building UNK written risen by eight point nine times and look at the UNK a hundred and eight thousand er that really is UNK you know that re return on UNK
but don't forget that those can always be in reverse and if you look at the there's a chart which shows five year periods wh where shares didn't make any profits at all
we're just getting to the end of that now we'll be another mark on the er five year list you know between eighty seven and ninety two
well you've probably lost or not gained on shares
but don't forget that over a longer period shares are bound to do better
because when there's inflation in the system company values are UNK company er profits are UNK so companies go up with inflation
so erm worth bearing that in mind
er adjusted for erm the r p i one thousand pounds adjusted on a building society would have actually lost you money
your thousand pounds would now be worth five hundred and ten if you take the effect of r p i
and er i like to think that if you'd bought a nice full nose morris in nineteen forty five and you wanted a replacement in nineteen ninety you'd have still got a reasonable UNK wouldn't you
you'd have still got your wheels
so in that sense the build the UNK have kept pace but if you think in the short term you'll always be out of out of order with shares if you're thinking of going in for three or four years you you're likely to get your fingers burnt
you've got to look at it at five years plus
and er management through er investment trusts p e ps er and er share UNK the best way of achieving er security
er this is just to show income from building societies during the seventy five to ninety period and the yellow line shows a decline or at least a UNK line which just reflects interest rates and the un unit trust income rising over that time is the orange line
just making the point that in the early years your income will be less then there's a UNK point because the value of the asset grows and so does the yield on the fund
er these are guaranteed areas UNK local authority loans which used to be popular pay gross but they're not around that much these days they're not that competitive
and local co UNK sometimes offer good rates on fixed rate deposits as well
but they've all fallen foul of erm low interest rates at the moment
so erm national savings again worth mentioning those erm deposit accounts not really up to much at the moment
so UNK are very safe then regular UNK partly tax free but not available once you've spent your money that's it
and you get part of your money back tax free
er p e ps i've covered
and i just want to look at capital UNK here
i mean in summary i i'd say that this is the sort of thing they'd look for in a in a portfolio
some in immediate access which is your building society some back to back through either a an endowment scheme or a p e p scheme where you've got the security of the annuity to back it
then some national savings possibly some income bonds and then onto the growth side which would be bonds unit trusts shares p e ps etcetera
so they're er the three blocks of er investment
and i'd even go i think really you've got to look at it as sort of immediate term immediate access er medium term investment and longer term investment over here
cos even national savings cycle over a five year period and what you want to achieve is money coming back into your hands regularly over that period so you can take another look at what you're doing
so when i'm seeing clients mainly at the end of a of a three year fixed rate deposit again at five years when we get a national savings UNK and so on and so forth
and really that should be er a secure portfolio that you don't need to worry about too much
it should actually pull through all your need
and on the building society side that's your instant access fund y anything you need in the meantime if we've said that we want to achieve eight hundred a month income and that's really the basic income any holidays any UNK come from this account
and er you know we keep the income steady on the other two parts
erm so if you're looking for advice independent financial UNK
well we deal with a wide range of different groups and erm we've got to produce a best advice list and er we try to find you the best contract available in the market
that doesn't mean we're always right incidentally
er but we try and UNK eliminate the poorer companies we try and make sure that we go for strength and security as much as return
and er that means adopting the current market
erm so erm if you're looking for advice er try to get sound UNK advice free and without obligation
and please get a written report a proper written report
if you haven't got one it's not worth proceeding
because that written report is your evidence that they've actually taken information analyzed it and come back to you with a solution
and if there is anything that you want to discuss with your adviser positive or negative later you can go back to your report say well this is what should have happened and can you explain what is happening
so it's your document if you like
only i've come across one or two head teachers who've taken out things like a b cs recently and they didn't realize that they wouldn't get a lot of value if they UNK them early you know if they UNK them within two or three years
erm one chap thought he could cash his a b c before his pension and he'd actually bought a massive amount of a b c business to retire at fifty five
and of course if he doesn't retire at fifty five the authority or the school his a b c's just destroyed his pension
and er i mean i tried to indicate you know to him that he could claim against the company and get his premiums back but unfortunately there was no letter and no i indication and the person was no longer with the company
so it was his word against the company
and all the product details were there i mean you know that all the product details would be in front of you but whether you actually read the small print it's is the er is the issue really
and you can't get compensation for that
i mean i doubt it'll matter in this case it's not that serious
but it was serious in the sense that he was given wrong advice
so make sure you're dealing with a company that's committed to what you know the market that you're in that you're you know that you're familiar with the people that you're working with
independent advice er comes from major UNK the banks and building societies have come out of independent advice pretty well because they've decided that it's expensive and a hassle cos we're regulated all the time and of course it makes we've got to analyze the products on the market so we've got to pay people to do that
so it is expensive relatively
but the banks and building societies ha have found that people didn't want independent advice because they didn't ask for it
so now unless you go in and actually bang on the counter they'll give you the advice of their tied erm agency
er i mean standard life for instance tied with the halifax g a with the derbyshire erm endless societies have tied
er bradford and UNK i think have remained independent
erm but there are other organizations as well erm and er you see UNK west you know you remember the man with the wings who used to walk round in the advert
you know
well he's taken his wings off now and joined clerical medical
er so er i mean the thing is that they a are in a position where they can improve their profits by er UNK the operation
you'd do it if you were on a bank executive and you said well only five percent of people ask for independent advice why do we bother with all that lot
you know
er just make it available if somebody asks for it they'll go and drag somebody up to have a look at you and they will keep er they've made it so they keep an independent arm but it's not the major part of their business
they are interested in volume obviously and that's what y that's what they're going to go for through their products
no that's no problem except that you must know who you're talking to
cos if you read adverts in the paper and things you wonder who
it says things like UNK advice doesn't it for mortgages erm in the nottingham and the derby paper and then you read at the bottom it says erm an appointed representative of legal and general
well you know i h i hardly think that's UNK
i mean it will be perhaps where they try and place the mortgage for you but erm i w i bet you they won't recommend anything but legal and general when it comes to actually you know covering your mortgage
so er that's the er point to ra er to make there
i mean we use standard life we use clerical we use most of the major groups erm but it's always a matter of trying to find the best contract at the time
i mean at the moment three or four groups are actually pushing up their annuity rates again er to get business in
so i'll probably use those three groups until they've got enough business and then they'll UNK the rate and i'll wait for somebody else to come along
so you know that's the way that the system works and we've got the choice to actually make those decisions
erm it's er it's er entirely up to you obviously wh whether you take where y you take your advice but erm i would make the point that if you're retiring in the next year or so erm best to take advice erm relatively early you know maybe two to three months before you retire
you've then got the time to look at your report decide whether it's suitable perhaps have another chat with your adviser and then at that stage you're ready to go ahead
erm you know the difficult thing for me is when i'm working with people who've actually been given no notice at all and that's happening with lots of organizations where on friday you're suddenly told you've got no job but your UNK available
er they may have had some UNK but you know they might have applied for a UNK you know it suddenly comes
and that's difficult because you need a bit of lead in time to actually think it all through
the mistakes are made in investment terms when you actually rush at something and you decide to go ahead and invest before you've really studied all the options
and then obviously once you've done that you might live to regret it in that erm the erm the investment itself might not be suitable for you
so er take your time and erm do l look at all the options in front of you
and just one final word of warning and that is to do with newspapers
there's a lot of stuff in newspapers about you know erm er investments and what you can do with your money and get the p e p with one and a half percent discount and all the rest of it
er but erm if you do er business through a paper then nobody is responsible for the investment business that you do
i mean nobody's there to back you up if you need a if you need any assistance or it's or the company's not really UNK then you've got no UNK
so i think you've got to look at this as er saying well if you get external advice at least you're covered and er i mean er if a if a company's in difficulties we perhaps would know before you would erm that erm you know that we shouldn't really be investing with them
so i mean what you're getting is the expertise and the and the assistance of erm an external adviser
erm if you want to know how a UNK are paid erm you know then i er would explain that under the terms and conditions of er 's business we're actually paid erm a salary by and er i UNK obviously get er you know a car to get about in etcetera but the when we place business er the er commissions that we get generate are paid to they go down to head office in UNK they're then used to give us our er our you know returns advances and what have you
so that's where the money goes
but don't forget that is not an additional charge to you
so that erm i mean if i recommended a norwich union income plan and you UNK into nottingham to buy the charge would be the same whether you bought it from me or from norwich
and er the difference is that i will know at any one time whether norwich are offering you the best rate or not
and i can decide then on which o which company i'm going to use
erm so you don't lose out by using an adviser
and where possible we do try and pass on any discounts that are available to you
er i mean if a particular group's promoting a product which we're already using then i might switch investment to that product if there's a big discount
because it's very competitive at the moment and people are actually UNK charges quite regularly
and where that's available obviously we'll pass it on
so erm er ongoing charges there aren't any
we don't l levy any charges for UNK er monitoring UNK
er but we're not i must explain we're not UNK managers
now UNK management is a another thing
i mean have you come across that
that's where you actually sign over er the management of your whole portfolio to another individual as you would with a share portfolio with a bank
and that is a different matter because you're then they then make decisions on your behalf and th they will actually move and UNK er take commissions from some of those UNK and that's all going to them and fine if they do the job
but you've got to think carefully whether about whether UNK management is really erm what you want
in the sense that you've got no control over your portfolio at all and it's just invested and they give you a statement
er
UNK supposed to have UNK
in charge of
oh right
oh
it's erm
yes
yeah yes
they're not supposed to handle their own shares if they're in a position to have inside information
yeah well i mean that's a that's a difficult one inside information when you get down below the top ranks there are lots of people in the mid mi medium ranks who would know about UNK dealing and i'm sure use it
but that's something we're not party to
er but anyway UNK management can cost a lot of money erm but you've got to weigh up whether it's actually worth it
i think in the case of share UNK you need a lot of money to make it work properly
and er you always want to look at the track record
i mean my belief is that if standard life and m and g can't show me a profit on a good managed fund i doubt that anybody in a another institute is going to do any better
cos er the people that run these funds are highly paid and highly experienced and erm you know i don't think banks or building societies or any other institution is going to pay more they're buying in their skills the top offices
i mean that's just view of it erm and er i m obviously there are individual funds that perform very well you know
and when you're getting advice don't forget that erm if it's particularly the a single company they will be showing you figures which actually show their products in a reasonable light
i mean you would wouldn't you
er so er i mean they're going to show you the seven year figure maybe don't show you the ten year figure because they don't look too good over ten years
erm so you can get those figures yourself from money management and from er various erm newspapers and you can actually check performances if you want to
but again that's the sort of thing the we'd monitor
erm i i'd like to thank you all for your participation this morning by the way and i will give you out erm these reply if you'd like re erm a an information pack from us or if you wish to have a chat with me then you can send in this you can give it me back at lunchtime and i can send it into the office and they'll send you a retirement pack with an income planner and what have you
so if you'd like one of those
does your service offer a service
er yes it does
erm in that erm er we've got facility to review UNK
yes
what we're looking at again
yes
well that automatically comes up erm if erm you've got which are turning round and ou our records will automatically show maturity dates etcetera
but i usually arrange with a client over what's seen in two years' time or one year's time whatever
it's normally down to individual circumstances
are you on the phone
well yes
i mean you'll find that my home UNK on here and tha because i will advise you from home during the week i'm quite happy for
for people to phone the home line
er but erm obviously i'll sometimes need some time to get back to you
oh sorry
yeah
hello
well now what can we do for this lady
well erm it's negatives so x rays my leg
right
oh
x rays
now then
back this morning
okay
right there's no arthritis that's fine
but that doesn't mean that you know you won't have pain
no
er because there's no arthritis
aha
and you still get pains in your joints even though you don't have arthritis
er right
but what i was thinking maybe i'd be better going back to work and seeing how
mhm
you know
yeah er i think so
the one thing about arthritis that y you're better if you can keep going
rather than because if you settle if you let the joints settle instead of being nice and smooth they get all rough and the other bones knit in
mm
with them
it was just that pain i was getting
it seemed to have disappeared so
i thought maybe that have my work maybe
yeah that would probably be a good thing
er more help than anything you know
now the wee pink tablets did when you started them did they make a difference
well i was actually feeling very UNK with them
you felt UNK with them
aha
right
well what
but i've not been taking them for the last week
well keep what you've got in the house
aha
and if you feel that the pains are bad during the night take them at
take them
bedtime
mhm
right
take keep them round the house
mhm
if you need them take them at bedtime
but er i'm glad to say the er x rays are alright
aye well i was glad myself
oh aye
could you date it that i start back monday doctor if you don't mind
next monday
er aye well i'm
monday that'll be the eighteenth nineteenth now
er nineteen four ninety three
er so that gives you another five or ten years before the dry rot sets in
i hope so
oh that's good
oh that's
i sometimes think it's UNK wear and tear
ah
you've got years and years and years to catch up yet
years and years and years
oh well i don't suppose i damage if
yeah you've a lot of a lot of UNK still to get up to
mm
there we are that'll keep you right
with these folks
it's just they like you to slip in before you actually start to
that means when i go in they know i'm s coming in you know
it kind of keeps them
yes oh aye that's right
keeps them keeps them off your back
and it
keeps them off your back
right UNK
right doctor thanks very much
cheerio
okay cheerio now
in walsall august fourteenth nineteen hundred and six
i have two brothers one older and one younger
shortly afterwards we moved to and we lived there for many years
the family had always been interested in the leather trade indeed as far back as eighteen hundred and fourteen er our UNK were UNK in the south country and we make an article known as UNK food which is much sought after by the UNK and other people using similar sort of UNK
worked for the firm of with whom my grandfather was connected and also my uncle
were UNK merchants and UNK joined the firm to start them in the leather trade
subsequently he started the walsall branch to where my father went and also the UNK branch to where my uncle went
and also in later years my cousin was o operating was working with in the UNK trade
father was very ill he had t b and during the war he became worse and shortly afterwards fifty seven he died
i was then twenty years old and was asked to take charge of the walsall business
my cousin er what's name now kenneth was the lieutenant colonel and was the youngest commanding officer in the army at the time of UNK
he was killed in this battle erm is that of interest
i don't know
erm with regard to the leather trade i worked for until i was fifty until i was fifty four years old
after which i decided to get into the leather producing industry rather than the purely UNK business and i joined as a director of the main board
in this capacity i started where we built a new building in a very nice building of UNK bricks and UNK constructive i also was the principal UNK when harvey hired the firm of in walsall
unfortunately due to a difference of opinion in the after UNK of new methods this was not a successful venture
because was very fine producers of top class UNK and other UNK in the old style
the new methods of mass production were unsuccessful and was closed down a few years later
why were they unsuccessful
what was the problem there
they brought in management and er i've got i've got erm i i'll show you a thing about it
do you want to know that
can you co up again if you can co i'm going back to the reason being that the approach to the business was one of quality and a large amount of hand finishing and the UNK were aimed mainly at the UNK and leather goods trade and also only at the very top end of the shoe trade
under the new management the idea was to get into the production of leather for the shoe trade with modern machinery and mass production methods
these were not understood by the workers and the management on the floor and indeed should never have been put into operation
with the old style of production with a little extra help in the marketing and on the financial side it would have been a big success
is that all right
yes
i'm not used to this you know
what am i going to say now
erm what was your job exactly
what did you do
at
i was a director but i had no responsibility in the production of leather or indeed in any of the management er erm methods
i did my best to oppose er these new er schemes and found myself in the majority of one quite often
and of course and what dear oh dear oh you go
how many people did they employ there
was it a large concern
was the biggest leather producing unit in walsall
at one time i think i'm right in saying that they had two hundred people
certainly at the time of our taking over the number of UNK would have been not far short of a hundred
it was
and whereabouts was their premises
whereabouts was the premises
oh the premises er are were erm in er between er and
and indeed in those days the whole of that area belonged to even the land facing onto was nearly wholly owned by
so what happened to them
i mean are they still in existence or
ha
have they been taken over completely
shut
i was then put in er charge if that's the correct word of UNK of the premises and er we sold a part to harry who was an old friend of mine er for his garage purposes and er later on purchased a large building in the middle of erm er this area which was still being used as a leather UNK works and so on
er
and when was this
about what year would you say
about nineteen before to sixty nine
and then when where did you move on to from that point
you yourself what did you do
well erm the firm of er was taken over by geoffrey and myself were the two main board directors mostly in favour of the UNK
but shortly afterwards er i was in UNK with the chairman the basis of my contract with was such that it was not to his liking and i was not prepared to give way in the matter and was dismissed within six months of the acquisition of by
i was then sixty four years old and i started a business again as john
where was that
was that here or is this in
oh no
er i didn't have any idea er that i was going to start obviously er but er i first started at home in the UNK and had letters all over the floor
within a few months i took a small office space oh dear i can't remember
what that was
can i go back
it was in it was in where
yes
i took the offices yes
tell me exactly what you were doing
UNK er is the buying and selling of materials not the production of materials and erm i was probably the first person from this area in the leather trade to go to china and we started to do quite a large business with china so that immediately i was on my own the first big operation i took was to go to china and make very substantial purchases of UNK leather
then shortly after that i moved to where because no one else who wanted to buy the old buildings i purchased them from the firm of er in our own right no ou in my own right and i started my office there where i had warehouse space
they were all leather manufacturers
we sold quite substantially locally but also we had a reasonable export business
we erm sold bigger parcels to other parts of the countries in this town because we were not dealing specially in walsall UNK at that time
erm we were agents for a firm called in australia who made very good leather indeed and we did sell quite a large amount of his UNK to the local er firms for the UNK trade
where else did you acquire leather from
you mentioned UNK from china and UNK australia
er that's a difficult question because we bought er anywhere we could er and where we thought there was leather that we could make a small profit on
indeed erm i can say this now er that at that time unknown to the top management of i was buying large quantities of leather from my old firm it into the town right past the front door of my old offices which were now the UNK the local headquarters of our and selling them literally within sight of the building that used to be the place where i operated from on their behalf
when did you come to then mr
and what was the firm doing when you came here were they
this is a very old established firm
er it started in eighteen fifty six had been UNK leather for the UNK trade all those years and it was then a subsidiary to and was making UNK leather for them but in addition quite a large production of fancy leather for the local light leather goods trade
after er purchasing we continued to produce the same materials erm mainly er directed towards the UNK trade
later at the time of the collapse of the empire we also purchased the small er manufacturing plant in which again was a plant that i'd started
we produced there only fancy UNK however two years ago we decided to close this plant in mainly because i'm getting fairly old nowadays and my son had many activities to take charge of
so we concentrated our leather producing efforts in where we make almost exclusively leather for the UNK trade
where do you get your UNK from
this is at the moment a difficult question
the immediate answer is the UNK as such almost entirely come from the british royal UNK which are UNK in this country and then er find their way back to walsall er for the UNK trade
unfortunately there are only two or three UNK left in the country who produce the type of leather that's suitable for this trade
and in addition we're suppliers to other countries as well particularly the european countries
so that the source of supplies for the UNK trade is becoming more difficult year by year
one can look around the world but even though there are somewhat similar UNK produced in south america and africa they're not really quite suitable for the better end of the walsall trade
we can all still bring leather in from our friends in australia but for reasons that i don't wholly understand this is very much UNK than the local er supplies available and for the time being it's not of interest to the UNK makers in walsall
erm do you export any of your finished items here
yes you're asking us er a question which now is erm pass er politically er not er very er UNK to put on the air for public erm interest however we do export er quite considerably
er we export to france
we export a little to the united states
er we export some to india we export and anticipate to export a fair quantity to another country which for the purpose of our own affairs shall be UNK
erm does climate affect the finished item
yes
er the question you are now asking er is really concerned with the final finish of the material
some buyers prefer the UNK to be left lying UNK on the grain and the flesh of the leather and t so that it will gradually be absorbed and also they can then brush it up when they have got the goods when they are making it up in their workshops
but for the local manufacturers we UNK it and dress it up here before it is delivered so that it's then in its final beauty ready for being cut up into the various items of UNK
are there any other UNK firms such as this in the area
not in the area
er there's one other firm in walsall called who are very fine producers of UNK leather indeed the leaders
they are much bigger much er better UNK and very good quality producers
er we are good friends er although competitors and erm my view is that whoever who are the walsall producers make the best leather we can be found in this country
would you say erm at one time there were many more firms
oh years ago when i was a boy there were twelve UNK in walsall
there must have been more than twenty UNK nowadays there are no UNK and there are only three UNK so the answer to your question is yes many more
a lot occasions it is a contracting trade
it's contracting not only as regards the walsall trade but for the simple reason that UNK and skins at ma v very largely found in the countries of UNK africa and south america
now all these countries have much cheaper labour force most of them have warmer UNK and with the advantages of low price labour and also less expensive from the point of view of having to dry out leather and do these various processes that come in the production the erm the leather UNK trade is being increased in those countries with the knowledge and indeed the design of the western countries because UNK is not the most UNK of er works
there are certain UNK and there's er UNK problems and very often they're quite glad to get rid of the UNK if they're anywhere near the middle of the towns
do you promote your products
that's an interesting question
we don't promote them
i disagree with advertising
i think it's an unnecessary expense and we take the view that if the product is good and if the price is fair buyers will come to us
if we spend a lot of money in advertising i think it's not only unnecessary but UNK
at least it
had they had any problems getting labour
always that we now could of do with one or two suitable workers er there were problems throughout trade
our friends who are UNK and UNK makers can't get workers and nobody there aren't any workers in the UNK and UNK trade available
it's quite possible that there are one or two old gentlemen but when one wants to find a new operative one really is looking for somebody to come in the trade who will be with the firm all being well for a number of years
why can't you get these sort of people now
what are the reasons for this these UNK
i can't answer that question
i don't know
what are the main uses of leather today would you say
of course that's too simple
there's a very large amount of clothing which is new in the last twenty years because the technology of producing leather is such that the skins can be split thinner and still retain their strength
the leather processing is such that they can produce leather with very soft handle nearly as soft as er as er fabric er UNK er erm jacket or costume er and also it's er become a fashion article
so after the shoe trade the clothing trade is of an immense importance
UNK has declined somewhat
you don't see all the ladies pulling their gloves on every time they go to church or appear in public er and certainly men very rarely wear use gloves possibly as we're driving cars we're not exposed to the cold
if we were walking backwards and forwards er to our offices we'd pro er probably wear gloves in the cold weather
then there were so many other uses of leather
what percentage of the total would be the UNK and UNK side of it then
minimal
minimal
er it wouldn't matter to the leather trade as such or to any of the countries er if there was no UNK and UNK trade and that goes for countries like erm britain and france and germany and united states and so on
obviously of course it matters in the sense that people who want to ride horses and race horses and hunt with horses and this sort of thing so that as a pleasure thing er it's good er to have the leather for those purposes
but one has to bear in mind that it is always possible that you could have other materials for riding and so on
not as good but UNK nevertheless er such things are possible
it then takes away the acid from the joint
and can you see it will not cure UNK knees but it gets you rid of the acid for the time being
if you don't get rid of acid you know what it does to even metal if it sits on metal it eats through it so you imagine what it does to your bones when it sits on them
and this is why with forms of arthritis you get UNK and you get n er b the joint won't use
so can you see it is vital that all of you keep your circulation going right and a good idea is to start it in bed so that before you get out and put weight on your limbs and the same with the rest of your body get your circulation going get the joints doing a bit of movement and before you get up and give them the added job of bearing your weight
now if you're a UNK person you will know that you have difficulty getting out of bed in the morning unless you do something and this is the way of doing it move in the bed before get the circulation going so it moves the acid so that you can move
and don't let it UNK the joints cos it does eventually
why i'm very positive about this i am a UNK arthritis person have been since i oh i don't know happen to be in my fifties i think
and i have been years on bold UNK and all the rest of it and i know from experience you get you deal with it doesn't cure the disease but can you see you have a way of dealing with it of coping with it of helping yourself er c er do things and therefore you can
you've UNK it hasn't UNK you
it if it's left it will UNK joints
that hand of mine won't go the right shape although i've tried i knew it would UNK joints and so i put all my efforts into spreading them the opposite way but i haven't won on that one can you see
because it's affected the bone once the bone is affected you can't get it right cos the UNK done
so it's very important that you do
what of course you don't see is wh what it will have looked like if you have UNK
n well i had why i was so positive about it i had an uncle who had it very badly and as a child i was very aware of his hands they were quite UNK looking they were that shape and you know everything he did he had to that and that's remained in my mind that when i got it i though i won't have the hands like that so i r i w i go i went to sleep i still do it every night spread my hands the last thing i think about spread the hands
now it affects all the joints as well but somehow or other i felt that was the thing that stuck in my mind from seeing him
and that one which eventually o originally was the worst hand has got the less er damage to it
so again you see it is up to you to do deal with it
i think as long as you've got some way of dealing with things you can live with them
cos you're it's positive again you're in charge and not it
now UNK is the most important but when you've got that you have to go for something else before you even can grow the stamina and that is strength the power of the muscle to produce the body action resist gravity and work against resistance
y the power comes from muscle UNK it's needed for movement management balance and UNK and for lifting and handling objects
it needs regular graded notice progressive practice to build and maintain the skill
care must be taken to start from each individual's capability
because your friend can do some fantastic things it doesn't mean to say your muscles will you could be in trouble
you must start you forget there where he is or she is but you've got to start from your actual capacity otherwise you're in danger in that
now er how powerful are your muscles
what will they do
have you thought about them lately about how strong are they
just let's have a little test on that one
sit on the table
you're sitting in your chair just lift up one knee will you and the other one
and repeat that right
now he'll put it up and hold it
now the muscles are not r working to lift it they're working to hold it against gravity saying go on let it go
and can you see by about now the muscles are beginning to feel
again the same thing there's UNK in that muscle which stops the blood flowing which builds the acid and therefore it begins to hurt let it go
and again you see if you increase the load can you take up both back pick them up again
we all know how easy that is to do and if i say hold it
we find a few more right let it go
can you see it requires more in a static holding this is building muscle power and you have to do things and muscle can build it if it c if you asked that those legs to do that every day they would get better at it because what the body would then do would be build in more muscle UNK to cope with the job so can you see it what you ask the body to do you've got to ask it the right amount not too much or else you damage and you've got to ask it regularly and gradually increase it if you want to improve the muscle power
now again if you take a good look round the retired people in town there is you just sit down on one of those benches in town and watch people for a bit and you'll see that a lot of them are UNK physically and that is making them making it difficult for them to get about socially shopping wise and so on
and again can you see what will happen
if it is getting difficult you can see what's going to happen they're going to think oh well i won't go to town today i'll go to the corner shop and manage
in other words they're going to ask their body to do less and less and less
and there was a book i always regret not UNK it where one of the people who write on health er made the point that you start with the full page in the book and the outer band of it were all pictures of the world and then it was erm a particular sort of location in a town and then it was a house and garden and then it was a room in a house
can you see what it says
yeah
and that happens gradually you know the person concerned isn't always aware unless they're very have some way of telling
when you retire you see at the moment in your job you will know how you cope with the job so if the job's in your round your house or if the job's ins in your work
erm how are you going to know when you retire whether your physical ability is UNK
only if you've got something to measure it by
you see erm
appraisal
see your skills aren't going to be wasted
you're going to need them in your retirement
er
do we send our to you
chart
you see speed is one thing how do you know whether you're getting slower
er i this is why it's important that you mix with people that you get out and about because if you find that everybody else is getting up the hill faster than you and everybody else is crossing the roads quicker than you and all the rest of it should tell you something now i mean i don't even want to go into competition but i think it is good occasionally to see if you can walk as fast as that eighteen year old in front of you
can you keep up with up her
i mean you probably beat her with a lot of the eighteen year olds you see
but can you see have some idea how long does it take you to go some to one place to another that you go regularly
are you taking more time as you go along
i mean there's no reason why you shouldn't take longer if you're intending to take longer because you want to enjoy the view
er are you feeling in the mood to take it easy
er sometimes i i'm i get a lot a lot of things on i have at the moment an awful lot of things on so everything is you know getting in a p a tight path and fast so i deliberately thoroughly enjoy taking my dog and wandering along in the park
and i'm going as slow as i can go and i'm just taking everything in and i'm UNK i'm relaxing mentally and physically as i do it because that's what i feel i need at the moment and having that ability is good
but on the other hand i don't want to wake up with horror one day when i find that i've lost all my physical abilities because i wasn't taking too much care of them and UNK
again another thing too is that UNK your ego side if you s if you set yourself a little bit of a target and you can manage it er can you run up the hill
can you still run
can you balance
can you get over er UNK un er across a ditch
i c i tell this story cos i think it UNK it very much i expect most of you have er if you haven't been you've heard of UNK in derbyshire and it's this river with a lovely walk either side of the river you walk along the side and then you come to the point where there's a bend in the river and there's these gorgeous great enormous stepping stones
and i went about two years ago on a gorgeous and sunny morning like one of the first of the season you know and the place was packed
and i had t spent a fascinating time standing near the stepping stones and looking at people
because you know they came up they were full of the UNK of spring looking around chatting to their friends and then they r started looking at the stepping stone
and you knew what they were thinking they were trying to weigh up whether they dare go across the stepping stones and you could tell by their faces and what they did of course when they decided no it was beyond them and they'd play safe and they'd go back the same way
but can you see the people who came to the stepping stones and couldn't go across and had to go back the way they'd already come wouldn't go back with a very their ego wouldn't have b been UNK very high
but the ones who'd found you know wondered about the stepping stones and then had UNK up their courage and then had got across safely can you see how they would have walked down the other side
oh all their friends what they'd done
i bet
they had met a challenge and they'd succeeded indeed we all need them
and what challenges are you going to meet you see to boost your ego because if you don't boost it you're going to be in trouble
so this is why you've got to have it
you'd be stupid to go across the stepping stones if you didn't have the power to jump from one to the other pretty big but the so are the distances between them and at that time of the year the river was pretty high too and r rather UNK so it wouldn't be very pleasant if you had fallen in but you've got to have that but you've also got to have stamina as you said but it wouldn't have been any fun if you'd got halfway across and your stamina had run out then fire brigade called out the fire brigade or something
so you need to have the ability to keep going but you can't get stamina till you've previously got s the strength in the muscles to do it
er the other thing you've got to have and very essentially is coordination got to cross those stepping stones if you couldn't coordinate the action right now this is vitally important this coordination it's the UNK interaction of the five senses the brain the nerves and the muscles acting with the right degree of effort and timing
you don't get your timing right and you'd be in the river don't get the effort right and you'd still be in the river wouldn't you
this type of work movement works closely with UNK in many cases these skills are essential for daily living they need regular daily practice in a great variety of situations
now if you don't have coordination and you're then you're in dire trouble
you think of some of the erm handicapped people that you know that's what they lack in their movements are UNK and UNK they don't have the fine coordination so life is very difficult then for them to manage
coordination at its highest when we develop it we say we've developed skills and if you've done that can you see you acquired skills in quite a lot of situations and again that's an area where you'll get a great deal of satisfaction
i mean if you're absolutely marvellous at painting and produce gorgeous pictures and so forth that everybody else UNK not only gives you something to do but UNK again your ego and your satisfaction but you need very good coordination to do anything which requires the skill
on the other hand can you see if coordination gets er UNK in any way you're going to be cut off from an awful lot of things you now you might have been marvellous at UNK it gave you a lot of satisfaction but if your co coordination starts to go then the quality of what you can do will satisfy you will UNK you make you feel annoyed
so again we do need to practise coordination it needs to have lots of practice it is of course frequently affected by certain types of illnesses er and again that may be inevitable but again the more past experience you've acquired and the more the greater your ability to fight back even though you're fighting a losing battle if it's an illness can you see it's going to delay the difficult bit the difficult part longer you're going to be able to cope
that's important and of course when you lose really lose your powers of coordination then you lose the ability to look after yourself you can't dress yourself you can't feed yourself and when that happens it's into a home and UNK ward and be looked after
so it is a very vital part
then comes your stamina that you've mentioned the ability to maintain UNK physical and mental effort notice it's also mental it's not just physical
the staying power having UNK again you say with the feeling of the mind as well as the body
keeping going without distress
it needs regular graded progressive training to build up the muscle power and gradually improve UNK output
that's your ability for your UNK and your heart to get the oxygen it requires from your lungs and to keep going cos if that d h doesn't happen all the rest just goes
er it needs skilled coordination and rhythm to help build the keep the action going developing stamina helps us to cope with work and leisure without undue UNK
so that you can enjoy your hobbies and you know you can take on hobbies that do require quite a lot from you if you've got the stamina
also very useful in UNK in UNK you think of a do you remember the UNK disaster
th the one that was so bad where a man used his back for other people to escape by
now people th people there those people would have been in dire trouble if there hadn't been somebody who could do that
now i always think of that as stamina cos i think that must have been a terrific stamina thing
he must have felt it and he must have suffered afterwards from it i would imagine but he had he had those qualifications he had those abilities and he used them for a
now we never know especially in this day and age what situation we're going to be in and would your physical ability save you
would it be able to even go further and save other people
the you may get by very nicely on very moderate physical ability in ordinary every day life because you can kind of order what you're going to let yourself in for
but if you're in an emergency UNK situation you don't know and would you be equal to it would you have some reserve you could fall on
and it is important to think about that
and then we haven't finished yet
we just ask on that on
what
yeah
what are the best exercises then or the best form of exercise to build up some UNK to build up the heart
erm again this is why er UNK at th at this point became so er popular if you remember UNK er a little while few years ago everybody was rushing out UNK and there are still people who are doing it
now again it's very difficult to say because UNK will not be any good to you unless you're in the right condition to do UNK and unless you've got the right conditions to UNK
for instance the doctors in the hospitals had a lot of work because people rushed into UNK who weren't fit for it or weren't doing it with the right conditions
you should you you're advised not to UNK on tarmac because the surface is hard and UNK and so if you do a lot of it can you see and if particularly if your joints are not equal to it then you set up a lot of trouble
erm it again if you'd only do things like UNK it will build up if you've got the right conditions your heart y your heart and lung ability but in order to have this stamina that we're talking about you've got to have power
now UNK doesn't give power to the big muscles of the body it doesn't do that so again you'd have to be doing something which that built up the power
er again if you're in certain situations you need UNK very good coordination and timing and again just UNK would not do that
er you need to have a much more all round variety of exercise to build up the different things
does that answer it for you or not
a specific exercise is aimed at specific
yes
muscles
muscles yes you've got to er if you're going to build power into muscles you've got to you've got to give the load to those particular muscles and you've got to do it at the right load
this is the whole things behind weight training it's not a thing i've ever done it cos it i would find that boring it's er too mechanical for me
but erm the idea is you give a certain load a reasonable load to a muscle and it will cope with that then you increase the load and it increases the muscle power to deal with the increased load
this is how these men make themselves into all those UNK things where muscles UNK all over the place they look as if they're about to i'm not quite sure they always remind of erm those UNK you know that pop off beach balls they look a bit like that
but that's how they build their muscles you see it's all very scientific and they and they're very dedicated and they know how they do it
no the principle of it is good we could all do with a bit more muscle building than we have
but you've got to do the right kind of exercise to get the effect er and again when you come to stamina it's got to be you've got to have a bit of the all round to go with the stamina
erm and again when i
you need also very much to have the all round development the ability to be UNK speedy and capable of dealing with the unexpected and a series of movements demanding and challenging on weight transference and balance performed with speed and various use of space
can you see how variable it has to be because you've got about everything in there
er it needs a safe level of UNK strength stamina and coordination
it calls for confidence and courage
you notice where that is courage that'll be partly in you
deciding to go on the stepping stones
yes
partly in you know that likes a challenge and you like to step up to things that are difficult and you can UNK up your courage very easily and oth some people have more difficulty
but when UNK it gives a great feeling of UNK and achievement in other words your UNK going to get built if you're good on that
but you'd be a fool to try and get this UNK if you haven't got those safe levels UNK strength stamina and coordination cos you'd be asking for trouble
so
how do you rate cycling and swimming
erm swimming is recommended as about the most all round exercise because it certainly does your heart and lungs it does all the muscles of the body it according to what you do in the water of course i mean if you just go and stand there it does nothing
er but if you are actually swimming and you are using the different strokes and so forth it does use power wise all the main muscles of the body
and it certainly does the heart and lungs and it certainly has erm that feeling that you can UNK and move around in the water so it certainly gives you this feeling of UNK as well
er this is why UNK been taken up by quite a lot there are UNK classes for people who've retired and can't swim
there's quite a lot of those being arranged that's quite a good way of doing it
erm what was the other one
cycling
cycling
cycling
well i thought that cycling built power in the leg muscles it's i mean it ought to didn't it
but i have i i've ever since i've retired i've run a performing dance group of men and women erm who do it for a hobby
and er i have in there one of the great UNK he cycles all over the country he's gone from john UNK down the other way and across the opposite way he cycles everywhere he never goes in car he always cycles everywhere he goes
and he's got the UNK legs in my dance group
now i can't account for that because he ought to have strong ones didn't he if he did all that stuff there
i think the a i think the thing is that i we can't mentally get into realize how to use his body weight which comes from using your feet and getting and the l and your legs and so forth
but in theory cycling shouldn't give you very strong leg muscles
and certainly do your heart and lungs
i don't know that is does much for your shoulders and arms and so forth but can you see that's a that's what it is
some things will give all round but others won't
i mean if you say you dance it depends on how you dance whether it does everything for you because some are very concerned with keeping the body rather UNK like ballet i minimize it you try to pretend you don't have any body weight in ballet you control it
er and therefore it is usually very good foot and leg work and the line of the body er but it's not it wouldn't be ever so good at UNK because it is concerned with holding with holding your body weight from gravity
now to be UNK you've got to be able to let your body give to gravity and then pull away from gravity UNK very quickly er that gives you UNK
so again there aren't many things that do complete swimming i think i far as i can see is the only one that does but then again that depends on how you use the swimming it just cos you UNK every week doesn't necessarily mean that it does do it for you it depends what you do okay
right now can you see you've got an awful lot there to be working on now i've got one more
here it's called awareness in dance call it sensitivity to what is happening around us with the ability to react sometimes at great speed
it calls for physical and mental reaction and is sometimes affected for good or bad by our emotions
you see if you are very angry about something about a situation you know that when you're in that anger it's so strong that you wouldn't notice if something happened right under your nose because your anger is u UNK your brain and your senses
erm on the other hand if you s in some situations er i your anger would could make you UNK aware of something more UNK aware than the other so it depends
it needs a well trained body a flexible mind and feelings that can be analyzed and used
it requires lots of experience of working with other people in varied situations
but that sensitivity in my book is what is going to give you a tremendous amount of pleasure in your retirement
if you've got it to use and you plan your retirement is isn't that if what you're hoping to do
go places and do things
can not super UNK super sensitivity work both ways
you can ex experience great happiness and great
yeah
because of the sensitivity
so it's really your attitude as to what you make of it
mm
and again you see er it's personal choice in retirement and you've got to choose it to suit your you
because you are an individual
you've got a personality a character which was partly what you were born with partly what life has developed in you as somebody described it e we are the sum total of the UNK we've acquired
erm but again you see you could you would you wouldn't want to be a person who was only aware of all the good things and the bright things and the light things and the enjoyable things and were never aware of the others
er do you want to feel that in your retirement you experience the full range of emotions
would you find that something you wanted that you were able to experience the full range of emotions
or would you want to shy away from everything that was unpleasant or difficult
or would you be one of those people who only ever saw the worst of everything because they are around aren't they
erm so they only pick up and they thoroughly enjoy disaster
er and they're very sensitive to that and they pick it up and make the most of it
er they're the real to work with er but can you see the choice
it's going to really be what you want what you make of it
isn't it true though that
pardon
if you haven't UNK sorrow you can't really sense joy to its
this is the point isn't it
there's part of life that you've been missing if you haven't had some experience somewhere and as you say er some of the most beautiful things in life move you to tears
UNK russell said the UNK of happiness is to be without it
yes
if you think about that that's true isn't it
until you've known loss you've never known what you really have got
well i think that i think most of us when you get to this to well not to my age to your ages we've experienced that i think
yes i think you you'd agree on that wouldn't you
so erm where does this leaves us
have you got those physical abilities that we talked about
have you got any idea in your retirement about how you're going to keep yourself so that your body is not going to be a handicap to you
because that's really what you want isn't it
you want your body to get about as easily as possible and be able to do the things that your mind UNK on that you want to have a go at and to make a reasonable job of it
now again you see i there's a million ways that you can do it
but i think another important thing is to weigh up yourself it UNK from you what are you like
you see lots of people find that they w they do best when they join a class and they go to the class it's there every week and th or maybe more than once a week and that keeps them going because they are they're expected it's a definite booking and that's it and they can go that way
other people would hate that it's too restricting and er and again it is if you think about it because if you've got a regular date and you're retired and something nice and exciting comes up and that's right in the middle of your it UNK into your regular date so then you have to say do i go or do i do or don't i
and you can do that you can go
but you see i'm finishing my dance group this year it's doing its final UNK performance at UNK college if any of you are interested on may the fourth and fifteenth er there
now i decided cos i'm the director of it that we finish this year
there were various factors that came into making this decision but one of the things is i'm UNK sick that i have never been able to go away on holiday in the autumn ever in my life
cos i was in teaching so if you know where you were in the autumn i leave UNK college and what do i do
i have to work every wednesday night every week and one sunday a month in the dance school
so i can't go away in the autumn now cos that's just when everybody's start you know UNK to go and wanting to get started on next year's programme
so i still haven't been in the autumn so one of my reasons for finishing is so i can go on holiday in the autumn
i go on holiday other times but you know there is a bit something about the autumn isn't there
which is a bit different and i'd like to see it that's just one of my things but again when you're in going into retirement i think you've got to think about this i mean i went nobody twisted my arm i went into that situation and i've enjoyed it for a great many years but now i'm thinking i'd before i it's too late i want to have a l a UNK in autumn as it were
so i'm going to have a go at that
erm but you will be in that position you may be so dedicated about something that you want to do like i did i thoroughly enjoyed it it's given me a great deal of pleasure i've worked with about a hundred different people over the years that have been in my dance group all ages all personalities we've worked with some fantastic music which er erm we've had to interpret
erm we er you know had a situation you so er we've had moments when you get very UNK with one another because what you're trying to do isn't UNK and because you always blame the other folk
you keep looking at me then
thank goodness
but er can you see you've got to make up your mind what it is it's not necessarily going to be easy
and how are you going to live this er physical activity er again i certainly had plenty of mental through this dance group as well as the physical
there you go again
you shouldn't have then should you
you're right
er and i might say you're not the only one i've got my eye on
on somebody else but er no comment
erm but again you have got to decide what it is you want out of your retirement because you're the boss and it's no good UNK when you're into your retirement that it doesn't suit you because you've planned it you've made the decisions and therefore it's up to you to alter whatever you don't like
now i know that's always dead simple i mean erm one of one of our directors is a great wine maker isn't he
yes
er or is it it's beer as well i think he does all the lot
and all his working life his mind was set on when he retired instead of down doing it you know late at night he was going to be able to get up in the morning and do it
and there he was straight away as he retired into the kitchen and setting all his stuff out and his wife walked in what do you think you're doing
out of this kitchen
so again can you see you have other people to consider if you've partners but that's one of the difficulties of having a partner but then again think if you don't have a partner that's worse cos you've nobody to communicate with nobody to shout at nobody to organize or organize you er nobody ready made to go out with you've got it all to do yourself because your number one requirement when you're left on your own is to get the company and the activity whereas if you if you are er living with a person then at least a certain amount of that is ready to hand
but again people will say don't go hand in UNK everywhere with one another
no
never i mean some people go around just like twins don't they
er that can be bad because if only from the point of view that when you get back you've got nothing to talk about because they were there and saw and did it all you see
and it limits your conversation a bit
er but again if you er something happens to them you're more in a you've no other leads to your life and so you're left on your own
now about getting physical activity i can't say that i can give your a er a UNK method because it will depend upon you
and how it fits into your life i have the feeling that er if i could fix it so that i could do it sort of in the house by the way i could i could do certain things and i could stick to them and i would see that i'd do them
and er to a certain extent i do that for instance people pay a lot of money to go and buy what they call boxes they're quite expensive
and the idea is that you step up and down on those and that's your exercise well you can do that on the bottom of your UNK for nothing
so the bottom UNK is a in most houses they're ideal for doing that
now the idea behind that is that it builds up and keeps in trim the muscles of the feet and UNK and legs which is going to be what gets you about because you realize your retirement is going to be as good as your legs
if your legs pack up on you or are difficult then you it will limit where you can go
isn't it awful to think your legs decide what your UNK going to be but they do more or less so that if you th if you think a if you've ever had any trouble with them you'll realize people say you know would you we're going out for the day you coming
and immediately if you've got leg trouble it's well where are you going
what will we be doing
will there be much walking
will it be up hills
you know and immediately can you see you've asked him all these questions you can see what a pain in the neck you are to all the people you've asked these questions of
and of course it then in the end you have to say oh well i'd like to but i don't think my legs are equal to it
so they can be the deciding factor in what your UNK going to be so it pays to keep them in good trim
now you can do that on the step in fact don't go from a house to a bungalow you give up your best form of exercise now i know people say ooh well when you get older you can't get up and down
you can get up and down
who w somebody said you find another way somebody said that ear earlier on in the talk
when my UNK arthritis was very bad it has been very bad and very UNK and it still can be some days erm i had more ways of getting up and down those stairs and i got up and down but i had to invent ways to do it
quite interesting i could give you a much gr a greater variety of ways up and down stairs than probably anybody
but there is a way you can manage you can do it and the important thing is that it's your body that's doing it that your body that's keeping the exercise going so that when the actual pain UNK when you've got rid of the acid your joints still work and your muscles are still good
and if you don't do that once you let them go you've had it so it is very important
and again you see people fa you've got to keep your arms strong how do you get in and out of the bath at the moment
don't suppose you've even bothered to think about it
but there will come a time when you may have to think about it
now how do you do it
just stand up and get out
you just stand up and get out but h what happens if and when something happens with your legs and you can't do that how would get out then
UNK down turn around and UNK down
that would depend upon your knee joints wouldn't it
can you see
er now what are you you're going to pull something what're you going to pull on with
feet
well again what if they aren't good enough
you see do you ever have you ever tried do you know how you're how good your muscle power is in your shoulders and arms
have you ever pulled yourself up with your arms
put all your weight on your hands and arms
it's no good you see waiting and thinking er and then finding you can't get out and you do need your arms to pull you out but then if it's no good be no good if there's no power they can't do it
and then i know a lot people who now in retirement do not have a bath because they can't be confident enough at getting out of a bath so they say oh well i manage with a shower
now you can manage with a shower i mean it's efficient as regards er keeping you er clean but can you to men there's a different pleasure in having a shower i enjoy both i would hate to h to be limited to one
but er i have to make quite sure that my arms will take my weight as near as one can
erm again when i have bad days with these UNK they just give way and this is not a mental thing at all i mean i could be holding a glass or a cup in my hand or a dish of something for that matter and the er the nerves just relax the muscle and out it goes it's n i don't know it's going to happen but it can happen
usually with something light not heavy
pardon
often with something light not heavy
oh o oh yes it doesn't have to be something heavy
no
th you er i mean if it were very heavy you'd almost sort of be prepared for it to go but you know when you're s standing with a something quite light and you might have been standing with it a little while in your hand and then suddenly the hand goes and can't you see that's ve that's very UNK it makes you not very confident
erm but again you've got to try and think of ways of coping with any difficulties that you've got
it's no good sitting down and UNK and being depressed and saying well i won't do that i won't do that
now how UNK your balance
now we have man er we have illnesses which effect balance of course and your blood UNK one how's your blood pressure
had it taken
we're entitled now you know to have all sorts of things done at the doctors coming up to the right age to be hav to be done er
should be okay on that
but there is this centre which is right op on parliament street opposite boots and you can go in there and all these leaflets that i've got come from there you can get those any time they also have all the UNK they also have all have all the other information and two ladies sitting there voluntary er who will phone up and get you any information on any subject that you want
so if you've got any problem of any sort you pop in there
they will do blood pressures tuesday and wednesday mornings there's a nurse there then
erm lots of information do that's very convenient on parliament street
er there's another one at the back of victoria centre it's on the corner it's the new red brick building and that is a much more complicated more where you can go in and have your m o t done
and you can have an m o t certificate they like you to book for those cos it takes the nurse quite a time to do you
you can walk in any time and get your blood pressure done there
now it is important that you find out about your blood pressure because again erm if that is rising it's putting your
right perhaps i could start by asking you how you how you became involved in the co op movement locally
locally no yo your not wanting side of it
well yes as well
yes well cos you see i mean you see you begin life as erm your shop was the corner shop erm you know the shop was the co op and of course erm we always went each week my brother and i er to the co op for the UNK you see so it was all co op
and then erm mother of course i can always remember was in the guild and erm she would the guild in those days i'm always telling the er people today were very active women very active erm and you'd got them as councillors magistrates erm come forward to all these positions
councillors erm went on to be mayor and erm we even had one as went on to be erm mp you see
erm er so of course there was always people coming to the house connected with the co op educational side you know and erm i used to sort of you kn understand it all mother was the treasurer and sometimes the secretary would come down to see her
and then of course so both sides we new about
we knew about the social side and we knew about the shop was our shop
the shop was our shop definitely and then we got a UNK who went on to be a councillor
he was a club man and the co op had got a club
and the thing that i did say to june once was erm you know when i began to UNK and seeing all the girls in the pretty little dresses and things marks and UNK had just got clubs going and that you know
i wanted to go into their clubs because erm i used to the co op the dresses were a bit UNK and er whether it was just er me or i don't know
but er you know we had simply got to have our things from the co op
it was er you know everything you wanted was from the co op you see
er so i it was really UNK in me from a very early age
but er i never sort of thought about the guild going to the guild erm at all really because erm mother i say was in the guild till she died in nineteen forty three
but from then onwards they were always asking me to join but by then i had already opened a young UNK belonging to the church
the vicar had asked me in the war to do this and erm i was secretary of that and i used to say er you know you could only do so much because we wasn't like housewives today
our UNK was hard and long and UNK and erm we'd got two children to look after and then i'd got my brother who didn't leave home until he was thirty and er you hadn't got the time you know to do too many things so er my interest was the young UNK and it was really a as regards the erm the guild itself i was thrown in at the deep end when this lady who was with my mother was treasurer she was secretary erm she used to come down for me and i know you shouldn't UNK but she used to UNK and say erm you know the voting you know will you will you come and vote
i'd say oh yes you know but still couldn't get me to go in the guild and er it was so strange that the i can't remember i think i've been in the guild about twenty five years so you'll have to do your own little sum
but erm all that time i was running the young UNK and we used to hold a stall in the garden at the garden party at the church and w when you took your UNK in you know th the treasurer would say you know who are you know and i used to say young UNK and then one day i said well you know we're no longer young wives you know we were getting old and i decided there and then i'd had enough of young UNK you know and er because i said i was secretary and i'll close it down it erm the young UNK closed down and er it had actually closed down and this lady was marvellous this secretary of the guild who would kno known mother and she was a councillor she come UNK down you know you th the young UNK has closed and you know you've got excuse
i said UNK i'll come
so i came on the monday night to the guild and it wasn't long after only a matter of weeks before this lady erm she er came back home from canada seeing to some other woman and er she just sat down and died
so her husband brought the case in the guild room on the tuesday night and erm i was sort of UNK in at the deep end because they were mostly older women and they all said oh well you're secretary erm yo i said yes but i don't know the co op dual structure
they said well it doesn't matter you know you'll pick that up as you go along so i was really thrown into the UNK you know
how old would you've been then
er well i'm sixty five you see so i mean i would be in my forties wouldn't i you see
but i say the i'd heard such a lot of the guild and the UNK influence was in walsall wood i think primarily as i'm always telling the women today because they were so interested in the village and you got they were local councillors magistrates people you went to for advice
but the UNK now you see erm don't seem to be they're not at all as active its quite honest
erm but i mean i've been true co op through and through erm
why is
you'd better ask me some questions i think
yes i will right that's right
erm why do you think your mother was so keen on the co op
what was it that er attracted her to it
er i think really it must've been UNK
she was a very UNK woman because in spite of eleven children we never wanted for anything and you went through a depression like you know
the UNK was very important which is why i as a UNK woman erm through i suppose the memories of mother was so UNK in against the dividend stamps because to us that woman who i'd just been talking about councillor mrs always i'm sure no one would mind me saying it but she always used to tell us that it was her UNK and she saved and they brought their house through this the co op you see
and in those days erm i the co op had got a building society as well you see so it all tied up and i think mother you know i think it was a very good shop i mean it was er so
my memories of it i've got i've always got wonderful memories of the co op you see and that co op has been there m on that corner which when it closed a few years ago i went down to see the present executive officer he was then assistant and we UNK against the closing of walsall wood shop but erm course it was of no UNK
i mean i was showing the figures and proved that er it wasn't paying its way but to me it had always been our shop you know from when i was child and wonderful memories you know
i can see i've only got to close my eyes and i can see it all as it was
all men of course there was no women in my youth there was no women
erm we did get a woman later on i think in this little cash desk where the money used to go in the machine you know and er but you'd go in and you would have it used to UNK me that er you'd go in and the dairy goods was all one side and you would you would my brother and i would have our lists and it was we were UNK that we case we made a mistake you know
and er then he would carry all your goods in i used to think it was wonderful how he managed to pick them all up in his arms and he'd walk round to the next counter where your other you had your other dry goods you see your tea and sugar and your fruit and er then it would all be UNK up together
and as i say in during the war years our UNK we were all treated so fairly at the co op i believe you know we were really treated fairly
er i can't really find think of anything else to say only that it was UNK because mother was UNK
we were taught to be UNK
yes
what sort of things did they sell in the shop
what range of goods
all everything
in walsall wood erm as i say we used to have er two big bags full on a UNK friday and then in the week we could go up but you've got your bread but you know yo the men would be i can just picture them with their little all this pretty coloured paper would all be in little piles and when there were no customers they would be UNK the UNK the UNK the UNK all in these pretty papers you see and they knew i mean you'd ask them for UNK and they never sort of knew i didn't quite understand how they could pick by it'd be by the paper you see
they picked the UNK one which is probably UNK and the other one was UNK
you sold er they they'd got these sort of erm the old fashioned you'd see them in the corn merchants where there would be UNK er feed
course i can remember it had a licence a spirit licence before the war
this is the second war of course i'm not quite that old
and i know he was very good to us in the war cos my father was got a terminal illness and er he used to see that i had a bottle of whisky for dad you know er the manager did
er and of course i seen the present managers are th the one you know only just lives down the road here he's recently retired
erm they sold everything
i mean er and as i say you had everything erm when er i wanted coal i mean you had coal erm because after my husband ceased at the pit er that ceased because cos miners always had coal as part of their er it was part of their wages you see
but er afterwards you had coal we had the milk the bread er delivered erm i mean really e literally everything
i mean we hardly went into another shop and yet you see we have a young UNK like yourself who comes to the guild once every year and shows us slides of old walsall wood UNK the local area and he said i'm not very good ruth at talking but he he'd got the slides you know and it used to end up with me doing the commentary on walsall wood because you stand on the of walsall wood which is there now and your co op was right on the corner which is why i call it the corner store and you see people UNK there people met there and when i'd been accused of the we'd been at the college or at other conferences and why can't we get guild members today well that was the breeding ground your shop you see
you would see a likely customer er likely one come in you'd say why don't you come here we only meet upstairs
we met upstairs in a room upstairs you see and this is where you got all your contacts and of course the men all knew you
i remember as a young woman before i even when i was UNK a young boys was there writing little notes behind the counter trying to make dates with me you know erm er it was oh it was more than a shop
it was and yet i'm losing my thread with what i was going to say was it must've been so important because an in that you could get anything you liked
you got your co op on the corner
but you could go down there you could get clothes the fitted made to measure suits
you could get erm the UNK three other er butchers
the co op butcher was had got his own shop lower down you could get everything in that one street and now in this modern age we've got nothing we've got to get on a bus and get into walsall and so this is where it we get UNK because you know in this progress we've lost out haven't we
and erm this is why i say to the co op now er they know my feelings because my husband had only got erm he had er trans works transport which when he retired erm he said well what are we going to do
we're going over to michael three months of the year and there was air fare to find and there was holiday money cos we used to go away with michael and er so we didn't have a car of our own
we got a free bus pass and we used our money to which i'm glad we did with my husband only having a few years
er i'm glad he did have what he had was full you know
but i mean now you see erm i i've got to er go to since they closed central and i haven't got a car erm so i'm not going to carry thing i can't i'm with arthritis in my back i can't i can't carry really only a very small bag so this was
you feel these changes are definitely for the worse
definitely
definitely
i don't know where this doctor had this idea from but i don't know how many years ago but i remember i had my co op news every week and he said that he could see us going a full circle and i'm just wondering when he's gon if i'll be alive when it comes round again because i don't think that these big mass stores erm as i say they're all right you see people with plenty of money with a car they could fill the UNK up
but you don't get that choice you don't er and to me i hate going because the you got everyone seems to be it's as bad as a road really with the UNK erm and i badly miss this over the counter service but er
it's a very personal service then
a very personal service and er i just well i don't know unless you ask me questions what else i can say really
is it did they have a large staff
how many people would have been working in the old store
in the old store
ooh there would be some staff really
i couldn't really give a figure i mean mr he would've soon told you the manager down below
erm he erm i should say at a rough guess there would be at least eight
i should've of thought there'd be eight
and you see the boy would be there with his erm bike with that funny big er cage on it
the basket
the basket
it was like er cage as the basket fitted in and he would go round
i mean tommy who he retired just as a magistrate erm and a manager erm he is in this last focus we've had you know the centenary er tommy and i
i mean i can remember him on this er on this bike and then he rose to be a manager and er as he was i say he was the manager fo er magistrate up until he retired last year
er there was such a big staff and as i say there was no erm the women didn't come into it till the war
not in the grocery i suppose there would be i mean erm as i say i was never UNK with the clothing department and when i did get involved with the deals er i'm afraid i was a political animal and i would've have been more interested in the political side
but i was thrown into this guild secretary business and er you can't do both not when you're trying to erm a family and then by then my son was away and erm i went got a job and the co op gave me a job
the said well you know if you want a job we'll find you something and erm
i worked in quite a few departments in the co op erm and i was secretary to the education er in those days whereas miss member relations er in the when i was there we were just education department with an educational secretary and erm then he we did all the staff training as well
this was a paid job was it
oh this was a paid employment yes
so then i began to be really pretty busy with running the office and then keeping my home but i'd got a husband who was very handy and helped me out in the home you know
this was this was after the war was it after
oh gosh yes
i've only gone since er erm you know i say UNK be seventeen you know it must be like twenty years er you know
i've been up here tw twenty three years and i didn't go out till i came here so i should say i was about twenty two years ago i started back to work
but you see i just went to the education officer and i say he ran it he it was it was his responsibility the UNK were and i went to him about a guild matter and i said oh erm how i mentioned that i was working and he said well where are you working
i said well i thought i'd er the doctor advised me to actually
he said that brain of yours wants working
i said so i've been to a local firm and he said well if you'd wanted a job we could've found you one so i went to the co op and i went in the credit working in the co op credit and er went from there to
it was from the credit that the i went the education secretary his secretary was retiring and er he came for me because he knew i knew guild and co operative work you know
and what sort of things did the education department as it was then what sort of things were they doing in those days
oh well i think it was different to what we're doing now
i mean i'm pleased with the way the dividend stamps are helping the hospitals which is a very good thing but erm i think we did a very good job
you got a very good committee dedicated committee erm who you see the young trainees were sent to the technical colleges and you see erm some of them did go on if they graduated to UNK hall but i mean those that went to technical college we used to have to get the committee to sit in at the UNK
we had to pay the lads their bus fares and er the things like when they went to college
er we were as i say responsible more or less for staff erm and er so we were pretty busy really
erm i think it was er you know a good thing that in a way that it was UNK and made er staff you know training officer and business you know sort of thing
but we certainly did some good work in the education because i think that we erm we used to you know of course we'd got used to use our UNK naturally and erm we used to have a big UNK a big er concert once a year in the town hall and er we would involve all the UNK you know erm and of course we used to always erm fell a bit flat the international day which is july the first ju saturday in july is international day co operative international and we have always the guilds have worked very closely with the international day
and we used to go to town we used to have really good er good day erm we used to have a UNK and erm local course local UNK used to come er i i've got a one or two pictures in my UNK where erm it i was asking telling jean she would have to look up er when we did begin UNK
but i know we my two women won the competition
one went as miss UNK in these old and the other was miss UNK
she was a very little dolly bird you know and she looked a real miss UNK you know in the mini dress you know
right
you were saying you remember the trips
oh the trips was marvellous
i mean i remember mother saying that you see mother had never seen the sea till she joined the guild and they decided to save for an outing and then the next thing i can remember was that we used to have these stamps every week and i think it come to two and UNK erm and for that we went to UNK
and this was not only walsall co op it was the co UNK as far as i can remember because er you know i wouldn't take that for gospel could i'm not sure because i was only child
but we used to l i think i can remember going three times and we went on the train and we would have a big label with branch number seven we were walsall wood and we were always told that you know you look on the sea front if you get lost cos you've got your name and who you belong to on card was all given out
and you make for that and on i on the sand there'd be number seven you see so you could got to UNK for there if you were lost
and we were given this lovely bag you know with your UNK in and your lunch and i think at these kind of things erm were very acceptable and you see it was it was involving people er with the store not just your UNK
you see erm even the erm and of course your UNK i think coming round he got to know er the people he's we as well you know they could save up for things
i haven't heard of the UNK
tell me a bit about him
oh
well you see the we always had club collectors
there was twenty week club you see and i don't know i mean up until recently i was in the credit when we used to have credit
erm the men used to co the women used to come and pay their money and er i used to do the slips
erm they used to call round you see
it would be shilling in the pound i think it was
but you see you see you could you could have your goods then you'll be paying on the slip and he would give you a slip you see
and i mean again he was a contact with you like your UNK
yo you knew your UNK was coming you've stayed in and that is how our local UNK who is now dead mr became a councillor because naturally people voted for him against the conservative because he was someone they knew someone like as came you know
and then of course you've got your i think people made more use of the UNK club which we have got
erm we've got a UNK club for members and i think people made more use of that and then there was a time when i remember er you see even the death there was a death grant
the death grant has been finished quite a long time ago but there was the death grant erm because i can remember you know this people telling me about this
er i don't i can't even remember whether i had anything for mother in forty three and forty for but i do know there was a death for quite a long time
and these are all things that made the co op so personal didn't they really
more than just that shop where you go in you can go all round and wander round and you don't see anybody only filling the shelves up and half the time they don't even can't even advise you where to go can they you know
where can i find this you know they don't even know
i haven't asked you anything about the guilds yet and this is obviously
of your involvement
erm you got involved through the guilds because of your mother's
as a mother
perhaps you could describe how the guilds actually work an and how they sort of how the committee were appointed and what the sort of how the or originally the ordinary meeting was organised
well the er the guilds i can speak now because i've been up to a higher level i've been on the section and birmingham is a very big area
and i can tell you that erm birmingham city council told me this erm that if ever they need anyone to chair a meeting they would look to the guild committees
even if they're sort of not erm involved
but they know these people because you co opted on so i was on standing conference of UNK organisations
working UNK organisations you get co opted on and the we were known for the way the business like way we run our meeting you know
erm for instance you go to one meeting and erm you would just sort of mind you i think probably you may not agree young people perhaps think this is the best way
i've been to UNK hall where they have you in a circle but at least i think wh however you sit you must have a president in front of you in a chair and someone to keep a little bit of order
whereas er i've been to a meeting where you know well will you come and speak
well there was no one no table or nowhere to put your notes nowhere one to sort of say well this is mrs she's come from so and so
well we wouldn't tolerate this in the guild
this has been you know we've always and we always go for the rule by the vote one vote per member and er we stick to our rules
we have our little rule book and we let a woman come into the guild for a few weeks and then she's told the rules
er one of the rules is you must belong to the co op you know and er you must have a pound share in the co op you see
and you must also have that naturally before you can be on the committee
and you have an a g m once a year and every everything is goes by the vote you know if president's there's no time limit
er well each guild makes their own mind up whether they have a new pre if they want the same president year after year or secretary
at the moment i can never get voted out of it you know
er but we're very business like very business like
erm we have of course we've got a we have a congress each year which erm we each guild is allowed to send one delegate and so really we always stress at the top level that erm you know it's you that run the guild you can't blame head office the UNK national executive because you're the ones who send the people to the top aren't you
and it's just as i've said in local government er we only get what you've put in
it's your fault
you've had the vote and who you've put in
but erm we're very business like
but we've found out er that we have er we still keep our programme erm i can show you my programme book
er we still er we have to submit to miss officer
it is one of the rules that er we get a grant from the society
we get our we're very lucky because as i travel ov in the country there's lot's of co UNK as the guilds don't get the grant or they don't get room rent
but we in walsall er i say walsall is west midlands er been very lucky
i'm always UNK this to my people because we do get a room rent a UNK and we get a grant every year according to how many members you've got
and to qualify for that grant you have got to submit two er your programme for the year and you've gotta give the secretaries you've got to give a report and you've got to give your balance sheet and er jean is always i must say very pleased with mine because erm you know we do give quite a lot to charity
we make ourselves known in the village w erm you see we've got the peace movement at the moment and last year er we always have put a UNK
we always march in the parade on UNK sunday and this year erm i picked my UNK up from the UNK from UNK and i said to the vicar you don't mind if i wind some white UNK in this one do you because it was the earl UNK you know
and he said not at all not at all and i said well i do want the people to know that you know we although we tribute to of the lost lives in the two world wars we are now UNK for peace and so i wound a few white UNK
and the vicar did pick this up in his sermon and he did mention the co op UNK guild and so we were very proud that we'd been mentioned you see you know
erm as i say we are known in the village and this is er this is what it's all about
it's getting known isn't it really
if i could just ask you what sort of activities the guild the guilds are actually involved in today
er well er i think i don't think they are so politically activated and this is where you haven't got your forthcoming erm members on committees
you're not you've not got your councillors coming forward and er you know that which i would like because the only way you'll get your get anything is by sort of working for it and erm we are very proud you know i don't know whether you've you must've seen the book you know erm the was brought out the centenary the eighty three and er i mean er there's an awful lot of information there
erm my UNK gone for a minute
this is what happens
about caring and sharing
the caring and sharing yes erm
and actually it does show how they were politically quite active
er you see there was really activists and you see you've not got the women coming forward
they seem as what women we are getting today er just want social er and yet my own particular guild i'm just wondering if it's the secretaries that we're jus it's the good secretary we need of course really because er this sounds really awful of me it sounds a bit big headed doesn't it you know we would we would say
erm but i mean er you know i tried to UNK we get a good programme and we get really interesting no we di we wouldn't like all UNK
we like we have erm a sort of er we have a current affairs and that night we pick up we all have a say on something that's be UNK on the television that particular week
years ago we used to have the w e a UNK and erm that they always did current affairs and er of course we have the different councillors
i always involve the local councillors because at the moment we have a running battle with them over the er repairs because most of us live in council property in my particular guild and so we get involved and s you know what you're going to do about these you know
erm but erm we get involved
of course we get co opted onto other committees so we are involved in with others you know
erm
you mentioned you mentioned the erm movement towards peace that's quite interesting
i didn't i wasn't aware that was still a part of the guild work today
oh well the guild yes i mean first and foremost we you know we are UNK to help the guild
er help the guild is UNK to the peace movement
i we're not i don't know whether you've got we could say we were activists we don't i don't even know who goes on a march or anything but we do our best for anything we support and get signatures for anything they ask us to
we do support them and as i say we buy our UNK we wear our UNK and like this year we put them on the UNK as well you know er we're very keen
of course over the years we've UNK as i was telling someone only yesterday in another club that i go to at the church that i said you know we the co op UNK guild were helping to put water into africa before any of this band aid and live aid was thought about
er we had er buy a bucket of water campaign and we did erm er you know i we went in local shops selling little stickers and it all went to and the wells have been dug and i believe UNK has got wells that have been dug with through the er UNK guild
er we do worldwide we do sort of take an interest but that again is linked up with your co operative international erm isn't really you see
but the you see if you look in the i have information off the birmingham secretary er secretary's secretary she was involved she even was UNK in UNK erm when the peace movement was on between the two wars and that was when they were i believe it was a german woman that er that was on you know in the committee but i'll have to refer to the caring and sharing book
erm er they formed this committee and erm it was in UNK er where they were at the time
i mean they fought UNK for peace but i think that erm the maternity bill i think is what everybody UNK that we shall always go down as being noted for
erm i've heard it said lots of times that whatever else er you know gets forgotten we will remembered for the maternity bill it was an awful lot of work
because we can work
we can we can UNK our mps and erm until they do and because they are UNK to a lot of things that are going on in their own you know till we put it in front of them
so erm and the other thing was the erm the maternity bill er what is the other one that so interests me that i've got my two UNK erm and that is the UNK the cancer UNK test
now that we never get any credit for it and yet we did an awful lot of work
i can remember you see i don't think today's guild women would go around with me
we knocked on doors and got signatures and erm
i have got of piles of papers between er still
what am i gonna do when i move next week i don't know
because er the when between us and westminster and mps to get this UNK cancer UNK test going you know and one of the women that was very prominent in walsall was she died with it herself but she was an older woman you know just too late to save her
but i think that you know we've got so involved we've done a lot of work in our time but now we don't seem to be erm there is a younger element coming in they tell me
i've seen quite a few er in the so well you see we belong wi the guild is fit into three UNK
you've got your er local tier i'm a local guild attached to west UNK society
but then you see we've got a section which is birmingham and then we've got a head office
so you see we we've got a three tier movement you know throughout the throughout the country
er and in the south UNK section i think it is erm towards coventry and UNK we have got erm i can even remember the name of the guild it's we've got a lot of younger women in there and these are younger women that it's very i'm very pleased to see them and when you see them go to the rostrum you can you know they really are they seem as if they're a UNK of the old camp because we we've got to campaign you see and but you try i mean i'm getting beyond it really myself and yet you see you try and whip up erm an UNK movement it you want younger women you see
you want you say your mid thirties erm er to sort of campaign with but i think we really this is what we used to be a campaigning movement and this is what we are no longer
now you see they want a social they want a night out er but they're very loyal to the co op er particularly my o i can only speak for my own guild
they they're tremendously loyal and as i say when they closed walsall wood co op we went to UNK the next little visit
then they closed that
and now some of them go up UNK you know they're very loyal
and erm they're loyal to the society because it they know really it's partly through them supporting the guilds that we are able erm i don't know whether i would get the membership there if you've got you see we pay a subscription to see it costs five pound a year at the moment to be to be a member of the UNK guild which we send dues as i say to these three sections you see
and i don't think if you've got it out of the guilds and say now we've got to have so much for the rent this week i don't think i would have a guild very long because they can go round the corner
there's so many clubs now isn't there
they can go round the corner to the er i go to a church club er and i pay twenty five pence and that includes my raffle and a cup of tea you see
and you see you're competing with things like this aren't you
now jean was pleased because i do sequence dancing which i learnt with my husband and so now this coming september when we start back again once a month i'm going to teach some sequence dancing in the hope that some young ones would will hear of it and join because then once you can sort of get them involved with one thing you may sort of get good numbers
but i think this is the kind of thing that we really need
we need the younger blood because you talk and say well how are you and oh my UNK bad my UNK been dreadful this week and you can't very well ask these people to go campaigning on the streets can you
and comes UNK election time as regards political er then you see the la the labour party would like you to help them because we are co operative labour
i have stood twice as co operative labour candidate and didn't win either time er much to my husband's UNK because i but you see at the time er labour was very low but erm the local people you can tell by your boxes was very loyal to me
but you get the erm the little estates UNK grew round walsall wood erm you see they were all conservative and it was but it was just a straight fight between but he said it was a good fight and er we had we had two
were what were the erm the main issues in your mother's day
i mean were there any sort of political issues she felt very strongly about
ooh great a lot of UNK this is what i say they were when i think of them i can remember them even as a young girl and you know remember them they were all very er they were only just the average working woman er i don't think we had got there again we'd got an extremely good they'd got an extremely good secretary a well educated woman erm and er the whole family was involved and it was one of their family was went on to be an m p
but erm perhaps because i had a good i don't know
but erm the women were so involved they were on all these committees they were you know UNK committees and they er really working they were
er of course as i say they er this was the ma the maternity bill i think was would would've been my mother's day more than mine you see because i mean then yo the woman didn't get the maternity allowance and
was there anything your mother felt particularly strongly about do you remember or
well i think it was the maternity because i mean she had eleven UNK so i think she was very erm able to talk about it and i don't i know dad had got a good job in the well if you can call any pit job a good job but say that the money was decent but i know that she always had to have two doctors and it was it was in those days we were it was good we were in a doctor's club because you know you hadn't got any er the maternity and the and the UNK and pre UNK and goodness knows what that we've got today
so i think if i've gotta say UNK i should say was maternity which you they were very political animals
the walsall wood guild was in particular and when you look round even the walsall ones were like because you've got erm er you've got board members
the first president of walsall society was a woman guild member
she was from russia you see
so i mean you got they were very politically minded
did your did your mother talk at all about the er the nineteen twenty six great strike
oh yes of course yes of course
that must've hit walsall wood as a mining village
yes it hit it hit us UNK yes and you would've this er UNK who showed us slides he showed us erm er you know the soup kitchens that we did erm they did and i think the UNK women were involved with that you know
er i you see they used to work the guilds work more with the political party they worked i'd i can't see my guild women going to the labour party erm you see
er they supported me and UNK for me when i was putting up but i can't see them going whereas i can remember the erm the when i was a child going to the we used to have a UNK and it was a politically i can't remember exactly what it would be called but i know mother and the guild were always there making the tea and got a stall and they were always in the forefront and they'd always got their UNK on
erm cos the guild has sort of this is a new thing we've UNK the international flag and we wear the er UNK which the asked us to wear we at the church service you see but you mainly the guild women in those days would be wearing the red UNK of the labour party you see
er i remember it so vividly because it at our house it was quite er an event because mother and father were so labour and my brother who erm he i don't know why he's not alive today and i can't so i and i've no idea i don't think i ever asked him because i'd be too young but i do know that the friction was in the house because he was working for the conservative and she was the first woman that we ever elected er she this lady did
she was a local farmer's wife and she went on to be our first member of parliament and me brother was helping her and mum and dad you see was working for the we got the house as a committee room and all the and i can remember going with mother we had we had a co op paper or it was co op orientated i'm sure news and i can remembering canvassing walsall wood with me mother well i can't see my guild members doing that
we UNK all round the village you know the guild members did and to get people to take this paper
you know they were really but you see in the in the to modern UNK favour you see these women hadn't got anything like we have today
they haven't got the telly which is UNK the house have they and these other things
er you see wh when i'm tr when i'm speaking in favour of today's women this is what i look at
you know UNK used to come back so UNK with all these slides they'd had and they'd had the local doctor as well
we had a course of first aid so that we were pr prepared er for first aid in the home you know which is a good thing erm in our guild
i always seem to i think we were always at UNK hall that we must it was a must that we have a good programme because if somebody comes and there's nothing doing they think well you know yo i you see i suppose i've got that orientated into guild work but a friend of mine UNK me to go to er a club and erm it's just simply for any age group any sex male or female but you must UNK you know and erm she is a widow and i was widow so i went but you see we sat round and you just there was nothing organised and to me who had always been organised i just felt so like a lost soul you know and er then one UNK put some records on and you cou and you couldn't dance to them and i said oh you know to me i thought wh you know but i don't want to do it i've got enough to do but i was straight away i was looking for the organisation behind it you know
yes
you mentioned UNK hall then and you've been on courses at UNK
oh yes
oh right
so what sort of courses would those have been
oh these courses mainly i've been on is being opening the guild you know how to open a guild how to open you know a guild erm and er i've been on consumer courses erm such as like that paper they just sent this week on what's on i mean that is nothing new they've sent out in today's co op news you know that our own label and all the UNK because the UNK i can remember er being at UNK hall on a consumer course for a week and you see i was on the er when i was know longer an employee i was on member relations you see representing the guild and you'd go through there sometimes and that would probably be a consumer task
i don't rea i can't remember who sent me when on a consumer course
and i can remember having big long sheets and they would take us into nottingham and just dump you at a shop and say now you know go in and fill that in
and it would be you know which tin is the best value which has got the most in and all this
so it's nothing new really those labels have always had the contents and things in you know
erm
i see and who would who would pay for UNK courses
would it be the local society
the member relations as was would pay would pay for you
it never came out of er ha our pockets at all
you see they send you er and of course we always in asked the guild women
i've got a congress fund which i mean today it's getting so dear to go to congress erm you know the hotels are so dear
it's a three day congress er and what we do in our guild we have we had a house party on a tuesday night and she's told me she made twenty six pounds and erm we send our delegate congress with that money you see er because you see er women would not if you couldn't say you could sponsor them
erm that's where the money comes from because er
so actually you think the local society had quite er an important role to play then really in sort of promoting education
oh definitely
i've got i as i say i feel very grateful to the society for giving me the chance
i had until i took the role of the guild secretary i as i say i think i would have gone on to being politically erm but i felt i couldn't do both
er but i went i've been i've represented the society at the big conference of the co op union which is you know each society sends delegates you know and erm er i've always liked this kind of thing
i've always enjoyed it and sometimes i wonder if er probably as i think i've think i said before erm this goes back to what kind of a secretary you've got you see
erm my guild always say they're lucky in having me because i've come back and give them all the information and they seem to be so well educated themselves now you know
erm
did the erm the central society themselves did they did they run sort of UNK adult education type courses there in
oh yes
we've be run courses you know and this they used to they run directors' courses directors' training courses and things like that you know and public speaking you know
we erm of course this is besides the ordinary classes that they take erm now i believe there's doing something for the erm what was the one i looked at on the board the other day for UNK your UNK back you know
erm yes
i wa i was talking to erm mr the other day and he was saying that when he started at the co op it was a very good place to work
yes
erm was that still true when you when you worked there
do you think it was a good employer or
er yes i think so
er but i think really i was probably er you know i was er when i look back erm i was not in the in the er what words do i want
i wasn't in the actual UNK er i wa i've always been more or less a UNK
er i was in the credit and i was with a large group of people there and they seemed very happy and i think we were fair we'd got good conditions
we had erm very good canteen facilities erm i think er everything was quite good
but then i went on to be secretary and more or less you're UNK again in another office
and then from there i went to the grocery manager i was his secretary
and i ended up in the erm my ended my career as the in i was in charge of the stone UNK office working for the funeral manager
so i always say well i went backwards i went to the dead end you know i think i ended up very low in the co op really you know er but erm
did they did they do things like erm staff discount and things like that
oh staff discount was very good yes they did the staff discount
and er you know of course you've got employees on your committee
they've got a very good welfare committee er UNK committee you know
erm i don't know erm how it is like as i say because i i've been left now ten years eleven in may er so erm i really i don't know what how things are with the er with the employees really you know but erm i used to enjoys my meetings once a month erm and i think everybody seemed fair we got and of course according to the co magazine that we have that focus they always send me one of those still and er i mean you've got er we used to have a good football team and i think they've still got a sports team haven't they
and er they did a lot for that fun run and er made money on there erm i think they've kept the image up really
i don't know i think
right
going back to the early days you mentioned that erm the dividend the UNK was quite important
yes
your mother used to take her dividend out did she
i know there was quite a lot of encouragement to actually leave your dividend in and build up interest on it
er yes i er i think i couldn't really speak definitely on this but er you i have said that we you know that this secretary encouraged them because you know to keep it in and even the one woman said this was how she got a deposit for her house and through as i say you'd got a co op building society as well
but i think er with a big family like mother had got she used to like her UNK day erm for erm you know well say save up well it used to come round about may and you'd think well just you know just in time for the summer shoes or something you know
and er it used to be quite event when you saw all the queue and er of course with walsall wood you've got the room over the shop where the guild room was and a rest room i think for the staff
there was another little UNK up above
and you know the UNK be all down the stairs and all down the road and to be UNK as a as erm i in my early married days of course erm i my money UNK er because of sort i didn't really need it
but er in my later as i was UNK my two children erm i think i used to spend mine
i can show you now erm what i bought with my UNK and we had a speaker at the guild er on UNK steel and er he wh you know when they asked questions you said well how do we how do we clean it
so er i thought well he was not a too good a rep because he couldn't answer this question
i said well i can tell you how to clean it
i said in my UNK there is a little and he told you to use white tide and you put a little bit of tide in it once a week
i said what i do is if i'm going i know say UNK i'm going shopping gonna be out nearly all day put it in the tide in it comes out and i can show you my UNK it'll be it is clean now
and it must be i've been up here twenty three years it must be getting on for thirty years old that UNK and er i couldn't have afforded that money for that UNK steel UNK as those days but i had it with my UNK
i can remember that so vividly and it's still going today so that's saying something for british steel erm it was local you know the erm the one at er
old hall
old hall yes yeah and so i think and of course erm i have talked erm i talk in the different clubs you know as i say and i think erm the majority of women usually like this they look forward to the UNK to buy say a major item you know
erm but we were encouraged of course for it to go er as your savings and er something i heard that may be interesting to you er and er he just said to me in this other club but again we were talking about i think we'd talking politics then and we're not supposed to do it was a church club
but erm er and she said erm you know the little we were talking about the little corner shop and how they used to keep open all hours
this is a private little shop you know and her mother kept this little shop mother long since dead you know
and she said it was so funny she said you'd get the so the poorer people perhaps would use this shop and erm and yet she said people i knew in the street erm that were conservatives dealt at the co op where it was i suppose the best buy and they were saving the UNK you know and we thought it was quite funny really
i don't know how it would appeal to you but we thought it was funny
but i think this is i think that i know it w it was the arguments that went on when we were on about going dividend stamps was very interesting i quite enjoyed them and you can you know definitely what came out was that erm it was a bad thing because erm people er maybe it's good if these stamps are going to the co op er going to the hospitals i'm all for it but i'm afraid mine i keep them to for myself and erm er i get so few these days now my co UNK gone but erm you know usually i go and get a bag of er box of UNK with mine you know and er so i use my stamps now erm
you feel that was definitely a wrong move to
oh definitely i think they did
but of course we were very strongly against it really but er because th you know we'd been UNK with all these marvellous ideas of this progress and it's all for the best and everything but it doesn't seemed to have work does it really
erm i must say that on the clothing scene because i did criticize it in my earlier statements er that when i was so young i thought it was so UNK and i was so pleased when i was married and got my own income that you know i could go elsewhere and choose something
but it did and i think there again a little bit of guild influence because when er we were at meetings we would say well what are you going to do about the er UNK you know and eventually we did get this better erm you know UNK
erm you mentioned that the local corner shop sold virtually everything
yes
what sort of things would be delivered erm
oh i should suppose just grocery i should think really
i can't really because we never did
we actually lived in th the corner shop is right on the corner if you've come up high street on the bus and your co op would be on that corner your church and your co UNK on the corner and just turns there and i only lived just down that street so we never had to have it delivered because we just UNK up er and my brother and i can so remember us going with our two big bags you know and we you know how you do when families meet you know and he'll say that's the time because dad we never knew dad hit us and yet you'd of thought he was we were so scared it must have been his voice you know that he erm that we was so scared that everything was all correct from the co op
the you know his tobacco had got to be ready rubbed and we still remember that
but no it was a certain type of tobacco but you'd got to bring it ready rubbed and er you know it's back to the co op you'd go and it wasn't very far
but of course it was lovely with er they used to trim it up christmas time you know and it used to be so lovely
it was a really nice size shop walsall wood was but my sister remember is eighty two i asked her i told her you were coming and i asked her if there was anything she could tell me but er she do couldn't tell me much more than myself
she used to come a long way right from the top of to walk down to her co op a long way
but again it had always got to be from the co op because it had come through mum you see really and er sh i say she is eighty two
but she remembers the co op having its first shop just still in high street but half way down but then they had this prime position right on the corner you know and it was a marvellous a good co op i always thought
they always took your they as asked for your share number when you when you bought something was that right
well a at the co op store
was that right
well we used to er you see you know when you paid you had your cheque
my mother's was five two nine seven and mine was seven five one eight one
and you know you always you er give gave your number you see and er course some people i believe had an a i believe in later days they'd given the older numbers out again i don't know wh you know because some people UNK joined since me have got an older number so i don't know whether they've given the UNK they were sort of long since run out you know
hello stranger what can we do for you today

cheerio just now
hello
well young UNK what can i do for you today
well i was at the hospital a month ago and my blood UNK up a wee bit
so i said that i'd start
oh
oh
right before i got somebody to check
but er what i was wondering i've got to water
you know i'm not my water
he said that it was all quite normal really and
aye
just i've run to the toilet
but i don't know whether it's cold with it during the winter or not i know but
let's check
started doing a bit of training maybe and i've started cutting down eating
okay yeah
and i think i'm UNK i tell you what i think
i was lying on my back i was working my legs up and down a lot
well
and i don't know whether i've stretched a wee bit in here
putting the pressure on
well this is it
and i know i one it because i felt it one day
right
see what this tells us
see if you've been a bad boy
and down you come
ah doing alright
UNK the white coats must have frightened the life out of you some
aye you'd past couple of see me in i said it doesn't seem
i wee bit here and i don't know what it is
they're always
it was it was a hundred and sixty over ninety or something er i what was it now
what's it
hundred and s hundred and sixty over seventy five
but i know that's what it was you know because the wee UNK done it with this special electronic thing
that's right
and er
cos i'd lost about half a stone in weight and i was cut down on chocolate biscuits and i what i'd been doing i was at my tea at five o'clock i was eating another at ten o'clock i reckon i was UNK it a bit you know with the i was trying to cut down a lot
yeah
aye
i would
and i'd lost half a stone in weight
i would think your best bet robert is just try and keep your weight steady
and don't go hard at the training
i mean your weight and your pressure there is er
have you got the report back from the hospital a couple
aye
aye
of weeks ago aye
twenty fifth yeah twenty fifth of march
aye that's right
almost a year
hundred and sixty
hundred and UNK
it's alright today
aye
great today
is it
no problem
that was all that was worrying me
you know i'm saying maybe there's a wee bit of strain in here
and now see
aye that's probably
i'm on my feet
i'm alright when i'm in that position right
aye
i do but see if i'm sitting down
that's right
see them guys in the corner see me sitting in this position
sitting
now i don't know whether it's a wee bit of
extra weight
is that what it is
you get caught between a weight pushing down and the seat the pressure on the seat
cos i'm alright when i'm on my feet i'm hardly bothered having to go for
yeah
aye
it's just this is i remember on my back cos i was lifting up you know lifting my legs up
aye
and one of these i felt
i don't know er
yeah i would think
that was all what was
i would think so robert
but all your blood tests
but he's that doctor he says er just show him that wee UNK and he'll know but

i mean i don't know
och yes
that's right
i mean
and that's it the head and i could feel the UNK
you'll need to get one of these wee hats
i know
bill 's got a spare one
right thanks a lot
right pal right
okay sir cheerio now
first year of business or your first year of assessment you made five hundred pounds profit from your business is that what you've got in mind
yeah
you might have bought capital things a van tools etcetera which might just for example cost you five thousand pounds
now in the in the first year of business you'd be allowed capital allowances on that which is m may well er varies i in the proportion but just say just say it's er ten percent five hundred pounds actually will you make that four hundred
and you get a ten percent capital allowance
for cars it's actually quarter twenty five percent on the reducing balance
so in that first year at ten percent you'd be given a capital allowance of five hundred pounds to be set against a profit of four hundred pounds
so therefore you'd have no liability but you'd have UNK capital allowances to be carried forward to the next year
now that wouldn't affect your pension at all
no
at that stage
and because you'd made a loss you could out of your taxed pension introduce a couple of hundred pounds into the business as a capital in introduction to keep the business running and it wouldn't affect the profit figures at all
is that right
yes
well thank you
would i actually get a tax refund
you could
on your loss if you make a loss
or if that had been yes i if you'd actually
if you'd actually made a minus there ignoring capital allowances you'd just made a loss of four hundred pounds then that loss would be for a year of assessment and in that year of assessment it could be set against your salary or pensions for that year a as if it was a personal allowance
so it would be worth running a small slightly UNK or non profit making business to keep your tax bill down
well yes because
people do
people do
for a year or so
oh yes this is what the big business people why they run far why one of the big business people used to buy farms
he got the pleasure of farming and the losses were merely set off against er
this is what used to upset the farmer down the road
who was a genuine farmer
a genuine farmer
now then i've made oh er before i go into the capital gains er capital allowances you can claim a proportion of the capital allowances on a reducing balance so er if a car for example costs you five thousand pounds you'd actually be allowed twenty five percent in the first year the twenty five percent would be reduced from five thousand and in the next year you'd get twenty five percent off your balance until the five thousand pounds had been allowed against your profits
so it er could pay you in the first year of business to incur any capital that you could afford because you can either get it against your first year's profits or by not using the capital allowances it's available for subsequent years' profit
now then onto the capital gains
could i just say if you're thinking about going into small business for UNK sake use the small business advice bureau
oh yes every time
yes
they are wonderful
i mean you're UNK you've got three interviews free
yeah
and you only start paying after you after the third one
right
and erm a lot of them are retired business men or people still people in business who give their time freely to it
very good
yeah
and they are they really work
yeah
one of the other items of expenditure that could be in this er what did i say five thousand pounds could be the your UNK of your home because you've used the spare room as an office
or a garage as a workshop or a workshop as a workshop
and you can claim that proportion of your total outgoing
but if you've used a room at home then you have to watch the capital gains situation because if it's your residence then for capital gains purposes when you sell it it's exempt from income tax
but if you've used er part of it as a business then that part isn't your residence
so when if you were to come to sell your residence they would knock off that proportion of the total er which could in fact give rise to a small capital gain depending on how the er how you sold because you might sell it at a loss
but if you've made up the gain at all then since it's residential property it's exempt
but that part of it which is used in your business wouldn't be exempt and could give rise to a gain
it's bound to be small if it's a small part of your house
and in all in most of those cases it will be covered by the individual exemption of five thousand eight hundred per annum anyway
there's no real i mean you'd have to be in a real big way of a business and use a large proportion of your house for the gain on that proportion to exceed five thousand eight hundred
so in most cases you can ignore it
but nevertheless we have to say that it's so
and furthermore with the council tax you could come up against the question of business rating for that
the other thing is you can claim an allowance for using your room against your tax that's one
of the things you can do of course
as i say a proportion of the of your total UNK which er related to that room can be claimed as a business expense
erm wife's wages for answering the telephone
the phone of course is an allowed expense
what if you don't use it full time
i mean are you allowed to claim for
well it it's that proportion of business use
i mean you're only using it one day a week
yes
if you've got er a room the re the tax inspector will say well what proportion of the total would you say that room is
and if it's a quarter
and you
what
and if you used it one day a week
well it's a er seventh of a quarter if you
and that proportion is then allowed as a business expense
these people young people often who do some UNK if they take in children
right
is their house being used as a sort of business
it could be
it could be yes
they could alter their tax status
oh yeah yes
if you're s setting up in business as a UNK not doing it as a for a friend for just UNK expense
if you're attracting custom as a UNK you really would be in business
and could then claim
pardon
if you've got more than two you are anyway
you are anyway yes
you really are yes
you you've co you've UNK organized yourself therefore you're in business
in which case you could claim the proportion of the house on expenses
both the house expenses the room and also provision of food and cleaning things for the UNK for because of the involvement with children
you could be providing meals for them i dare say they do they with child
mhm
yeah
in which case they'd go down as well
but it is this facility of er of you determining that an expense is generally for the business therefore it can be claimed so
if you if you go over the fifteen thousand turnover
right
how important or desirable is it to use an accountant
er not at all i wouldn't think
if you're UNK if you're reasonably intelligent no
because all
an accountant will do is work on the information you give him
and he'll put it into a nice neat accountancy type form
but he can only he can only do it on your information
if you're fully aware of all the implications of the tax and what er allowances you can claim then super
if you're not absolutely up to date
oh yes
your accountant is
the accountant will then earn his keep
that's right
but in most small businesses it really isn't worth their while having accountants in
just keeping good accurate records
that's right yeah
yeah
yeah
if your if your total turnover was sixteen thousand then the inspector of taxes would want from you an account which shows how your fifteen thou sixteen thousand has been arrived at who's paid you this money because he looks at those and he checks their accounts to see they've received it obviously that's what it is and wh how is your five thousand pounds made up
and if y if of the five thousand pounds for an extreme example four thousand pounds of car expenses he'd ask you in and say hello what sort of car have you got then
you know
but if it's a reasonable amount say five hundred pounds he would merely look at it and say fair enough
not worth challenging
unless you
if you've got four thousand pound car expenses he might question where you're paying the car expenses to
oh indeed yes
yeah
and whether you should be paying tax on it
that's right
oh yes yeah
cos this is where the revenue gets its information about all sorts of tax
i mean if you're a builder and you receive sixteen thousand of that there's a thousand pounds from joe UNK builder whatnot then the er the tax inspector will make a note and pass on a little note to joe UNK file that yeah he paid bill smith a thousand pounds and i that then should appear in his accounts and if it doesn't then he's a ripe subject for being investigated
so this is the thing you have to have to bear in mind
this is happening all the time
obviously you'd expect the revenue to do this wouldn't you
er the b the more you do in cash really the more the tax inspectors look at it
oh well yes
because the you've no means of proving have you that i mean y er the best system would never be able to discover that er your figure of fifteen thousand pounds cash taken selling ice cream was genuine
except that you do work on UNK
ye oh yes
there is there is yeah
yeah
i mean if you're doing something like selling ice cream
yeah there is there is yeah
they have a lot of people which they say you should make from
you should be making within that range within that
and if you're not they want to know why you're not
but it's only if it's UNK out
if y you know if you're content to pocket five hundred pounds they'll never be able to discover it in fifteen thousand
if you made er if you UNK ten thousand of course it'd stand out a mile
because you've not you're not er in the same relative position as the next
anyway i think i've dealt with that er have i
is that is that good enough
yeah
but taking your point about er you know you've got you've incurred these expenses anyway therefore at the end of the day you're not that much better off than er
as i say well if you do go into business on your own be extremely careful if you are thinking of
i wonder if i could go back to that point that er a couple of you raised this morning about the transfer assets into the wife's name
you raised it didn't you bob
yes
and i must admit it left me somewhat confused
and can i b make it quite clear that if you transfer assets into your wife's name it has to be a UNK transfer into her name
you can't retain control of it at all
and therefore it has to be a separate account
but what john was saying this morning and i think it wasn't with respect it didn't come over clearly to me as clearly to me as i would have liked and i was determined to point was what john was saying the transfer of that if that's capital the transfer of that capital should be made into the wife's account
the income from it is then the wife's therefore if it happens to be three four five it is completely free of tax whereas left with the husband would be taxed
but then what he then went on to say was that since only the wife would be able to spend from that account then put the money after it had been dealt with for the wife's tax purposes into a joint account on which both could draw
knowing full well that a half would be the husband's which would be taxable the other half would also be the wife's and would therefore be taxable if she'd already absorbed her three four five
you don't need the separate account you just
you don't need a separate
to sign that's all
yeah
mm
if she gives you authority to sign on
it was this separate account that confused me
er it did me
yeah
i mean i
yeah
it got me i didn't say any more but er
i i'm sure it was because he realized that if it was a sole account you wouldn't normally be able t a husband and wife wouldn't be able to draw on it freely but as you say you could
yeah authority to sign
she just gives you authority to sign
it has to be a genuine transfer of an asset
it has to be in her name
yeah
erm mm
okay i i'm glad i i'm glad i was confused on that point because if i hadn't been i might not have er
i think he was worried about his ability to get his motorbike out
to get his motorbike out of his wife's
yes it was used in connection with that wasn't it
er well i'm going to leave it that we're very early i hope
i hope you don't mind
i don't think you do but er i really we've
okay well now er i er le tell you straight up
i do said this before hadn't i
erm that erm about erm me father coming down from the top of the ah well this was january the thirty first nineteen hundred and sixteen and er me father had been up to look after the horses pigs etc you know and about eight o'clock he came back and said to my mother that there was a big fire out at UNK me mother and all of us went up there and er we could see these UNK buildings over there and er mother immediately said that's no fire that's the UNK and er that's what it turned out to be of course
so course a bit later we all went off to bed and er well i the next thing i remember were was er me father coming UNK out to me and me brother and UNK us more or less out of ou get off downstairs and get under the table
and er as there were seven of us you can imagine that was a bit of a problem
but anyway that's what we did
and er we stopped there for some time and nothing happened and me dad says UNK
go and put that lamp out in the street cos there's one about fifty yards up the road
so now of course UNK immediately goes out UNK up the lamp and just pulls the thing and it
well about i don't know how long ago but we were stuck under the table for some time and er eventually we could hear this UNK noise like you know and er i was a bit more UNK than me brothers and i UNK out and went out to the UNK an and looked up and there i could see this er UNK in the sky you know
and it knew it was a UNK because that was the only thing we knew heard of like you know
and er then all of a sudden i opened a sort of a door up in there the light UNK down like somebody with a big UNK you know
course i immediately UNK back in the house and told me dad and well and er he says er you can look out for some trouble then now like you know and er nothing happened
after a bit me dad went out to see what was going on and all of a sudden there was such a crash and erm then there was two more like you know and er we heard what we assumed was somebody's house UNK down but it was our stable unfortunately
they'd hit right on the corner of the stable and er me dad went to go out
well we thought he'd gone out but apparently he must have got to the door just as the bomb landed and the blast blew the door backwards er the door UNK knocked me dad backwards and at the back of him we had a cellar but it went through this the cellar door and although it turned round before it went down the cellar he finished up down there because we didn't know this til after a while that me brother wou didn't offer to go out so i went out think to find where me dad was you see
and er the next thing i remember was er being picked up by somebody off this pile of bricks and the doctor told me that it was a gas some sort of gas has come out of it which had UNK me like you know
and er
gas out of the bomb
out of the bomb yes
and er of course i i'd soon all right like you know but er it was at but of course me dad wasn't there
of course i didn't know that cos i'd UNK out with this gas you see
apparently they either found me dad down the cellar or he recovered and come up the cellar like you know
it hadn't really hurt him only a number of UNK like you know
well of course when daylight came and i of course it was midnight see when that happened and early in the morning and er oh there was a crowds of people coming
course we was UNK trying to chip the bricks and things off the horse then how what had happened because we'd got two stalls for them and there was pigs in the one side and the horse in the other one but of course when we eventually came to it or they eventually came to the horse he was dead been killed standing up there like you know and er poor old pigs was all dead as well and as i said about a hundred fell and two or three would been blown sky high
we never saw no more of them
but er i suppose in a lot of senses it could been worse
it could have been the house you see
and the funny thing was it broke every window in the house except the ones nearest to it
and those remain just the same as they were before
but the frame i think was a bit dodgy but it we never had to have anything done at it
so it showed the difference how they put them up then to what they put them up now
and of course the stables that was all it UNK down like but that was only at the most twenty yards from the house
them were more or less joined on you know
there was as shed in between but that's all
and of course the toilet used to be outside that was quite all right all those building
but erm course we er you didn't er think about that part of it then like you know
did your father receive any compensation of anything
no compensation but i mean i'm talking about after government or anything like that
but the people were very good
i couldn't tell you what but they collected quite a lot of money for us and er and er they were holding things there er people were holding boxes at the bottom of the gate like and er
is it neighbours
it well it ought see there were so many people come to see it but there was thousands you know at different times like you know
oh yes perhaps and everybody would come up
i don't know how much they gave but i do know that it came into a few hundred pounds which is a lot of money in those days you know when you're talking about nineteen sixteen
but i can't remember what it was because obviously at that age you don't bother about money do you like you know
but erm as i say they did er the people did but you never got nothing off the government for it and er i've always said it he must have been a much better man than i thought he was because er to go as i say from what it was in those days to start his own business and that
and that he had that house built er like er before he got in it and it was paid built and paid for like you know and that
i think when i think it since i think he must have been a remarkable man to work and UNK like that
he was always at work always sunday
now cos i mean don't forget originally we used to take milk out twice a day morning and night because you had to fetch it from the farm
they got no UNK or anything like that UNK and nothing of that you know and er you'd got a we used to fetch it in the morning and we used to supply UNK in and two other two or three other little places
we had to make and we used to have to take this milk i used to take it about five o'clock in the morning
and i had a little truck and run it down from down into
and er were at UNK right
i used to take about around about four to five gallons which er i could er like erm carry it down there like to them you know and er and then you got out cos in the UNK original days when i first started as a kid with him we used to have to take it out morning and night people mostly the factory owners and we had er had er having twice a day
well of course there was they got no methods of keeping it you see
you were you were at school presumably erm at the time of the UNK raid
oh i when i when i went there the next morning i had to tell all in front of the class and tell all the kids
i did i yes
yes i was in er i'm not sure i think i was in the top class in the junior school and er without UNK i was a good UNK and i eventually passed to go to the q m and me dad couldn't afford to let me go
but er i er i went into from standard four in the junior school to form four in the senior which was standard six
i passed me own brother by in the process
and er i was only in there one year and then i went into form five for three months and i went into the form six
i was in there nearly three years or two and a half years anyway and of course i when i passed to go to the q m of course i used to do the UNK and all that but they couldn't teach me any more because you can only have the same lessons as them that have been taught you know
but
can you remember any of the other things that were happening in the town at the time of the first world war
not er no on that particular night that erm tha that the air raid was
a man had a got killed and there was a man named out at he lost one eye
i can tell you that he lived at number forty one i think yes forty one if you know if you want any confirmation that is correct
i mean i can tell you the names of the of all everybody in them days round the UNK area like you know
but
do you remember anything called the tank bank
tank bank
the tank bank
no i can't say
i seem to remember i you know you try to UNK you brought something back into me mind through saying that but er i can't i couldn't tell you nothing about it no i couldn't tell you nothing about it
do you remember of the UNK leaving at the beginning of the war
well i didn't remember them no
i knew some of them but i didn't remember them leaving like
i ye you know being working with me dad on the milk round you didn't have chance to go anywhere an and that's perfectly true
i never had a holiday for about ten years
not because i couldn't have had a holiday only that er we had loads of milk so we had to go and fetch it from the farms and you gotta have somebody to take it out
well nobody wanted them jobs because it was a seven days' a week job
i used to work seven days' a week and i used to play football
i don't know how i got the time to play
i used to start me UNK on a saturday morning at six o'clock and i'd be still running round at one o'clock and some of these two o'clock sometimes if it was bad weather
some of these footballers now can't play when they're resting all the week
er no
would you say
ooh yes definitely yes i would say you know nobody ever expected they could get this far and i i've heard people say this you know
more recent than then because as a kid they don't talk to you about them things do they like you know
but erm yes i've heard a lot of people say that er they never thought they could get this far
and i mean these were UNK people who i know like since were sensible people like you know
and er really er they themselves thought exactly the same like but they were talking about other people telling them you know that they couldn't get this far but they did
i never expected them to i'll tell you the truth but then again at that age you don't think they ever will or it'll ever happen to you do you
were there any air raid precautions that night at all
any what
air raid precautions
no
not before the raid or afterwards
no i don't ever remember any anyway no i don't ever remember
i as a matter of fact i don't think there was any such things er thought of like you know
but er i never heard of them if they did and er i mean i used to involve meself not in politics or anything like that is the last thing i ever thought of involving meself in but er i did er sort er well being on the milk round you used to see the people in because they come to door to bring a jug you see and you talk to people and you know they were er were sensible and they were should i say soft or had no er conversation at all like you know
but er know i don't think i ever heard anybody think about it or say anything about a an air raid like you know
because er as far as i'd concerned i'd never heard of air raids before hand you know i hadn't and i was as i say i was only nine and a half i know but er i did use to speak to a lot more people than most er lads of that age did like you know
cos i tell you i used to go to UNK fetch this milk of a morning and coming back i'd empty the one can and i had a UNK a UNK in each can an and er the first erm the first call coming back was at that big house on the corner of
i think it's called or something
its on the left hand side and er some people named lived there
i used to leave two pints or three pints there depending what they wanted
then he lived about half way and er one or two more he lived at the top house on the right and somebody over the other side
i forgot their name
well i'd UNK that one can
there was only eight pints in a UNK
and the other UNK
i used to come and i used to go from there just past the top of there was two UNK houses erm who was it lived in the one some somebody named and er and then there was er who was something to do at er on and somebody named who was got a brewery at UNK and they were ladies and proper UNK type ladies at that
and whenever they knew you've come would you would you walk through and they used to for us every time an tha and that in those days they'd give you a couple of bob which is it was a fortune to me at that age
and er then there was a fellow named and then which was works at UNK and erm and erm UNK down they got a factory at UNK as well
and er and that was er go and did this before i went to school
do you remember seeing any of the first world war soldiers about while you were working on your travels coming home on leave or anything like that
no i can't er i can't tell you that i did definitely although i i've heard a lot of them at times but er i'm not sure
we always keep the home fires burning and them sort of things like you know
the lads used to sing them like when er but as i say it wasn't anybody only just the kids round as we played about with you know
because in them days er i think most of us had to had to do some work
you didn't have time to er to go and er and play too much
well i we didn't because me nor me brother and that
i'm afraid i was a bit UNK than me brother
i had to take his part although he was older than me
but er i suppose i had a happy UNK well i know i've had a happy life
i've enjoyed it if it wasn't easy like you know
cos people often used to say to me because i'd played everything you could play except golf and er and i people used to say you did two men's work and you i met a chap one day this was an instance i'm not trying to blow me trumpet don't think that at all
but er i met a chap this one day he says well i saw you this morning taking milk out he says i saw you this afternoon taking coal out he said i see you tonight going playing tennis
and it was true i did and er and i did reasonably well at most of the games that i play but er i played cricket for st john's and i played when i was in the army at this last time and er and erm you know it's i think if you make up your mind and you're fit enough
i i'll put that first see because i was always fit
i never know what it was to not do anything go to the doctor's and be bad or anything like that
the first thing i never went to the doctor with when i UNK off the wall down cut me head open and that's the only and then after i got used to playing football they must've have put a steel inset into your head the way i head that ball
but
did you play any games that were connected with the war in any way
no
pretending to be soldiers or anything
no i never saw lads er the game that seemed most popular with us i don't know whether you have it's nothing only really UNK across the road
lancashire they used to call it and we used to they used to set one on at first and then as he knocked if he could knock one off his feet onto his two feet then he had to help him to knock the others over as they come in close and er i know they don't sound nothing like you know now but er in them days we use to think it was great
only because it meant knocking the others over like you know
but er no i can't never er remember anything like that you know
kids
the summer time was introduced in the first world war do you remember that
er i can't say that i know they did do that yes but i can't say that it er it UNK with us much and i can't er ev ever think of anybody you know wh sort of talking about it like in any respect
no i can't
do you recall any types of food that were different difficult to obtain
well again you see i with us keeping our own pigs which we always did we were always better off than anybody else and er we er we you see when we kept these pigs we used to either buy or breed some young ones see
well when they was feeding these up you could have one for yourself as long as you let the government have one see and er of course the next to feed a pig up see but er i mean if you could fed them properly you could erm perhaps get one ready in er six to nine months you see and er which would be a good bacon pig like if you fed it er correctly
how heavy would that be
well er probably about er in them days they used to call them twelve score and then so it'd be twelve two's or something that's two hundred forty pounds i suppose like you know and er but most of the people er
see a lot of people used to save us their UNK and bits like that
well all these people we would always let them ha when we killed one we would share it out amongst the people who had given them like er i don't say every time but occasionally we would do that and we'd let them have a piece of pork you see which we could legally do see
this was during the war
that's during the war yes and er of course this is the first world war i were referring to and erm the people appreciated this and we used to give it to them like you know
i mean some of them wanted to pay but i said no you helped us to feed them so this were me dad's idea you see he was always very fair minded me dad was
but er we did and we were UNK on a in a numerous ways as well with people who was able to get things that we couldn't get like and they give them us like you know in return
did a lot of people keep pigs during the war
well no i don't say a lot but more people than they did in peace days even then you know
they had but they found it difficult because you'd gotta get a licence to keep them you see
you could keep them a as long as it was a reasonable way from the street as you might say and were fortunate because our UNK had been built years before and they were ooh suitably fifty to sixty yards from the main road you see but i used to laugh at that when we when we were having these pigs killed
you'd see all the kids there UNK through the cracks in the in the gate stand cos they used to UNK blue murder you know and er i know it's er it's
who used to kill them
pardon
who used to kill them
oh we had a butcher to kill them
we always we were lucky we ha knew a man named he lived on and he was a butcher in his rights his own rights you know just like and but er me dad's brother or somebody knew him and he used to come and do it for us like you know
and er he was a good clean butcher what i call a clean butcher you know
i mean in he didn't leave it all over the yard and all that you know
it all washed down and that and we never had any trouble
course the inspectors used to come and examine them you see er like
after they've been killed
after they'd been killed yes
to make sure they were all right to eat them
that's it
is that why they come
yes
they used to come and er and they'd come and er and sometimes they'd oh would want a little bit off there like you know and i'd say oh well the people who's helped us to feed them they're gonna have a bit like you know
but er i didn't believe in well it was me dad's pigs of course but i was there at the time as well like you know
but
how did you manage to keep the meat erm without UNK
oh er we'd got a cellar and it was a real UNK you could er leave it down there salt UNK you see
oh yes
and er not UNK salt
it's the same type of thing but it's
was it just ordinary salt
that's right
rubbed in or
yes rubbed in yes and er of course we'd do that with the UNK and we'd do it with the shoulders of the bacon cos
and how long would it take
ooh twelve months like that as long as you get it dried properly at first you see
and er and yo you can do it to keep it
we did occasionally get the flies blowing them like you know but as long as you get it got it in time and cut it down and cut it up straight away it was all right like
we never seemed to have much trouble anyway
we as long as you could use the shoulders and the UNK the other part would be quite all right oh yes you got the bacon there hanging up sometimes longer than twelve months mm
come in very useful
oh yes and er what i didn't i say i told a lie
i didn't deliver to tell a lie but i did tell you a slight wrong thing
when i left school i wouldn't go on with me dad at first i said i wanted to play football and me dad didn't want me to play football and he said you can't do a UNK and play football
well i went and worked in a factory for about nine months i suppose and the man himself cos it was casting brass castings the man himself says he says look son this job's no good to you i'll tell you that
he says an which he says you've worked so hard cos i worked for two UNK which i shouldn't have done really but that's how i were used to working you see and er he said er i said well me dad keeps asking me to go and work for him and he said well i'll tell you what i'll do with you he says you've worked so hard for us this bloke came from UNK you know he says you've worked so hard for us he said we'll agree to you going with your father er for a month and see whether you like it and if you don't like it come back and we'll give you your job back
an it don't matter who we've set on we'll stop him
cos you used to work for the UNK had to pay you see not the firm
you had to we worked for the UNK at the back
they had to pay you see
what did you used to do
what was your job
you well you these and things see they was all sort of er furniture particularly they used to make a lot of
and er that was in very big demand in those days and of course us being the UNK they we used to have these things
th there was sort of UNK on the UNK and things like that you know and er they had this firm and it was up of course well and it to tell how far it was i had to be in by seven o'clock and i used to run it all the way
not because i was made to be late but i i'd me mother had made me cos she said you gotta come home to your dinner and there was no buses there were trams in them days but i'd got to get into the town
i could i used to run it down and er and that's the only reason me mother would let me but they was pleased as punch when i stopped and went and worked for me dad again
well again i had to do it as a kid but i didn't afterwards but er i er tell you about this chap and i even went back and told him
i says i'm gonna stop with me father and they said well we're sorry to lose you but we know this UNK know good to you and we hope that you'll stay with your dad and well i did i stayed with me dad until as i say after i come out of the army and they wouldn't let me increase me coal trade
and
how many customers did your dad have
oh i er i dunno there was course there was m there was me dad me brother and meself er oh i suppose it's hard to say
well i used to serve about i used to serve close on UNK
what did you used to take the milk out in
was it horse and cart
yes horse and cart yes and er and me brother course we had er bought another horse by then
me brother used to go he used to do erm er this street funnily enough i used to do and er i done down i served nearly every house an and down the side streets
me brother served here and just round there and erm then he used to do erm up wood green an and we used to serve down er we was only milk people who went down
there weren't many houses but there was a few when you got to the bottom see
er when i say a few about twenty perhaps thirty and er of course it was then me brother got the order for the canteen as well see
so it was quite er a bit to do like you know
but he didn't do quite as much as me i don't think like
did you have to fetch the milk fresh each morning
oh yes but it wa was down er ha had it from until they had to close down
that's er where is now
all there
and there was er he used to have some fields up wood green as well that he turned the cattle into
those over still over the bridge like now you know and er where the brook comes through but of course there was no er there was no houses at the back end you see it went right
few changes round here then
ooh gosh and me dad yes he used to do er just a he didn't do too many but he had like a sort of a push truck like you know and he has to go up and that only round not too far and he like to do it i think more
we could've done it really but it kept him in with the people like and er
course he used to know a lot of them round there because there was more houses at the top of than there is now and all round there you know
quite a few old ones up there was even up on the left hand side
er i would say about eighteen to twenty close up to the top
cos they were all small ones you know like some up UNK
i mean there was houses in the street and there was like these UNK at the back of them
that's right
you know you wouldn't know there was houses there if you didn't go up there and see mm
was the football ground
the what
the football ground
oh yes
i played on there a good many times
yes oh that was there mm
but er yes there was er th that was wa was the football club was there all along like you know there used to be that one what's still on but that used to belong to the l n s then they had er a good football team
some of me lads as i told you as well they went to play for them like you know
when they got a bit older
but er
what was like in those days
er it it's er it more or less finished er when you went over the bridge like
there wasn't a UNK of course you must remember this before i tell you see
er there was down and farm was on the right and it went the back where old is around there
that was all his fields you see
and of course was a very prominent ma er the chemical people that was the hunt he was concerned with it
and er he erm he was quite all right
he was the sort of liked to be looked upon as the local UNK
i mean if he saw me or anybody who he knew hello young that sort of thing like you know
and i always remember me and me sister UNK sh they're all dead except me now so er seven of us like you know
and er a lot of them were younger than me but i don't know why but i've lasted lo but anyway m me and me sister we always used to we'd say to me dad when we went to fetch the milk with me dad
course we were only kids ourselves like you know
so shall we go and sing a carol
so we went this one christmas i'll always remember it
and er dad was at the farm and we there were ba UNK that went up to the house see
so we went which was the UNK to started UNK singing once in royal david's city you know cos i knew he liked that
and er he come to the door
can't you read
yes well why are you singing carols
well it doesn't say anything about singing carols
it does on the front door he said
i says well we haven't come by the front door which we hadn't of course
we'd gone round that back door
he opened his and gave us a couple of bob
anyway i always remember another one at the same time that same christmas
we went up to erm top of and er we earned mo more money in carol singing we had in anything else
and er we went there and knocked the door
we started singing a carol
er what the UNK did we sing the first noel i think
well we finished that and the door opened and er do you know once in royal david's city
and i said oh yes mr i said know all the carols
me an me sister we thought we were then he says come inside and sing it for our somebody you know
i don't know what his name was but i was only a little kid like you know we sung that he give us half a crown each he said do you know on the i said oh yes
he said would you put this card through the door for us
we've forgot to send them a card
so it give us another shilling each
i mean it you know us kids i mean this was a fortune to us but i don't mind telling you me dad had it off of us when we got home
says that's gotta go in your box
you said wasn't cut through
oh no
that's right
what was there then
it was just fields
was it
that was were they use t and it had turned off down er down where it is now er down there
we used to serve all those houses down the bottom there round there
UNK and there was more than there is now like
and er then t to the brook where he it is now
you th cos the railway men used to make the path cos the terrific amount of railway men used to work down at and most of our round UNK of railway people and most of them had come up from wales and places like that
but anyway er you was saying er th there then was a path which went eventually up to erm the UNK head on the and there was a path across those fields all the way a walk up there
we used to go and walk round there a
so you could walk from right round
yes right to and you could even go on farther but i don't think i ever went any further i didn't have time
but yes that was what wh what it was
and they were all open fields across there
yes and this path was at the side of the fields like you know that went just on the edge like you know
they ne they didn't nobody used to well as far i knew nobody ever caused trouble in the kids in like in on those sort of things
i could do me own UNK of er playing about like you know
like tying a bottle on the door and sticking it on the window and knock the door and they had to come crash the bottle would go
used to think that was a glorious but er not what they do now like you know
i mean like some of the kids do now i think it's terrible you know
but er yes that was that wa tha that finished there like er that was the finish of the of all the traffic there until th course you can't UNK it now without being UNK
but erm
what was the bridge like itself
well it looked very similar not quite as good as it is now but er it wasn't no where near as wide of course
it was like on only the one half roughly about what the bridge is
but it was in reasonable condition like you know
but certainly not good condition cos it wasn't used by much of course being a dead end see
mm
what about the centre of the itself
what was that like in those days
it ooh yes it was quite busy it definitely was busy and but er it was in very similar in what it is now but the shops were all different like you know
i mean they people er the UNK for instance they seemed to be there for UNK at the far end towards i mean er and then there was half way along on the other side and
what sort of shop was that
they were both UNK those were
one men's and one women's
no they were a both men's
i don't think women had their hair done then did they
not that i can er remember
the first UNK was some where up where there is one now where and whatsername is now i think erm i do whatsername towards like you know
er cos his mother lives down now i think yes
well tha that was the th the first UNK as i can ever remember
was there a shop
there was a UNK a UNK on the corner of erm of itself like
a pretty big one
a chap named ooh harry he used to keep it for a long while and er then of course th the post office was on the er opposite side of the road to where it is now
that was about the i would think the fourth shop from er UNK like that
because er i used to serve them with coal and miss her name was and er th there was erm a sweet shop about tow by that fish shop which was er a fish shop even in those days fish and chip shop even in those days
i'm talking about opposite what they call you know
and er there was a bloke i used to play football
i don't think he played for walsall but he played for UNK
he was quite a decent UNK quite a nice chap really
and er then there was a fella named he used to keep the sweet shop and it was a sort of a high class sweets like you know
they used to it were very nice shop in those days and er then of course the next door to that fish shop the other half going towards was
these people who lived in ha they had a shop in as well
they had like well for the sake of saying pigeon co for food and even poultry food like you know such as er well they used to call it UNK and mix it up like into a UNK you know
but er that was there though with their affairs
then was next to them
then there was a the paper shop where somewhere near where it still is now
and er ooh what was the name there was a grocery shop and then there was a UNK right on the corner of erm er is it called that leads off in into it only a short street there's no houses in it actually
well that was then that was another UNK er place like
when i say UNK cakes and things like that you know
oh there was quite a few and then on the other side there was er the old reading room where the erm er building society is it now what's there
and oh on the corner of there was er ti whatsername er what do you call them these things what sell curtains and stuff like that
UNK
UNK and things like that
oh that was there for years UNK years when i can remember when i was at school going to school and it was still there quite a number of years after i left school
oh that's all right
oh yeah and this chap inherited the money off his mother and father and er i don't know whether he drunk it or whether he UNK it away but he lost the business so that and that was the beginning of the breaking up in my er opinion of the UNK shops like you know
do you remember the trams going down
oh yes i wa as kids er i used to i could always get in with the UNK
i of course i suppose going round with milk i'd perhaps got more confidence th cos i had to take milk whether i wanted to or not see and we if we got down there and there was two or three of the UNK down the UNK and er jump on a UNK bus cos i'd got to get to like you know
so er you can ring the bell for the custom er people to get off and on like you know
and i had but i was soon off when i got at well just past there to pull up there
but you could jump off them while they were going so i an
very slowly did they
well not too slowly no but er they er they er kept on going like there was a continuous flow of them you know all the while
aye they seemed to be following one another up the road
but of course nobody had cars you see in them days
that's what you've got to think of
and er we oh usually i could get on there for a you can get erm i think it was a four way ticket for threepence down the town
i don't know whether it was a return i forgot that but er it was it was four for four UNK for threepence and er that's if you're down the town you know that's quite a few really for threepence
and er an and as i say i had like this was only coming home from school like you know
but a another one they used to call a UNK i can remember that even now
she was very pleasant as a matter of fact
but cos i knew a lot of the UNK the drivers because er they were local people like you know
one or two lived even the top of on the other side of the road houses are down now but er there was there was three UNK which we call cottages which er much smaller than the others but they were still very useful and UNK to there used to be a chap named oh UNK but two
there used to be a chap named they used to work on th on the trams and they used to used to seem to work in families like you know
they had er perhaps two UNK on the trams and UNK follow them like you know
ah then they er these sort of jobs seem to run in families
but er ah yes as i say there was some happy times and there was some UNK times no doubt
this is oral history project tape number two of mr jack of

well you learnt about the technique with the mares when you were trying to UNK them didn't you
ah
you learnt about the weaning techniques
the what
weaning
UNK

weaning
the weaning as a the game would be weaning you know
some people leave it late you know
they even get big UNK you know
er well i tell you interest of a stud is to know one another and to wanna know your stud UNK where you send your mares
see i used to i never took a UNK away wi with me in foal to foal down at fo away you know to be coming away without i had a to a UNK head collar
well that head collar represented that stud groom
when that foal was born we did put he head collar on it you see
well er stud groom we used to pay them pay one another you see
if you didn't do that they wouldn't do it for you they wouldn't pull them for you wouldn't do anything
wouldn't pull them
pull them no
what d'ya mean pull them
well th the first time you lead a foal get up put a head collar on and foal them
put the UNK on it
they rear and fight
yeah
at you know
er we used to do it out in the muck yard
get them in the muck yard and th you see when they used to do that they used to fall over you know they couldn't hurt theirselves
see they used to hurt their neck
put it through a ring you know
had
and
them
and pull
let them pull a cow collar wi it was what they call cow collar learn the way to learn them
and then lead them with this to come with
most UNK you had to lead your foal and lead your UNK
see
that's how you're taught
so you got a er your UNK in one hand and your foal in the other int ya
lady james you had to come over a water bridge at er her stud
UNK and foal over a water bridge
out of one paddock into another
did that create problems
yeah
yeah well they was used to it

mhm
what did you do there
well when i was taking mares down into
yeah
they had the UNK down there then you see they had UNK at the stud

i took six to ireland one year
and was it six i took or four
four
four was it
and er i never had to leave them
and the valuation was two hundred and fifty thousand
the valuation of them
and you had to stay with them all the while
UNK that was stud
whe when you went and you didn't have to leave them you know
you was insured not to leave yo wha you i was in charge of them horses you mustn't leave them
so could you could you
they was in box so i've had to go and get my tea and my grub
cos of the insurance people used to creep about see if you was in the box
and if you wasn't in your box and anything happened you wouldn't get nothing
so what happened if you wanted to pop to the loo
what
what happened if you wanted to pop to the loo
oh
you have to do it inside the box

you had to stay with them
yeah
literally
yes you
twenty four hours a day
cor
ooh
daren't leave
no once you take over a job you take over a job
ah yeah
do they still do that today
what
well er some places are very strict
these UNK places i should think they do
very strict
especially mares and what they've got er today
the valuation of the mares and UNK stud i should think so
they were strict enough when i was in when i flying never mind about anything else
talking about flying the horses was there special preparation for flying them
no you just had your stalls
used to we used to put five UNK in a er take them like two stalls you take the middle stall out and the top box you used to get five UNK in
see the we used to work with the five
the closer they are the better they were you see they couldn't kick they couldn't roll about
got me
yes
and er that's how we used to fix everything in like that you see
i've been the top middle down bu UNK down
i was at the top end one and all the UNK come through the door paralysed me
and then at the back end you get the you know
what
er the in the aeroplane you wanna be in the middle if you can get in the middle you're
yeah
alright
yeah
you come you go to ireland and you might come in on a lovely sunny day like this and you get half way over and you've go yo you think jesus christ has got hold of you
yo you've got go get in them air pockets
yeah good job you've got hay ni you've got hay net on at each horse you know
i used to sit the sit against the wall and hold onto my hay net
cos you never know when you're gonna drop into these pockets you know
don't half give you a ti
yes
you know you think it was gone
mm
what did the horses do when you hit an air pocket
they just UNK you know they some of them kick about and some
mhm
goes up rough
and wa and one or two bad journeys with them when they've got out and everything got over the top
what in the aeroplane
oh in aeroplane
oh yes
what d'ya do then
well get hold of them
give them the needle quick
needle
give them needle and put them back in the stalls again
what an injection of so
injection
wha what do you inject them with then
well it keeps just keeps them quiet UNK
what
ju
UNK
sends them UNK and open the door and put them back in again
well they get over the top we had them over the top hanging over the top
they hurt themselves
well er course they hurt theirselves but they're that's their that's their look out
as long as we can get them inside we don't want them outside do we
mhm
oh yes
well terrible we've had some been some funny things
we've had UNK get out and everything
terrible things we've had
well you'd be surprised that's why you have cow UNK
you have them big cow UNK all ready for them you know
hold them down
they want UNK and all that they want to rear you see but so long as you get them settled and stand on them do anything keep them down
oh it's not all easy
you don't think it they're up there you're flying in UNK
you're not
not easy
do you stay with the horses all the while u in the flight
yeah
yeah
yeah
the young girls fetch the grub along
the girls fetch the grub along
and er to er well you know i could tell you some UNK about them
er on th on the on the big planes you see like when what we used to take twenty eight twenty eight out to
mm
UNK kong and UNK and all them places
we used to twenty eight there used to be two UNK madam and gents you know
and these UNK you know they're only just tall and ordinary you know well they they'd got black UNK got UNK on you know all wore UNK
and they says as soon as you see one coming you sa say can i got make your bloody mind up which one do you want
they're all the same the UNK
you ought to see them
oh dear
this is a good a good
they were good to us them UNK
they were tough sport they loved it
you know come down and touch they were always wanting to be with your horses
give you plenty of grub
look after you
soup come
ma myself of course i was married
do you know i i've come i've come away from luton stansted at times cambridge especially when i've come down perhaps half a dozen UNK
half a dozen UNK you see when i've got in and haven't been you haven't been in the oven haven't eaten UNK fetch the home lovely
you can bring them home
UNK yeah
too true
bring the home shove them in the oven
UNK
cos all that UNK drivers used to ask for them
did they
yeah but with us on the plane they had a privilege you see
you would wanna take any grub with you see
we had a privilege
but the UNK drivers used to always ask for them
cos they didn't want it to go bad you see
mm
oh yes it was lovely
it's most interesting i found it
a bit nervous at the start i was i di hadn't been in aeroplane you know
not with horses
only my son
but i hadn't on with the horses
that's the going up but once you're up
but once you're up you look see then al you're alright
easy as UNK your eye
i don't mind now
easy
and then another thing yo you also there's tricks in everything
now if you had two horses up the front you see th their heads are facing this way the engines th UNK er two engines you see and they all put UNK up first you know
always send one engine off first you see
well the shadow of these wheels going round like that this is what we learnt al that's what i learnt anyway shadow going round like that keep marking on the walls and the sun don't they
so they always used to say if you ever get two up the front take your coat off and cover the windows up
so th they don't see nothing then
you learn all that
mm
cos the UNK frighten the horses
yeah
mm
mhm
and the row of the engines see
yeah
