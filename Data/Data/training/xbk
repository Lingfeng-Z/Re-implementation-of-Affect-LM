you'd do your animal get your next one out
and you always worked by time in stables you'd get out at say you went at six o'clock you got out till seven and were out two hours that's seven eight nine

that's what we was always getting for seven days a week
seven days a week
yeah

d'ya you know like er normal workers have a union don't they
oh yeah
oh no not in them days
no
we had we tried a union here years ago we couldn't get on with it
UNK
half in and half out
no it was no good
i don't believe in them myself
don't believe in i said er couldn't do anything
and i couldn't say nowt
you mustn't condemn them you mustn't do anything you must just sit quiet and say nothing
yeah
no but the people wo la wouldn't realize it
i'll tell you when i was i whe when i was when i was head man for sammy i was only getting fifteen quid a week and my and my house
oh you had a house
yeah
fifteen quid
yeah
they're getting two hundred a week now
mm
two head man gets two hundred quid a week now
and part and part
does he still get a house
and ten percent of the wi er th er the bonus of everything in the UNK
yes
cos without the head man a trainer can't train horse and i'm telling you that for nothing
my UNK told me that
what are the duties of the head man then
what
what are the duties of the head man
well the head lad was a er the head lad had to see the head UNK er job was to be there first in the morning and the last off the place at night
first thing in the morning he'd UNK the doors lock it up he'd been there long hour before the men did
go round
yeah
but you see he'd have a list of the horse who's gonna work or win races well if them animals didn't eat up he didn't work them
you understand
yeah
he went back some horses left a bit in their UNK i used to have to put all that down nothing verbal all on paper
see
and the lads used to come they used to do in them days you know they wanted to go out in the country to get a bob or two
cos er i used to say to them i know where they've eat up or not i do and we've got them
i'd say eat up boy
yes
i never used to say that i used to keep my mouth shut and say put a cross against his name see not to be trusted see the you've gotta do it yourself see
go round and that's how you find them out
and that's how you train horses
that's why trainers are good to everybody
see
mhm
like reg 's good to me
let me see
but 's lads you can't train horses you've gotta tell them tell him everything exactly
yeah
that fella up at UNK i should he must be getting a fortune
he got hundred and forty one horses ten percent
and ten
yeah
and
erm
half the lads doing his work
they don't say nothing
in your day how many horses would you have when you were head lad
you had to do it yourself
but how many horses would you have in your yard
well about seventy five i had at 's
mm
er the most we had at reg 's when i was up there is thirty five forty two
mm
that's all the UNK hold
are yards bigger today than they were do you think
down there well he's got hundred and odd ain't he
look at the boxes he got
mm
oh yes
at 's i had seventy five at 's he had two yards
oh yeah
were you responsible for working out the amount of the feed that the
yes
animals had
as to an ounce
re reg er say we had er say twenty ton o twenty ton of oats come in and we soon used them up before the next lot i'll start on the next lot he the sample UNK come in you know sample in come them oats he'd come up perhaps when they come in check the first two or three sacks with me you see and then i'd have to get a rubber get a bowl full of oats bowl full of whole oats put into the rubber see and get a bowl full of whole and put them through the UNK and UNK the main like you know like we used to have just squeeze them you know crack them
mm
weigh them both see weigh them both
every UNK done by weight
when you've filled his hay UNK up you give him ten pound of hay
ten to twelve pound of hay
then you knew what he was eating
if it was good hay that was as good as two bowls of corn
was it
oh yeah
you get some good hay
you get good UNK hay or good some mixture good sand a bit of sand with it is good hay
yeah
as long as it's good
earlier on you mentioned a rubber
rubber
can you explain what the rubber is
well the UNK a well you call it a UNK you call it a UNK it's a rubber
we use them as UNK
see
we use them as rubber and you hold them in your arms alright
and you hold them in your arm just see the wa i mix them up in the feed i mix the feed up with some of it and then tip it into the rubber you see
and they carry them in the UNK and put them in the UNK
why is it called a rubber
well er well they were they always was UNK since they was it's UNK it's a UNK actually
i in fact half the rubber you cos yo unless you order them and buy them like we used to buy them in some big packets but erm you buy them in a shop you buy them and they've got UNK right across the middle haven't they
same one
same sort of thing
mm
only on a bigger scale they had them made on a bigger scale you see
i haven't got one now to show you now
i used to have one
called UNK
yes a set of tools consists of that's what you want now
and your set of tools used to consist of what you what you give the men it consists of UNK brush body brush water brush UNK and a UNK
and that's a UNK for picking horses feet out with
if you don't look after their feet it you which is very important indeed you see
see UNK picked out properly before he goes out exercising and when he comes in exercise
see
now some people don't wash them er horrible george never washed horses feet out
understand
mm
and when they picked us out they used to put the rubber on the ground pick the dirt out of their feet and put it into their UNK not throw it away put it into their UNK because horses love to UNK mud
love to UNK it
see if you go out hunting or anything like that and you don't that animal will love to UNK that mud off its off its feet off its UNK
see
some animals you cut UNK of little bits of UNK out and you put in the in the corner of the box and they UNK that and UNK themselves by eating it bit by bit
another thing we do you'll give them rock salt
you can have it in on a block or and put it on the floor a lump and put it on the floor
buy it from boots as we did
mhm
or otherwise you buy them in blocks and screw them on the wall
high blocks they're called you know
UNK them you see keeps them people er farmers use them today chuck them out in the field
yeah
for the cows to UNK see
like a brick
they're like a brick that's it
haul that and the they run down when you feed you see well you sa and you exercise have you did i give you exercise
no
well you we come in the mornings you start about six o'clock you see
start the morning about six o'clock and you muck out dress your horse over make him ready we call it make him ready and you turn out at say quarter to seven
when you say dress your horse over you mean groom him
groom them
that's right
groom them
you groom them
see we call it dressing them over you see
er you get ready and yo by quarter to seven the head lad see goes and walks round and he says oh eh okay come on get a move on we wanna be out
well you start getting out so that you leave the place at seven o'clock
the horses are walking round in a ring then
all your horses are out put your men up they walk round the ring and at seven o'clock you move off to the heath to train your horses
well you know practically the governor or the head you see he knows what he's gotta work but erm i know because the lads don't but he generally tells them well i wanna work so and so and he gives me a bit of paper with the horses names on wants galloping
and soon as he said UNK jack take the UNK off i'd take or the little lad helps me as well you know and he takes the UNK off and then i tell them what to do you see
some are five UNK some seven UNK a mile
some are long distance horses you see you train them all separately
not all at once
you do the five UNK first and then your long distance runners see
your two year olds don't do as much exercise sometimes as the old horses do
old horses want more time and le than two years olds do
cos they don't want the time they don't want two hours dragging about on their legs
but the old animals must have it see like th for fitness
oh
don't hurt them
and when you gallop them you put the UNK on and you walk them home quietly i if it's a nice day like this you give them a pick of grass in the paddock
ten minutes in the paddock pick of grass see
turn
then
them out loose in the paddock
ye in the paddock yeah
just le UNK you're leading them home so let them pick a bit of grass and then you go on into the yard and i'll give them the breakfast they have their breakfast and while they're eating their breakfast you're doing your horse and you get finished and then you go and have yours
and you come back again and you get out again about half past nine ten o'clock
see
what's this with the second horse
what we call a second lot
and the second lot er is er not much galloping
sometimes you gallop them se if you don't get them all in first lot it all depends on the jockeys if you get the jockeys or not
but then you don't yo they're not so important the second lot as what we call well you call them spares we call them spare in the stables you see
today they got so many horses like UNK got hundred and forty and 's hundred and forty well so you got three lots you can't do it
he th they they're not finished here till one o'clock and after you see
they also must have the time must have the exercise
you can't win races standing in the stable you gotta be fit
yeah
er
and you go on from there er you've mm we come and exercise they do their own they sweep up they sweep up and then carry on with their ordinary routine of every day
they er you take it in turns two of you go out and cut the UNK see
when you what they clean the horses with cut the UNK cut the green UNK up and then all ready
you feed them half past twelve whatever it is twelve o'clock and then they go home and you come back again at half past four
then you start at half past four i'll go round and give them a bit of tea all of them you see if they've eat those that's eat up horses eat up give them a bit of tea and then the lads start on them and they dress them over till they sa well say we give them till six o'clock wa to do two horses
and then i'll go down and ge for the governor and say alright governor
all ready
and they have to show their horses all the way the governor walks all the way round the lot of them
see if they're alright
feels their legs feels their bodies feels their skin pulls the you know all sorts
all sorts of tricks what they do
what's he looking for when he's feeling the legs
well see if there any trouble
filling any UNK er anything the matter you see
i have i go round first i report all the UNK one and i report all the good ones you see but i go round them all before i go down to see him
mm
as soon as th they're finished i go round them see
as they finish so i go round their horses and then i've gotta go down and report to him
so and so's so and so's UNK and so and so's got a big leg so and so caught UNK this morning had an UNK
an UNK is you know what an UNK is don't you
front catch a bit off the front
when the back one catches the
that's right
front one
that's the front one
and i or the speedy cuts
that's where animals go over the iron legs cut inside of the UNK
you see
you report all of this
and he looks for it when he comes round you see
but he don't worry about it cos he knows th er it actually happens you see all i've gotta do is keep them clean
mm
it's my job to keep all the UNK clean
and dress them you see
if it's a UNK job well i have to send for the vet
understand
would you call the vet in often
er you wouldn't call them in for the petty things
not better things you know UNK what to do yourself
you will know
mm
but you always leave it to your governor
but if your UNK away never trust nothing ring a vet
understand
mm
if your master's away at the race meeting and anything happened to a horse i don't carry my UNK i don't do it on my shoulders i go and get a vet
the UNK responsible for it
see and one way it gets me out of my trouble
mm
and the owners are pleased because the UNK seen it
you understand
yeah
UNK the owner
the owners have to re know all this you know
the owners ought to know all this and yo your governor
well i suppose ringing them up and telling them how they've been going how they're galloping how they don't gallop
it's all ra mm it's hard it's not easy
would you fill out a report sheet at the end of the day
yeah
oh yeah
oh yeah
you can report everything
put everything down
if you go to your master's away cu say he's gone to race meeting and it takes two day they're going to be up at say UNK more likely he goes for the week
see
we get all i all he comes home we works the horses in the morning and goes and stays you see overnight and
mhm
everything
i have to do all that
i carry on with the horses working the horses and then report to him by phone go in the in the office and re he's there at the other end knows what time i'm gonna ring him up
he's there and i can ring him up and report to him when he er how they've gone how they're feeding how they're doing and how they're not
just to please him you see
and he's satisfied
he lets the owners know whoever asked him
well my head man's told me that everything's okay and he's eat up well this morning and he's doing well
see
so it's very complicated but it's er you've got to do it
see without the head man the trainer couldn't train horses without a head man
or the travel head lad
see they travel half the morning
it's alright it was you UNK your microphone
after did i
aha
after er i've done with them the travel head lad takes over he does all the UNK the UNK the race course you know
does all this work
what when they go to a race meeting
when they go to race meetings
he's got all the UNK his job is to look after all the colours of all the UNK
what the
see
the racing colours
the racing colours
the UNK
and
yes
see they're washed and cleaned and everything if they get dirty or rain or wet
and erm he goes say i say we've got a runner today UNK but erm the UNK gotta go he's gotta go into the weighing room wa well he's get his form fill it in the weight he's got the jockey who UNK him that's gotta be erm forty five minutes before the race
but they generally put them in early about half past eleven you know
erm because you've got all of your orders and the if you've got UNK you've gotta declare UNK
understand
mm
all tha you've gotta de all that's gotta be done on this paper otherwise you'll find all the your animal don't run
well you've gotta declare apprentice if you have apprentice rider and you've gotta declare what weight he's carrying whether he carries five three or seven
it's all
what
weight
five three or seven pounds
weight
no they claim that
well they claim that you see
some apprentices claim seven some claim five some claim three
see the more winners you ride the less weight less you could claim
see
say you hadn't UNK a winner well you get full eleven seven pound
well after you've UNK so many winners they knock two pound off you carry five
and after you UNK them five so many twenty i think it's twenty and then er you're knocked down to three
and when you've lost that three you're finished
you see it's up to you to ma well you use your own head and get on then
and you've gotta struggle for yourself
mhm
but trainers want good competitors when they're claiming their allowance
and good competitors claiming a seven pound allowance the UNK have him
cos there's seven pound off UNK back
see what i mean here
how do they work out the UNK the allowance
is it governed on the weight of the jockey
what
er yes
oh yes
say horse has got eight seven well you put a sa boy up that claims seven pound he you he carries eight stone instead of eight seven
mm
so you want an eight stone jockey
eight stone for the boy yeah
oh yeah
and if he carries a pound UNK you've gotta declare it otherwise you're fined
you gotta se when you go up on the scales you've gotta er say eight ten to ma he carried two pound UNK so you've gotta put him at the scale and then the end of the governor relies on the travel head lad to do this the same as i'm head man at home
mhm
he's trusted to do everything
UNK them and do everything
he has an authority you know yo a written authority in his pocket and if the stewards pull him up he's got the authority to what he's doing carrying on
got me
mhm
so he's sa he's solely in charge of the horses on race days
yes
travel head lad
mhm
he's solely in charge of everything
till the old governor comes and some trainers UNK them but some leave it to travel head lad
but very seldom interfere with the travel head lads
all good stable i'm talking about i'm not talking about ten a penny ones you know
all good the big ones UNK
and this UNK just ran this UNK all got a head man to do it for them
tt
yeah that's his one job
that's all he does
look after the colours tack and travel the horses
does he take staff with him to help him
well no they take them to go with the horses
th the jockeys
no
th the sorry
beg your
the men
pardon
the stable
the
lads who look
yeah
after the horses normally
yeah they go they go with the horses
they go with the horses
and these long then man out see but they call them travel head lads see
mm
he's head lad over there and once they leave my yard he's in charge of them
mhm
see
going back to training the horses
which
going back to training them
yeah
how many times a week would you gallop the horse
oh twice
just twice
er you fe you call a time we used we used to do it on we UNK and saturdays
but th the man like the they all got different methods see
whether they were 's trained ready when i men i saw in my time we'd he UNK them on UNK and sundays
cos he had all the jockeys the jockeys no racing on a sunday and he had jockeys to ride them instead of the boys in the stable
understand
er yes
now would they normally get their er a jockey to gallop the horse rather than just the stable boy
yes
instead of them
mm
you see th mm er more brains and more idea of it you see
understand
mm
otherwise the UNK satisfied with his own men he do he UNK and saturdays
perhaps er you see sundays some er ta er every runner goes out on a sunday
and UNK an easy day you see
the not engaged and er they don't take them out
but runners they take all runners out and they're out exercise and come in
it's one UNK consistent same thing all the all the every day of your life
what about christmas time
oh well yo at christmas time they don't do it here but er not today they don't they give horses UNK physically a powder now
i used to er when i was head man on erm boxing day christmas day the day before christmas er
christmas eve
so like they would for two days before christmas you ball a horse give a ball see
and the second day is UNK day
you see that's two that's like start two days before christmas see
you give them a ball of what
you give them ball a UNK ball that's bitter you know
get it into your fingers and you
what UNK
er well yeah it's a li it's a roll like that
i used to roll them in my hand and get them warm and get them in my finger like that and shoot it down and watch it go down er
what pinch your fingers together and push it in its
that's right
UNK them
mouth
you push over the as long as you got over the
i used to do get them to have all their heads round and go round and do them
thirty and forty horses i used to have to ball then
well they sa they've works them the next day and then christmas day we call it setting day they're all done up int they
see you do them up
we call it setting day that
do them
see
up
you do them up you don't da you muck them out dress them over let them loose they have a easy time like we do
like the human beings
what you turn them into the paddock
yeah
no
in the stables
see
and give them done them as soon as you like get done as soon as you like
mm
so they didn't go out for exercise
but boxing day you go out the next day so ordinary exercise
you only have one rest
one christmas day that is
mm
well some lads have christmas and some having boxing day
so you have to split them up between you
you can't please them all
mm
but half of them don't turn up
but you've gotta put up with it
but that's what that's tha course today they do cos they're getting paid well today
so UNK what's happens in these days now
they work them all over christmas
oh
no
they do just the same
work all the while
they have weekends off what they call long weekends off friday to monday
who looks after the horses at weekends now
well the other men in the yard
oh
we have to do them we have to help one another
oh yeah you do yours and i'll do yours see
you do mine when i'm off
yes
see
i done yours now you look
mm
after mine
that's how they have to do it
but they're doing three each now today you know
three
oh yeah
unless another UNK don't turn up
but they get their money stopped of course
see if they don't turn up they won't come in they'd ra rather let you have a UNK than come into work
see they're getting so much you see
but today it's one bu everything's everything works alright today cos they're getting so much money you see
and they do it alright they take no notice of it
lads give another lad a UNK to do his horses if he wants to take off he'll say i'll give you a UNK to do mine tonight
and he does his for a UNK
see you can do that now but years ago if yo well didn't they wouldn't allow you to do it
oh no they wouldn't allow you if you can't stop and do your horses we don't want to know you
they'll say ah if you have stable off we had to give it to them you see
mm
well you can't you can't stop them
going back to the weights
weight
that they carry when they're racing how do they carry the weight
under the UNK weight cloth
weight UNK
they're all weighed out with the UNK weight UNK
the jockeys and everything you know
so it's the
and how
in the stables we do exactly with the lads in the stables as the jockeys do in the weighing room
we weighing machine in the loft or in the or in the or in the best UNK room you see you tell the lad er fetch your UNK in yourself get on it i'll weigh you
and he don't know what weight he's carrying the lad don't
got me
mm
th but the governor who UNK you out he knows what weight yo what he's putting all out cos he's gotta weight the horses out
they use different weights for the horses
he knows what weight all of you got
and then off you go and make them ready and when you get out onto the heath you just the horses what's galloping together you've all been weighed out and then who's riding them and they all take the sheets off and they er UNK
and they do they all have to carry the same weight
no they don't all carry i mean you don't all carry the same weight in UNK
say you wanted find out something and you you've gotta one one's gotta give so much weight away to something well gallop me galloping them in extraordinary ways to find out whether he's any good or not
oh no it's there's no it's not easy
and how are the weights carried on the weight cloth
in lead
all the square blocks of lead
lead about as big as that all go in slots or
ah well if you don't do that if you can't get it all in that you have leather UNK
they give you a leather UNK to put on
they know what weight it is
they say put that UNK on
see that's a stone see
say you're eight stone they make you put that UNK on it's nine stone
and you jump on there with your UNK and your everything you see th that's how they find out
all tricks of the trade you see
but they don't let you know what weight you're carrying
understand
not in stables
mm
but the jockeys know
when the jockeys come to ride well they know cos th say what weight are you
seven ten
seven ten seven eleven
you know just guess within an ounce or two
see
we oh yeah they don't let the li don't let the men know
is that
i know what weight they all got and what they all carry
do you
i know them ma myself i i've got it all in my book you see when we
yeah
gallop them
do they not let the stable lads know so that they don't have an advantage over picking a winner
a well th well practically nothing it's nothing to do with them
see you can't ask them i it's nothing to do with the lads at all
you see
they don't ask
if you if you're telling him not to look at it they say look the other way it's nothing to do with you
they tell you that you see
they come to weigh you see
say you go in hospital they weigh you every day you
mm
see
usually telling you nothing well they don't say anything to us
mm
but why don't they want the stable lads to know what weights
well it always was secret weren't it in the stables
just one secret thing all the time
and they don't want you to know this and don't want you to know that
well i know and we're an the lads don't
that's the only thing
so you would use the carrying of weight on the UNK in training to see how fit a horse is
yeah
oh i know all what they've all got
i know see er myself i weigh all the lads myself i've got all the weight of every man in my yard in my book
governor comes in and says what's the weight of so and so jack
er eight seven sir
well put him on so and so
he knows what he's galloping he knows within a few pounds what he wants
put him on so and so and so and so on that and change them about
see you have to know all your men's weight
mm
and ride work i mean work riders you know
mm
work them i don't say we don't wanna lead them out or anything like that do all the work riders
when the string of horses goes out for exercise who takes leads er leads them out
because somebody goes up ahead don't they
UNK ahead of them
well the head UNK i'm in charge of them all
if it's fifty or sixty going i'm in charge of them
so you would ride ahead of them
oh no
i ra you ride at the back
oh at the back
one of the lads go in front or you have a travel head lad you got the spare lads who ride a UNK
they may be in front leading for you
lead
mm
you across the road and stop the traffic and all this
ah yes
you always got someone on a UNK to help you
oh yeah
him and he goes out i'm in charge once i get out sa out of the yard
till the governor comes and then he's in charge till he's er worked them all and then he says
mm
ride home
and we on going home he talks all about the work
saying what they're in er erm so look and wa watch so and so very carefully jack i've got him in such and such a race
just see how he's working you know
he'll want me to keep my eye on them all the time what he what he's got in mind what's running when he thinks they'll win races
mm
d'ya see
oh yes you it's a it's a big responsibility
you know in a way
but you don't get paid you don't get paid for your i didn't anyway i i'd i never thought so
fifteen pound a week when i was at
live in house
it was very UNK
you know today they get fifty pounds and hundreds hundred pound a week the lads get hundred pound a week now
do they
yeah
years ago when you wanted to get to the heath from a stable that was maybe the cambridge side of newmarket
yeah
how would you get to the heath
walked them
walk all the way round
walk all the way round
well round you see
if you're over that side you've gotta come on the heath and come to what do i call them
well i've told you come to the UNK and walk up inside them UNK all the time
that leads you right onto the south fields
mm
because at present you've got what you told me were the horse walks which are the tracks out here with
yes
white rails round them did you always have those rails
no
no
we had to put up with the traffic
so you
had to take a chance
we used to go through the high street years before motor cars come out
when i come here there was no motor cars they used to wa UNK horses used to go through the high street
oh yes
you'll see photographs of that everywhere
oh yes
er that was nothing
so what one group would go after another all the way down the high street
yeah
and go behind one another you see
mm
but just steady the traffic
you know you had to put up with all that you had to take your chances in them days
but today everything's made for you
you go right the way round horse walks
mhm
when
so
were these horse walks put in
oh they've been here about a few years now
been a few year they've been about must have been er erm twenty or thirty year now
mhm
and they're UNK designed just for the horses
oh yeah
aren't they
UNK the trainers paid for them you know
did they
paid for the roads being done up and everything you know
oh yes it's council don't do it er they have to the UNK association paid for that
cost a lot of money
oh yes they've paid for th all the UNK coming to do them and everything
done once a year they are
you know swept and rolled and UNK and
has anybody come across those terms assertive aggressive and passive
yeah
a lot of training goes on about UNK training and maybe the word has got around UNK is good and everything else isn't so good
i think maybe that's right on some occasions but the thing about this is that very much depends where we are and what situation we're in and we may actually choose to use one of the other types of behaviour
what sort of situation might you choose to use that type of heading
possibly yes er a situation there where you might actually well you tell me what you think so it's actually declining backing off yeah
so maybe we'd use it in that situation
or working within a bank and somebody runs in with a shotgun what sort of behaviour then
there aren't too many people who actually go aggressive and UNK the UNK to the ground yeah
there may be the odd one or two but the risk he's making his head blown off by doing it so against most of us will say here you are take my money and run passive behaviour
what about aggressive behaviour then what choose to use that
rob a bank aggressive behaviour yeah
why not organization
when all else fails really
right i mean it could be as a matter of a last resort yeah
maybe he's a bit UNK about the scale so it may be a conscious decision that goes without
he's feeling aggressive
right yes it's quite often aggressive people passive people who like maybe having passive people around and just needs somebody to walk over to shout at and behaving in an aggressive way so maybe we have to go aggressive when we deal with an aggressive person
so perhaps the first thing about that UNK is that none of them are right or wrong we all dis represent the ways of behaving and it's very much a personal choice which one will use at one stage
right or wrong
the to say anything is that we all have natural places where we feel comfortable we all have particular styles where it's easier to eat it's more comfortable perhaps is an example and very comfortable just staying where we are being passive it's nothing particularly UNK about that for us
so we actually choose to be wherever we want to be it's very much a personal choice
the third thing about that is that it represents us saying UNK
now we've got very much a personal perspective and we see things through our own eyes so somebody may see somebody behaving and regard that as an assertive behaviour somebody else may actually see that as aggressive it's very much a personal view of actually where we see the people lying and also indeed the people who prefer to deal with them
maybe these people here prefer to deal with aggressive people or indeed passive because you can completely walk over them don't like dealing with anybody they're totally passive on the far end of the scale passive
so we all have personal preferences with people who we like to deal with and indeed how we see people as well
so got to continue on there on UNK recognize people that you see around about recognize to be aggressive some as assertive some as passive
what are some of the clues if you like that tell us if people behave in an assertive aggressive passive way what are some of the other clues take that away from us
right body languages
a very good example on sort of the clues some UNK that make us say yeah it's aggressive passive assertive
tone of voice certainly
anything else about the voice
yeah volume
voice tone volume what else
what other sort of visible symptoms is behaviour
right i mean part partly related to body language but it things like UNK
yeah absolutely yeah why is it people who use the aggressive words are gonna be totally different from the words individual passive behaviour
so there are a host of clues there if you like about the sort of things that people will actually do and these are all UNK by an attitude
if you've got a slightly different attitude also an attitude
okay what i'd like to do is get you to work in three UNK looking at body language voice tone words UNK attitude voice volume but what we'd like to do is actually work in a UNK that is out of style out of keeping in your normal style
so for example if you're normally aggressive we'd actually like you to go with a UNK that's passive and work passive
if you're normally passive we'd like you to work in a UNK that will be aggressive
okay
now we're obviously even split two in each three so aggressive group so remember want it to work in a group that a normal style so volunteers for groups
anybody else
i'll be aggressive
aggressive
okay
assertive
passive
assertive
yes
yeah well i dunno maybe i was gonna say is because what we'd like you to do in your feedback is actually give you a feedback using the style that you were holding back on
so for example the group who are doing the aggressive i don't say that until after
report back about being aggressive and we'd like you to report back modelling an aggressive style yeah
assertive group report back modelling an assertive style and the passive group you report back modelling a passive style of
if he can actually think about getting up yeah okay
so if you would like to prepare yourself responses and ready for a preparation not preparation presentation erm it's coming to half past nine give you twenty minutes on that preparation so if we can be back ten to ten this group please
can you just flip the thing
yeah sure
so it's body language tone volume and voice things like UNK the words they might use and also what's the underlying attitude that fires the behaviour you're looking at
in terms you wanna word hay loft UNK
subject matters
now i'm being totally passive about that one
how you getting on
yeah
done
yeah
yeah
done
looking good
okay now at this stage you don't normally have to ask for volunteers for the first group because it usually sort of role then off they go
so guess who's gonna go first
morning aggressive
so we don't need to go through this
now you're gonna get on and read it and you can report back in ten minutes and i don't want any questions
right
ah oh shame
presentation
short and sweet
think he got the message
did you get the message other groups
certainly knew which one they were doing
right okay so what you say about it
body language UNK eye contact talking at them and power UNK what's power UNK
sort of power UNK up and down walking up and down and UNK almost
yeah okay
so it's very much body language that is actually directive sort of right up people's UNK quite often very close to people yeah
er voice tone voice certainly loud short sharp phrases er little chance of UNK
raised tone
yeah
likely to be aggressive likely to be certainly likely too loud
yeah think about domestic silence
what's wrong
nothing
so they sit there and you think there's nothing being said but the atmosphere is very much full of aggression
frequently is loud but sometimes absolutely the complete opposite silence can be actually very aggressive particularly with somebody you don't normally get that silence from you know they're normally warm pleasant individuals and all of a sudden silent and that's actively aggressive as well
certainly a word you must you will i imposing language
positive and threatening conversation
i'm sorry i can't read that
yeah so it's likely to wanna be out on their own
competent controversial
okay
what's the underlying philosophy behind that type of behaviour aggressive behaviour
what's really just sort of quick summary of all of that
lack of self confidence
possibly i mean aggression could be a response to lack of self confidence you're quite right
if you're lacking in self confidence you may don't want you don't wanna get other people's views and UNK impose them
so perhaps the underlying philosophy is i win you lose yeah me i'm gonna win and gonna be loud and be aggressive i'm gonna stand over you i'm gonna stand very close to you i'm gonna point my finger at ya i'm gonna UNK at you
it's all about i win you lose i need to beat you i'm gonna stamp on you i'm gonna make sure they actually beat you
so that's the underlying philosophy of aggressive it's gonna be i win you lose
okay thank you aggressive group
who's gonna come next
right
this is gonna do
right the er body language voice tone volume social dominance the words and attitude
thanks
again it comes this but assertive behaviour body language etcetera
it's very much middle of the road aggressive person
yeah
yeah i think that's a good point cos certainly if you're towards the aggressive we've actually got go
you might shout a bit louder shout a bit louder and what happens if it doesn't work
all at the end you do is losing your voice and if you don't get your way then you it up louder and louder and louder and if you don't get your way you may have to back down then and the aggressive person backing down to sort of a UNK doesn't always hold very much credibility
maybe the assertive person might be able to be more flexible certainly cos he can move between
i've never had somebody from my class should be able to beat passive assertive that way find it difficult to do that one
what about the philosophy for this one then assertive
yes
yeah the attitude is very much about i respect your rights as an individual you've got equal rights as much as i have
the individual who's gonna be assertive is likely to be open and honest or likely to admit things that are not so good at honest those but they're not gonna necessarily apologise for those they're gonna treat those as statements of fact and they're certainly gonna try and involve other people and actually say what do you think this what are some ways forward er but it doesn't mean that they're gonna be walked all over and they still stand up for the things that they firmly believe in
they may not always get what they want but at least they're standing up for them and actually feel good about themselves afterwards because
at least i had my say in it and had the opportunity to put something in
okay so goodness from the assertive group
passive group
right well erm
we decided to er change
well i think the
i decided that what i did it for small reasons
thank you very much
thanks david
comments from the others for that passive behaviour
it's very UNK
right
it frequently is UNK yeah
why is it likely to be UNK
yeah i mean it's about to decide whether you lose situations now i lose everybody else is much better than me everybody else has got a far better right to actually
they often can be related to in hierarchy terribly aggressive to his UNK but the company or his boss quite often the position the attitude that we actually take passive aggressive assertive
so a range of behaviour is very important in influencing that we identify where we're coming from and where the other party's coming from as well so that we can maybe begin to mould our behaviour and decide what is appropriate maybe on some occasions towards a passive actually gonna help us achieve for influence
we may decide let's be passive and move to battle decide is actually an important issue and wanna be aggressive and they actually bring in a relationship so important
on other occasions we may decide UNK is an investment actually got to use that style of behaviour to get my point across and to listen to them as well
so the choice is the choice
right you've got a view but the other party the other party actually has a point of view you don't know you need to look change
change is probably the biggest sitting with their arms crossed quite long periods involved with what is going on people who sit with their folding sometimes change of attitude how people react
indeed and one of the points can be more difficult you don't know
okay
so we've had a look at the three different erm behaviour types passive aggressive assertive
stage further though and begin to think about what we're dealing with people with different behaviour types
how do we actually manage to deal with them some of the ways that we can actually do that
so we'll do let's just split into two groups one group to have a look at aggressive people one group to have a look at passive and what i'd like to do is identify any groups
how you gonna deal with people who are we get this side of the group to be aggressive people passive side we'll give the right hand side of the group as i'm standing look at the passive people
how are you gonna deal with passive people on the right and how are you gonna deal with aggressive people
what are some of the things that you can do when you actually have to deal with these people particularly remember if you try to achieve influence on a course here that's what we're here for
we'll leave the assertive alone for this particular point in time what are we to do to deal with aggressive what are we to do to deal with passive
again some feedback on the flip chart erm let's give you fifteen minutes for that so it's coming up to five past twenty past
we'll take a bit of feedback on how you're gonna deal with those people
yeah the clock the UNK there i always get groups that say where's the clock cos they can't sort of see where it is and i'm sort of saying it's the angle tell the time
okay so a quarter of an hour and we'll take some feedback i think the er last one is perhaps so if anybody's got or anything else perhaps
okay who would like to come and er give us a feedback
this is the group that are dealing with passive behaviour
erm they can start by relaxing erm and a passive person erm and at the same time try and increase their
always use encouraging words see their point of view involve instructions as possible understand what their what problems they have and try and provide where possible erm reward positive feedback
er establish trust much as possible and involve er and try and get involved yourself if you can in any way to er show that you're you understand the task that they're doing
erm try and where possible to use the individual communication with them as opposed to erm communicating to them as a member of a group preferably in a relaxed environment er rather than a sort of erm including any decision making pass on as much credit for that decision as possible
yeah
erm possible identify their UNK reasons for their
good thanks a lot
yes certainly deal with pa passive people probably more difficult people
when i was out on the road i mean before i came into training i was so i laid my cards at the table at this point in time to say yes i need to sell insurance erm and i always remember particular UNK who you go in and he's saying well so how many of these particular products would you sell over the next year and he said oh twenty five and you go in great guy's promised to sell twenty five domestic contents policies over the next year
unfortunately the rules inspector would come in next and the rules inspector would say to the guy how many rules policies are and you say oh g a inspector and to every one he actually gained in fact it wasn't there was no commitment there at all get rid of people
difficult people to deal with they get much commitments out they're so frightened they won't actually say no they won't point out what is the objection to that and none of us got very much business out of the guy at all
i mean how he even got to be a UNK i never understood
but he just could not give very difficult to actually deal with
actually there are quite a few UNK people went out for a drink what are you having to drink and she said oh whatever you're having
and who have never ever been assertive oh well whatever you're having i'll have the same
yeah that's right
situation where you why did you do that and the silence is absolutely incredibly aggressive and you feel quite put on the spot
so silence can yes be a very good technique but too much it can actually be sometimes a bad thing very aggressive
alright that's what you want that is what we'll do
thank you passive group
aggressive
avoid the UNK
yes
two of you against one of them back you up
whatever it means whatever it means to you
situation
yeah
yeah thanks john
yes please
again any sort of comments on some of those tactics there
you absolutely get them going off but sometimes you actually want to use UNK fair in love and war also actually use those sort of tactics
in terms of how UNK and UNK for probably not very long and you don't get aggressive behaviour got nowhere else to go you gotta get to come back down hang on to the chair to UNK death absolute UNK never used it like this
you can actually get a lot of information out of the group
the passive person you sit there
okay
don't try and stop them and they start all over again it's incredibly hard work
shouting
what do you mean shouting you think i'm shouting though you wait till i get going you know okay right incredibly powerful trying to work out exactly what he wants er eyes were UNK don't do that don't do that i'm in charge don't do that
don't you dare i'm in charge of this interview and erm and erm and erm what's caused this and why discussion what has caused this change to try and find out and put him off horrible feeling you see two people shouting at each other two people shouting at each other get the impression that the other party is actually doing an impression of a UNK and going like that
did you ever see that actually talking concentrating at what you're saying
okay shall we break for coffee
the first session we're gonna look at is called training and
it's just literally about a twenty minute session
the purpose of the session really is to give this training course an overview and also to sort of have a for training
what we want to do in this session as i said it will only take about twenty minutes there are three key things we want to do
one we're going to look at why well trained staff are so important to the c u secondly we're going to look at things responsibility training is and lastly we want to look at a systematic approach that you can take as training
those are the three things we're gonna cover in about twenty minutes
well the first thing that we want to think about is why well trained staff are so important to the company and do this very much a UNK session ignore the tape i am i've forgotten about it already
so why are well trained staff so important to the company
you can just shout out any ideas you have so why do we need well trained people
productivity
productivity
yep
cost efficiency
much more cost effective isn't it if things to be done once rather than have to do reading them two or three times and generally the reason that things are repeated a number of times is that perhaps people are not really quite sure or not that are systems yet productivity the better trained people are people who can do things get it right the first time and they can do more work can't they than somebody else you are not having to pick it up as the manager responsible and put mistakes right
so productivity and cost efficiency
it gives a good impression
yeah like so many industries we're competing on good service aren't we and if we do things right it does convey a very professional image of c u to the company to the not to the company to the to the market place
i mean you were gonna say something
any more
so we've got
er yeah that's a good one isn't it
just as if we are in a sort team leader or a section head as i've shown it doesn't mean to say that we hold all the knowledge we can pass it on to others who can he pass it on to somebody else although you ultimately may be responsible for the training of other people you don't need to do it all yourself do you but unless you pass on skills you're gonna make a sort of a quite a vicious circle for yourself aren't ya
yeah
and how does training do that
we all like to get things right don't we
we all like to think we can do things and we can do things well
it actually helps our morale doesn't it and it sort of helps our confidence
i don't know about you but if i had to sort of pass something on to somebody else to check if i can see somebody UNK on it i feel quite UNK i hate it i like to feel that i can do it and i can do it well and that other people don't need to have to amend it
there have been a lot of studies done with regard to morale and job satisfaction and it has been shown that if people are well trained they feel a lot more loyalty towards the company cos they feel that somebody's actually taking responsibility for their training and development
how does that help us in the outside world if people know that we give good training
yeah we attract a better class of candidate don't we
people hear within the market place that we give good training that we do develop people and it does attract good people to join us doesn't it whereas very few people want to join a company where you go nowhere where you're not given any training you stay in the same job for ten years and it does nothing for you
most of us like to feel that we can join in and we can progress if we want to
any others
if any decided
yeah
yeah
we need to sort of plan we need to grow people develop people
otherwise if we don't invest money and time in training we're forced to have to go outside to sort of buy in people because we haven't actually invested in them
any more
i think those are the those are the key things that we want to put across really
i think the other thing is about erm flexible as well we've got a flexible workforce
if people are well trained you've got lots of people in turn you know when you've got UNK or holidays you've got lots of people who could be UNK to different positions for you and obviously the better trained people are it does help with the talent it makes you more flexible and you've got more people who can possibly go for certain jobs
awful lot of reasons why training i is so important to us an and basically it simply all comes back to our statement isn't it it's to be a sort of feeding UNK to give UNK service
i mean th there's no way we could do that unless we've got well trained staff
we can't compete on the basis we can't project the profession if people aren't well trained and people are making slow and the only way we can overcome that is by taking the time to train people
and on a more le local level you're quite right the better trained people there are the more they the happier they feel the more work they have the more job satisfaction they have
there is a direct correlation between morale motivation job satisfaction and UNK and staff turnover if people are happy they generally want to stay for us they're much more loyal and work harder and when we're managing an area it becomes a lot easier because we are not having to people are well trained they do the things right first time you're not having to correct their mistakes
so training is essential really it's fundamental
in fact we'll move on quickly now to have a look at we've looked at why it's so important
if we spend one or two minutes just thinking about whose responsibility is training
who do you see as the sort of holding responsibility for training
whoever's got some knowledge to pass on
yeah who has ever got knowledge to pass on
cos if you were asked as a person by a manager or by somebody else to actually do the training then it's your responsibility isn't it you've been asked you've been given that task and it's your responsibility to ensure that people are able to do at the end of the session something effectively
who else do you see as holding responsibility for training
training officer
yeah
training officer
that's what they're employed to do at any particular site but they don't hold total responsibility do they
line manager's job
yes yeah
line managers and supervisors as well are responsible for training because as a line manager or a supervisor you're responsible aren't you for training and developing people
that is one of your UNK to develop others and training falls into that
now you may as a manager think well you don't have to do it all yourself you can use senior people within your section who have the knowledge or you can use training officers or you can use people like ourselves at the training centre or the c b t or the i UNK or it could be that you bring the marketing department to help you out
there are lots of resources available for you but ultimately if you have a manager or a supervisor in your title then you are responsible for the training development of others or in a technical louise and andy the b t as are responsible for the technical training aren't they of others within the section cos you have the knowledge
well what a lot of people say on the course is i know it's my responsibility but i always i don't always have the time to train because there's a lot of backlog there's a lot of pressure it's and we all say to them that training is like a catch twenty two situation
if you don't make the time for training due to the work pressures or UNK or UNK and if you're not training others they make mistakes don't they
if they're not properly trained it's not their fault people can only do what they can do can't they
if th they don't know if people are not properly trained they are making mistakes then it does make more work doesn't it
because the mistakes have to be UNK and it puts us under even more pressure because you've got even less time
so training we do need to make the time otherwise it does become a catch twenty two situation
but as you said if it is your responsibility you'll have to do it all yourself there are lots of resources and lots of other people who can actually help you out who have the knowledge and you can use because you can use it as a development tool can't you for some of your members of the section to give them some training expertise
right so we'll just look at the sort of er the negative side of not making the time that we get more mistakes
we have to UNK more mistakes and put more pressure on us
what i'd like to introduce lastly now is an approach that you can take to training to help yourselves and to help make it more effective and more systematic and what i'd like to introduce to you is something called the training cycle and the rest of the course is actually based around the training cycle and i know margaret you've actually seen the training cycle a few weeks ago i'm not sure if any of the others are any of the others familiar
yes i have
you've seen it before
good
now for questions in the next session now
can't remember it though
great
we've seen training there have been four major steps for training and the first of which is actually to identify training needs
so before we start doing anything at all we actually do some identification of trainees
what do you think this actually involves
those that have seen it before
oh right
or for those who haven't seen it before
what do you think identifying training is all about
yeah
yeah
to find out
yeah
yeah
identifying trainees is all about finding out who needs to be trained and what they need to know and if you remember one of UNK objectives we had for the course is was to so that by the end of the course you will actually develop a system by identifying the trainees because this is sort of hit or miss
if they're gonna do training well then we need some sort of system to find out who knows what and what people need to learn
we need some sort of method for finding out what people need to know
the second part once we know what people need to know we now need to think about putting together some training which actually UNK that particular need
so this next part is called design in training
we're UNK into the training jargon here but all it is writing just putting together some material which is which is just what they need
if you haven't done this if you haven't found out exactly what people need to know the danger is that when you actually start to put together some material it's very hit or miss isn't it
it could be that you're giving them some stuff that we already know or it could be that you're giving them some stuff which is far too advanced for them they don't have the basics there
sometimes we know people very well but it still helps doesn't it if somebody else comes in that there's some sort of system there that somebody else who takes over your section can find out exactly who's received what
the last point then is delivering the training
once we've actually written the session we can then deliver it and the delivery is generally much more effective if we've put together material which suits their needs perfectly
you feel more confident don't you in a group situation if you know exactly what people er know or what they don't know cos there's nothing worse isn't there than to go in and thinking they may already know this i might be going in an teaching my grandmother to suck eggs here i'm not sure what they know about this
you feel much more confident don't you if you know exactly what people need from you
you go in feeling better and cos you feel better you'll deliver it in a much more effective way
and the last part is something that a number of you had for your objectives is and evaluation monitoring and evaluating training
once you've actually delivered it you then need to find out well was it successful did we achieve our objectives did people learn what we wanted them to learn
this is the very important part of the training cycle and the cycle is UNK cos there's no good investing in time and training is there if we don't know whether we've been
successful or not
if we have great we find out what else they need to know
if they haven't quite got it then we may need to re do parts of it
but we think the training cycle is something that's continuous
if people are new we need to train them to get the maximum competent level don't we
if they've been with us for quite some time there are always ways we can enhance people's skills aren't there
there are always ways that we could make people more effective or help people to got the wrong flip but to grow into other jobs
so that's the training cycle and we believe that if you follow that approach to training then it will help you to be very effective and successful
that's something that we definitely do here
right first of all i said it was an overview and that's all it was
what we wanted to look at to start with was why training is so important whose responsibility training is and lastly a systematic approach to training
what we're gonna do now it's just coming up to twenty past three so we'll take a tea break and then after tea we'll come back and we'll spend about an hour or so looking at identifying trainees
we'll look at what you're currently doing and we also suggest to you something that you could be doing
any questions
quite happy
right so we'll take tea then
it's just coming up to twenty past three we'll take fifteen minutes
that's a bit impressive dawn fifteen minutes
UNK
we were only given ten on the first day
unfortunately
yeah and i need the UNK i dunno why
asking questions referring do you get that situation whereby you're told something two or three times and yet they keep coming back
is it a training need or could it just be the fact that if they pass it on to you they know you're dead
two aspects of that but i think that's a good way of identifying training
yeah we're on the training cycle again another one
contact with the outside world customer services
so what would you how would you identify from that
there's no margin
so we got two then on to errors and erm complaints
yeah
yeah
what you said
yeah
it says you know UNK it out a bit so we can be a bit more specific
alright
changes in job specifications personnel changes
reinforced ones
alright changes in job spec
i procedures were introduced
any others
backlog
okay
yeah erm
by examining people's body language
we're not going to that one now cos i haven't examined your body language i'm not really interested
erm right difficult one that it's like the body language after what looking at do some work
amazing
yes thank you for that precise definition there
what was that sorry
yeah you wanna see if they can do it or not you can tell if somebody if you give somebody something to do body language you can normally
yeah sit at their desk
now the thing about UNK when identify you know somebody might have training
now be positive about it
when they've been promoted to a high UNK job
right promotion
and if you've got somebody who's gonna be promoted or you think might be promoted in a couple years' time or even yeah less than that well what should you be doing
you ever heard a succession plan is
er you probably don't do it erm you know er so UNK probably the back of your mind but again key staff you are key staff er yeah if you actually prepare somebody to take over your job when you're not there sort of thing
so in a way it's a succession plan
what other things might come out
what do we do once a year
review
what
review
review
anything else appraisals yeah things like that
anyone else
comprehensive list
new recruits ask them what a good idea
charts of asking questions if people come to you and ask questions keep referring the same things similar things to you all the time
perhaps it's cos they don't know the basics
what sort of errors do they make
UNK make errors and the same with it
complaints from other departments and complaints from members of the public changes in job spec er new technology perhaps er UNK that people always have a backlog don't they
is it cos they're lazy often think it's cos they're lazy don't they
i think it's often because people are always and then it always gets put to the bottom of the pile
things they're not so sure about
perhaps might not be it can't you can't wave a magic UNK and say everything's but they might not
body language can suggest you have like jumping out a window or hanging themselves or whatever
promotion succession planning
we do enough succession planning in c u you know it's magic you know you know number two like it's smashing number two it's still you know you know young children number two has a different UNK to what it does here but definitely if you are a number two here it means the same to what a child thinks it is but i
er and appraisals
all packets that we can use to identify i really do need people to talk to me
alright so that's a brief out overview if you like of some of the errors that we can do
let's go a bit more specific job analysis
we do the first bit who needs to be trained what do they need to know is the second
yeah so what they need to know and why forms a heading job analysis
where do you get your job analysis from
personnel
what
personnel
personnel
okay has anyone seen their job spec
does it actually give you any training on it
it's very broad isn't it yeah
erm
oh no it's the same sort of thing you're told it when you
you're told it aren't you
it tends to be blocked up in somebody's mind what you do
right that's the other element it's what you think they think you should be doing and it's amazing how few people yeah that's the yeah
i talking about but that's what job UNK are all about
it might seem long UNK but dependent upon er if you get it right at the start with it might mean that one of the things we're suggesting er you might say no it's not for me this but you might think that job analysis is a good way of identifying training
what they've gotta do and why they do it
what's the starting point for job analysis do you think
what's the first thing you've gotta identify
yeah the need for the job er yeah not quite exactly what i'm looking for the way of the UNK dilemma isn't it
i've got an answer for that it's not quite right what shall i do
can i just say no shut up
or should i and this is all part of it isn't it
cos he won't say anything to me if i don't know what's wrong
erm won't say anything else will he
what results
yeah alright
yeah okay so we're looking for results
the results of this person why are they employed
so the results that we expect out the job
if you get results it could earn a job analysis what would we do
if i if i was a job analysis person what will i sit next to you wouldn't i and what would i have missed out
right yeah
another word for main responsibilities
mm you're testing me today aren't you
right
key tasks what is the person's key task
this is difficult stuff i'm not gonna spend a lot of time on this because it's covered on various other courses as well
things like appraisal skills er level one level two various others other courses that we run
there's your job the first thing i should do is say well what are the key tasks what are the areas that would mean results
perhaps a working demonstration might highlight something i'm trying to
take the job of a receptionist
who's been a receptionist
you have haven't you elaine
yes
right
let's list the tasks of a receptionist
shout now go on let let's go for it
telephone answering it
and telephone answer
that's what you think they do
er you're right erm i can't think of the right word er
re route
re route same thing as what you meant isn't it
UNK if i wrote divert up here you might use it against me in later life
erm er route let's just call it route er to correct yeah
does that make sense that's for the receptionist we don't expect her to fiddle with the rates for liability capital or whatever do we
anything else a receptionist does
okay
okay so it's erm meet public yeah
we need to
what
UNK kids
UNK kids
yeah
i can see why you gave the job up
right now
any others come on you know just think about some things your receptionist would do
UNK petty cash and
petty cash er accounts yeah
post
it's normally the person that needs it the most actually isn't it but what else
anything else you think the receptionist you might have seen your receptionist do
well let's leave it at that we gotta we gotta we
what is a receptionist paid to do out of that list
answer the phone customers
this one here
yeah
yeah
you've been actually quite specific there meet the public erm deal with
what are all the rest of these
exactly
yeah
see there's some difference if we go and say what is a UNK key task all the jobs that we do at work probably only two three four of them are actually what we're paid to do cos they're the results we're measured on
yeah
yeah if you try and think about it processing
there are lots of things we do to get that form to there we're actually paid to move that form to there
how we do it and the various other things we do aren't exactly what we're paid for but they become part of the job
say that they're not part of the job that the receptionist gets paid primarily with these
so what are the key skill areas UNK need
telephone technique
telephone technique
yeah
inter personal skills
inter personal skills
UNK skills
UNK skills
so how does that now by just analyzing if you had to train a receptionist which would you concentrate on
does it
at various branch to branch you messages
yeah
you do
yeah
great
yeah we learn as well
but perhaps those three are the ones you'll if it was a new person coming in to the job you'd concentrate on that wouldn't you
in the training without out
you think about perhaps another example host isn't a key task is it
it becomes
can you remember the UNK i nearly killed myself then another thing you'll learn about training is er that all should be put down and around but if it if we were to go receptionist now you've got the idea of key tasks anyway
the rest had to be done but they're called enabling tasks
host training you first received can you remember it
how good was it
it wasn't really
exactly yeah i mean we got trained on host down here
now who trained me on host
have a guess
mm virtually but the initial training was done by somebody else lasted eighteen minutes
it was by the manager's secretary who is UNK for her typing speeds
so what happened
you couldn't follow it
i couldn't follow it
yeah another element but what did what did i need to know about host
what are the three key things perhaps i need to know about host if i never used it before
have a
how to get out
how to get out yeah
how to review
how to review
those are the only things i need to know to start with don't i
what did i get in the talk in eighteen minutes
how to send a letter and review file issue file public file the whole lot
see what i'm saying is the key task if you break it down is what are the key elements is the first way of identifying a trainee
so we if we our receptionist if we can say those are our key specifications again it's a loose idea this is not easy sometimes to look into it partly because we've been in our jobs for quite a while and you know we don't we can clarify it but think about your UNK and people that might be trained
identify those first then you can actually write down what they're supposed to do
if you can write that down what else can you then build on what's the next step
so you've done your key tasks you then write down exactly what they are and then UNK them so you got training need not very good at answering the telephone what are ya gonna do
train them on it
if they're no good at typing you gonna
to a lesser extent cos that's their key tasks
a lot of people would say well you're typing they do the typing first this sort of thing
so can you see how trainee needs UNK specific to them
what would be the first stage then
UNK you're looking at your receptionist now because you've identified the key tasks you might say well what's the standard on these things how good is she at passing on messages etcetera
bit of a difficult one to imagine a training exercise on passing on messages but it could be couldn't it
some of the large UNK and things like this
so you look at the UNK and most jobs have a standard of performance don't they
most of us are measured on the some form of performance they do
if you've got that standard you can then identify whether a person is below standard or
i can ask you easy questions now and again you know
christmas or above it
are we worried about the above it
could be that we wanna we could raise this even higher couldn't we
nothing wrong with people being above standard in fact it's encouraged
what about this is the more worrying one isn't it
if you've actually got a standard for the key tasks you can actually measure the what we call the performance gap and it becomes much more logical
again it's not always easy is it
some of the things are skill areas and it's not so easy to measure the skill area sometimes how are we doing so far
we've lost ya or UNK you with us be honest cos i wanna move on
lost ya
no
oh i said have i lost you and you were going
no with us and i
it's a way it's a very formal way of identifying training needs but there are times when you need to do it
you er you just sometimes cross the word poor UNK does that ever crop up
no
it might do no not in our branch well yeah alright it doesn't crop up but we have other words for it
it might be that before you start that if we training you need to see what the performance gap actually is
because if somebody doesn't know what standard they're supposed to achieve how can they be training then it's like a piece of string isn't it how UNK a piece of string
it's an idea take it away think about it
one of the other things that leads off from a job analysis by finding out exactly what a person's supposed to do is that you can start doing things like a personal training log UNK cash sell this is a word this is real life example
this is word that's coming out now of what one department did by a new member of staff
can i ask to share cos can you just share one for signed copies
it's an introduction cos this is given to a member of staff and he says the first the question is can develop and train all staff
well if it's not it should be etcetera
let's move on to the pages i've got to the actual format here
it's got training need and it's got virtually everything down there that the new member of staff joining the company would need to know
given this basic
i mean something as basic as the family tree yeah
yeah
yeah
got a family
i've got a family tree
how would how useful is a family tree for someone
and it's also you know your first few days you sort of you become a UNK don't you to the person that you know you know the person sitting next to you
you know i mean it's really difficult you know they go to the toilet they wanna have a crap you know
you know they might as well go to the toilet at the same time and all this sort of stuff and yet a little bit of information about that how long does it take to put together and various other things you know where's the staff manual kept i mean when i joined i didn't know purchase and this sort of stuff
staff you know all this sort of stuff
nice to know but they're very important flick over a page technology host pack or host training
think about people just joining the company how long does it take to get up to speed on
three weeks
three weeks
depends on the job doesn't it how much they're using but if they're supposed to be using regularly surely one person
what do we do
we get people you say well i you know somebody told me a couple of months back how to use the diary system by you know putting the note in and then UNK it when you want to remind yourself been in the company ten years you know all this sort of stuff and it's just useful bits you know the whole and all this sort of stuff
there's so much that they could learn that would help them in their job
move over we on er systems training technical
now we start getting into the actual UNK of the job and there's a whole list of things down here
it says okay all this sort of stuff
the important things though are things like who's gonna tutor them but it doesn't actually does it and target dates completion dates and tests to be done
how long would that take to put together
quite a long time
once it's in place though benefit of it
if somebody new comes along there it is here's our training programme for this person new person
yeah don't you feel as though you take some care of them
i joining the company something like that and if they did when you do join a department that does it you have a great sense of belonging because some of the things you'll do for the training will be allocated to other members round a team yeah all this sort of stuff and it becomes very easy takes a monkey off your back as it were you don't have to worry
it's just an idea
again think about it could it be useful don't know might be in the long term
another area that i have the plug
this is an advert now coming up
have you ever seen these personal development plans
yeah
yeah alright okay
okay front here
er the company through the training centre and the personnel department put together a personal development plan
think it's aimed at your group and also n UNK and people like that
the idea is that UNK it much the same as you had i'd just given and it's got induction er it's got a b c erm there are personal details so that departments people picking up see where they've gone see where they've been and in things like skills knowledge required objectives start finish dates how and with whom results comments
it's just a training log that's linked up with the job spec UNK it a bit more
what if something like this you know if i give this to arthur and john and say er they just joined i give them this personal development plan who should it put pressure on should do yeah cos you should be going up to them and saying well i'm supposed to have done you know x y and they go ah yeah and then they go up with these excuses yeah
again it's a thought these are both group supply
the contents relies entirely on
yeah depends might go away
you have to check that through to your manager
er cos at the end of the day if they don't like something trainees UNK
if you could quickly UNK down and see what somebody's done and the levels of UNK they've achieved it helps you think that why aren't they doing the job it might not be a trainee it might be somebody else
another area now this is this is one of my favourite things
you have to shout margaret cos i know you've got a problem with
cos i can't
have you ever seen these skills matrix before
again it's an idea we took from i think it's west end or various other departments
we look at our team it doesn't matter if you are section head or not section head or whatever you're just working the team you have responsibility for training
what you can do is list all the people down here and then you might have a skills matrix you might also have a product knowledge matrix yeah
you know technology matrix something like that and what you do you just simply say okay whatever the skills are along here it doesn't really matter
mr a is good at one three five and mrs b is responsible for the skills that she's good at one two three four five eight
mr c mrs d what does that show ya at a glance
what else does it show you
who trained who
possibly
yeah good stuff
anything else
training requirements
training requirements
if all these people are doing the same job officially in the real world we know that some people are more UNK than others that in some things or others can you see how quickly go down that line and you say to yourself well mr a you know he's got all those there great but there are a few gaps
what happens when mrs b goes on holiday or goes off sick
who UNK how many people can do task two
only her which means that when she's not there who must do the job
yeah
you see you see how easy it is to build trainee analysis a very simple format
er i would suspect that very few branches and departments have used anything like this
it's locked up away up here isn't it
just in case
i never thought of it that way
what do they got stars for in UNK
like cooking UNK properly or UNK a UNK properly or personal hygiene i think that's the big standard one
yeah
always make sure they got that
thanks for sharing that
i was just thinking i'm going to UNK on thursday so i'll look out for that
right okay so again it's just a simple idea that shows you an awful lot how long would it take to put that back together
the actual matrix to design it yet it comes back to doesn't it
what is the job spec what are they expected to do but that's a bit take for example once it's in place the chance of it changing regularly are quite minimal aren't they
so there's perhaps an idea for you is when you go back and you wanna get a bit of UNK with your boss is to say well why don't we set up a er training matrix just to check where everyone's
somebody said it was on the was it you said you know somebody mentioned charts
yeah
yeah and you encouraged the staff to
oh yeah they all do it
yeah
so can we just develop that one says that in our own department they put it up on the wall so people complete it themselves
well it doesn't go up on the wall it kind of goes around so it's not like public knowledge in there all the time
oh
you send it round what they want training on and it comes back to the manager
that's a good idea cos a lot of training needs have come from
people being trained
people who are trained
unfortunately that's one of the problems we have is people are sent on courses
yeah you're told you're going and we spend the first day UNK barriers to the fact that they don't know why they're there they've just been sent and it'll be good for you know this sort of stuff
yeah
yeah
so you know i mean if you use it perhaps the way as explained it then it's a much better way
what else we got
okay now who what and why what other things might we need to think about identifying trainee needs
let's think about the trainee
and when i say use the word trainee i don't it automatically makes a UNK doesn't it if somebody who's new to the job new to the company
it's not is it
they're all trainees when you've been in the company ten years twenty years you can still be a trainee learning something new
so what things do we need to think about perhaps from the UNK point of view
what level of training they need
okay so that's the level of training
do they think they need the training
yeah
the type of training that would best suit them
oh we're on to tomorrow now
right i think one of the things we'll be looking at tomorrow is learning styles and people's preferred learning styles and what we'll find is that people in this room you'll all you might have a slightly different way that you prefer to learn
i'm not giving too much away and that might be quite important
anything else
make sure that they get training
yeah er not too much in one go yeah
bit like my host training
UNK i was frightened of the thing for months you know you know there's always keys and what happens if i press sent
you know you got this you got this fear that the whole company's gonna get this stupid memo
you do don't ya
this is this natural thing inside me
so not too much in one go
like you said make sure they understand when they why they are having the training
right
why
quite embarrassed being told
or they think they don't need it
yeah
two aspects
yeah
what other things might we think about the trainee
to a certain extent
that's another element
perhaps identify trainees but it might be something that thinks about when we're actually designing training yeah
okay so we're doing well so far
what about the more experienced member of staff who needs training
who is actually doing the training
any of you i mean cos we've got a very young group this week myself excluded
erm it's certainly a nice everyone on my side
very quiet
what do the what do the older people feel when you go out to train them
do they like it
why not
yeah who is this UNK coming along here telling me how to do my job better
yeah
right
so again think about that aspect of it in identifying training needs
what about the experienced person what sort of training have they received in the past
does that help you
one of the things we said the worst training session can be is going over stuff that i already have done already known what training have i received that they received in the past
okay we'll leave it at that for the moment
what we've briefly done is look at how we identify who needs training
some are so obvious that new recruits but now don't forget the other the asking bit
what do people want to do
a lot of us ignore the fact that people do have their own development and they want to do something a bit more exciting but unless we're given the opportunity ask will they want to demonstrate it
asking questions referring they keep doing that all these ideas here perhaps a good starting point is a job analysis
but what are their key tasks what are the things they're actually paid to do
from that we can then build up the job spec you know the training needs like the a little example we and then we can look at UNK
how competent are people in their keys tasks they're the ones we should vote on first off
if they're performing below standard we've got a gap performance gap that needs training good identification of training but identifying exactly where they are performing and how
if they're performing above what can we be selecting those people for
promotion or
yeah very easy way people learn from a peer group much better sometimes
also thought about trainee what sort of things do we need to think about in terms of the trainee
there's one other area that's just UNK to me about the trainee and their actual ability
is it worth training somebody who has never hasn't got the mental capacity to progress to another job or perhaps performing
how do you know
how do you know
well that's a picture you build up by doing things like appraisals assessments things like that using the other skills
just something to give you some food for thought is there are two types of ability know what they are
i know
what
yes
but i don't know how to spell UNK so i'm gonna write another word innate ability
we've all got innate ability for something or other you know what innate means
UNK
UNK yeah you know like some people are really good at figure work yeah and that's brilliant at it they've got a natural UNK for maths and things like that
footballers most professional footballers have innate ability don't they as well as professional footballers
what would be the other one then if that's what we've got UNK
what would be the second one
what we learn
what we learn
acquired ability
capacity to learn if you like
some people cannot learn very well can they
no
quite difficult to learn don't they
yeah
you know you can spend hours with them one to one you go through everything you go through it over and over again
what do they do
you can think of something now can't you
that smile on your face says it all
no matter what you do they just cannot seem to learn
they got you know their mind is full up with what they've got they've got no room for any improvement
we have to accept that in life don't we
we ourselves are the same it might one subject area we might have to get down to take on loads of different things
in other areas we find it very difficult to learn
i find it very difficult to be er to learn morris dancing
why do you think that is
cos you can't dance
i can't dance basically no
i got no i've got no innate ability and if you try to teach me would it be any use just a stupid example
other things to think about when you're identifying training alright a handout for you identifying training needs at this stage just to make sure that ya the are still out
get a bit of a up
all this today
a little exercise for you to finish up with not finish up this bit
five minutes
individual exercise doesn't have to be i'm sorry i'm really how do you feel left out
left out yeah
yeah that's quite right see thing to avoid for training don't leave anyone out
methods you are currently using for identifying training needs
methods put to practice to enhance training
five minutes before you start it though now that it might not apply to you might not have control over training and perhaps down the left hand side you put well what methods do they use and you might put the other side then you go back and suggest to your boss will you alright
five minutes on that one
right your five minutes is up
something crossed very bad time looking at that brief picture who wouldn't you invite to a group training session on skill six
it just crossed my mind another thing about this matrix here is you wouldn't bring a those two people would you
unless they like their training
one of the big dangers of group training is that if the first one hasn't got the skills is that he might not get anything out of it
that's like one to one training isn't it
is there anybody you know that also have got the knowledge but they find it difficult
you might think you know
think back to a few years back when i was in training about a job and you might still think it now but i couldn't give put ideas over to somebody on one to one training
you know i've been i wouldn't bother showing them some that worked i'll always pick the case that had some UNK on it so the basic skill you were trying to show them never worked out you know what i mean and it's well don't worry about that if it was a normal case
you know they sit there going what is a normal case this is a normal case i've never seen anything else before
you might think about not inviting mr c and mrs d
you might think about skill level two
why might you invite mrs b
might have mrs b why we're doing a group get the whole team
sometimes it's worth having a word before you announce training to mrs b say look your role in this will be support me and have you got any ideas etcetera that we can talk to
involve people on a positive side
the other people that have been there a long time know it all and what they what you say can you help me
put it together on a training session on this and they rely on you and perhaps talk through to the session and say look that when i say this sort of thing will you be the person that demonstrates or gives me answer you know this sort of thing
get them involved pro actively as opposed to letting them sit there and UNK at you cos they know more about it than you do
it's a thought that crossed my mind to help you as a trainer
what we done in that brief session is giving you an overview of identifying training needs and you can go to i have seen books written identifying training needs and i have read books that thick and they so many ideas there give you a starter
say if we don't get it right at the beginning what we get out at the end can be very successful
i think the first stage process is to decide who needs training and what they need to know
er and it's about the UNK approach to training
i've got a bit of time on a friday afternoon for some training i think i'll pick friday afternoon
i could have gone home
whatever alright so try and build early start
we move on if we identify our training needs and get them all specific it's gonna help us tremendously designing group training
no two ways about it what we gonna do in this session is list the main stages to consider when designing training
so really it's sort of the stages we look at we're gonna design a training course or training session
steps that we look at
and the way we're gonna test this session is when you give your training session on wednesday
laughing already
it isn't UNK to the rest of the manor by the way they got close circuit t v
er that's how we're gonna test this out alright see how you put the structure together
we're gonna look at training objectives see that a bit more a bit more lively though
i mean look at training objectives
mm
mm yes a bit quiet on this side still bit quiet on this one
we're gonna look at how we actually set about writing the training session
mm
oh look at that little eyebrow raise
now this is a good one making the training session interesting
oh i think i'm gonna forget about the fourth one preparing notes
some of it's pretty self explanatory
dangerous thing to say we've already said but preparing notes is lastly down to yourselves i might give you a few tips on that
what i want to spend a few minutes on again this is something we'll test tomorrow right so i'm giving you UNK all about doing what do you think
what
well yeah er if i'm training you so prepared it but what am i what have i what i have to do as a trainer make sure saying
eh
that'll take up to about half five erm what have i got to do to make sure you've understood what i'm saying
question
test
training presentation
in the presentation you get people up front and they talk at ya don't they for a few minutes try and keep it interesting etcetera
with training what you're supposed to do all the time
get feedback from your group to test out
this will build up obviously as we go through the course
the first the first one that we're really gonna test you on is gonna be testing is tomorrow morning
so you're gonna have to do a little bit of work just a tiny bit tonight on one area which is your training objective for your session tomorrow
it's the only bit we want you to amend for tomorrow
it's the only way we can test out what we said as having any affect
so we're looking at designing training and the first thing we're gonna need to design a training is what
subject
subject
great
there's our subject i'm gonna train them all on what did i hear someone say
preferred age no
that doesn't mean er UNK theory of UNK
the training to be really effective and to get round to this bit monitoring evaluating training i need a step
to tell them a subject what's the next step i've gotta do
minute you had me really worried thank you
we need some objectives
what's an objective
something you want to get across
it is something you want to get across an objective is
what did somebody say
a goal
a goal
UNK it's specific an objective should be specific
what does that mean
UNK definite
how do you do that and this voice comes out over here
what do you think specific i give up you started you started so you can finish
UNK
it's UNK
is that possible to do in training
UNK most of the training you do can you actually say at the end of this training session you will be able to
yeah
ah that's within the training but if you gotta if you're gonna train somebody or especially a group of people you've gotta have some objective that is specific
remember at the beginning of this course what was our objectives
that we'll be able to list
training cycle
is that specific
what else is it
it's er UNK
have you ever heard of it
s specific objective should be smart
or you could put UNK
UNK
i thought you said UNK i was gonna say well no
spelt correctly there should be an e there shouldn't there
i'm not sure no
by the end of this course
ah right achievable for who
right achievable for the trainer limited to time aren't we
could i train you in like UNK theory of UNK in an hour
it's not achievable for me cos achievable is for you as a trainer realistic
who for
the trainee
trainee yes
we're getting there
trainer trainee have you wondered about the thought about the
so there's your objective it's got to be specific and re focused on an on an activity and we should be able to measure training not always easy is it
something about skills you know like telephone technique you know how can you measure somebody's telephone technique
difficult you might have certain standards they must achieve now for example er answer the telephones in three rings answer your name and your department is that measurable
yeah you gotta check this don't you the b t so you can measure them
achievable for yourself can you actually get those over within the training session
realistic for your trainees in terms of what are they capable of UNK them and then time
is by the end of the week and you will be able to process form x y z by the end of this session you will be able to
does that make sense
yeah
yeah
how many of your objectives are have many of you got objectives for your training session tomorrow
yeah seriously
who's got objectives
are they smart
specific
measurable
these ones you don't need to concentrate on too much but achievable realistic there's an amount of mixed audience tomorrow aren't we
and you just look down the route now and decide whether they're achievable or realistic
but they're certainly aren't they
not within fifteen minutes you'll to but at the end of this session you will be able to process how to tell us the five main points five main benefits of a certain policy
a few tips then on training objectives
we went out bit like one of these er soap powder adverts which of these two objectives would you alright given the option to decide that is a good training objective and which isn't so good
the first one just understand it you want to actually be able to do it
nine out of ten objectives holders agreed with you on that
is there anyone not anyone not understand
does anyone not understand
which is the best training objective
training will be able to complete a g s f three six five four
they've got to understand it as well
right how do you measure understanding
right can you see the logic behind it
it's a UNK i'm not gonna spend too long on this
when i'm writing a course or even a session within the course do you know what i spend most of my time writing the objective after a you know you know but not after
before i start i actually spend most of my time writing a UNK measurable etcetera objective
the argument says in pure training terms is that one is the best because it actually says that training will be able to complete the form
you can measure that can't you
can you
how do you measure that the trainee will understand
how do you measure understanding haven't we
why the fact that they can complete it
perhaps it's that UNK that is your objective the second one the trainee will understand how to complete what does your audience think
they don't have to do it
because if you in training like one of the things that the big bonus on this course is the trainee will be able to run a training session
does that focus your light on your coming on this training course
yeah
we're all benefited UNK aren't we
we all wanna do as well as the next person sitting next to us don't we
true driving courses when our training
so if we actually sent out training instructions the trainee will understand how to run a training session
should we be so up about going on this course or so worried about it
you wouldn't would you
and i wouldn't be able to UNK it
cos you could turn round to me and say oh we didn't know we had to do it and you could use that as what
so as any guidelines here and there is a handout on this so i won't i won't tell you that cos there's too much on here
where's a bit of paper
in order to write objectives and as i say we're not gonna labour this point because it it's easy
one of the key things to think about is action UNK
so an example of words we should use are this example and there's a handout to write to UNK to identify to differentiate to solve to construct to list to compare to controls
you can argue about some of them i dunno i don't wanna make a big thing
they're all action UNK aren't they
at the end of this course you'll be able to write an essay on
UNK theory of UNK
you'll be able to UNK can't even remember UNK er UNK i don't know somebody who UNK the poem
you will be able to identify is that a good one
identify it's not so good is it that one
what about identify the five major steps towards writing a training course
it's more specific
you've gotta think about content but that's a UNK
words that perhaps will help you are the words we should avoid using
at the end of this session you will know four steps well what does that mean
am i gonna test you on it
i'm not am i
how do i know that you know
by getting you to do something
you will understand come on hands up who's going to understand their objective tomorrow
i have i've got an objective tomorrow it says understanding
right appreciate how does how does somebody appreciate the difference between key plan and a golden key plan
is there such a thing
no well it doesn't matter you've got the idea
er how do you grasp a significance of
you see what we're saying it's the words you use in your objective
you will enjoy being here at this course you will enjoy the training
you can't test that can you
i certainly wouldn't bother to test it or even dare to test it now
cos people sitting here thinking oh i thought it was gonna be a lot of fun this it's quite difficult now
the i dunno where i got these from
really what the point i'm trying to make is training objectives are about doing something
people are do something at the end of the training and it UNK your mind to the trainer writing material
if you haven't got an objective that ends up with them doing something or listing something then you can't test your objectives
we develop those off your training session tomorrow
alright so if you don't worry if you if you
i shall be available after half past five till about six o'clock if you wanna just i'll be in tomorrow morning at quarter past eight
it's a difficult thing this has taken years to get objectives and every time the old
right keep one of them and hand the rest out
does anyone want a quick break
five minute tea break breath of fresh air haven't got time for a cigarette though unless you're very quick
i'll give you five minutes breath of fresh air alright
can i ask you though if you are gonna UNK out and smoke in the UNK er not in that UNK along there cos the smoke UNK
i will not tell you who that secret smoker was
you coping there alright john have had a long day
no i'm fine
are you sure
yeah
very much aware of it
still early leeds branch
we are very much aware of it
yeah
all here
yeah
well before we start once again we're on air
recorded by what's it called
the corpus
erm british corpus
british corpus
that's best language best behaviour this evening
that's a microphone
incredible
this is new you've gotta explain cos i was a bit concerned last night unless you know about it
yeah what is what is the reason behind this
it's m i five
UNK
it was the british corpus asked us if we would be willing to record the last council meeting because they wanted to erm get UNK and accents and use of words from different parts of the country and they were so UNK by our display they've asked for a further two meetings
so we did last night's and now we're doing tonight's
and they couldn't understand the vocabulary
yeah we had too many UNK and UNK
there's two more
i think there's no real point to start them with before is there
seeing as we're gonna ask young ladies to talk
only thirty second early
right well good evening ladies gentlemen and members of the public and erm the first thing i'd like to do is to ask the youngest of the young ladies at the end of the table who have come to talk to us and i'm not quite sure let me guess which one but i reckon that that's miss and that's miss
have i got it right
so we've got i did have the first names somewhere
UNK an UNK and amy
that's UNK no amy and UNK who gonna talk to us about project they're doing which is called a dog called mock
okay so ov over to you two
you ready
no
well the book in her own time produced these eight books of which four we're going to put into print
perhaps you'd like to pass them are you erm you could have a look at them
the teachers felt that they'd put so much effort into it that it er should be taken a stage further
and perhaps go towards printing and to this end they erm approach from john
er this UNK erm producing a book exactly the same size as the trade directory
it will have the same feel to the cover forty pages and er contain four of the stories
erm to this end we need about six hundred pounds for the printing and then all the proceeds will go towards the legal and also to buy additional equipment for the primary school
erm it's their last year at the primary school so it would nice to leave a couple of benches or something like that behind for the UNK to sit on
but it's all their own work they're at the moment re drawing every single page of the four stories that will be in the book and i think that UNK got this is the work in progress
erm the book here is the one that she's working on at the moment
some stories they've chosen to use
and you can see actually
hello
so they've all
yeah
got to be re drawn in black and white that'll be gone over
hello okay my love yeah i will do finish okay fine see you then happy christmas bye
putting a lot more detail in rather than any UNK annual you should buy there is always things in the background that draw you eye in to the picture so UNK putting a lot more detail into the picture as it coming up for re drawing
erm we've got to set out haven't we amy
and as i say bill is doing it all at cost so you know he's not making anything out of it himself
erm we've got a few UNK and also a few places that people have agreed to sell the book and display so UNK malcolm college UNK toy and UNK erm a bloke from manchester insurance has given me a couple of days to sell the book out there
at the lunchtime they've got a big social club erm and all main hospital fund raising coffee mornings and events will be able to sell the book there
so you know there is an end to the product we can see when
and an and in our portsmouth information centre
great that would be lovely yeah
and i also hoping to contact the parent teacher association of the schools that the hospital will service and see if they will sell the books at their stall as well because it's all to benefit hospitals you see
so there are UNK
we hmm now young ladies how long have you been working on this
a year
yeah
and erm how much time do you spend on it
they te it they tend to do a lot like in the holidays and half term when they can get together because obviously there are other demands on them with UNK and guides and stuff like that
but it's really when you're together you work on them more don't you
right the production cost is say six hundred pounds right
yeah
and you've raised some sponsorship
we've raised about two hundred just over two hundred
great
has anybody got any questions for these young ladies or their mums
can sponsor money
sorry
that they would raise as a sponsor what to give or give us some idea what er
yeah they they've got sponsorship down beneath the two hundred pounds
paul
they seem to work very hard on these
have you any idea how many books you might actually sell
erm we're no we're not sure about selling
i mean this the six hundred pound will produce one thousand books
that gives us the potential of raising two thousand pounds because we intend to sell them for one ninety nine
we've been told if we go over the two pound they won't sell so well erm so really i'm not too sure but er i can work on bigger er like i got this couple of days off living manchester i'm sure if i approach erm you know the police they might give me a couple of days selling out there
can i
i'm sure of ways and means
mm
can i ask you it's a thousand pounds to sell two hundred and fifty of each of the four
no
no this book well it's
will
two thousand of this book which contains the four stories
contains the four of th oh right that's fine
yeah
so what we've got is four of these books that will go and UNK into one copy
yeah
and two thousand copies of a thousand copies of that
one thousand of this yeah
right
yeah same size
who's gonna pick which four go in then
they both are
they both are
yeah
and have you got any ideas which ones they are
yes
UNK you show them
that one
please
and er this one
that's the one where it's properly drawn up is it
yeah and the dog show
and the dog show
and the UNK one
and the UNK
and the UNK
right have we got any timescale on this
erm yes
it will be produced by easter
right
yeah we've drawn out UNK for the books to be copied and it will be launched at easter
erm colours
er we've got black and white with three other colours
er blue red and yellow which mixed together should also give us purple green and pink
so we're probably talking about eight different colours
right
we thought if anybody
right now
first thing i wanna thank you for coming in
i wanna thank you for the initiative you've shown
i can't tell you till we've had our meeting what we're gonna decide
whatever happens we wish you very well
i think i speak for everybody and say that we wish you well in this project
and if either mum likes to phone in or come into the office tomorrow by tomorrow you'll know what we can do or if we're gonna do anything to help you
okay
right so we won't keep you waiting
we'll get it sorted tonight
thank you very much
okay
thank you for taking the time and come to see us
anyway i think these young ladies deserve a round of applause for what they've done so far
don don't to be afraid to come and see us again alright
it's quite nice to have people here
we'll be selling copies next time
right before we actually st plans please
now before we again before we start the actual meeting proper i've invited carol along you'll see that we've got er oh sorry for those who don't know carol
leading night in UNK
and you'll see we've got an application up for UNK tonight
we thought it would be a good opportunity for carol to come along and tell you as quickly as she can
yeah
where we've got to with our recycling initiative and then we can look at that grant in the light of what we've been told by carol
okay
i'll sit round here and you can see me
right just like reading that through i'll give you the readers digest version and then you can ask me any questions to fill in there's er quite a bit to tell
we started off about a year ago looking at recycling that's available in which is just basically the paper cans and glass out at the park car park
we thought there's a lot more that you can do
there's a lot more that you can do than this
how can we go about doing it
we thought that the site over at the station centre would be good as a shop UNK and as office space for recycling and that the site behind it would be a good place to keep all the stuff until it can actually be recycled erm so we identified the site to start with then we started looking at what's actually possible as op opposed to desirable
to this end we had a feasibility study written by ken who is UNK community recycling network coordinator
his study took three months to prepare and considers the markets available it considers things like recycling credits that the councils can give you
it looks at other initiatives similar to the one that we're planning and derek has got a copy of that if anyone would like details on any of that
the next thing we did was starting to support and run it of course
so far we've got support from waste watch which is a department of the UNK er recycling group
they've sponsored us a consultancy
they UNK us
they've UNK us as it were with a town called UNK which is a similar size to ottery st mary in every respect
and our consultant has been running varied recycling for the last four years and they are currently recycling seventy percent of the waste in that town
that's as against a national average of about five percent
so obviously this consultancy gives a lot of good ideas and a lot of very practical advice because they were actually doing it
we've been to visit him he's back to visit us and he's available to us on the phone for a year and all of that's covered by this department of the environment
in terms of hard cash we've applied to the community council of great britain and their rural action project and they've promised us two thousand pounds as an actual funding so as and when funding becomes available from councils or from private sector or from our own efforts they match that pound for pound as we go along
er other money is being raised from local businesses we've got support from UNK and we've got support from as well
who are local support
as far as council support goes we've been granted the use of both the station centre itself so that we can have a retail UNK for furniture UNK a UNK books the kind of thing that might go to UNK but which people might very well want to use
and that would also give us office space which would give us a headquarters for a recycling education group which would go out to schools to councils to UNK groups to anybody who might be interested in recycling what they can do how they can it better
erm that would all be based in the station centre erm as i say we've also been granted permission to use the site behind and planning permission is on the way through now that's looking good
we've got support of social services who actually own the access onto that site
they're obliged to charge us a certain amount for access but they're talking about giving us that money back as a grant
so all of all of that is under way
er what do we need now
well it's all very well saying you're gonna UNK things you've gotta have something to keep them in
we looked into all sorts of different buildings and that would be suitable and we've decided the best thing is on the shipping containers they're water proof they're UNK proof and they're recycled as well which helps
we are looking at a cost of about five hundred pound for these plus two hundred pound shipping charges and we're going to need four or five of them
at the moment we've got devon county council's recycling working party who are very likely to be paying our UNK charges for at least the first year to get us off the ground
er i can't say definitely yet because the meeting comes up after this meeting but i've had a lot of positive noises
east devon district council has looked at the paperwork and has realized that the community council is going to match anything that they give so i've spoken to their recycling officer and he thinks that the way the budget is we're very likely to get one of the containers from them which would be matched by another from the community council
so basically what i'm here to ask you for this evening is your support of the project and specifically if the town council could buy us another one of these shipping containers
then we effectively double their money because that would give us the fourth and final one that we do need to set up and start operating
in the long term we'd like to go on and build a workshop make our own UNK electrical goods because obviously this is something a bit more in capital intensive and it's something we're looking at it in the future
thank you
that's it
mm
questions
out of that
mhm
would you UNK goods or whatever you like to call it
no
have you any
yeah
erm last week we consulted devon county council we sell it for UNK unfortunately now because the market as we know with people being UNK on to the recycling plus products flooding in from germany creating products
er from the sound business point of view we can only UNK glass because we get what are called recycling credits which is that the county council gives us fifteen pounds a ton at the moment
that's going up april of next year
for everything that we collect
so they will take the glass and they will pay us recycling credits for that
newspaper difficult one generally but we're lucky in that we've got a place down in UNK that UNK this all up for animal UNK and they'll take that and again we'll get recycling credits so although it's low value in terms of the actual material it attracts this big recycling credit so a subsidized market if you like
aluminium cans can only start at seven hundred pounds a ton
steel cans you can just about cover the costs of it
you mentioned all the figures that you can
yes
you mentioned germany
sorry
germany has a big problem hasn't it
germany does have a big problem
they are they are the top UNK nation in the world
that's right
well the problem is that they
they have so much they can't get rid of it
that's it
the problem the problem with germany is as you say they're flooding the market they've gone at it from one end only
you know they thought UNK things marvellous they've got people UNK their waste they're collected separately and then they oh well now what oh we'll ship it to england
invasion
you go somewhere over UNK and you've got land sites full of UNK up old UNK german UNK
they do with it i agree
it's a
but do you think you can compete with that
yes
because as i say we've got recycling credits on our side we've got the fact that we've got this UNK in UNK which will take the paper and that's why we're looking at producing this workshop area so that a lot of this stuff that goes to UNK i'm talking about UNK tables whichever else that can be repaired and UNK er i know this is only on a very small scale but one of the things that i think is very important with is that we're not purely a recycling centre we also want to set an education project to raise people's awareness of what yo yet waste production isn't about recycling it's about not producing it in the first place
that's right yes
and the more people are aware of that
it's not a question of how good it is to UNK several tons it would be better still not to produce it
so i think that's er an important part of it
we've actually had a recycling paper project going on over the last couple of months which made paper out of UNK and then made christmas cards out of them
they sold those on the profit for UNK
so it's small things like that which although on their own as we didn't UNK but for all those people who bought cards and the people they send them to are now aware that they need to create a market
thank you
anybody else
can you ask ah sorry wh what products do you actually UNK
you mentioned glass and paper
glass paper cans steel scrap metal generally
timber which can either be good UNK furniture or furniture that can be repaired which can go straight back out to anybody who wants to buy them
we've also got through social services and UNK who are desperate serving source of furniture and you just see it going on top of the estate cars going down towards all the time
if we can divert that back into social services that'll be instantly UNK
waste oil can be collected and we can re sell that to be used as fuel oil
er scrap timber can be UNK up at one side and used as UNK
erm textiles have a high re sale value
even if we did something like jumble sale clearance and get people's old clothes you could sell that for about a hundred pounds a ton
erm off the top of my head
we're not going to be touching UNK because the market isn't in place yet
just create a problem for ourselves at the moment
as and when the market UNK we might look at that
erm
will you restrict what's how are you collecting people bring it to you or will you actually
yeah
the idea is to make it a bring facility at the moment which is why we like the station centre and the yard behind it because people tend to drive out that way as they go to exeter and back
wh what are the problems with throwing out plastic UNK full of rubbish and just dumping it on your doorstep and finding it UNK
well that's obviously one of the problems with a recycling centre
we've done quite an extensive survey around ottery looking at the times people use these facilities and the weekends especially saturdays is the favoured time
what we're planning to do in the very early stages is to have the site UNK on a saturday and have people there so we can actually turn away rubbish
we will have a skip on site so that any rubbish that accidentally UNK through can be put in there and that's something we've budgeted for the fact that we will have to remove rubbish
because i think you will have a real problem coming on board now is finding a building place
devon waste money on controlling tips in devon
mm
they're raising their fees restricting what you can tip there
that's right
and then a lot of these skip UNK do an awful lot of domestic
mm
erm UNK and i think what we ought to do is if you can travel UNK people from having UNK at home and i think if you set up there you'd be
but there again if you look at the number of building sites
outside people's houses and the amount of stuff in there that just breaks my heart to see it all go into UNK
you've got bricks which can be UNK you've got timber which can be UNK
right well you say that but it's
right highly unlikely
right
thanks
anyone else got a question
okay carol thank you for the time you've given to us to see it
well thank you for listening
right erm obviously we'll come to our deliberations as we go along
right oh
okay and we will be asking you back at regular intervals
thank you very much
alright
thank you
right
thanks a lot
thanks for your time
well thanks for yours i hope you i know how precious it is at meetings
right
okay
well can we get down to business
town clerk to receive apologies
erm councillors and
and right
item two under the go on to grants now
reports of correspondence
no i've got er no er reports in fact
oh yes i can report i phone erm my work today about the place save because i'm obviously very concerned about that
i met up with her two and three times to see where we're at
and apparently the firm that she ordered the thing from in the first place had been er re set up
i don't know whether it's exactly the same company or whether it's erm brackets nineteen ninety three or whatever it is
but it has some of the same staff with a new manager director and so on
she apparently phoned him shortly before i spoke to her today and she's got an assurance that she'll get her money back
so this is to be hoped for and he he's guaranteed reconciliation by the thirty first of this month
so she was writing to him at the time i UNK
he's getting the letter and has promised that action will be taken so i it's only words at the moment
right hopefully i think we must take this as erm part b agenda item at the main council meeting
because we've got to get this sorted out because if we don't the end of the year will be any enhancement money be lost won't it
yep
so we've really got to get put some we'll take that as a part b in the january meeting
i was slightly UNK when we got that copy of the UNK times and there was a fire inside it begging people to come forward for the er
and that was no chairman no secretary no treasurer in the organization
and perhaps there was only
there were erm what i think you know things were not as they seem
however we're in a situation now we've got to UNK so i think that's the only course of action we can take
see what comes by the end of the month
mm
and then do something even if it means calling her in
i'm not afraid to call her in
yeah
for part three of the meeting
mm
erm and take it like that
said she's guaranteed to phone me before the next council meeting so that we know what we're doing so i'll keep at her
right
fine
we're going to erm item three the supermarket applications now under youth grants you remember that we advertised this is the money we UNK which we won't be using for the detached youth work workers' scheme
plus the UNK that we had from that project
the total we've got er available to us to support UNK and different youth activities is six thousand one hundred and thirty two pounds
and that's UNK to use by march of ninety four
okay
i must say i've been UNK you know ve pleased by the number applications from youth activities that have come through
the first one on our list tonight ah one seven nine is for the young ladies that we've just seen with a production of their book a dog called mock and i think that we er talked about this and asked them to come in because we wanted to know the substance and whether this thing was actually taking place and what was i don't know what the rest of you feel i think they made a fine presentation and it's obviously something which is going ahead and i hope that some of you feel we should reward initiative
comments
well i think mr chairman they've done a fair job in there
the work they've put in erm and obviously if you give your support to erm make them a grant it's basically a grant for adults
because a lot of the profits that would er be generated by this book is being put back into
yeah i
er in a way
i like the idea they're gonna raise six hundred pound wherever they can then all the money they raise they can sell the books for is going back into the community
mm
sorry did i miss out on something that didn't they say who they were selling it to
presumably parents but
yeah well i suppose any i mean if they go to london or manchester or er i think they're gonna produce something rather like th the books you buy for your kids when they're young you know
sort of UNK books they're very similar
i've got one of two of those at home and they're very similar
oh i do like that
right well
that's four hundred quid weren't it
yeah i'd like to propose for maybe about two hundred
oh that's what i'd been thinking fifty percent of what they want
fifty percent of what they've got left
that means they've raised a third we've given them a third and they got a third to raise
all in fa all in favour
it's getting used to thinking that somebody's doing something for 'em
well i think we can actually get a bit in the newspaper with this one
right
all agree
yes
thank you very much
number one eight four
UNK erm basically we have helped UNK before was it last year
no it was this year
this year
we've given them five hundred pounds
remember john and i went on a visit down to see their hut and to be honest they were making a very good job of the hut what they come in for is er a second bite really erm they've got to floor the roof which we er thought was quite interesting
i think what they mean is they're putting a floor well i know what it means they're putting a floor so they can store stuff across the erm
roof space
yeah you know
is the roof UNK
that my floor yeah
i call that a ceiling but that's a second
that's right yes and t to line the walls and paint the UNK they've got virtually well they got nine hundred and fifteen UNK worth of work they need to do to the hut
they've actually asked us for five hundred
i thought that see as we've given them five hundred before perhaps you'd consider giving them perhaps two hundred and fifty this time
any comments
can i raise a question
it's the same old thing i'm what i'm called a coordinator it's all good saying we're gonna put a UNK floor in one of those you've got to line the building out
is there any specification going with it
well all i can say was i been seen the building and there were a lot of the work was being done under supervision of david under a community project and for the amount of money they're talking about three hundred pound they're not going to put a UNK i mean what they were doing is gonna put something across the UNK so they can store something there aren't they
i mean it's a it's a wooden UNK type hut it's very UNK done concrete floors they've made a good job of it
erm and we have got six thousand pounds to spend
yep
i don't want to give up work but
yeah
can the building support it
i mean i seen people
support it
well string timbers up and you build it up and the whole lot comes down
yeah well all i can say is that i've seen the building and i would i would think th that it's no problem
i mean i haven't done a detailed survey on anything but i was UNK surprised by what i saw when i went in there and i must say i went there expecting it to be no more than a garden hut
mm
right
i mean pi pity that john isn't here because he can ver i said take your points but then i mean
the other two jobs i don't think there's any problem with them
even though you say there wasn't could you could you fund them money after that
oh i don't think we are
i mean tonight there was paint the walls was six hundred and fifty pounds
well that's yeah
and we're talking about two hundred and fifty pound towards that
i'd like to go along with it but i think it's an area that ou ought to be clear when er grants coming in for some or even minor building works there ought to be a specification within whether the building can cover it or whatever
yeah i know it puts more work back on the people asking for the money but if that went ahead and they it up and the whole lot came down
well in the same way you see when we lent six thousand pounds they paid up back over a ten year period
we're actually in the business of trying support and i think failure is not to have tried
now if they do try and it failed
you know at least we're supporting the activity of the young people
young people learn a lot from failing don't they
they yes
oh my god
mr chairman i take your point but i also support erm paul actually because if we do support things like this and like you say if it were do collapse on these kids erm they could come back and say well you know council give us the money towards it you know they should have
oh i don't think that's true
but it could well do you know
no
you get bad
no i mean they UNK they're insured
i know that i mean er we what paul said is basically that we could have problems if it if it did go wrong
i mean if you if you into if you were trying to look into building or commercial and you had to send them a planning application for it you'd have to prove that building could support the weight
what i'm saying is this
if UNK scouts have written to us and said that under the grant that we're trying to give tonight towards
if they said would you please give five hundred pounds towards our running costs there's a chance we would have looked at it
we'd have looked at it
what they're doing is actually going a lot further and supply us all the their ac accounts and details and they've actually sort of called it a grant for partial costs of materials right so we're actually
is it not UNK though on the councillor or ward councillor to make sure when the money has been granted that how it's used and spent so he's going to keep an eye on it anyway
because that's part of the thing that the ward councillor is meant to b keep an eye on the actual project
well i've just seen a new way forward
why don't we get a report on this i mean he's more operative i mean to consider the building is worthy of what something or other
well there's no harm in you doing it is there
your ward your ward
you're experienced in this sort of thing
yeah
i would like to think that we've pass for two hundred and fifty subject to trevor being satisfied
wait a minute
how did this hut started was it did it start as an agricultural building or a house or a just a plan hut
i think it started as an agricultural building which they got for nothing
and transported there and they've re done it and put it on site with a concrete floor
quite impressive
there's no reason why you should get somebody
i don't call for it but i think he's right in bringing it along
ask you for it is as it was reasonably sound there is no reason why it should just sit and suddenly collapse
no
then it's the first
it's the basic principle
i mean i'm not after money but you you've got to make sure you're giving the money to a project like that the thing is viable
that's right
we are the UNK of this pub public UNK money
yeah
and it's only right that we should say how it's spent
but surely that isn't the case i mean that you know we can't be responsible for the way in which all these groups actually behave and all the rest
i agree with you
we have to draw the line at some point
yeah
i mean it's like UNK you know somebody could UNK
yeah
underneath it you know under those trucks or something but i mean we can't be responsible for that
what we're here to do is
gone and do
showing more initiative
we're trying sports and
is there anything in the constitution anywhere cos i happily to go along with that if it's written in
whose constitution
or wh what that we just give out grants and we're not responsible how the money is spent
i think that's irresponsible
it's worth looking into i think
it's just that nowadays in life you make a mistake and someone UNK you on the head for it
oh making it for quite a while
yes
with as it turned out
yes
erm the money is here for us to allocate
yes i know
the council passed it for allocation to youth activities
it remains with youth activities
now we're not going to be able to go out and check where which way that every pound is spent
no i appreciate that
right
you've got a UNK that need a training course
what about the lady first with the books i mean th that could someone could fall out lose interest you've given a grant
sure
well look at UNK play area
this is what's at the back of my mind
the minute we stop doing this we might as well stop the whole plans procedure
that's how i view it
yeah
and we're here to try and alright if seven out of the ten that we look up tonight come through we've done well
no
at the end of the day you can't be one hundred percent but i'm i think it's a good idea that we actually pass something to the people pending trevor being happy
i think that's a yeah
he'll look on that
so do you agree two hundred and fifty pounds
yeah i think i'll go along with that
yeah
yeah i think it's a good investment
sounds good anyway
right
okay
a hundred and eighty five is erm the boxing club
er i was hoping the president of the boxing club councillor would have been here tonight
erm they're applying for a grant of five hundred pounds for equipment being a senior stand ball cost two hundred and eighty and a new UNK for the boxing ring cost two hundred and twenty pound
er this is obviously in answer to the questionnaire yes they have four hundred and fifty pound in the bank and yes they do organize boxing UNK for self help
must say i know some of you don't like boxing erm i was at the last UNK in UNK
it was very well organized and i'm impressed with the way the kids behave at these dos and i'd like to see you support it
i see you've add three hundred pounds is that right
yeah
th that this erm what you bear in mind that this is out of our usual grants
did they have one this year
yes
yes
they had one thi but this is out of our grants
this is specifically for our youth grants
so quite rightly they've already had some support and at that time we didn't know how much money you know we were working on a different budget
can i just ask is ottery st mary erm boxing club and UNK
yes
they're
yes
one and the same
yeah
they thought it would draw people in from a wider
they're trying to draw from a wider yeah
area
my question
comments
yes i think we should er give them something but seeing as they've had three hundred pound i think or less or perhaps two hundred pound they've got the five hundred do they want erm anything else
they've asked us for five
they've asked for five
if you wanna give them half of that
two fifty
well you'll have to think how much
mr you know that's grant
yeah i know
work out all the way down
i've added it all up
well i well i mean i've had to do my homework before i come on this meeting for you and i and if i can start at the back and work forwards we have got enough money
right
right
we have got enough money
to give 'em five hundred actually
right
if we gave them the five hundred we won't we are within having said that we're not going to give everybody everything i don't think
so i mean i think that would be quite fair if we erm given 'em two hundred and fifty pounds at this stage or
further in the summer
two hundred
two hundred and eighty
well
well why don't we do that then
support one of the two items they've asked for
they've asked for a stand ball
cost two hundred and eighty
yes
you happy to pay that on receipt of UNK for that money
yes
yes
right
two fifty
no hang on
no you're
personally i mean i'm against er encouraging
boxing
but er i don't i obviously gone have a way of doing this but erm it's difficult if you if you're at the bottom of the
no
of the agenda i mean
it's gonna be alright
dropping off the end
no
i promise you i promise you that isn't
grant available
i don't think you
oh yeah
right erm
communities theatre erm of er th they want a grant to support their current production
now i've put this in a as youth because i do think there are quite a large number of young people in this and erm as broadly across the spectrum er as we can as we can give it erm they're expecting to pay three hundred and ninety five pound of hire charges for the institute and on top of this it's necessary to hire extra lighting as the existing UNK system is UNK for the UNK use
and they have a bill an bill of two hundred and fifty four pounds for the lighting erm they think it's an important community opportunity to have good entertainment on their doorstep and they've only been able to balance their proposed production this year by putting up the price by fifty pence
so they're actually charging people a little bit more to get in to the pantomime this year
i would have thought that if we were to put forward the two hundred and fifty pound to cover the their extra lighting bill that would have been money well spent
how much are they asking for
they've actually said that their cost of three hundred and ninety five pound out of which two hundred and fifty is for lighting
personally i'd love to see us support it to the UNK because i believe that you know the community theatre above all else in ottery really does give it a good name
excellent UNK
very well professionally done
and you know for a small place like ottery you know i mean UNK as far as i know hasn't got anything like this
no years ago
brings in all sorts of sorry
companies of ottery as a community place about five or six years ago weren't it
that's right that's right
that's when it all started
i UNK the first meeting in the institute
you know it's no amateur sort erm well it is amateur but i mean it's very
as long as it's going to run i mean i don't know i think i think they up against
everybody says give a bit more than that
i think i think i'd love to see us give this full amount
i mean i know for instance the institute charges for them are UNK them you know and to put on a production is incredibly expensive
and to think you know i mean one of the people came along tonight actually very much involved in it
the people that do this spend a hell of a lot of time and energy doing it
repairing UNK
i could i could go along with phil on that
erm it is a real community pro i don't watch it i'm not interested in it but it is a real community project and obviously reaches right to the family
the family of this community
and i think it might be as well to support it
right
trevor
i been thinking
right
we take advantage of it not just
well in actual fact we've cut down on the boxing bit
from what i thought perhaps
we could give 'em a bit more we could give we could give 'em the four hundred pounds
what that there
community together if you wanted to
well i think we ought to
depends on the success of their audience they got for the pantomime not
it doesn't look like
they've got to do it but i mean
i think we should you should support these phil
i would like to think they'd been supported the same as the boxing club but after all the boxing club is for youths and i think they've got to look after the youths erm try and find something for them to do as much as erm community
they work hard
i mean to my to my mind
they don't want to know
i mean a lot of these grants go sporting wise very few are arts type grants and it's something that a lot of people participate and a lot of people get pleasure out of
they put their they put their tickets up by fifty pence which is itself out
you see they do charge for people to go and see it
yeah
they do
they have to do
i propose from the chair we give 'em four hundred pound
i declare my interest mr chairman i think i'm the vice president so
they given the same grant
well why don't you get that in writing yeah
i was going to
right
all agree all agree
i don't actually think that a vice presidency is somehow should rule you out of organization
okay
move on to number one eight seven
the sports centre
now i think this is a very interesting reply to our advert
they're er th they've got three suggestions been made which to consider or discuss further
one is a lump sum to be given to the sports centre to be used to offset junior activities of their choice
the centre would then were promoting this activity as they weren't supported by ottery town council
this scheme would benefit anyone participating in the chosen activity not just ottery youth
two a lump sum to be held by the town council to be used as a form of grant or financial support for low income families students unemployed etcetera on production of the relevant proof erm depending on the individual's needs this could be either a full financial or part financial support for an activity of the person's choice and this scheme could be used purely for ottery based people
three a lump sum could be given to the centre for training employment of certain ottery teenagers
we have over the years employed several students but over the last few have been unable to do so for financial constraints
a youth training fund would enable us to continue this scheme not only with a view to employment but enabling us to provide training and development of personal skills which would benefit them in future employment or future education
there
three interesting concepts
purely a matter of personal choice
i s i like the first one
a lump sum can be given and then erm they administer it
but i don't know that we can get in the day to day running of the sports centre
how much have they asked for
well they haven't asked
but i in my workings out i'd thought five hundred pounds was the you know you can give 'em a lot less than that and not gonna fund much of an activity i don't think the silence was UNK
well i'm afraid i'm against the erm sports centre to be honest
for the amount of money we pay so much now towards this
yeah
and such like i think we support it very well
but then again it does do a good thing and i wouldn't be against giving them some support
yeah
but i think we do as a council support that sports centre very well at the moment which we didn't expect to be doing
well all i all i can say and i take your point is there is an awful large number of ottery people using that place and i think that i think east devon do a very good job with the sports centre and we all know the giving a
yes
four thousand pound a year grant
but this isn't one off is it
this is something different again
town clerk
i think just to answer that the pitch because obviously i looked into this and tried to get a reduction
yes
the amount we have to pay for the pitch is no fault of the centre it's the fact that east devon and devon county permitted competitive pitches to be opened up quite close
quite close yes
long after they said they wouldn't because i understand there was a firm assurance there wouldn't be other pitches around
and all of a sudden they opened them in competition
we lost the team we lost all sorts of things
yes but why they got the to offer it because we were promised that this event would be decreased
would be decreased
that given time they would be a self supporting but those of us there was UNK there was exeter there was UNK er they've all got them
UNK
but if we hadn't of paid the four thousand there wouldn't be a pitch there now
well that that's what they said
i mean wouldn't know i wouldn't know i wasn't here at the time
difference you know
yes
is whether you support richard 's initiative in coming forward to ask us to try and support a different scheme
perhaps a scheme where they say sponsored by ottery town council
i'd sooner see that UNK thing than er UNK a whole sort of like a hall or something like that
yeah
yes i agree with that
i think you have to be sure
to offset junior activities of their choice
yeah
i would it be would it be erm wrong of me to ask you say grant up to five hundred pounds and i go in and talk to him so we come back with a council with a scheme
we keep the money rather than just say there's five hundred pound
let's find out what scheme first
mr chairman i like i like the sound of that
alright
we've got to do that really
yeah
yeah we can't just throw five hundred pounds
i'd like to explore these
these additional schemes and not er UNK one
well
yeah
well i look on this all with a i don't think i don't think we regret east devon a step with every everything you come to
i would have thought the community
i'm going down to the
yeah
well i'm looking at this we didn't promise not about this any more than the community there once
well by very few people
more people could get benefit out of the five hundred then there what there is for four
i can assure you the way it's going at the end of the annual review
just going
at the end of no we won't
at the end of the night we're still gonna have some money which we've gotta get spent or w would hope to get spent by next march so we're gonna have you to come in again
we're gonna have to look for more you know it's december now
mm
and you've got the money to use by march
yeah
and they're all pretty valid and i can assure you that if we allow up to a maximum of five hundred and we check out what they're doing with it and we put all the right s it's not going to be money wasted
well let's put it the other way
why should we give five hundred to the sports centre and only four hundred to the community centre
cos that's what they asked for
or three hundred to the something else three hundred to erm
well cos hopefully
yeah
we're tying all these grants
yeah
to what people have asked for rather than just saying i mean it would be very easy if you said right all the people who've applied we'll give them five hundred pound each
but that's not really the way to do is it
why not give them what they asked for since you
because hopefully the product of this discussion is that we'll look at each grant judge it on its merits and then come up with what we think's the right figure
so i'll be proposing we have five hundred pound based on satisfactory outcome of the discussions
all those in favour
yeah i think rather a good idea
right
fine
busy UNK play group
erm they're writing on behalf of the to apply for a grant as detailed in the advert erm and basically erm it's it they're really asking for us for help to keep the thing running
mm
they're not asking for anything in specific
they're actually saying can you please seeing as you've got this money for youth help us keep the job going
i think they're they doing a good job actually
yeah
and we've you know i put down two hundred and fifty pounds
i think that's er that's a fair assessment for them
i think they will be well pleased with that to be honest
councillor
sorry er sorry mr chairman i'm just thinking about it
i don't erm i don't erm
you hear what he said
i don't see anything wrong with the proposal i erm i'm not against any of this
i mean i think we should er
they have they have sent up very detail detailed accounts
they are they're master of UNK specific amount
or have they
i second two hundred and fifty
right
all those in favour
yes
thank you
UNK vale hockey club
well they've sent us in an application er very detailed very go good letter actually
and what they're actually asking for is some help towards item of kit erm a UNK sixty pounds
pads hundred and twenty
chest pads fifty two
UNK is that UNK
UNK
sixty five pounds gloves forty and a set of shirts two hundred and fifty eight
they say a set of gear is costing them five hundred and ninety five pounds
they're running five teams from five to nine year olds upwards
they charge they charge twenty five pounds erm subscription and two pounds for each game that people play
erm they're actually asking us to supply one set of gear
so they they're actually asking us for five hundred and ninety five pounds
sorry mr chairman i'm only thinking UNK
i put down five hundred on my lists for you to decide
it is surprising how much this has UNK out in the last twelve months to be honest
erm the amount that young children and adults that are playing hockey now surprised me
i in actual fact went there and erm just thinking about it the amount of people that's involved with it now is UNK to be honest i didn't realize the interest was in hockey as it is
no
erm i would say yes we support 'em
to how much mr chairman i will leave that
we can afford within the scope of what we've got we can afford to pay five hundred pounds
you see then my argument is the same well why give the hockey club five hundred pounds and the play group only two fifty
you see that
you can't
the play group with er people with small children and erm
perhaps only thirty people in the hockey field
right
proposal
six hundred
yeah
i propose
anybody second that
all those in favour
it must be mustn't it
aye
five hundred out of the five ninety
again on receipt of the bills for that
we've got erm the next application in from the station centre for a youth and community activities
their problem is that they've lost five hundred pounds
which was the anticipated work for the detached youth worker erm project
they er are making the building available to UNK
they are supporting several other different users but clearly if the five hundred pound which they were anticipating doesn't come to them they are in grave financial difficulties again
whether you wish to support the that building
can i just make a point
yes
for the future
erm i've been in discussion because i've been trying to rescue their electricity bill situation which is again something which has blown up on them
their lease runs out at the end of i think it's april and we are going to receive an approach from devon county council that we become involved in any extension of that as a council and that perhaps we offer them rather more in the way of guidance which i think is their main need
and rather than make it into a viable erm organization
erm we're not ready with the proposal yet because obviously we haven't had anything to come to us
but if this station youth centre is to continue and i think personally that it is very important that it does and that it UNK
but it's controlled in a way rather differently to that which it's controlled now
erm obviously as soon as we get something it'll be put before the council but this is just an interim thing
yes
so that it stays UNK
i think part of the problem with the station youth centre surely is that we don't seem to know from one year to another what the UNK gonna be other you know there doesn't seem to be any forward planning whatsoever
yeah
and personally i mean i know having been there in the evening in that hall it's not very easy to hire it out but it's freezing still
you know i mean there's UNK coming in here and there and everywhere
the whole place has got an air of being run down and county council i think to be honest would quite like it to fall down or just to be able to develop the whole site
well
we've got planning applications haven't we
yeah
so i think th that the one thing which is good i think is a possibility of re opening it up and possibly using it to a UNK extent which might actually give it er new lease of life
well also erm the education authority if it were used properly would be prepared to make more money available to it
erm at the moment they're looking to give possibly a prefer a UNK grant to the one that's there now for any cost of a UNK from devon county council
they said what they mean by using it properly i mean
well this has got to come in a letter i mean this is what we want
erm they haven't said because at the moment it's at the end of one lease or nearly the end of one lease with some small horror stories in there of sorts and i think it's got to come on to
we did er we re we were hopeful that in the next few months there would be a full scale debate on the future on this building and that we as the council will take some initiative in actually the renewal of the lease
if we don't grant a what's going there now it could well be that by default the building will revert to the county council and it would be lost to the people of ottery
clearly i don't want to see us having just an open ended thing that every time they get into trouble we bail them out but i do think that we need to give breathing space now until we can come with a decent set of proposals for the future of the building
remembering of course that they have painted the outside the county council but clearly erm there is need for a fair refurbishment package inside
in my discussions with the police it was one of the buildings we offered them and i went with erm the new inspector to look at that and i still said they were somewhat put off by the cold UNK sort of feeling of the place
but there are possible
UNK there
i know that i know that erm the existing committee are drawing up proposals for their refurbishment of the place erm obviously to look for help towards it
i think we as a town don't want to lose we got precious few buildings for community use and i think we need to look at this to the different light now
i think we need to say okay in the future what are we the town gonna do to make this building right for what we want for the town
mm
rather than think oh well there's a couple of people group running it that's near enough and it's good enough
and i think we've reached the stage where the county council said you come to us with a new initiative and we're far more likely to be bend over to help you than under the present
so on that basis i would hope you feel that we could support 'em to make up the shortfall in rent which will in actual fact be paid on by them in rent to keep the place UNK
who runs the new centre now
it's the same committee run by er well it's the station and station centre for community and
it's used only
oh yes indeed there's quite a few users
st john's ambulance are based there erm they're all sorts of different UNK are you still involved in it
no
no use the theatre
yeah
it's got quite a lot erm users who would be without a home albeit boxing club
i think we'll have to support that
yes
as long as it's being used then i think we've gotta keep it
right
you're happy with the five hundred
yeah
i see wi with the additional five hundred last year i should think you couldn't do less than that could you
right
fine
now then that's one is the squad room air training UNK
now the reason we've got this is there are quite a few erm ottery boys who are members of this UNK and get taken down there by bus every friday evening and the town clerk erm went to speak to them
yeah i attended i used to run an a t c squad well i used to run the two different ones in london and a t c UNK and i must say i've been invited to the last two open nights
there was one about a fortnight ago and would have given my ears for the sort of civilian committee and the methods that they're using here compared with the ones i saw in london
it's well run there's a good attendance they've got some very good results on UNK this year and of course this is all extra to their school work
they're smart the place is well maintained and i think anything we can do to support the general thing there and certainly the ottery youth there is money well spent
out of their membership of twenty four do you know how many are ottery
i think it's about six
six
they've got two thousand seven hundred pounds in the deposit account erm they'll be applying to UNK town council for a grant er the reason for the grant they've asked for two hundred and fifty is to sponsor as many UNK as possible to take part in activities at UNK banks
which i guess is a
it's er UNK er training centre
er trevor
mr chairman this in actual fact i can put a little bit of light on to this i mean having had two of my children erm attended this air training UNK
basically th there are two members that come over to ottery and pick the kids up in their own transport when the a t c transport is UNK which they
they take them there they train them and they bring them back again in the evenings as well
i might my children in actual fact have been flown around scotland in the UNK and such like
they do a lot they travel all over the country er and i think it's a worthwhile thing i mean you see the kids dressed up smart
i in actual fact went to the er UNK day parade and to see those kids do a silent drill it's unbelievable
in fact it's very UNK
i
right could we
myself and i think it's a very good er
they asked for two hundred and fifty pounds
yes
the thing i'm thinking about i mean terribly keen on you know training wh whatever the basis for it is i mean we don't want to start a discussion on that
but must but i don't know how much further i want to go along that sort of line
erm but i think i mean don't we have to be a bit careful about supporting other organizations in other towns
we have given them a grant er a couple of years ago
i'm just thinking in terms of if i can just finish
well we do we do support sorry
if those six children you know turn out to be you know this would be this year or next year or whatever erm what's going to happen next year
you know are we going to get requests again when they aren't ottery children
i think we would have UNK that there are ottery kids taking part in that particular year
that is that is the least i've known it
yeah
six
i mean there's usually two car loads used to go across when my kids were there
yeah
i mean we do support don't we things like the talking newspaper across the area because there's and we do support like erm mrs 's holiday for youngsters although they are not all ottery kids but i mean the fact of the matter is i think we would need each time we look at any of this that there are ottery youngsters involved
well equally you couldn't have an a t c UNK in every small town or village in the country and therefore they've got to be i mean just as much as UNK valley boxing club has extended its range to get more people so the a t c have to be in some particular place
mm
because there's quite a lot of equipment supplied from m o d to support them
right
erm
they've asked us for two hundred and fifty pounds proposal
right i'll mr chairman i think that's alright
seconded
right all in favour
any right two hundred and fifty pound it is
one nine two the ottery st mary football UNK youth section
erm i've got a three four page letter from the ottery youth section erm and their we run at the moment three teams of boys between the age of ten and sixteen
er we have approximately sixty boys signed on for the three teams all of whom come from the ottery area
we have considerable success with all the teams in the past few years and even when not winning the boys enjoy their football
our expenses in running these teams include league and club entry fees UNK fees refreshments UNK for goals UNK and three sets of kit and changes of kit in case of a colour clash
we pay for each boy to have a UNK at the end of the season to recognize that he had represented ottery throughout the season
erm the kit that these boys are wearing is a number of years old and therefore we are going to need think about replacing it at the end of this season
we would like to be able UNK the kit so all three teams wear the same colours
to replace this kid would cost a thousand pounds
the fund raising we did covers our cost and we rely heavily on the UNK of parents and friends to provide transport every sunday
erm we are we are at present at the moment spending money UNK facilities for the youths
we've already used improved the UNK hut to provide shelter for the many people who watch the matches from which to serve UNK
there's still a great deal to do to upgrade the changing facilities for the boys all the work is carried out by parents and friends but the materials cost money
we're a forward as many ideas for improving new football
at present we have also got twenty five boys aged between eight and eleven who attend training for the under twelve team
only thirteen players can pick to play each week with a four in un under eleven team
and so it goes on
and finishes off by saying erm our youth committee chairman UNK have a forward looking attitude to developing and improving youth for many years to come for as many boys as possible and we would like to apply for a grant for a thousand pound to cover the cost of providing these new UNK for three teams
i hope you will look UNK on this request comments
are they asking for a thousand are they
yeah
i mean seeing the amount of kids that do go out there and the state of the changing rooms that they are using at the moment i think it's really UNK
three one hundred and thirty
yeah
three one three o
i don't know what you think mr chairman but i just still five hundred the same as the youth centre the erm
right proposal
yeah i second that
i propose
i propose
right all in favour of five hundred
hockey club
right
i think that's thank you councillor that's excellent
three six three o now
three six three o
we'll have the running total in a minute
right
er ottery st mary UNK roof repairs amount request a thousand pounds
membership of the organization one hundred and four boys
membership fifteen pounds per annum
balance sheet quote for three thousand pounds to strip the existing roof covering and basically well they're putting on a new roof
is this building here not so long ago
yes that's the ones where you put a little under six thousand
isn't that meant we say that i know time goes on but in years they took to pay the loan
so it's a ten year old building and they're
is it
looking to re felt the roof
and was it a flat roof
er
no
no it er i can't remember what it was
no
is it a UNK roof is it
i forget what when they ordered but i cannot remember now
probably flat one of them
hot UNK and
oh it's gotta be a flat roof then
yeah
in fact i mean yeah ten year
yeah
that's all you'll get out of 'em
they gotta
UNK
yeah
UNK the UNK
yeah ten years about right
what they're applying for
the bill th the it's three thousand pound and they're asking us for a thousand
looks a UNK i mean obviously we want to make sure the work's done
what do you think
i can't think what building it is then if it's got a flat roof
yeah they're all there's another one along the end
i have for a number of years
UNK scouts UNK scouts two fifty
yeah but UNK scouts you've already had one this year
yeah that's right
and this is i mean what they're asking actually to be fair to them they've put in for a thousand pound against three
they've asked for a third
they've asked for a third of what
erm
i go along as same as the other five hundred that's my way of thinking but i don't know what everybody else thinks
i think we should
we didn't we didn't on the first request
instead of giving it a grant they paid back their money
yeah they done very well really
would you would you agree to seven fifty councillor would you
i have nothing against the scouts i'm all in favour of them actually
i just sort of
mm
we can afford the thousand pound if you think it's right
they've got a hundred and four boys UNK and scouts
well they seeing the ottery whatever you call it they did put in a lot of work down there seem to be a lot of scouts about
i like to hear what the rest of erm the committee got to say on it actually
i mean it's i seem to be talking quite a bit here tonight
i'm glad you came
this year is it being these people must be given to understand
oh yes
yes it's up to us
it's up to us we either the club out or we don't
yeah
if we've got enough money i mean
thank you
but let's remember this
what we were criticized and several senior councillors quite rightly said the five thousand pound we were spending was only going to a very few
but now it's
what we've done tonight is spread that amount of money over a tremendous number of people tonight
yes
and you would have to say that the UNK gonna be far more far reaching than it was before
i think yes
so what we're talking about is
scouts or guides all use it or
i think they do don't they
i think they did
yeah i think they do
yeah
she did mention the guides when she came into the talk with me
i mean i think i think that considering the work they we ought to be looking at giving them the grant
right a proposal from the chair
a thousand pounds
all in favour
any against
fine and the running total there
how many hands have you had in favour
how many hands in favour
er all of 'em
i make it fifteen left
running out
four six four six three o
i make it fifteen minutes to go
i haven't done anything wrong
it's just that it's running out rather quickly
got there now
we have we
this is that's that one
that's
now we move on that's the youth one now we move on so we now we've got one thousand
i make it on fifteen oh two left
balance
one thousand five hundred and two pound left to spend
so that what did you make the running total
four six three o
that's it
so four six three o
and i added it all up to four six five o
so somebody had gone
oh i may be wrong
no i meant that's what i did before
well no don't pack your papers away
i did promise that i'd be away at eight o'clock
right
thank you councillor
you're late
nice to see you
happy christmas to you
thank you very much and the same to all of you and i hope you chaps will carry on and use it up properly
what
we were worried about that weren't you
oh that's alright
right move on to part two
move on to part two one nine four war memorial
can i suggest then can we have er UNK of what each of these groups actually want so we can see
right
fine
i mean what's the likelihood of
i agree with that
okay
yeah good idea
what we've got left in the kitty is one thousand no
no
two one o one
two one
it's this it's this figure on here of this is what you've given out as the total of five thousand
this now goes back to the ordinary grants money
right let's i'll run through this quickly what i put down
the first one i mean er this is not casting the stone but this is the way i see 'em all
the first one i think shouldn't come
not really
the first one i don't think should come under this grant i think it should go to enhancement
because it's all about UNK the area of the war memorial and i think that should go for next year's enhancement
the second one wo if we look to support the UNK and their UNK high insurance costs
i've put down the target figure of two hundred and fifty
the UNK valley talking newspaper we gave a hundred and fifty pound before and we have done each year
right
the ottery primary school is about UNK er UNK seat and i've put a hundred and fifty for that
and r UNK is to supply one container plus costs of getting it there seven hundred pound
in total that comes to twelve hundred and fifty out of a balance of
two thousand one hundred and one
so there's the b
so there's the basis of the discussion
right
alright
thank you
yeah
okay
now the first one as i say it's from a mr it's from a mr councillor of UNK it's erm i understand ottery council has some money available an immediately fund that can be used to enhance the environment
could we suggest paving the area around west hall war memorial
i think that falls directly into town enhancement for next year
town enhancement
yeah
all agree
yeah
right
use all of it too
fine
erm the next one is purely from the UNK er towards their erm er expenses and they say that insurance has risen from three hundred to twelve hundred pounds
basically it's another one isn't it where whatever money we put towards it and the end of the day what they get left with comes back into the community
you know they pay they pay
oh yeah
various charities
the insurance for what er public liability
yeah
yeah
ridiculous int and they're having problems of getting
that's the only thing that's gonna stop the UNK
yeah
you only gonna have one upset and that's to be the end of it
but why have they actually said to ask specifically i mean you can understand it in terms of the cars or something cos a lot of people are claiming for everything right left and centre
but i mean there is not a lot of UNK barrel rolling around the country
well what it's all about is that er the UNK have seen things on the telly etcetera and horrified with the result
yes
and basically they're running out of companies who are prepared to insure
yes
even though they haven't made claims
trevor
mr chairman erm i believe we have had a breakdown there haven't we
any
a break
any way of giving a breakdown of what money they give out do they
donations wise yeah
erm
would you could you read some of those
yeah
donations
well in nineteen eighty four they gave out four seven five in prize money and three hundred pound in donations
by nineteen eighty eight it was up to five hundred and five in prize money and eleven forty seven in donations
and in nineteen ninety three they gave a thousand and forty prize money and paid out two thousand one hundred and sixty pound on donations
they haven't give you the breakdown of donations and who they give it to
they have
could you give us that
last year's
right in nineteen ninety three twenty five pound to the police UNK and UNK hundred and fifty to the girl guides two hundred and fifty busy UNK two hundred pound to ottery football a thousand pound to ottery UNK association two hundred pounds to the w r v s for talking books for the partially sighted fifty pounds for the primary school and fifty pounds for the st john's ambulance
they also supply computers as i understood
no
no
but there you are
all things within the town
and they're giving quite a lot back and i know you only give it as a as a guide mr chairman but two hundred and fifty pound i would think that would have to be doubled
the amount of money that they give back to this community i would like to see it supported
right
that's what
used to be a UNK on UNK
oh dear
i thought they used to run a carol service
yeah it's gone
car carol weren't there
oh sorry it's seven o'clock
okay
let somebody on the
i'll second i'll second that
well that somebody on the committee propose that
i'll propose it
it seems a bit strange though cos i mean UNK we seem to be giving back to the community
the community
i think what they're saying is that unless the money to start with there's no UNK definition that they can carry on
when they've raised the money at the UNK
so they need the money as capital up front
up front
i do think it's probably
a good idea that the council back the UNK
supports it yes supports it
oh yeah i mean i've nothing whatsoever against it
sure
i think it's brilliant
yeah
so we'll do that
i'm a seconder for that
what was the proposal
UNK proposed five hundred pounds
yeah
right
all in favour
yeah
okay erm the UNK talking newspaper we've supported this before
erm
it's them again
yeah we with this been ongoing we've given a hundred and fifty pounds to it erm well i say i don't see it on the top one
i think it's pretty well supported
bottom one
pretty well supported
top one on the bottom one
there you are
all in favour
two hundred and fifty
right
th right the next one's a sad little one
it's about vandalism of a school of a seat outside the primary school
erm you may have heard that UNK destroyed our community seat on the long UNK lane last week
the seat was given to the school for a mr headmaster and as a gesture of UNK to all who pass the school
you'll be all to aware of the school's financial circumstances and understand we are unable to afford replacement or repair
my staff and governors wonder if the town council would be willing to help and restore in the much loved seat
hundred and fifty pounds
fair enough
right
will that cover the cost of the seat
no
does don't it
not quite
though about the one that's going in the UNK they're just on two hundred
they're very good seats
oh well if you wanna make it two
i'm taking your word for it
i thought hundred and fifty covered it
the time they set fire to the
right
well
i would like to see us cover the cost of the seat
proposal
yeah that's the least we can do
two hundred pound
right
you'll given them a new target to go for a
right
give them a new target
well
mustn't give in to UNK must we
well there comes a time
right
one nine eight
it's you've heard the er presentation by carol for UNK
they've asked us to provide them with the finance one container that's five hundred pound plus two hundred pound transport which will be matched by the community council if we do it
so in actual fact we're grant UNK them to get two of their four
i think this is a very actually mr chairman
i think
the only thing the only thing that worries me is that the thing gets priority
well yes i got the advert
the they put the advert in and she UNK them
i've got those sort of prices some time ago when we were
well
looking for one for the
yeah
the bowling club
we are we are paying nine hundred pound at the moment
she's got she's got well they've asked us for seven
if that does the job and on receipt of the bills i think we should support it
yes
i think they've got off the ground and they've shown a lot of initiative
i think she yes she presented it well
okay
all agree
i think that means we've spent a bit more than we planned
that i've put down erm anybody added it up as we've gone along
yes fifteen fifty
fifteen fifty
fifteen fifty which leave us a balance of six hundred pounds does it
yeah
yeah
okay
i think that's a good position to be in now er one more grants meeting before the end of the financial year
well i think we're on the right on the right side of it
move on the buildings
the schedule action to be taken relative to necessary works
now you've all been down and looked at the state of the playground below
i think we put the erm report and the guarantee which we've had from UNK in solicitor's hands and he is in the process of contacting UNK
yep
UNK have said that they don't consider that the guarantee covers us
but i would suggest to you that we need to press UNK and say you know you the conditions of the guarantee we feel we'd comply with and wait until we get anything back from the solicitors before we do anything else
i'm pleased you've all seen the state of it
but i don't think there's any action
i think it may mean that we'll have to call a meeting quite quickly after this one to discuss but i really don't think we've got the basis of anything till that comes back
i don't know what the rest of you feel
can i just make the point that we are due to pay the next erm annual subscription for this guarantee
erm it was due to today actually
on the solicitor's advice we held it
erm in the letter that you s sending by fax tomorrow you tend to indicate that it is held while the UNK sorted
if they say we've got to pay it well then i'll have to come back at the council meeting
if not well it will held pending what they do next because there's no point i mean UNK i think frankly rightly said that the guarantee is not a very solid document
if this is the case then i co wouldn't be able to propose to the council that we continue to give UNK two hundred and seventy quid a year
for nothing
for nothing
so therefore
if you refuse to pay it they not worth paying
no
you've got to be very careful on that
no
the solicitor is wording it that we're not refusing to pay it but we're just holding it UNK
holding it in UNK
as long as it doesn't UNK the guarantee
well that's what you've got to be careful of
gentlemen i do believe fellow councillors what we've done now is asked the solicitor to take the matter in hand and so i do think until we've got advice from him it would be for us to actually recommend any other
so i think we may have to take this as part of the council meeting when we get a report back cos obviously there's a degree of urgency in whatever we do about this but i can suggest that we can do no more than report back to the next council meeting that we've discussed this and that it is in solicitor's hands
can i ask mr chairman in your opinion had we carry out the erm works or anything to do suppose to do
i mean
my only UNK opinion is that the thing is so UNK and UNK that we could claim we have and they could we haven't
mm
i'm not clear on reading the fu
i haven't read the full report
i will say that roy dealt with it when it happened and i know at the time he was very thorough over it
mm
i mean i know we spent a lot of time with the former clerk
mm
and with UNK and if you remember at that time as he rightly said last night the idea of going with UNK was that we thought they were a UNK firm
mm
and thought we were doing the best possible thing we could do
dennis was also an adviser on it
yeah well there you are
i think it
i think you can stand to correct me but the problem being with these things that they're so
it's the typical get out clause this isn't it
how it looks to me is that most of it was UNK towards the bit that they were involved in last time which was much more to do i think with the police officer i wasn't here but you know
UNK it yeah
and it all sort of refers to that part
mm
did they do structural work last sunday
or was it was it all dry rot treatment
yeah
typically
yeah
well i think what we gotta do
i must s
what's happened it this
what's happened is this
at the moment the solicitor has the report which it took derek quite a while to find cos it wasn't filed where it should have been
but we've now found that and it's gone to the solicitor's
in the me we hadn't actually had a chance go through it properly ourselves
and that's something we must do before the next meeting so that i can answer the questions cos we don't really know at this moment
one which was actually carried out
we just put it all in UNK hands really
mm
thought we were doing right
now we've got to go into the fine print
mr chairman may i ask
what happened what happened to the property next door they were going to put the claim against the council
yeah well th that all UNK out in the end didn't it
well i don't know
we have we have a problem of course erm in finding the exact root of the problem we could possibly
you see so
so there's nobody can really
no
define it
well that did reach a conclusion with the solicitors didn't it
if it's any comfort it's just been sold next door
so whoever's bought it
bought all the problems yeah
well apparently what's happened there i do know because erm one or two of the people who looked at it got involved and whereas the property started out at some figure in the high hun hundred and fifty hundred and eighty thousand something like that
it was actually sold for something in the region of fif fifty thousand
because some people came in and had offered sixty that's what i was told the last lot that came in had offered sixty
fifty and then UNK but it's around that fifty sixty mark
oh
can i ask mr chairman if it's possible for us to have a copy of the reports
is it is it possible
you can borrow the copy can't you
yeah
i'll give it back to you
would you would you look at that and perhaps you
i will look at that yeah
perhaps you'd speak to us at the next council meeting then
if i get a chance to look at it
yeah
fine
okay
christmas reading then
okay
that's what i want yes
erm there be no other business
i like to close the meeting
thank you for attendance
and this is the final council meeting before christmas
wish you a happy christmas and a peaceful new year
and just mention
just mention that there are there is carol singing around the tree at the bottom thursday seven thirty
has anybody any idea why it's so late
because we can't actually make it because we're going out somewhere else but we would have done it if it has been earlier
it seems funny cos you know small kids go there
well that time of the evening you mean
yeah i mean i would have gone
i don't know why
i mean basically we have had organize it this year
as he has other years
is it any later than normal or
i said
no it's always about seven thirty
is it
yeah
i think one of the things to be honest is to avoid the traffic
because that's quite a lot of traffic going through there
nice evening
i love it
i happen to tell you that it's we hope that the tree will be lit
it's lit again at the moment but so far we've had something like fifteen UNK stolen and when that heavy rain comes it fills the little cups and goes bang and the gentleman today was busy UNK things out of the fuse box where i think it had gone again
so
it's we lit tonight
one piece
okay let's see your essays spend er twenty or thirty minutes talking about the essays and the remainder of the tutorial talking about er the exams because this is the last time i see you before your exams in the tutorial anyway erm so just a few UNK and tips on exam technique
right
right by the way are your aware of erm professor erm which visited nottingham at the moment
tony is er professor of economics at cambridge and is a world UNK in economic circles and er he's here for the next week as a special professor and er is giving a number of lectures er most of which are open to all to all students and he is a very famous UNK very clever chap you know if you can get to see him i i'd UNK i'd recommend it erm UNK there may be a sort of programme of his visit stuck up on the student notice boards erm if there isn't er he's giving a lecture tomorrow two o'clock in b seventy four and that's if he is going to be talking to the m a students er taking economic development and policy analysis and his topic there is comparing income inequality and poverty in europe erm so if you know if you are free tomorrow at two it just might be interesting to go along to feel free to go to b seventy four tomorrow at two o'clock
erm there's another UNK the economic society putting on a lecture at five o'clock on wednesday er in a forty two and the topic there is what's happening to the distribution of income in britain and he is also talking to the public sector
take public sector economics and also taking a couple of lectures there one on targeting social security and er another lecture on an inefficient on the official poverty line erm if you want er well you can get the details from me afterwards but something like that could well be on the notice board if you want to go along and see him
he is a famous chap dick
if you've got time it might be worth spending an hour listening to him
see what he s has to say
c can we see his
yeah sure
thanks
he's a professor of economics at cambridge and er
it's very big and cos he's in the office next door
er right amazing
anything else
did you get my instruction UNK adjustment
yes that's hello this is just an article that we went through last tutorial adjustment developing countries
has everybody got one on this stage
that will just save you er copying that yourselves library
right let's just briefly run through this er essay on migration that so some of you answered can't remember would somebody tell me the title of it again
it was er what are the major factors influencing migration decisions in less developed countries and how might this affect the urban unemployment
okay so er where shall we start
is migration just generally is migration a good or a bad thing
i mean well why do people migrate
getting married
okay they're UNK from an area of low incomes to an area of high incomes right broken the route
migration scenario
is that a good or a bad thing
right okay depends whether they can get they can get the jobs right erm what was our experience say when er u k france spain was developing
there was a lot of rural urban migration then was that a good thing or a bad thing
does it help or UNK development of those countries
sorry
helped
yeah helped yeah why was that
well you answered it in the first in the first answer that they got jobs they were employed er the rural labourers were able to get employment in urban areas er where wages were slightly above those wages that they could reasonably expect in agriculture and because they were actually productive making goods and services they helped the development process
there is the same true in countries that are developing at the moment
no what's happening there
you get high levels of urban unemployment there so migration to the urban areas and not finding employment situation
that's right in a current case of in developing countries now
migration is UNK the development process and that is quite different from when the now developed countries were de were developing fifty hundred years ago
so how can we explain this UNK situation of high unemployment in urban areas and rapid rates of er rural to urban migration
why is it happening it seems UNK i mean in theory erm you know the migration should be driven by the wage differentials right and migration will UNK will reduce those wage differentials
did a lot of the emphasis on
that's right that's the reason why they move
w why do why do people move i mean if they know there's urban unemployment why you know why do they move
i mean if you've got a UNK situation here and there is very high unemployment in the urban area yet migration is still is still an ongoing phenomenon wh what may account for they actually again erm a well paid urban job and they migrate
right so they may think that you know they're gonna be one of the lucky ones presumably
how about if i said well the reason why they migrate is that they don't know about urban unemployment you know if you know it's a lack of information problem
if they knew that the unemployment rates were twenty or thirty percent in urban areas that they wouldn't migrate but because they don't have that information that's the reason
i mean does that hold any water do you accept that
i mean it's a logical it seems UNK anyway erm empirical evidence however suggests that isn't why we have rapid migration or such a large degree of migration
empirical evidence suggests that erm migrants are reasonably well informed about employment prospects in urban areas
right so why do they why do they still move
well tom suggested well they could be one of the one of the lucky ones that does get does get a job what other factors might account for
do they see erm if they migrate to the city in the urban areas then they realize they won't get a job and have a job straight away er well paying job but by actually living in the area they would and taking in at a job and they get a lot of contacts and then eventually after a period of time they job
yeah i mean that seems a UNK way of getting into the er the job market er what would harrison UNK erm say you know because they were saying that this migration this migration was perfectly rational despite there being high levels of unemployment
what was the basis of their argument
why did they say that migration occurs even when we have high UNK unemployment
yeah okay over oh what century were they
long term short term
that's right they say
they say even though unemployment rates are very high now people are prepared to wait ten years before they get a job
current levels of unemployment are relatively UNK hopefully some time down the line they will expect to get er as a relatively well paid job erm because agricultural incomes are so very low you know and urban incomes are relatively high they may be prepared to wait for you know five or six years in the urban area making what could be sort of a subsistence wage simply because that's all that they're gonna be on anyway if they stay in the rural area so if there is a higher probability of them getting a well paid job merely by being in the urban area making these contacts then they might as well move to the to the urban area in the hope of some time in the future obtaining that er an urban job
right okay
so what i mean we've been t talking around it at the moment
what are the factors that affect the migration decision
does em does empirical evidence well i think you probably say generally that there is some economic factors and there is some non economic factors which of those two does er empirical evidence suggest is the main driving force behind migration
is it the UNK of the bright lights or is it something more economic
yeah UNK what appears to be the case is that it's economic reasons that are the main drive the main driving factors from er the UNK
although there although there clearly are important non economic factors
the bright city lights that's not what makes people UNK their UNK their lives and go and move somewhere else they are after economic UNK and that's the driving force er behind migration so just before we leave the non economic factors what might they be
the non UNK economic factors this er erm infrastructure services
okay right anything else
just wanting to get away from traditional
yeah they may feel constrained in their very traditional UNK of life dominated by religion or some er some restrictive erm
UNK of the of the society
anything else you can think of
weather
yeah that's right due to s lack of infrastructure in the rural areas it's much more lively but erm the disaster of one form or another of one form or another will have a much more important effect well that's simply because there's a flood then you either swim or you sink you know there's no there's no help a at hand
in urban area there may well be mechanisms in place five against so on and so forth to sort out these problems
okay right erm so what seems to emerge is that it's economic factors that are the most important er UNK affecting the UNK decision
right so migrants move to the urban areas erm due to the presence of higher wages there
what are the reason for my account the fact that there they don't obtain these higher wages because clearly there is this income gap the differential is driving the whole process yet economic theory tells us that the migration should UNK that gap between income in urban and rural areas
jobs to go around the people who do migrate to the urban skilled enough to jobs
okay our economic theory assumes our economic theory assumes that both labour and capital are perfectly mobile
are different sectors in urban areas
one that er they call the that is the state over employed people and the casual and formal sector had wait dates in the formal sector they don't meet and if this sector does not create many jobs
right okay so
formal sector wait
for opportunities
yes
to emerge
that's right all we've got here is that although there is a high degree of migration the wage differentials are not er UNK because we don't have perfectly mobile resources like are theory tells us that we do have
clearly the labour is geographically mobile it's not UNK mobile so the people that move don't necessarily have the skills required to take up these high wages
you obvious supposed high wages in the urban area
what other reasons might account for this urban rural wage differential just generally higher er standard of living er just cost just prices er yeah the cost the cost of living may well be higher and as a result employers have to pay higher wages
train staff UNK trained
yeah could be important who are the main employers
who are who's offering
yeah that's one of the reasons for the quite an important reason in many cases why there are ways of large wage differentials that's because there's a minimum wage legislation
does that does that
they don't assume it could be one of the factors that leads to the higher i mean all these things they don't actually say what cause the differential is to them
say there is a differential what affect does that have on mi on migration that's where they sort of start from erm who were the import the employers because er when it says you know it says UNK wages are higher er in the urban areas partly due to higher costs of living partly due to the minimum wage legislation but also another quite important influence
there are some ways of government on wages
what do you mean there martin
i mean some are better wages because they are subsidized by the government
right
which welfare policy by better wages
that's right it's erm its UNK that in developing countries er the civil service or the government sector is very large relative to the to the economy now whereas say u k or somewhere like france the government public and semi public er organizations employ ten percent of the workforce perhaps a bit more in france than the u k erm in developing countries the government sector can be you know over half of the total urban employment in some cases it's seventy and eighty percent of er employment
now it is generally observed that most civil servants whatever country they come from make sure that they er give each other pay rises and i know it happens in this country the civil service pay pays quite well and it's certainly a key erm feature in er pay structure in developing countries that if your if you work for the government you are very well paid like government wages can be you know four five six ten twenty times
of the national average and it's not because erm they're paying high wages to get the most able people it's because there are mechanisms institutional mechanisms that keep wages high there's no market in the jobs for th these are UNK but i think they are fairly true erm UNK there is no market for er for the jobs for civil service jobs that appointments are made and it is much more important who you know than what you know and the old boy network as it's called in this country is fairly important in the english civil service but a similar sort of network tends to be far more important in developing countries something that is UNK called UNK erm but we might call the old boy network or er jobs for the boys whatever but erm
do they issue them part of the reason that of them having higher wages is that part UNK are bias that they have a higher wages and they think they will have a stronger growth in the industrial sector
well because there is er an industrial bias erm what industrial bias means is that gets subsidized because it's subsidized they can pay higher wages er erm so it's not just the government jobs that are well paid it's the industrial jobs
now because the government has a plays a much bigger role in the economy the government will be in charge of what you might think of as industrial employment so er a lot of manufacturing heavy industry er mining so on and so forth will be run as a national as a national industry right and er wages in that nationalized industry will not be er set at market levels but will be set at by some institutional mechanism that won't reflect demand and supply or reflect the rent seeking and rent server rent preserving behaviour of civil servants and government UNK er so on and so forth but you must bear in mind that the government sector will er the public and semi public sector in developing countries is vast in comparison to er to develop the countries and as a result wages set in er in the government sector er will erm will be the driving force for all industrial employment so what with wages and industrial employment
okay erm
what's erm what's a quango
quango government appointed body essentially
check i'm right i think i can spell it it's a q isn't it quango
yes
it's not so accurate
no i don't really think so it's a name given to a body so semi public body appointed by government
like the n r a
sorry
like the n r a
er are they UNK
they regulatory
yeah that's a
o p q
how do you spell that
i am just about to tell you q a p u UNK quango it's a q u a n g o semi public body with financial support from and senior appointments made by government
yes that's a semi copy body appointed by the government or possibly with financial support from the government
right erm okay let's just er wrap up here
what was the main er outcome for UNK harrison UNK model
they could explain why it was rational like for migrants to migrate even in the a even in the presence of high unemployment
what was the policy and UNK
of that analysis
basically government can increase or reduce unemployment by increasing labour demands through just handing out more jobs in the sector
that will create more migration
right so it will be UNK self UNK job creation in the urban areas will be self UNK and most of the reason why that was particularly important because historically most of the job creation schemes that governments have put in place with or without aid in developing countries is in the urban areas you know it's the erm subsidized industrial plants subsidized erm UNK manufacturing industry right so that the import UNK industries er have been set up with government and or aid money foreign aid money and what harrison UNK was saying you're wasting your time putting money into these big projects right because that only in that only in erm UNK th the migration problem because it really will increase people's perception of er job possibilities in the urban area they think there are jobs being created by government there that will happen as another as another stimulus er let me just draw a little diagram what harrison UNK was saying right we've got time here such to say horizontal axis marks the UNK of some representative UNK then you've got wages in the agricultural area and wages in the urban area like let's just say that this is the wage rate in agriculture right
now what the potential UNK will do harrison UNK assumed was to say right what they'll do is that they'll these migrants will mentally calculate the present value of receiving w a throughout their lifetime right and they'll discount erm those wages by appropriate discount rate reflecting the fact that a hundred pounds today is worth a lot more than a hundred pounds twenty years' time or thirty years' time
right so something like that and so this represent i mean you can figure this line as being sort of the real wage over the time you mention increasing throughout
is the real wage over time so at this point let's just say that's a hundred a hundred pounds and this is ten say two well UNK is thirty years and a hundred pounds erm today is worth er no
yes it's worth two pounds in thirty years
what you can buy with one hundred pounds today will buy just two pounds in thirty years
no that's erm a hundred pounds in thirty years' time is equivalent to receiving two pounds today that's right as you say
okay so if we just UNK this area right that area there represents the present value of the discounted stream of income
right over a lifetime okay if we could sum this it seems the time is continuous with the integrate right over time we'll just get the area of that and that curve
now let's say that urban wages right are up here and that it's going to take it's like this individual this amount of time to get er a job at that at that wage let's say that's the expected wage of the urban area okay
if we again discount this income at the time or get it looks like that
so this now represents the discounted value of the urban wage overtime
all this potential UNK has to do is to say well does that area right exceed sorry this area
chalk
okay does that area exceed that area well that's clear from this little diagram yes it does
well what are the key factors that will affect the relative sizes in these two in these two erm these two boxes
well the first thing right the differential between agricultural wages and the expected erm urban wage right would create the closer these lines are together right the erm smaller would be the difference between this area here and that area there
what other things are important
well it's the time taken to gain employment the time taken to gain employment in the urban sector
what is the expected urban wage
well it's the actual urban wage times by the probability of getting a job right therefore the probability of getting a job is also going go going is also going to be important erm
this diagram doesn't actually incorporate this but full thing is going to be the initial costs the costs of moving okay so there may be actual physical costs involved this diagram
right so those are the things that are going to be that will that will be important
right erm just finally given that the main conclusion of harrison UNK model was that there's no point erm having job creation schemes in urban areas because that just UNK the problem of migration
right what should we do
UNK if migration is a problem i think you will all agree that it actually UNK the development process what should we what should we do
create
okay creating jobs in that sector or creating
okay if that would raise agricultural wages or
well raise agricultural wages will reduce the number of people wanting to
to migrate
to migrate
to migrate to the urban sector
okay and UNK how best to do that though
because it looks like you are advocating supporting agriculture
okay so what do rural developments schemes
you will reduce the erm wage differentials as well
wi it may well do it may well produce the
wage differential
increasing
yeah okay i mean this is all what these schemes or what the current school of thought is
initially you know development meant higher than wages alright you know making these erm er sort of producing cars and high technology goods in urban areas in developing countries was thought you know that's the way that's the way ahead and these big projects whereas now the thinking has changed and it's let's promote infrastructure education erm in the rural areas UNK rural areas themselves right erm UNK any other policies so yeah you may want to erm invest in agriculture and i don't mean some agricultural support but erm promote well yeah make roads educate the population erm UNK agricultural technologies
any other policies that you might think of
compulsory UNK that's the main problem here too many bloody people about that's what's needed population control well that's what's done that's what they er you know a lot but not compulsory well sometimes compulsory
but we don't normally get money from the world bank to er get the UNK out erm the note er
population control in terms of sort of contraception awareness so on and so forth is a major the it can be a major means of reducing this particular problem
