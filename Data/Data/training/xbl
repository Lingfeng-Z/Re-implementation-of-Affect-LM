because part of the problem is that there are too many people in agriculture and if you can reduce the population UNK allowed right wages will virtually rise because labour productivity will rise because there is less labour on the same amount of land
er any other policies
some of these countries in africa though they've got like compared with the population they've got loads of land compared with somewhere say like u k so if that's the case how come they've got so much surplus labour
well because the labour in say this country is over productive this has an awful lot of categories attached to each unit of labour that's why labour is very productive is that you for each unit of labour employed there might be ten units of capital i e there are chemicals etcetera the reason why erm this pressure on the land in say africa even though the density of population was much less and that there's virtually no capital there right so in order to produce the food you know the labour has to till the soil by hand and spread the seed by hand
surely that would require lots and lots of labour though wouldn't it
mm yes that's right
so there should be a surplus
well it's just that for that i mean that's all it's all relative for those conditions there are there is too much labour on the land you erm if you could increase agricultural productivity in a way that would UNK labour and that's very difficult to do well you can you can do it er most capital is labour UNK but not all not all capital erm so you could whereas i see i see what you are saying is that why well the you could g you could you could do it right even though that there are a lot of people on the land er you could still make them wholly productive by giving them more capital that wasn't labour that wasn't labour UNK like you give them better seeds for example like that would increase the productivity of the land there wouldn't be so much you know population pressure on the land er because everybody would have enough to eat and we could er actually sell something right
any other any other policies that you might want to pursue
say that's population control investment in agricultural infrastructure and technology education and what's causing this problem in the first place
do you have er sort of reduce the industrial
yeah that's what's causing the problem very high urban wage rate but it doesn't reflect market forces so if you erm reduce the subsidies given to er industry
erm and get rid of any institutional price setting that there may or wage setting that there may be in those in those industries
you know i hate to say it but privatization might be required right there's too much government involvement there's too much erm er there's too much UNK right by and large there's an awful lot of er UNK in developing countries their government sectors are very large
okay just before we go first we get a copy of er exam papers this is from g you may already have a copy oh blast
when you are talking about er public division does standards er british and with other companies from er western economies
okay so
there is there is a gap in technology er now
that's right apart from
these government run industries in these developed countries they are subsidized to a very large extent and they are not competitive on the world market
so UNK this company there will er they will fail in competition with erm
they may they may do
if that's the case you know resources shouldn't be going into that particular industry or there is not a direct economic case apart from to the social costs that they be involved in
that company going out of business erm because er large scale government UNK erm is so UNK in developing countries er the a lot of the government's UNK being spent on what are inefficient or UNK industries
mm
and that's UNK the whole development process because it's high wages high wages creates migration and the whole resource allocation reflects in the economies er are UNK and because people are moving out of agriculture because they can't make any money from agriculture they think they can make some money in industry like agriculture itself is being UNK of capital and er so it UNK the development process i mean it's a complicated business but er there may well be some sort of UNK of sense that we can draw out of this one of which may be well if the government sectors are too large in these countries essentially it doesn't matter who owns these companies whether it's they were privately owned or government erm if they are inefficient they are inefficient
yes
and if that UNK was causing the problem it's not the result of the ownership er there are inefficient private companies it's just that inefficient private companies tend to go out of business whereas inefficient public ones can be maintained with UNK
what i'll do is that i'll final of action shortly and i'll tu
that's my last copy that's what i'll do i'll photocopy it before you go and er give you a copy each
don't worry i the exam i'm leaving at christmas time
alright oh i see you are not sitting you are not taking the exams
last year's exam they er seems to be exactly the same syllabus more or less yeah
can i just say just a couple of points before you go erm you are all fairly good at writing long answer essay questions but you are probably not so good at writing short answer questions right
now it is very important that you write good short answer questions because you think they're
in actual fact that's where most people fall down and last year
is it marked with a fifty
yes fifty given it exactly the same way
it's much easier to get good marks on a short answer question than it is in theory to but most people don't because they don't apply the correct technique so to writing short answers
we must have in a short answer like there's a definition most of the concepts there will be erm defined effective protection its UNK trained creation or trained diversion there will be concepts that need definition economic jargon so you must have an equal er definition in there and you must have examples of how this concept is used right say erm er one of those about don't make UNK dumping
write a short essay on UNK dumping because define what UNK dumping is you've also got to give at least one example of UNK dumping right so you don't have to give any detailed examples just erm e c waste er food policy in these days UNK dumping would be subsidized after exports in order for america to sell its few exports it has to so it is best UNK definition define what it is give application of concept erm if the concept involves measurement say how it how it can be measured say an effective protection trade er say how it could how it could be measured
er and then discuss any problems that there might be is it a contentious issue
er or are there is there are there a couple of schools of thought on this particular subject well essentially what you must do is write something about everything you know about erm that this particular sort of concept don't write everything you know on this particular subject like you have only got fifteen minutes
so it's is it better to write a little bit about a lot of things
yeah
rather than a lot about
that's what you must do if you get if you write a lot about a couple of things they'll say erm this UNK knowledge is pretty specialized on this area you know what these er short answer questions are picking up right is your is your general knowledge
so it has to be sort of like written in comprehensive
oh yeah
written UNK
but you know so you
it's like writing an essay you've got to try and get as mi many things in as you would do when you if you were writing a full essay but instead of writing a paragraph on each thing you write a sentence on each thing try and cover as many bases then that's how you how you get very good marks it's not they are not trying to test your erm your deep knowledge about any one thing in these short answers they are testing the broad venture of your of your knowledge alright so what you want to try and do is to is a UNK approach when you UNK you answer these questions
yes this these diagrams
don't touch it with a barge pole they take too much time but very rarely do you need to write to draw the diagram in the short answer questions
that's about the only difference between writing a short answer question than writing a long answer question is that the long answer is a is a good idea to have a diagram
in short answers unless it is crying out for a diagram don't bother because you'll spend five minutes drawing the diagram labelling it explaining what d p and d s means and it just won't work it definition application measurement problems contention
yeah
is it a contentious issue erm ho how is the criticized very short because you are only going to be writing for about a page a page and a half right so just make sure that every sentence or every other sentence carries a new bit of information and then people say good this person knows everything about this subject full marks and you and er but it's all too easy to focus on one or two aspects of say a question on trade or er harrison UNK model of migration
if you sp if you spend five minutes drawing a diagram or going through the equations person knows one aspect of this model in great detail what they want to know is what was the importance of that of that model important results of the model
how can we criticize it how well does it actually fit into what happened in the real world they just want little bits of information but not too much depth on anything but always remember empirical evidence examples are very important what i would do is using those examples or la last year's exam paper practise the short answers because you can't write very much detail in it so it's a good idea to have some idea about how much you can write then your expectations will be changed okay
right if you have problems er before you leave or when you're advising afterwards i'll be here throughout UNK and before your exams so come along and you go through
holiday are you
yeah
full time
yeah if you want to come and see me please do
yeah alright

mm
about this you are wasting your time er then hopefully you if you are having a problem to come and see me and i can tell you if it is a problem or whether it's not it's not particularly a problem so you know come along and see me
thank you very much
right but have a lovely holiday don't forget to have don't forget to have a holiday don't revise all the way through
okay
okay cheerio UNK
recording in edinburgh on the evening of friday the fourteenth er UNK
UNK
and see the sheet number one in terms of context government area from mrs
terms of sponsorship
the first subject is sponsorship
well does it act
does it does it act that question does it act in the modern way and if it does how much does it act in the modern way
i mean you must see it yourself
okay there must be a reason for doing this but er i'm more concerned with getting oil out north sea
how can it help me do my job point of view the reason is that it can help you do your job is very simply that to involve members of the public er local councils local authorities decision makers and allows the outcome to erm entertain them and to erm hope for and communicate what it is they'll come erm in a non threatening non selling non hard sell environment where they can come along they can enjoy themselves and go away and form their own opinions without somebody over the head with what they're try to sa trying to do erm
i suppose while this is for me cos on the sponsorship issue is would sponsorship have any impact in terms of what i might purchase so if i went to the scottish opera or the ballet or to the theatre and i bought a programme which i usually do and one of the things which is interesting about the evening that erm alan and i spent last time at scottish council was that half the people attend scottish opera buy a programme and the programmes that i have sponsored always
would i then purchase their goods as a result of a programme being sponsored by that company
now i cannot think of a single occasion over the years my UNK when i have been going to theatre arts events of any kind when i've actually gone out and bought anything as a result of sponsorship of a programme i've been looking at
now i mean i okay i'm only one person i mean is round the table is there anybody who can say that if
quite for me it depends on i in a sense i think it's perhaps more UNK
in simply why not and simply hoping that someone's gonna go out and buy your brand of petrol for example erm i think for me it's erm there are so many messages UNK at people every day erm do this do that buy our product instead of x and UNK product but when you've paid when you're faced with that purchase decision and i would say perhaps this is true for most people from most jargon
i think erm if you shopping performance the week before and if the programme have been sponsored by UNK then it's possible that if you were in your local erm UNK shop and were faced with a number of alternatives to buy there is possibly a chance that you can buy UNK
mm
it's very desperate and i'm not saying that you would do it back because of that but it may just be the thing that influences you to buy a particular brand particularly the things which are heavily erm which have many alternatives to buy
i mean er imagine you the programme should be really sponsored by soap companies
alan what i don't know the answer to what you're proposing i really don't know the answer and er i mean i can only go on the my experiences and my experiences are i've never ever consciously or not aware of ever having bought any as a result of
mm
now interesting because erm one of the things i did before christmas was i went out to and it i think it's my memory it's sixty percent of scotland is gets its power from nuclear power
sixty per cent of the
yeah
central group does yes
yes and that means forty percent doesn't it if you know what i mean so we can make an assumption that hydro electric UNK a chunk of that
convention
yeah a convention
so therefore was there anything for me as a consumer go along to the theatre have a back programme that has been sponsored by hydro electric to use the bad example
i mean it makes no odds does it
no
i mean i think the message that they were communicating last was that it's about them being appearing to be a good
yes but the interesting thing in last night's
he said and i don't think that they were meant to be perhaps they were meant to be in order of importance
the first was the reason for sponsorship was UNK and publicity the second social responsibility the third brand development with special reference obviously to the drink companies
corporate UNK to be seen to be involved and to win awards
now my view is that i think rather like your comment on christian doing concerts scottish UNK er standard life scottish hydro scottish power scottish nuclear i don't necessarily see it as making influence to make a decision to make a purchase or to recommend a purchase to the third party in another part of scotland
right
but i do actually think that one considers they're playing a part in the community
now the part they play in the community depending on your political statistical or whatever leisure interest viewpoint may be that you think they haven't got the combination right but that's obviously a very subjective thing but i think that i mean the UNK and the social responsibility UNK i would have thought are two of the most important for people
well i have to say that as a result of last night's session i have a much UNK view of hydro electric and i do so would i have got that from the programme
see what i mean
i mean we were in a particular discussion last night i mean that chap was making a particular point and we were able to ask questions and that was very useful and it helped everything else and as a result i have a view that hydro electric have a certain commitment to the community and i respect it for having that commitment
i was particularly impressed with the comments that mike was making about organization makes to charity which it doesn't acknowledge it doesn't sort of er seek to UNK erm but i wish
programme
yes they UNK but i wouldn't have got that from a programme
but you see one other person who was there last night was at one time involved with a major no longer major scottish company which did all its substantial charitable giving UNK once a year through its lawyers because they decided that they did not wish to be publicly associated with any particular thing and then the representative from john lewis said last night
yes
that john lewis doesn't publish its erm most of its charitable giving either and that they done quite a lot
but that surprised the man in the queue and yet interestingly i think that and she said i was right in my assumption that is part of the partnership philosophy of john lewis that they work in partnership with their staff and in partnership with the community and they make their profit which is generated to start through the community which they sell to and therefore they quietly give back without wanting to play their own UNK and in a sense i think that's how it should be
from a personal point of view i think that charity charitable giving by er companies whether big or small should be erm should be erm on that basis i mean they shouldn't be looking for acknowledgement but unfortunately in the real world companies are looking to see what we can get back in terms of the investment they make and
but especially peter let's think about people like ourselves and the kind of work we do
if you and i were working for an organization which gave say half a million to charity our i mean correct me if i'm wrong but i i'm sure our temptation would be to say how can we promote this giving in the media in order let's be honest about it to make our us look good partly that would be it
you know there we are the marketing communication p r people whatever we are and so therefore if that organization we worked for gets published in the media positive company
but then you're back to the centimetre argument
well no i'm not actually back to the centimetre cost i don't agree with the centimetre argument er the centimetre argument i mean i'd rather have one good solid paragraph which
yes
says a lot than twenty that said nothing
but that's right i mean when i
cos people don't read the nineteen centimetres anyway
that was the interesting thing that said to UNK last night that a three column centimetres depending on which UNK it is or paper it's in can do you far more good or damage than twenty at another
mm
it's about perception
yes
i mean most companies would rather the four centimetres or whatever over a or and says that says things they'd like to hear than have erm than have say er which basically
provided they know that that's the game and the problem is i and i don't know about you peter or you
getting the manager's
but i have actually worked for organizations where they do see it in terms of those centimetre UNK erm measurements and that's a you know i mean it's funny when i've been giving talks on communications erm one of the things i say to people is erm where your stuff appears is crucial don't worry about one and page three
where it doesn't appear is crucial too
mm
but i'll say is it on the gardening page is it on the letters page pray for the sports page i always say and people look at me quite you know with a quite a look on their face when i sort of say that and i'm absolutely serious i'll say you know if you get a four paragraph story on the UNK page you're home
if you get a four paragraph story on the letters page you're home if you've got a full page or a two paragraph story on the sports page you should go out and celebrate and because those are the ones that people read and look at and that's what's important to them and that's you know that's that message that you
it's very hard to get that across to some people
but i think that's that is the erm UNK managers and my own
yes
view is that one hopes that my hopes are that of the direct report you er worked for erm is equal and competent and is erm in a sense UNK and brave and that they realize that sometimes to get the best results you have to do things which are perhaps challenging and UNK
yes
erm one of the best programmes that i UNK in was a programme where yes money was spent to get matter for UNK as it's called
yes
get maximum press coverage and it looks good but there is also equally a very considerable programme running very gently sort of going at the community working with the community holding hands with the community and getting results erm a policy for
but it is one of the isn't one of the other interesting things about the sponsorship the potential the partnership and UNK as
mm
opposed to the nation
i agree
i mean it's interesting you're using that second you used erm UNK a number of people are saying to me you know that UNK is a word they have problems with
i have no problem with UNK or i love the word UNK because i split it up UNK increasing the power we all have for god's sake what's UNK about that
i mean it's about sort of you know in it's about increasing the erm where we are within our own particular sphere and it's far too much i mean people it's interesting that i mean for the it seems to me an and once again correction but it seems to me the last five years the UNK thing was really strong and now managers are moving away from it and saying it's jargon as a means of UNK it
i think i
and an and therefore taking away what
work appear to be philosophy let's go out there let's do it individual we can deliver the goods
now because of the because of the unemployment people are scared
well then you change the words
about changes you know
yes i know yes but i mean it's interesting at lunch time i had a i had a working lunch with someone and a month after we had finished all the work and stuff we got on to a whole pile of other things and i was talking about some of the UNK and one of the UNK i was talking about was feminism and how i'd been in an amazing meeting a few weeks ago where you know i used that word and the women it was all a meeting with women the women there had absolutely UNK at the use of the word feminism and UNK
was that in UNK or
yes
at the
yes
yes
and you know i actually had phrases like UNK burning thrown at me and erm i said that feminism to me is about having the same opportunities as men and i put few of the phrases er you know along those lines and so everybody round the table said well yes i believe in that too i said well then you're UNK and so it's about UNK or UNK words as well and you know you just made the point about changing words but how far do we go with this
do we get to the stage where you know you look at the word UNK do you change the use of the word UNK because people are saying you know well that's jargon and all that doesn't work any more or can't do that any more
well a case where you
or one other word which is to say that sponsorship is enabling because if you go into a partnership like a b s a it enables you to get the UNK similar government funding
now a b s a show there's an organization called the association for business and the arts
and what that means that if an organization which has not sponsored something in the arts before decides to do so the government will give a similar amount of money er at a lower ceiling of a thousand and up to a maximum of forty thousand was it
mm
yes so that if for example a company called twin plugs or something says right we're going to sponsor a concert because we're opening a new factory and we think this is special and we want to do something we will put in ten thousand pounds
if you do it through a b s a the government will give another ten thousand pounds so of course for the orchestra or the institution whether it's opera ballet concert or whatever is but it must be arts gets the extra money so of course that in a sense is very enabling
one of the difficulties that actually struck me last night about an organization like a b s a is that how wide and in fact i've got something in my filing cabinet next door which will tell me if i looked it up how wide is the umbrella of the arts because we don't have anything similar for sport we don't have anything specific
you're absolutely right
for young people and if one of the things that UNK to my mind have a positive duty to do which is the social responsibility and we live in a society so increasingly UNK and you know not so far away in places from UNK that they have a duty to do things which effect maybe to see one the bs not the a ones the bs
surprise
well then you don't know me
but in fact what they should be doing is planning effort into things which UNK the fabric of society and to UNK families
mm that's right
and to deal with problems of substance abuse unemployment UNK rather than things which are fashionable and to my mind highly like opera and the ballet which isn't to say that i don't love them both but i think that you have to have a sense of complete reality about the social issues
but then that question was asked last night erm from one chap about sport versus the arts and i suppose to me it is a quality of life issue erm where do you start an and stop i mean you have a problem when you have a recession don't you where you say okay we i we are in a recession we have got limited resources we have to make decisions
we can cut money off let's make some easy quick decisions about cutting money off let's chop out the arts you could do that on one line easily and i think you have to look at the long term you have to look at what happens in terms of our culture our civilization if you do that how people change and to me it's about and that was raised last night too about how an saying that they had put a limit on the cost of opera tickets forty pounds compared
two fifty
two fifty
price of the ticket
yeah
bloody hell sorry
and a minimum price in glasgow of three pounds
fifty
so even if you're in the or whatever you know you could still enjoy a meal and so that is about making it special to everyone
i see that as a big change i mean i see that i think that was coming without sponsorship
i think it would be to survive and to get the audience its erm its target audience was getting smaller and smaller
mm
and it had to appeal to a broader group
i mean last time i was at an opera was erm i had these tickets now erm i took my sister and a friend of hers
do you know what the total price of the tickets would have been if i had to pay for this one hundred and ten pounds
mm
and there's no way i would have paid that
the opera was great but i wouldn't have paid for that i mean compared to rock erm a rock concert performance and most of the rock concert was twenty quid a ticket
yeah right
you know what i mean
i know what you mean
er it's just i mean that is just ou a box we had dress circle tickets
then of course then you go back to government subsidies and whether or not they are UNK are prepared to pay government subsidies so the tickets don't cost the price you were talking about
mm
erm and of course you i mean look at what you were talking about with rock
okay as prices are cheaper but you do have things like coca cola getting to those kind of things and everything else which you know where they might not to opera and it's because it's more popular and they know what they're doing
talking to huge
don't get me wrong i'm not saying that companies shouldn't sponsor ballet or opera but i think they have to not lose sight of sponsorship potential with the disadvantages as well as the anonymous giving branch because small amounts of money to some organizations may do UNK more than the scottish opera
i agree with you
but mind you i again and terms scottish opera
i think issue
huge issue th the scottish opera and the cultural organizations don't think that i'm being very left wing when i made my points peter
i also i also actually said that a co a country that does not promote and sustain its cultural heritage in the UNK sense of its world w in a word e er i is a country without a history and if you lose your social history and your culture then you can't progress
mm
which is probably very tried but i mean if you imagine the whole of britain with no UNK no concerts no ballet and no opera none of these things then you would be a very UNK society
we certainly would
one of the UNK to that it has now become so expensive but is very difficult but not because it was sponsored but somebody told me the other night that the billy UNK programme excuse me billy UNK programme about art and culture was
the rome one
er yes i mean rome
it was very well presented and that whilst billy UNK freely admitted he was not in fact a culture UNK it was his enthusiasm that in a sense having his own that make the programme apparently a complete and utter joy and in a sense that's what sponsorship should do it should do for art music ballet and opera what UNK and UNK have done for the environment and UNK
but er well you see but billy UNK brought an audience to that programme you would never have got
mm
billy UNK socialist people all switched on to watch that programme because they like billy UNK it
it's like the chap that did the opera harry UNK did a series of opera programmes
yes
it was very clever i watched the first couple because people who like harry UNK characters switched on just to see what he was like and before you knew it you were twenty minutes into a half hour programme and you stuck with it to the end
that's right
and it's m and again it's all about opening things up it's about putting in erm getting someone like that and all that erm
UNK
yeah UNK the word yeah
er
you see to me there's an issue the power is cricket
now i i'm your least sporting person but i quite like a good test game and i was in australia when UNK did the whole thing with what i call pack a ball one day cricket
now i have friends in UNK who would never look at be interested go to a cricket match in their entire life
pack a ball introduced them to cricket
the go to one day games they like the excitement oh everything is wonderful
i compare test matches to more like the UNK game you know it's slower and you sort of you know whatever but these are people who would did not to test games you know they didn't sort of say okay we've now met this pack a ball thing where you know and everything else
when i look at test matches the game the one day game was an itself
now making these points to and then to go backwards still about what we've been talking about and that is it's the same with the opera and what you were saying about harry UNK and everything else that you can an and billy UNK you can bring certain groups of people into areas where they wouldn't previously have been but you will not necessarily take them on the next leaf so for example this is all gonna sound UNK and i'm sorry but you know i mean a lot of people like UNK and UNK for example but will not move on to UNK or whatever it is and will never do that and i mean i have a problem with that i mean it to me it's not we're not it's just reality but we have to understand that i mean we have to understand that in the context of sponsorship
and about making you know the next step on survive
i mean i think you and say that you know i mean i think test matches are simply because you know over time you know people are in to the one day cricket match be the excitement and everything else and it's getting increasingly more difficult for television companies to get sponsorship commercial sponsorship for
but the thing that UNK me last night was the statistic about UNK do you know they said when UNK started when UNK started doing the erm UNK cup it cost them five thousand a year
they pulled out at a point not where the cost they thought wasn't worth it but they pulled out because people associate
and that UNK cricket now runs at one point two five million pounds
one point two five million
well er
and really with the UNK image of being what it is you see i found i
cricket really
yeah i found
i found it interesting last night because of course my reaction to all that was imagine how UNK did it matter
UNK with cricket rather than UNK given that when they were in the supermarket UNK they would say that was it er a friendly name
no but no but obviously no th the association was only with cricket not with the product so it wasn't UNK the initial product
so what it is they're saying
you see the association wasn't being made
it wasn't including sales
i mean there was a superb advert made by film director and he made a superb ad advertisement
for apple macintosh computers erm it must have been about three or four years ago
everybody loved the advert but couldn't tell you who the advert was for
well there's an increasing number
yeah people could just switch off and then it apple macintosh erm i think with the UNK decision was part of the UNK seemed to UNK themselves in advertising to
wonderful
i mean i erm there was a i think there was a beer ad on television the other the other day and at the end of advert they were advertising beer weren't they you know
yes but you see
and that's right you know
whatever it is the silk advertisements
yeah
because they're becoming so UNK now that they're becoming an e exercise in erm UNK or UNK or whatever in the same way into the same appalling state as the annual report disease is becoming a design competition not an annual report presentation of financial figures
yeah
gosh i'm getting my some of my hobby horses in aren't i
well you're suggesting a back to basics campaign is appropriate here
absolutely
showing a bit of up peter
i'm just making an opportunity here
before you get too political you must remember the only time i've been actively political was for an independent candidate
agents so there you are
actually i've only ever been a member of a political party for three months of my life and i resigned
which one
on principle
the tories i resigned on principle when somebody suggested i could join a women's committee and i said i thought
oh god
it was absolutely the end
they actually do that very well i believe tories
and i erm i actually like to discuss back to basics for a while erm on communication perspective i in some of the what's happening at the moment
do you mean you think the tory party needs UNK
oh that too erm that we are had if we are saying that this evening we are looking at communications and different elements of it i think this is an area which if ever there was an example of how perhaps not to do it how to blow it UNK it's probably the best one we've had in decades
erm i was very interested in an interview i heard last weekend i think it was with pete when he made the comment that he wasn't interested in back to basics because that was looking backwards a lot of people in the past lived pretty miserable lives
we saw them we should be looking forward
that was the interview with mr heath i think earlier on in the week
was that the one in which he was asked by ni not nick but the news at ten chap
yes
that wh who in the government would he dispose of and he sat and smiled gently and said well he wouldn't have appointed any of them in the first place
erm well i mean i think there's some very fundamental issues in all this in the communication spectrum first of all using the phrase back to basics what do people mean by that and that's where the they have gone wrong because the problem is that here we are four people round this table and i'm sure if all of us were asked what do we mean by getting back to basics we'll come out with a totally different you know set of things that meanings
actually erm that's what i was erm i have wanted to ask you so
yes
what if what does the basic m basics mean or basis
well we need a politician to tell us because none of us are very clear
it's a very valid question it really is
what is meant by it and what has happened erm is that people are making putting an interpretation that back to basics means back to looking at our UNK and of course
and of course we've always had a different view about what UNK are anyway all of us i mean once again if we went round the table and say you know expand on your moral position i'm sure we would get four probably ten actually different UNK
i think you'll probably get
would you
possibly yeah
is that UNK thinking
i think no i just think that i think that the british people forget there's people around the table that the british people are actually pretty sort of liberal and tolerate overall and er i think the problem back to basics was government UNK and they got john major
mm
and the problem has been that human beings are human beings
mm
and er life is like that and i think that your average UNK or forty four home tonight are sometimes you will get married and you have affairs and kids are born out of UNK
i'm not saying it's right i'm not saying it's wrong that's the way it is that's now let's just get on with it but we shouldn't saying that
yes i mean issue with UNK children or his affair means that i mean even the line he was running is okay because i'm rich so it's not gonna and it's not gonna and so he's got these two sort of values that if you are a single parent and you're poor that makes you lesser and more UNK than if you were a single parent and you're rich
rough mm
mm
but in fact back to basics to me is rather like my kind of personal creed
were you in that meeting the last meeting before christmas when we did the talking round the tables
mm
i missed that
for me back to basics is how i find most of the time to run my own life which is there are two teams and on the one hand there's compassion integrity and courage
yes
that's a
and on the other side there's UNK
UNK and UNK
i love that word UNK
yeah but you know when you i mean when you feel sick you remember the sick and it's c i c against c i c and you just have to remember because in fact courage compassion and integrity can actually help you to deal or to try to deal more or less UNK with any circumstance
mm
for me i cannot remember who said it someone far UNK than far UNK than me but somebody said a judge is civilization by the way he treats the
oh yeah that's right true
you know and that's right because it's special and i really think that you know the u k and perhaps we can world some countries like UNK and so on because of the high taxation have been able to keep their
but even they had a problem and this is more deeper more philosophical but i mean i really feel that sweep out the streets something has gone badly wrong and that an effect not just to those individuals but greater fabric
oh but then that gets you back to UNK to sponsorship would actually scottish power do more good for its image with the whole of the population if it sponsored a UNK or a care caravan or a soup kitchen
well that i mean that
or go back right coming to UNK the
yeah i mean i saw something interesting last night
about to get back
in terms of the people that wouldn't sponsor right
mm
i mean community groups were part of it th they didn't sponsor those they did sponsor individuals i mean it's interesting because example that in UNK individuals and teams example involve them sponsored by UNK on drug charges and sign their interviewed about his drug charges UNK t shirt on and so he said that you know one of their criteria was criteria was not UNK individuals
and i mean what is scottish opera but a group of individuals
i mean i er i mean i just don't know how you begin and end with this actually i mean i really don't and i mean i think quite frankly if hydro electric were to go out and say okay we will fund the purchase of twenty houses four bedrooms each for the homeless right i would have thought in terms of doing something i mean i walk round UNK street and i see those poor UNK and i say to myself
why
why
we live in this UNK society
i don't know about you three i would be prepared to pay an extra penny in my tax or whatever to make sure those poor UNK are not in that street
which is which is by and large by and large has broader liberal
oh yes
mean you know that would give the chance erm
do you know one or two of my friends UNK me two years ago for taking food to somebody who was sleeping in the gardens
i went into the gardens one sunday morning with the dog found a body in a sleeping bag and i really didn't know whether i thought it was alive or not alive so i went rather closer and i got a very defensive angry UNK from a young man and i said to him i'm not going to ask you to move because you've probably got nowhere to go my real concern is are you okay
you know given that life is as it is are you okay and he said yes so i went round the gardens and i came back to him and i had a friend coming for lunch and i thought this is ridiculous i'm going to have something to drink and i'm going to have a meal so i made him an enormous great UNK of cheese sandwiches and some apples and a piece of cake and some biscuits and a cup of tea and i went downstairs with the milk and the sugar and cup of tea and all this stuff and i went into the gardens and this poor child he looked very UNK a second time and i said well i thought you might like some breakfast and i wrapped the second lot up so if you've nothing later on why not put it in your pocket and eat later in the day and i didn't know whether you took milk or sugar so i thought i'd better just ask you and do you know i thought he was going to cry
there's an interesting point in there
isn't it amazing
mm
he was a UNK depending UNK and er situation that what you described but we were handing out food at christmas eve to people and people were coming up and er for their own proud they were saying things like i'm a UNK or i don't eat cheese UNK that was the case that was the only thing you had left but i mean it makes me really angry that we did not have this situation ten or twelve years ago
that's right but you know that it's only the are only one of the major supermarket chains that gives money to organization and one of the organizations in glasgow there was an article in the UNK or the herald the other day and i mustn't quote names because i can be wrong but one of them and there were major s major stores selling food as well as actual food retailers UNK but only one of them will give food that's past its sell by date or surplus or whatever for one of the glasgow charities for the homeless
now that seems to me quite extraordinary
well if you remember what it is let me know and i'll buy the shopping from them and that is an influence for me
it really is i mean i still feel guilty and it might sound daft to you but i still feel guilty and what would my have done about i was down in london a few weeks ago for a meeting and i was coming back on the UNK and i got the train to UNK and erm i came out at the wrong spot so i had to walk out of UNK underground and then round to go to UNK station rather than going through
there's a park when it's a beautiful area
and up the steps out of the underground there was this UNK there and i can't help it i mean i'm always aware of the fact of having this twenty five year old child so offspring and there was a girl roughly about his age or slightly younger and she was grey you know that UNK look your skin gets when you're not eating properly you know that grey sort of UNK and i had an overnight bag in one hand and a UNK and a UNK in the other and i remember i walked past her and she was begging and i had gone to the UNK and i'm sitting there and i'm thinking you UNK you could of put UNK down overnight bag down UNK down and got some money out
now okay you know the you know the one person you can't do anything for but it's the way this UNK looked you know and then about a week after that i'm in UNK street and i always try and er you know buy the issues
mm
issue
well it's just been UNK successful er and i know i UNK what you're saying think it's been successful because are beginning to care again
yes which is fabulous
they've got the opportunity to do something
just super
but anyway i gave it's fifty p i gave the UNK who was selling it a pound you see and she said here you are waiting to give me my change i said no and she said and i said to her i said you know you need it more than i do and she got tears in her eyes and i thought i mean i don't know if i can UNK this properly
i just don't
and they said it was going on and they were pleased with it
right well what is the i'm not quite actually clear what're they doing for us
so you didn't all have a UNK out there and have a look at it then
no unfortunately i missed part of the evening and i don't know whether they had done that previously but when i was there they didn't do it no
the only one i would mention chairman is not strictly accurate we all did lots of us anyway the british UNK service on sunday at the church and i just wondered if we could agree to send a letter to the president cos once again a lot of effort and time and organization went into it and i thought it was an excellent occasion and i think he might appreciate
fine
he should be UNK for organizing it on behalf of the council
well he will be sending us a bill i can pop it in when we get the bill
i can assure you that i did and i can assure you that i have already UNK him on behalf of the council UNK his hand and said how well he done it but if you'd like a letter to go to say how well he done it then i'll send a letter telling him how well he done it
he always sends us a bill
well i think he should have a letter anyway definitely thanking him cos i mean he did like
i suggest after we get the bill else it'll it went up last year
right i just thought the chair would like to thank councillor for the immense amount of work i know that he's been putting in over certain things that have been going on lately and i now take UNK questions if any of you got any for me
thank you
erm i would like to close by saying that erm i just thought it would be just a nice idea that i would invite any of you members of the council and wives who haven't got anything else to do on christmas morning if you fancy popping up to my house for a glass of UNK or whatever just on a casual basis as a little thank you for what you've done over the erm over the last twelve months i extend that invitation to you all and district councillors if they wish to come and i would like to say on behalf of the council that i hope you all have a this is the last full meeting and to everybody here i hope you have a very nice happy peaceful christmas and i hope we all go into the new year with renewed UNK
chairman i do have a couple of questions i do have a couple of questions if i may
oh sorry
i thought you'd done that
very quickly audit report audit report do we have anything on that yet
not yet
erm well we it's been accepted and i was i was something over and the lady was horrified
i'm awfully sorry about it
that's good
and the other one i wonder if the council would consider over sixties club i ought to declare an interest i suppose erm have two hundred members and they are distributing this christmas as they al always do a three pound voucher to each of those members in office you know and i just wondered whether the council would consider a small contribution towards that expenditure
we do obviously make grants to youth clubs and organizations
we've never made a contribution to this club
i w
perhaps you'd like to talk to somebody a before the branch meeting
if that comes in i don't think i could take it in
oh no i'd
could it be referred to the grant first
could we get something from them
well it's up you know all i was asking
i was just UNK you said you when you said is they're issuing three pound to each member
three pound voucher er well not voucher no erm box of UNK
yes that's right
do you get one
you don't get one do you
my wife was embarrassed today yes
you what
someone called her up yeah
i'll make a note of that one
well
well it's nice to end the year in such good humour
ladies and gentlemen thank you for all for your attendance
i'm sorry about that mr chairman but er i don't know if that's correct
well just have a look and see if you think it alright
yeah fine
could you phone in the morning
yes
as well as
yes
says it would be we could get his opinion on why the
yeah i know him quite well
it appears to be that it's off the rails
finances i think they're well up on that sort of thing
oh yes they're very well up financially
that our total spending is still nought
nought
it was indeed
could we just ask
i'll fill it in
oh i'm not
eighty eight
yes it's on the set you've got it's there
well i'll read it out to you and then you can amend them
on the official ones it was resolved totalling four one two five and sixty pence for october and six hundred and seventy one twenty five for the t i c
can i just explain why that was
the books were at the auditors and i didn't want to hold up the minutes and as you'd all mostly seen them anyway i felt that perhaps i could let them go
it does help with our twelve month projection if we haven't spent anything
it makes you much closer to budget
thank you for bringing that up
with that erm with that exception can i sign the minutes
agreed
thank you
move on then to matters arising item four number one three four uses for the old hospital
erm you will remember that after the last meeting we were going to have a meeting with mr which we which we subsequently did have and we put forward several erm possible uses for the old hospital including re UNK of the library UNK of the council offices police station day centre for the elderly day services for the physically disabled for young mothers and children centre and for a mental health services centre and he was delighted that we had the meeting because he has to meet with his UNK late in december early january when he has been asked to put forward ideas
they are considering now short term UNK rather than sell on the market as it is at the present and they are including the clinic in the buildings for which they are looking for alternative uses
so i think we er UNK further developments on that
erm item two one three four an update from councillor
it's been UNK by events in that you have apparently had an application in and that's being studied when next monday
yes it'll come up on monday next erm no monday fortnight yes twentieth
there is a planning application in for thirty four flats that will include UNK into flats as well
right there's not a lot more we can say until that
at this stage we can't but it will come before the council on the twentieth
let's make certain this time nevertheless chairman that this council does spell out very thoroughly reasons for objection if they wish to object and not missing anything out
i think we always have actually
this is a new a
i take your point and that will be looked at thank you
right item three one three four footpaths
it was my pleasure to chair a meeting between all interested parties at village hall
erm having been told that the county council were running the meeting i did find it a little difficult to chair but i do think that we've come out of it with some constructive ideas
erm perhaps the town clerk would like to comment further as a er developments as you see them
well it was a very successful meeting
i mean considering there are only about five hundred people in there were just on forty people present in the room which is quite a good average or percentage of them and er a lot of the questions were quite positive and the chairman sort of took them there were one or two people there who obviously erm wanted to have everything either exactly as it was or whatever but it looked very much from the conversation that i had with the UNK afterwards that in large part this scheme could be accepted
erm the only area that i found that er there was a particular wish to keep was the road le was the path leading down from down to itself
they really don't seem to want to have that part closed off but that part along by the river and that seemed to be almost entirely er satisfactory to everybody and er chairman UNK off one or two other people quite well
one of the warmer meetings i've done but th i think that we did come out in the end with all bar four people in the room i believe that's right councillor is it
four was it
er the vast majority seemed to be generally in favour of the package and it was a small number that did seem to me
i think that puts it fairly well in er perspective and hopefully now the county council will come up with the er d
erm it shouldn't it should be noted that the er land owners are prepared to pay for a fairly expensive UNK on their land to cure the problem and er i hope that this council's initiatives follow through and a twenty five year old problem gets UNK
thank you chairman and town clerk and councillors for attending that meeting because this has been a problem here for so long that i think all of us would be delighted to see it resolved to the er satisfaction of the local residents
right item four UNK eighty five one three five working party
i agree with the town clerk
he feels it's time we actually set up a working party
well unfortunately we were scheduled to have a meeting erm something like ten days ago and then two or three of the key people had to drop out so i cancelled the meeting because obviously we want the people there who were going to actually get the thing up and running so that we can UNK a first public meeting and i would like erm you know now to establish a working party but again a number of the people who one would expect to be on it are not here and it's slightly awkward
i know councillor is quite happy to be on it i would hope that councillor is
yeah
how many do you want on it
i want at least five and i just wanted to erm establish that with one or two other people who er presently attend the tourism meetings are invited as required rather than to every meeting
er how can we take this forward
er i presume we actually know that and are on it
will be on it automatically
erm you were thinking
ya
two others
ya
and then UNK as they
as we need
correct
ya
wh anybody with a UNK ambition and desire to be on the working party
or will it be another one that i have to join in with
oh well and a volunteer
will volunteer if they're not keeping anyone else away from things
wonderful there we are
i'll establish a first meeting as soon as i can
the odd name there with a familiar ring to it i fancy
however we move on
item five UNK eighty six one three five public seats an update
well i've circulated the letter that i got from
i don't agree with it because there are certainly seats there which are their responsibility which are not on this list particularly around this memorial outside and places like that and erm quite UNK they're theirs
what i would like is for all the councillors to look at this to advise me which other seats they think are indeed the responsibility of and then i'll go back and go to battle but er i'd like everybody's views on which ones they believe they are so that i can do it firmly
erm has had chance to cast his eye over that list
no
well if we could send that with the UNK and perhaps if they've got any we can't say that er i view this as very much we've got a platform here
they've accepted the responsibility for a number of seats
if we can get a few more accepted under their responsibility so be it
there's the old seat up that they seem to UNK but that's the last old seat of council the old fashioned seat
you couldn't find that one could you
yes it's there
it's responsibility
councillor good evening
chairman good evening gentlemen
there is a seat by our place which council have always maintained
it's not on this list
right well we'll include that one then
if you could let me have these in writing it would make life easier
how do you know they haven't maintained it
could you just drop a note in to the town clerk as to where that is
i appreciate what you say but we wanna
it's over the road just beyond our
well i'll leave you to liaison with that
right
fine thank you for that
that's progress
eighty six one three five level crossing gates
i'd just like to say a doesn't it look wonderful the one gate we've done a i saw a i saw a train coming last week
however the problem is that mr is not keen i think it's been a labour of love doing the one he's not keen to do the other one
he says he doesn't feel that he can do it does he
i wrote and UNK him on behalf of the council for what he'd done but it's now a question of finding somebody who can match it
so at least now we've got a specification to go to w we know what it looks like and er we've had one or two quotes in the past week and for UNK those up now and chosen exactly what we want them to do
i mean before it was a little bit difficult to describe exactly what we wanted
he's certainly done a very good job on that one it's very
mhm i'm delighted we've done that
we'd really like the other one done by the tourist season because it's the sort of thing to send people to look at
is it
well compared to some of the other things that are supposed to be tourist attractions
come and look at the gates sub contract planning committee which has already had a look at that
that's right yes
you agree that the contract sub committee looks at that d rather than the council
all agreed
thank you
right number seven UNK eighty eight one four six policing update
successful i think the UNK going in downstairs today is that right
it's er the box is there it's just gotta be the actual phone UNK gotta be put in
right
it's all UNK up in the back as well
and i will although he's here thank him in front of him moving mountains to make sure we get an increased police presence in
i'm delighted to say that we're gonna have w what a unit based in here isn't it
section
a section
the best thing i can do with your permission council is invite inspector to talk about what we're gonna do for er a police section in
have i got your permission
yes of course
yes
agree with that
yes
seconded
alright thank you
two points that i wish to update the council on
the chairman's already er done the first which is the box outside
i know that wishes to take a photograph of the chairman and myself on wednesday
you won't both get in it together
standing in front of the box
it won't be picture will it
but of course it is important that the box is er in operational use before such a photograph is taken so i will endeavour tomorrow to er to resolve the situation of actually putting the phones in the box so that er by the time wednesday comes and our photograph then it is up and running as they say
the other thing that i wish to update the council on is my deliberations in respect of establishing a section here at
now as a background to that i actually had one of my officers at undertake research of the in to establish what the demands were made upon us from th the section which includes at the present time
erm she actually UNK back calls on the station log and it was done from the first of october nineteen ninety two to the thirtieth of september nineteen ninety three and during that time we had over five thousand three hundred and thirty calls of which one thousand one hundred and sixty six UNK from so that is erm twenty point three percent of the calls received at police station and were held on came from which is quite a lot
true
i therefore worked on the premise that if a fifth of our work comes from then it must be right to have approximately a fifth of our staff based in
hear
at the present time i have in a total of fourteen patrol constables and two community constables and as you are aware i have two community constables here in and
my proposal and er notice i have in my hand a final draft which will be submitted later this week for approval by headquarters
my proposal is that we establish a section of four constables here in
now that i propose will be achieved by the use of the two existing community constables and transferring two officers from to
the review that we undertook of the calls shows that the peak demands in are between eight a m and twelve midnight so the four officers will work a sixteen hour duty scheme er of eight till four til midnight and then the cover between midnight and a m will come fr eight a m will come from as it does at present
by having four officers here it means that they will be able to man the police car for those shifts seven days a week and in addition there will be one spare constable on every day except for sunday either to cover UNK in that UNK or carry out er foot patrol or enquiries within the town
now my proposal is that this section is established on the seventeenth of january nineteen ninety four
certainly superintendent who is my immediate senior officer is very supportive of this proposition
i am aware that the chief superintendent in superintendent chief superintendent is also supportive of the idea
so i would anticipate that my proposals will receive favourable consideration from headquarters
so hopefully by the erm i should be in a position by the next council meeting to report that we should be in a position to be up and running on the seventeenth of january
the problems er that face me accommodation have been overcome with the assistance of the chairman and the town clerk ah and we have been offered additional accommodation here in the council offices which is most welcome
erm there is one slight technical problem which i have to overcome in relation to a computer terminal but i'll erm face that problem at if and when that situation UNK
hopefully then er on that date as i say we should have a fully UNK section here in
the other thing which i feel is important is that the section is UNK
there are two ways that it can be done either by a sergeant at being totally er dedicated to the policing of
the disadvantage is that he would be based at and he would still be working a twenty four hour shift system at
the preferable proposal is that a sergeant is UNK from another town in and er i won't mention where i have my UNK eye
i could get myself into trouble with a colleague of yours in another town but er i am hopeful so as i say er on the seventeenth of january then we could be returning to the situation and i understand in nineteen seventy four when there was a sergeant and six constables here in until the UNK of the urban district council when they were all moved to
twenty years later my plan is to move most of them back again
well done
thank you ever so much for that
i've moved back into and er i'd just like to say i'm sure on behalf of all of you and the people of that we see this as a tremendous move and thank you for the work you've put in
er i've been fortunate enough to share in some of that work with you and i know how much work's been involved
at the annual meeting the annual meeting last year in the institute it was obvious to me that one of the major concerns of people in this town was policing and police presence and i think the joint effort that we've put forward and i must mention as well since he's we've worked very well together the police liaison office has been running extremely well i feel the number of calls have gone up since we started
i would just like to say that i see this as an absolute benefit to and look forward to us working together in the future
thanks very much
hear
chairman i would just like to add that er you and the town clerk are to be UNK on this achievement
yes
and it should be recorded
thank you
thank you councillor that's very nice of you
right well
can i just make one point
yes
i think the fax would still be a highly useful element between us
i mean that door is always open for you so there's no reason why we can't continue
i pumped one through today on something lost and it does give you an immediate link to a written link
i would see no change to the UNK
no
police liaison arrangement
good okay
i would just say that what we've done we looked at the hospital we looked at the youth building and at the moment we've come up with the idea of the s the back room the second room across the corridor erm where we actually store some of the t i c books and UNK
it is gonna be the second room for the police and by moving one door we can put their two rooms together and you've got access to the toilets UNK and all the necessary things so without very much expenditure at all on anybody's back we've actually created the section within this building
and so we've got our public part our telephone our fax machine all through to the police and now we're UNK the car here
and so we've now you know in these times when you get tied up in red tape and bureaucratic mess everywhere the speed at which has achieved this is UNK and i do really thank you for that
hear
right now we've reached item eight under matters arising
thank you i know you've and i'm gonna UNK the chair now and let deal with
right
erm no
that one
i'll let you know
right ladies and gentlemen fellow councillors
erm we now move on to item eight appendix two and it's in matters arising regarding the estate
update the chairman i believe that the man who's major in this is councillor who's now as i understand got a UNK from the d o e
is that correct councillors
that indeed is correct
would you like to give us an update on that please
thank you very much
erm i've written it out here if i may read it
it's the first occasion in fact on which i've been permitted to speak at any meeting dealing with this application
the d o e has authorized me to do so but not to vote
i need hardly say i have found it difficult to hold my tongue on so important a matter over the last eighteen months
the latest situation is county highways have recommended refusal
the town council of which you are very aware in a very detailed submission written by the town clerk recommended refusal
all four district councillors have written in and recommended refusal
county councillor on my right i think is to be UNK on the work he has done with county highways on our behalf and has written to district council recommending refusal
the public have written thirty letters representing about a thousand people living in all corners of have written and recommended refusal
there have been no letters of support
the applicant has consistently in three applications t to develop this site omitted to include a link road from the site into lane a road required by a policy statement in the statutory town plan
a policy that quite clearly states in plain english without a link road there shall be no development of this site
in nineteen seventy if i take you back to twenty three years ago county recorded in the outline development plan the following and i quote growth in the town not UNK by measures to UNK the traffic problems in the existing road network would merely add to the UNK in the quality of the environment in the town and without such measures no further expansion is environmentally acceptable unquote
in the past twenty years the population of this town has almost doubled and the number of cars using the roads has UNK making that quote much more UNK
a further quote if i may from the same document in association with the construction in a link road between the site and lane shall be provided and the lane road junction closed unquote
that is a comment twenty years ago regarding the most dangerous crossroads in hill
the amount of traffic using hill and street is destroying in my opinion and UNK the town
the elderly are terrified to cross the road in what is the main shopping centre
an elderly lady this weekend actually i it sounds funny but it's rather serious what she said actually
we are now buying ourselves white sticks that we don't really need to help us cross the road
what a sad thing to have to say
and this development if allowed without a link road will generate an additional estimated four hundred cars daily into the town centre
there are other quotes but i will save these for my submission to district council if needed on the fourth of january
i'd heard it said that th the development of this site has been in the development plan for twenty years
absolutely correct
but i sh i my opinion is the test we should apply when determining this application surely is if we were today nineteen ninety three preparing a development plan for would we include in the plan this site for development
the answer is an UNK no of course we wouldn't
as you know the application has been withdrawn from the agenda of the coastal planning committee twice in recent weeks
i ask myself is this delay in any way connected with the decision of the t the developer to appeal to the d o e against the previous refusal of this application
you may wish to draw your own conclusions
especially when the applicant recently suggested and i quote we should not UNK in further UNK in reaching an early decision on this application
i ask that this UNK remark can only be far from being UNK we are being UNK in UNK the environment of and the quality of life of the people and we are not merely interested in financial gain
the fact remains if this ev development is allowed it will have an UNK detrimental effect on the UNK environment of the town centre and the UNK of the people for generations to come
is being UNK and UNK by the motor car coming specially from large housing estates built on the wrong side of
hear
requiring travel through the town centre the town centre that was designed and built for horse drawn traffic
the development of this site in nineteen ninety three is unacceptable and must be not be approved
we who live in know best and must be heard
now i can tell you a little one final remark i at five thirty this afternoon met mr councillor at five thirty to discuss the delay in dealing with this application
the delay was with the approval of district council at the request of the developer who asked for time to consider if hill could be improved
they agreed it will go before the district council without change on the fourth of january whatever the decision on county on the improvements if there are any to hill
and they've also agreed that any alteration of the plan will be referred back to this council for their consideration
thank you
thank you councillor
councillor
the town UNK just pointed out that their tape UNK run out and wondered if you would go back to the start and work through all that again
it's a joke
but this is a very serious matter and difficult to follow councillor because he's gone through nearly every point
er there is just one crucial one i think that i'd like to refer to briefly
what concerns me in particular is how district council is handling this and i'll come back to that in a moment
the only thing that didn't say was a letter from headmaster of the county primary school
he wrote to chief engineering and planning officer
i read with some concern that a housing development planned for the valley is to UNK its traffic on to the road near the hill lane crossroads
any increase in traffic at that already dangerous crossroads will i feel place my pupils at risk
during the twelve years that i've been head teacher at this school i have waited for promised improvements at the crossroads and in particular the lane junction
my p t a have re regularly UNK their concerns
now it appears that no improvements are in the pipeline but increased traffic is
surely this is UNK to all who regularly use the crossroads
i think UNK on er the thing that concerns me most about this
this before
yes we have
wh what i'd like to suggest without going through it all again is that perhaps we could agree to ask the town clerk to write to planning department and voice our concern at the way this matter is being handled
i didn't want to go through the arguments for and against
i think they've been discussed previously and i think the arguments for refusal are very clear cut
as said all the district councillors are opposed to it i'm opposed to it and there's very clear cut highways authority reasons for refusing but in spite of that district council seems to be going out of its way to bend over backwards and help the applicants for some reason or another presumably to get this thing through
and a that UNK me and concerns me because when this went to district council's environment and planning committee first of all speed was of the essence
i mean i UNK why it went to the district council environment and planning committee rather than the coastal planning committee and the one reason i was told was speed they could get the thing brought up there that much more quickly
a couple of months ago they were pushing it through as quickly as possible
it was UNK in UNK at that time
it was held in with the present public excluded but now we seem to have a completely different situation
the one thing that seems to be doing now is to string it out as long as possible
the one thing they seem to be trying to do now is UNK and delay er and i think we ought to voice our concern and i hope the council will agree to ask the town clerk to express concern at the way it's being handled
thank you councillor
i think you've gone through it now
i see no reason for us actually to go through the whole UNK and cons
we've made our view quite clear
i think the things that have come out of this for me er from councillor actually is that it would be unlikely that we or would be allocating that plan today and i think the amount of traffic has increased through the town centre would make it foolish and one does wonder at the wisdom if all the development went along which had to be serviced then through er street and through the town centre in to the main areas of employment that happened years ago
erm the other point that i think we should be clear and we should remember that this council has still not UNK
we have never gone away from the fact that the town plan and the policy statement in there that if the road was provided the land is in the town plan and this council would have approved it
i think it is important to remember that if they UNK with the properly doc adopted and UNK town plan then the permission would have been granted obviously subject to details and
that has been our major worry and i think for us now to go away and just allow it to go ahead twenty years on without any improvements without the link road and without improvements to hill i think is an UNK of our duties and i really do think that
right it's been suggested by councillor that we write a letter to
i think we should express our concern in the way that it's being handled and i think there are grounds for concern and i think must be aware that this council is watching what they're doing
i mean we it was very nearly went through had a meeting which had the press and public excluded and i think it was not handled well at that time from and we should make it quite clear that we are watching and hopefully we do understand the situation
now how does anyone else feel about the situation
chairman you may wish to with the council's approval and your approval councillor wishes to make a short statement on this
it might be useful
someone who again
this is an unusual evening isn't it
twice in one evening
yes agreed
just briefly i have been correspondence right back erm it's difficult to see why that land was designated for land except that it's agricultural land and erm my point is that the gradient on a lot of the site especially on the northern erm banks is one in five and one in seven and to build on that would erm well even said that the building would be UNK so i mean i it just isn't a suitable site apart from the link road for housing either because the gradient there would be very erm difficult from a landscape point of view a there's nothing they could do to improve the till you know the turn of the century and they are and through all the planning papers from nineteen eighty five it is said that hill can't be improved so i mean unless they do something erm dramatic i can't see what they can do i mean it just isn't a suitable site for development
right
move back into council
i take it
yes er no i'm not taking the planning minutes
i've got to take item in a minute item nine i believe
yes
erm is it your wish that we would write expressing our concern and would it be possible for us to erm delegate this to councillor and the town clerk with the chairman of planning obviously innit
would that be in order
i think we should you know make it clear how we stand
okay
are we all agreed
okay
a personal statement or a council statement
absolutely yes
this is a council view
so that's councillor town clerk and the chairman of planning
okay
anyone against
okay
thank you very much
right with that i'm gonna take you on if you're all agreed and i think you've already agreed some of you most of you that we go on to item nine
i have to say to you i'd no idea i was doing this evening so i'm gonna do everything and backup
right we're d discussing district council area wide plan
erm many of you will realize that east devon have been requested er by the government to prepare these area wide plans rather than just a town plan so they take in and UNK the whole of the area and there was quite a lengthy and substantial document with the with all the different policy statements on i believe councillor
thank you chairman
eh well the district
excuse me just one moment
i beg your pardon
i wonder could you agree that i signed appendix two
i didn't do this at i didn't know
yes of course
i'm sorry about that but i did it while was out
thank you
okay
the district wide erm development plan will take the place of the individual town development plans
here is the first draft a hundred and forty three pages of it
it's a draft document that will be in fact circulated to town councils for their opinion and also will have dis on display to the public in the near future
is in section page one
it was discussed in detail in a five hour meeting at district council and after as i say remember it's only a consultation document this time that will be put to you for your decision
i asked that in section fifteen should include which it doesn't at the moment the following matters
i asked that the link road from to lane which had been omitted should be included in the town plan and councillor has written on that matter to district council and they agreed that it should be
it has not yet been taken out in the statutory town development plan
my goodness
i note that county are preparing a town centre enhancement scheme which they are doing where there's a conflict clearly between the traffic and the pedestrian
that enhancement scheme is being prepared now and reference should be made to it in this document in respect of
the need for an open space public open space east of the town
that is not included
policy statements in respect of are fine hill and the prime shopping centre and lane should be r repeated in the new plan
they've been omitted
there should be reference to the social housing and the cross subsidy housing and the hospital at in the new plan
the plan will be operative from nineteen ninety four to the year two thousand and one
that's what we're talking about
between now and two thousand and one so we've gotta get these things in
the need for a pedestrian link between school and the
i asked that these all these matters should be put in and it was agreed
so when it comes before the council i will let the town clerk have this and then it's important that if the council agrees they should be included
development of a public amenity area in a vicinity and including the formed when the flood UNK scheme is constructed
this could be delightful
development of a route to and to UNK develop that site as an important town amenity
continued development and improvement of picnic site should be included
implementation of the approved resolution on the coastal planning committee this is an interesting one that they've totally forgotten implementation of the approved resolution of a coastal planning committee district on the twenty seventh of january that the highway implications which affect the development of the area marked w in the inset plan in fact is
it shall be UNK as part of the district wide local plan
would you believe it
and that was approved on the twenty seventh of january ninety three and nothing has happened about it since
the removal of all
inclusion of UNK eleven acres of land at school in the district wide development plan if we as we hope is taken out
all of those matters have been omitted
i asked that all of them should be put in
we'll wait and see when the second draft comes to this council when the council will discuss my points and agree or disagree that they should be included or not
thank you gentlemen
well i would think the council would be delighted to have those details in front of it for us to have a full discussion and to make it known but thank you councillor for all those details
it just shows i think how UNK councillors need to be when you get all these documents and you do get many of them if you're a district county councillor and how necessary it is for you to read them and study them and to remember because these things are very important when they're put in when it goes to higher authority at that time
right is there anyone else would like to ask anything on the district wide plan to councillor at this stage
no
so we just ask that these come forward so that the council can fully discuss this and make our replies to before they're formally adopted
right
well with that i thank you for my very short er stay in the chair and er with your agreement we'll ask the chairman to return
okay thank you very much
both together please
have you got any traffic lights
did you find the draft
move on to item five on the agenda of the UNK minutes the planning committee meetings are on monday the eighth of november and the twenty ninth of november
i presume we've all got a second now have you
i would like to present them in the absence of both the chairman and the vice chairman of planning so is it your wish that i sign both sets as a true and correct record
chairman there's just one little point that i did speak to the town clerk and i think the council should be aware of it
on er UNK ninety er regarding mr agricultural dwelling at
on the first one UNK ninety
UNK ninety
erm i did say at the time if the council agreed it was we would approve the new application it would only be if the original was UNK and i did speak to the town clerk so there's no need i'm not making a big issue but i think the council should be aware and the town clerk i believe has notified because again this is one of those things that could happen at a later date and as we all know if we haven't made these things perfectly clear
with that amendment is everybody happy that the minutes are signed
yes i've got some questions after though
okay that's ninety one and ninety two ninety three
okay let's take the er i'll do my best to answer 'em cos i'm not right let's take the meeting on the eighth of november
any questions on that meeting
any matters arising from that meeting
yes chairman
you might have to leave the room again
no i'm erm i'm quite happy
correspondence UNK ninety land at school
oh
right
erm
your UNK
er yeah i'm just gonna be safe
i'm gonna you can chair it from there but i'm gonna do it just to be safe
that's the only one
the remainder doesn't matter
okay thanks
thank you very much
erm UNK ninety land at school
correspondence if you'd all refer to that at the moment actually
in the last sentence erm my view is that we should not wait for an application to build on this site
if it is not included in the district wide local plan for development there can be no development of this site before the year two thousand and one
and i would recommend in fact that action on that should be we ought to visit the site there's a splendid map i think you've all had you had in a letter you had in a letter from a developer to have a look at this map and the sites they're talking about actually
consider the points made in the letter and if the council agree in principle it's a suitable site for development advise district council now that it should be considered for inclusion in the district wide plan now being drawn up
that was one of my points just now actually
it is level it's available the developer may provide a an amenity area it says so in the letter anyway for the town and a route across the river to
we've gotta plan ahead and give district council our views and not wait
it will be too late
it's gotta go in there
yes thank you i thank councillor thank you for that valid
you will recall and it is in the client was asked to obtain clarification on their proposals for an improved
there was an offer in the letter if my UNK correct but it didn't actually specify what their offer was and really i think what the council want to do is exactly what they are offering because we have to be minded all the time that the that er applicant does not own all the land and certainly it is the wish i think of this council i believe unanimously and i think a lot of the residents that we do somehow acquire a pedestrian link
it would be something that would vastly improve i think the link of the new hospital to the medical centre without going around over bridge
it really is something that i would like to see us achieve in the future and if this can be brought forward by meeting the developer down there then i would be certainly be in favour of that and i would certainly like and this is what we said at this meeting to find out a little more detail of exactly what they were offering but we have to be minded all the time as i said again is how we're going to acquire permission to go over one or two different land UNK lands
that's the that's the point yes
that will be the difficulty
that will be the difficulty
has the developer responded to that letter by the way
it went off only a couple of days after the meeting
well we may need a further letter now
whether the council i personally would be quite keen to go down there and see a and we'd need permission of the land owners to do this to see where the link could go across you know the best position so that we and i believe this is what councillor is saying so that we can actually come forward and maybe this ought to be a meeting with the UNK committee maybe the UNK and bear in mind as i say again i hate to do these things and the land owner think we're UNK 'em into something without their knowledge
i think if you get their backs up before you've even started it's not a helpful situation is it
but i would very much with the land owners like to go down there and see and then try and negotiate a possibility for right of way across
yes i think could be approached at this stage
i mean feelings on the matter
if we help the developer it's wrong to put a path if the other UNK not gonna cooperate
absolutely
we do want it in there chairman
would it be a situation if we asked the town clerk and er maybe with the chairman it's a little bit difficult i think the town clerk at this stage to speak to and then if it seems possible we could bring it up at the planning committee meeting and arrange a date to go down and have a look when we've actually approached the land owners
i would hate to do it the other way
do we have a lot of time
does it say
ya
do you think it might be an idea to speak to the er to first and get their UNK so i've got their response i think you
well it's and
so that they really mean they're going to do that and then to
mhm
i think it would be nice and then we could actually discuss it at the next planning meeting which i presume which is the twentieth
twentieth yes
ah the twentieth fairly big date
i mean it would be grand for wouldn't
okay
alright
so we're definitely agreed that we ask the town clerk to make those two contacts and to put it on the agenda for the planning committee
would it prudent for me to consider both sets of minutes rather than us get into difficulty
can i yeah can i go on to the application if i may chairman
i mean it's obvious that
i was not present i was not present but the committee itself and UNK the chairman's not here either of the planning committee erm itself got into some difficulty by accepting and voting on a proposal to approve the application subject to the provision of a suitable link road
you cannot and i know councillor and UNK erm have said this many times you cannot vote on something not before you
no
you can you can only vote on the application before you
in this case you can vote on the application without a link road
the chairman in fact should have a point of procedural rule not to accept the resolution er before you
erm eventually you've got refusing it but you i imagine you've got yourself in some difficulty f one further point on this i note you had a section on these minutes
i note you've got a site inspection on the hockey club room but not for the eighty seven houses that may affect for generations i e
i am a little surprised that the planning committee decided to go to look at the hockey club but not eighty seven houses in
thank you
yes well i think to answer bo both of yo your concerns first of all we have to accept that the planning committee has actually has power to make its decisions not to come back to this council so i'm afraid it is a decision of the planning committee
the chairman at that time decided t to take the motion and proposition and it was against my advice
i actually advised him at the meeting that he should not and couldn't take that motion and i was by UNK in that situation but he still deemed to go ahead and that's p his UNK
he is after all the chairman of that committee but certainly i advised him against that and i thought it was totally wrong er to do it in the way he did and i think it was a shame for this council that he that he did go ahead but there you are
that's to answer that situation
i believe that er we didn't er consider going to look at the development because it was quite clearly in the minds of a large percentage of us that it was contrary to the town plan and so we did not think it was necessary to do that
we did however feel it was necessary to go and look at the because we are very aware of the lighting that affects those properties who've been very patient with the amount of development that's gone on there
i thought that it was very polite that we should go there in the evening and assess for ourselves exactly the harm th the possible harm that it could do to their gardens at the back and that's why we did that
thank you chairman
and indeed chairman in taking account of those concerns we did add er a couple of conditions
yes we did
we recommended approval subject to conditions and one of those was
extra
to UNK the problem of the lighting to nearby properties
i think
right
erm are there any other matters
and i think we should do all the planning don't you
on then we're gonna need to accept that UNK ninety two and ninety three are a correct record
is that all agreed
yes
anyone against
no
are there any matters arising from the minutes of november the twenty ninth
no
and with that i think that covers the planning meetings
thank you very much
this is a funny meeting isn't it
thank you very much
i didn't realize it would be quite as tricky as this
if it had have been if we'd have known we'd have pulled the tables further pulled the tables further across that way
right
you'll have to tell me if i cover anything that you've already done
i think that's very wise
item six county council and county council's reports
i'd like to thank and i'd like it UNK that i'd like to thank our councillors and county council councillors because they are getting the reports in now
we are able to circulate these reports and i think that's working extremely well
has anybody got any questions of the reports from our councillors
i think councillor county councillor should refer to the UNK out the UNK there's not a UNK that's two pipes that takes the water UNK water across the
the road gets flooded when there's heavy rain and i er i clean it out
i don't want to give the impression that's a road that'll never be flooded again
quiet people thank you
did everybody hear what said
no afraid not
right let's try and talk one at a time now
can you just say it again please
i just councillor says about cleaning out the UNK
it's not a UNK it's two pipes that takes the water in ordinary times ordinary river level across the road but if there is heavy rain the ford you'll find that the ford will be always flooded so er it won't be UNK th the flooding of the of that part of the road
i'm sure councillor will take that on board
yes okay
i've got one comment
i'm extremely sad to see that the price for glass has gone down by five pounds a ton which results in the er the income from the recycling of glass being UNK
it shows what we've been saying for a long time how UNK the markets in this recycling are and i still stick to what i've thought all along that marketing comes first and making the product comes second
clearly that hasn't been the case
i hope that this gets back on the road because clearly people are starting to put things in the proper places for recycling
can we just mention there that we did have a problem at the weekend with the paper banks again
i meant to say that to you
there was paper all over the car park again
okay anybody got anything of any other reports
chairman i i've got one here actually
i wonder if you would take up this idea of the family tree for generations
it is an item a bit further down
oh is it
yeah
i can tell you i've seen the video
it really is appalling to see and thank goodness it's in black and white it's not in colour but
i'll share that view yes
i'm actually i am actually i've been party they've been circulating me with the correspondence of the residents' association and i am very worried about this but don't feel until invited by the residents' association that we should do any more
oh no it's district
clearly the survey couldn't be carried on in very many parts of the sewer because the pipes are in such bad condition
so we UNK developments on that
well i've now er i've now arranged a further meeting with environment health district council and the residents' association
thank you for that
thank you
right any other questions on the UNK reports
i think it's proof that they're and well written
thank you for that
good morning everyone and welcome to UNK first half results
one way or another we've had a pretty busy six months
as you know we've decided to concentrate our management and financial resources on our media interests which cover the information education and entertainment markets and in which our spread of businesses including books newspapers family attractions and television are well placed for future growth
in june we acquired thames television with its valuable programme rights distribution business and production capability
and we have a crack at star t v
the plans we announced on twenty seventh july to UNK and float camco are already UNK
until such time as they leave the group figures from these two businesses obviously continue to form part of our accounts
i'm pleased to say that in the course of the last six months we've seen a strong recovery in profits
so let's now look at the results
overall our nineteen ninety three first half pre tax profits stand at forty six million for all our businesses including UNK and camco
that's nearly twelve million better than for nineteen ninety two and reflects its satisfying improvement in underlying performance
sales were up by nineteen percent and there's also firm evidence in these results of margin improvements which reflect for the first time the full benefit of our cost cutting measures taken over the last three years
we've become better at making money in UNK trading conditions and are making the most of the UNK recovery we've seen in some of our markets
our overall operating profit has increased by some seventy percent over the same period last year
the difference between operating profit and profit before tax is of course made up of interest on non operating items
james will cover er this area in more detail later in the presentation
earnings per share are up er more than forty percent over the same period last year and when the e p s is adjusted to take account of the non operating items the figure has increased by nearly ninety percent
we said on twenty seventh july that we planned to pay an unchanged dividend for the full year
accordingly the board has declared an unchanged interim dividend of five point three seven five p per share
altogether then er an encouraging set of results and i'll hand you over to frank to take us through them in more detail
good morning everyone
well as you can see from that slide a much better first half with four of our four out of six of our businesses getting UNK points especially newspapers and the merchant banking
and there are good reasons why the other two are as they are and i'll explain that in due course
so i'll start with the book businesses
book sales show a nice increase in er in sales revenue especially in the u k which is up seventeen percent overall
penguin u k is gaining sale and market share and in north america the sales are only slightly down on last year which was a very exceptional year anyway
longman did particularly well in the u k although UNK markets were difficult and er sales in the schools markets in er north america was hard going for addison wesley with u s physical problems restricting the UNK money that schools had to er had to use
but we did particularly well in colleges
moving to profits for the book companies these are slightly down but this isn't indicative of a full year and the general outlook is er is good
the penguin profits pattern followed the sales pattern that is to say an increase in the u k more than UNK er a decline in the u s
longman had a very er very good increase in profits and the addison wesley loss which is bigger in the first half than usual er isn't something that UNK me particularly i'm really quite relaxed about full year performance but just to make sure they're er attacking erm expenses travel administration that kind but nothing in the erm book investment programme
newspapers apart from les echo erm advertisement volumes were pretty flat
les echo managed a nice increase in financial advertising but elsewhere volumes were flat erm and so the revenue increased has depended on er rate increases changes in the mix or circulation revenue with a mixture of cover price increases and some increases in circulation
profits are well up cost reduction obviously played a major part in this and the f t group is er fifty five percent up on last year and this is against the background of a five percent drop in advertisement volume and we have an eleven percent drop in advertisement volume from the continent of europe erm which of course doesn't affect other national newspapers
the UNK and les echo both recorded record UNK once again and UNK that's our partnership in spain as you will recall er their profits continued to UNK the trends in a very tough market
the westminster press cost budget is now adjusted and they're currently trading at a nine percent margin which would be ten percent if it wasn't for the er expenditure on er yorkshire on sunday er the circulation of which is growing very nicely
er and i expect that margin to continue rising and be much higher again next year so the medicine is working there
entertainment we divide our entertainment into two parts television and attractions
so starting with television we said at the er announcement of the UNK camco UNK that we intended to develop further in the visual media and so we are setting up a t d t v division in which we'll place all of our t v interests at present just thames the investment in b sky b and er yorkshire UNK but watch this space we e we intend to add to this er division
now obviously i'm not going to talk about profits from the t v division just now because thames only came in at the half year and we're not including any profits from b sky b in the half year but it's likely that we'll take some de loan stock interest in at the year end
attractions they've produced a very UNK rise in revenue and profits er from the UNK group although as you will recall most of the profits in the group come in july and august
but despite the recession there was an exceptional increase in attendances
UNK road was up by eight point two percent rock circus attendances were up by twenty eight percent and UNK twenty one percent
even at white castle and alton towers both of which recorded record attendances last year they were up by fourteen percent and sixteen percent respectively
and we achieved an increase in the spend per head so the UNK group is a real tale of success
let's now turn to the non media businesses
starting with camco the newly appointed chief executive er has been very active and has made a great impact already
even the products division which has been a long time drag on profitability improved its performance and was well up too
the overall excellent improvement in first half performance is UNK by a technical transfer last year which of course isn't repeated this year and this year a provision of UNK in pounds following the settlement of a civil anti trust suit
er i make a point of never saying i told you so but we did expect the UNK to come because fundamentally UNK er camco is a strong business
fine china sales have improved but the profit hasn't and this needs some explanation
we've been UNK costs on two UNK redundancy and also reducing factory stocks short time working and this has brought down margins and profits but the cash UNK improving and despite poor conditions in europe and japan er volume and unit value of orders is er increasing slowly
that brings us to investment banking and i'll leave you here since er james our james financial UNK the director of UNK and he's gonna go through the pearson UNK
he er he will cope with UNK at the same time so james over to you
thank you frank
well it's been a good half year for investment banking
just to remind you er we have a fifty percent interest in UNK brothers and a ten percent interest in the new york and paris partnerships
in new york er most of you will be well aware that the i p o and market remains UNK healthy and there have been therefore er excellent opportunities for UNK profits and erm therefore new york had its best first half ever
i in london there's been a good improvement across the board a much UNK corporate finance climate and UNK has er been pretty prominent in the rights issues in the first half of the year
if we then go back to er look at the profits as a whole there are just three items i'd like to comment on the corporate expenses as other income er has obviously had a dramatic improvement
this reflects effectively the sale of another of our shares in UNK the profit on sale of fixed assets comes right down as you again er i think all know we've had the benefit of our last of shares and we're actually rather UNK surprised that we were able to er sell some land at UNK to UNK which is why we have some profit of three million er for the first half of ninety three
change in the interest charge reflects no more than the impact of the stronger dollar on our u s dollar interest costs
going on down er the profit and loss account the tax charge er is lower as a percentage than it was this time last year
this time last year we actually were a little too conservative
we normally try and estimate the full year tax charge and then apply it to six months and we got it wrong
further point has helped er keep the tax charge well down in ninety three is that the there is no tax on the non operating items they're tax free effectively whereas that wasn't true a year ago
as a result adjusted earnings are up very UNK as you can see
if i can turn to the balance sheet it's a little more complicated we're in a rather odd position at the thirtieth of june of incorporating the thames er balance sheet because our offer went UNK
we haven't paid for it and therefore er we er you see a rather large item for provisions and UNK that includes the ninety nine million consideration that er went out of the door in july as well of course as the substantial provisions that thames made in their own accounts for their property UNK and for er potential losses on the disposal of UNK their west coast u s production company
they erm the thames investment in UNK is er another reason for in fact the principal reason for the increase in associates and investments working capital is a simple a seasonal UNK which has been again by the stronger dollar and the reduction in shareholders funds compared with the thirty first of december er reflects the eighty six million pound good will write off on thames
net debt as you can see er from the next slide and indeed it was in the balance sheet er it was a hundred and seventy million against a hundred and eighty five on thirtieth of june
erm that isn't an entirely accurate reflection on our performance er there are two factors
er we've UNK the one hand by the inclusion of UNK own cash of twenty seven million but on a year and year comparison the erm the dollar the sterling value of our dollar debt was fifty two million pounds higher so in fact we have reduced net debt on at an operating level year on year
the other feature i think of the debt that's worth drawing your attention to is a sharp shift towards variable debt compared to a year ago a number of our UNK have UNK we've put one new one in er some of our medium term notes have UNK in the in the states and we're at last in a position to take more advantage of er lower short term variable interest rates than we were
with that i'll hand you back to michael
we'd now like to take questions
erm i was wondering if you'd perhaps like to tell us how you're going to manage your er your
well i think frank mentioned er that we were forming a t v division and i think frank you might like to say more
well we'll set that up with a board of its own erm as an operating board and each of our divisions has an operating board erm and that means it will have a finance director it will have and it will have a chief executive er and there'll be one or two other people on that board such as er mark development director er and er we'll go from there
can you give some idea as to what the er can you give some idea as to what the underlying sales growth was in the first half
you've got the nineteen percent and as the statement says there was some degree of benefit from currency
what was the underlying
james can you give that accurate
absolutely
sales er of their hundred and thirty million increase in sales erm seventy seven million exchange fifty two million er underlying
yes
could you break down the profit of the f t group between les echo and the f t in the u k
i don't think we normally do that
i think in broad terms we can say that er les echo comparatively did better than the f t
but
yes er the f the f t er did improve er les echo improved UNK improved the UNK was slightly down on last year but remember the UNK were at record profits last year and erm so even maintaining their profits or just dropping is a good performance
and again i wouldn't regard that as indicative of a full year
yes
can you erm quantify what costs were taken above the line in the first half in terms of redundancy costs restructuring costs in the presentation to some restructuring again in the fine china division and how that compared to last year
redundancy costs for the first half of three point two million nought point seven million less than ninety two
yep for the group
is there expectations that there will be any more redundancy costs in the second half
frank
erm yes
there could there could well be more redundancy in the second half er declining but there could still be a little
er overall you know we're constantly looking where for reducing staffing levels and where we see opportunity of that we do it
er and that usually involves redundancy
so we don't regard it as ever static but er the major push on redundancies is over
you have in the past actually erm how much you think you've UNK your cost basis by over a period
hmm
a period of two and a half three years now
can you quantify that again
erm i couldn't answer that off the top of my head but we'll erm i'll let you have the information
i'll write to you and give you the information
yes
just so that we can erm make sure for the UNK committee you haven't given yourself enormous pay rises in the first half can you can you split out in the corporate expenses less other what the er profit on the sale of some of your UNK investment was
yes that's fine
it's effective of the whole of the increase
erm let me just erm of the of the change the five million change it's in accounts for over four and there is small odds and ends changes otherwise
a very modest increase in underlying costs i assure you
how many shares have you got left in UNK
david
erm we have about four and a half percent to five percent of the company left
erm could you give us some idea as to what the level of the accrue er fees on loans guarantees and so forth on the erm
james
so what we're gonna be taking in and when
what you're owed
ya well i haven't got the yes the backlog is very substantial er in terms of things like guaranteed fees and erm non stock interest but it's a long way out er i mean if we add it all up you might be far too impressed by the figure but i think erm we know that's the right way of looking at it
what we've got is as you know there's a hierarchy of UNK er starting with the de loan stock interest which is the last funding and then there's the maiden dividend and then there's guarantee fees and then there's erm sorry before that is senior loan stock interest from b s b h and then guarantee fees
so they kick in at different stages
what we think as frank said erm our policy is to accrue erm income which we think we'll get in cash terms the following year UNK we're not gonna accrue it as soon as b sky b expenses it which is one end of the spectrum of erm UNK you could say or and the other end extreme UNK is to account for nothing until it's cleared er in the bank balance
we now think it's appropriate to strike a medium balance therefore we'll get the de loan stock interest up to ninety three we'll take in this year which we expect to get next year
and how much of the cash received
i mean there's something you still owe to er to reed
to reed erm right who knows the terms of the reed mark do we know that one
not off the top of my head
what we're paying them on
we're certainly paying i think it's capital receipts is it off is it only the capital receipts on the interest
they had a lot of capital payments also and we have as it were the erm the p o element er with b sky b which is the erm the items i've gone through
then you have a number of loan UNK and you're quite right there is a there is a ma an amount will be paid to reed equivalent to i e we're not gonna pay them the interest for the capital receipts but when amount we receive money we're paying it on
that means we will still UNK it in our p o account but the cash flow terms will be neutral
and i think a significant point is that for the first time in ninety three we were likely to take something in relation to b sky b
yes well actually nigel was ha was first
same thing right
it follows on from that question it comes you've got a line b sky b er you've got a line b sky b in the t v er division so it presumably that loan interest is coming in that division is that right rather than net if off against interest
i'm afraid we're not allowed to er neil
er i think for management purposes and for presentation purposes we will erm presentation but certainly in terms of our accounts erm we have no option but to exempt the giving interest UNK but to erm impress you with the UNK of our of our interest and therefore how good our interest cover is
maybe that's erm that's what the erm that's what UNK and the accounted principles require
that although it's erm in our mind and yours identify with a specific investment
just following on from that
the er thames er investment how is that doing and have you sold UNK yet
thanks er well thames is doing rather well
you i'm sure you read about the twenty two million pound deal with er b c and er and there are there are other deals in the UNK
er UNK has been sold er and so erm the cost of that has been er UNK now and so that's no longer a problem
and the pr we're er i would expect the profits of thames to be in line with that we expected when we acquired the business
yes
can you tell us a bit more about addison wesley and why you feel relaxed with that
UNK er addison wesley and why we're relaxed
addison well er it's a very well managed business it's a very good business er there are only two businesses in the u s a have higher sales per head than addison wesley and one of those is and it's had a that's had a super time in maths and there's only one business and that's which UNK more profit per employee then er addison wesley and erm again that's and that reflects that one off maths programme
erm and we're doing very well in college
so er and the chief executive there would er i think commit suicide if he if he brought in less profits than the year before
so i'm quite relaxed and they're attacking the costs as well
that is not a forecast
when will when will these constraints be relaxed
well that's an
mr clinton or mrs clinton i'm not sure
UNK
yes
can you just say a little bit more about erm the structure of the t v board will you be looking to make any external appointments to fill those positions er and secondly following on from that erm as you said you had a look at star t v and came off empty handed
do you still have interests in that part of the world with regards to UNK
er i'll answer the second part of the question
i'll hand the first one over to frank
er yes we do er our overall television strategy has been to establish er a u k base where we are restricted because of the newspaper ownership in most cases other than b sky b to twenty percent though the rules may change and our strategy is to develop er overseas both in erm er broadcasting and in UNK
er as we can make the opportunities available
there are opportunities out there and people tend to think of or sometimes think of deals as being unique deals and they're unique in themselves but there are always other unique deals that can be found
yes er richard will be on that board and er and we also accept expect erm further outside appointments
appointment anyway and possibly appointments
yes
i suppose one wonders whether the financial times feels un UNK about the proposed reduction in the price of the er of the times as no doubt the independent probably the telegraph
well i was discussing that with frank last night and he actually pointed out that it might help the sales of the financial times because er the f t's very often bought as a second newspaper and if you get your first newspaper cheap you've got more change in your pocket
actually the financial times it comes in a completely different position to erm the independent and the guardian and even the telegraph
to start with it's a specialist newspaper and secondly erm the f t is profitable and erm even if even in a great recession and erm the other element is we every year increase our overseas sales six percent
erm specialist newspapers i really don't expect the times erm to have any effect on the f t's sale
could you just on that remind us what the current what the cover price is as a percentage of UNK in the f t
roughly eighty twenty
i mean it obviously it varies according to whether it's whether UNK but in overall over time it can work on twenty percent on the revenue coming from the cover price and about eighty percent coming from er from advertisements and so it's not a major figure
incidentally i'm not surprised the er the times is reducing its price
i think it's about right now
i think that's a re terrible comment
yes
sir can you give us an idea of the growth within the electronic business in the f t
in er terms they er they're growing very well
erm UNK profitability isn't as good
we we've been growing something like er twenty five percent per annum
i think this year speaking from memory it was something like fifteen sixteen percent er increase this year erm but er we're getting to the stage now where it's getting into profit and so we're quite pleased with the growth there
are you still developing your presence in japan
yes we erm we're obviously in japan and erm and increasing the sales slowly there but it's a very good market for us very good advertisement market er for us and er i think i've told you before even before the recession it started it looked as if we would UNK the extra spending in the first year
sad to say the recession UNK that but it's developing strongly again there now
it's not costing you money
it's costing us a bit of money but er you know we don't do these things for the short term er
what's a bit a million a year or
er well the extra costs was two million a year er and at the end of the first six months in the first year we'd achieved a million extra revenue so it looks as if we've paid for it
but it's probably costing us about er three quarters of a million to a million just now net
you've shown that you've moved erm substantially towards variable debt but there is obviously an UNK currency impact you said in the first half
how is your debt your gross debt currently UNK and where is your cash held
cash is UNK in sterling erm can i just look up and remind my erm UNK me on that
the erm the gross UNK the dollar is the overwhelming element in terms of we have about erm two hundred and thirty five million of sterling debt two bond issues and some old loan stocks and then the rest of it that's gross debt and some of that UNK you know
all the almost all are sterling except a little bit of camco cash which is in u s dollars is in sterling and then erm we have really a similar amount of u s dollar debt and small amounts of canadian and french UNK and UNK dollar where we really gear simple finance small investments in those countries under a hundred percent
we have offices now we have erm a genuine french UNK exposure to les echo but apart from that we don't really bother
is it possible to tell us how your advertising revenue performed in the first half on your westminster press and f t and whether you've experienced any improvements in sits UNK advertising since the end of the first half
yes it is and i'll hand it to frank
advertisement er revenue at westminster press ended the six months at about the advert revenue about the same level as last year but it was below last year's level early on so in other words erm advertisement volume is growing because there's next to no there's the yield is about the same overall
erm so volume has been gradually growing as the year UNK and erm and more so in the last erm the last say six weeks of the er of the half year
so i would expect that to continue and expect erm revenue to get ahead of last year
erm as i said f t volumes are flat but er they did achieve an increase in the yield erm but forward bookings are much better at the f t and october looks rather better so i think advertisement volumes are on the increase
situations vacant in westminster press there was an increase in the south er in volume terms in the southern divisions not in the northern divisions but then the northern divisions didn't experience the same problems with sits UNK and are much more profitable
i mean northern echo at UNK bradford york UNK they're all very profitable businesses er and so they're but they haven't had any increase in sits in sits UNK
where and financial times has had some increase in sits UNK too which is a high UNK er category of course
the deal of UNK of new york erm comes in the second half i presume and does the b m p er UNK commence also in the second half
i think that remains to be seen
i mean
just a bit more about camco second half is given these little plus and UNK you've had in the first half what's coming in the second
well erm it's difficult to make forecasts particularly with the s e c breathing down one's neck but i think one can say that the industry conditions if you were to read the reports of other companies and for us is pretty much erm status quo in other words the domestic excuse me domestic UNK doing quite well the rig the rig UNK up the canadian rig UNK up international markets remain rather UNK but some of them are qui you know on a on a selective basis some are quite good
for example the erm frank referred to doing quite well and some of that was due to sales into the former soviet union
erm the erm the erm the erm er settlement of the anti tr civil anti trust law suit that was referred to in the statement was erm costs of about six million dollars this year on a class action law suit which we have reached a UNK settlement on in the last few days and in fact there were some there was about six to seven million dollars of additional provision made at the end of last year in the one time charges that we referred to at that time but couldn't really identify with erm lawyers breathing down your UNK in the united states and er this is a class action law suit would have been in a texas court and erm you know the boiler plate language is that you want to get rid of the you know the expense and uncertainty of this type of litigation and if you think that what a texas jury did to UNK it's probably a prudent decision to close the matter off at this time
is it a recent provision order that
well they're making a new one
it's a combination of costs incurred this year plus provision to cover erm the costs of the settlement legal expenses and other allied and other related items
with regards to UNK eastern european sales drive does this have any er implications in terms of er working capital movements in terms of helping them fund those acquisitions and what sort of er provisions perhaps are you taking on those sales
erm i'm not sure i quite understand the question
well in terms of er bad debt
erm we gen generally speaking sales into places like the former soviet union and other parts of the world are done against letters of credit so generally speaking there are not erm bad debt problems
you know one or two UNK one or two isolated incidents but overall erm the erm business in the oil service industry is done on erm er a letter of credit terms
er how did the entertainment businesses do in july and august
frank
they did very well
good attendances and alton towers particularly is erm is er UNK doing very strong business and also has one or two UNK er UNK activities which should er extend the se extend that er later in the season
so it's going well
erm i seem to remember that when we met earlier in the year and you were looking forward to this year as a whole i think you er indicated that it was going to be a good year and i think you also suggested if i remember right that you thought the better part of that improvement would be seen in the second half rather than the first
i wonder if i got it right and i remember it correctly whether that's still the view
well i think that i bore people UNK by saying that erm the first half results are not an indication of the year as a whole because we make the bulk of our pro profits in the second half and you know that remains that remains true
i think at the time of the er of the a g m i said we were pleased by the prospects and in the current statement i say the outlook continues UNK but i don't think at any point we've made more of a forecast than that
are you gonna repeat the miracle of the first half and UNK sell some more land in UNK in the second half
i'll turn that to mark cos i'm not on the UNK committee
i think i would be UNK too to make a forecast so all i can say is there are some enquiries around of er people who appear to be interested but erm er you know the burden UNK quite a lot you know the UNK still the is quite a long way away still but it's not impossible we could sell some more land
you've got you've got the cash from UNK haven't you
yes yeah yes
er sorry just to follow up on b sky b again are you gonna be UNK for any arrears in the interest er in the second half as well as the ongoing amount
yes we'll get we'll get the ninety two and ninety three erm interest for in ninety in the second half
so what you would have had for the whole of ninety two and the whole of ninety three will all come in will all come in the second half of ninety three
right thanks
yeah on the on the de on the de loan stock
yes
would it be helpful to give some order of UNK here james
yes chairman
less than ten million
yes
brilliant management
well one of the reasons it er UNK the trend was because
is this les echo
yeah one of the reasons it UNK the trend was because we've erm ground one of our competitors into the dust and he's had to combine with another newspaper there and that too is struggling
UNK it's just had a change of ownership erm a well financed new owner but we're still confident of our position there
no he actually got erm a nice increase in UNK in financial advertising
i don't want to give you the impression it's UNK there it isn't
could you say anything about your extension plans i mean have they changed much or what might they do in UNK
not much well probably about sixty million for the year i'd say
or a bit more
they always they always UNK as you know our we always UNK capital in the first half against what our division think they're gonna do and they always think they're gonna catch it up in the second half they never do but erm it won't be you know it won't be UNK different
well i think the UNK ninety in the nineties but we don't expect to spend more than sixty million
yeah we won't spend that much
somewhere in between let's say
your royal UNK you might have some idea of how the er different UNK are doing
you mentioned in the annual report and accounts that expressions was meant to be doing very well although its more up market UNK were slightly more UNK
er can the future chairman answer that
i haven't got the detailed figures er with me but er i believe that still is the case that er people's eating habits are er that dining habits as it were er are changing somewhat and the er the everyday china market is possibly more UNK than the er erm the royal crown and UNK
would you make any conscious decision to move slightly down market or less up market
i myself wouldn't use that phrase
i think that er what i would say is that er we would follow the markets erm where they lead us
and the UNK yes
the fine UNK er doing er quite well in japan actually and that's starting to pick up again
any shall i say a couple more questions
if anybody's got one
no more questions
well thank you very much indeed
get into UNK when you're in the data input menu i'd like you to call up the file q m four fit
q m four fit file
if you just look at the er the sheet that we've handed out they loaded from er from the computer it's that data that's in front of you right we've got three series right it's times data right from nineteen twenty three to nineteen forty five right and the three variables are textile consumption united states er real sorry is UNK of the u s so it's textile consumption capita real income er per capita income to be adjusted through inflation so constant money terms and what the relative price of textiles p erm the price of textiles relative to the general level er the general price level
okay what we're going to be doing is UNK a demand function so we can specify the textile consumption as a function of real incomes per capita and also relative prices alright
a UNK what sign would we expect on those two variables
say the income what sign would you expect to observe
yeah positive providing textiles are a normal good you should observe positive er income consumption response okay
how about prices what code what sign do we expect on the er the price variable there
yeah negative right textiles rise faster the price of textiles rises faster than the general price level the real increase in textile prices therefore we'd expect providing the first law of demand holds that we get a negative response consumption right
so that's what we expect a UNK a positive coefficient a negative coefficient positive on income negative on prices
what we are actually going to do today is to look using this data is to look at structural stability right we're going to ask ourselves are the parameters that we estimate over the entire sample are they constant over time
there's no point in UNK a model if in reality those coefficients are not fixed they're jumping all over the place
right with those parameters so if you just look at the er UNK income if we estimate the UNK income to be nought point five right over the entire sample the then subsequently find out if that coefficient varies from year to year from minus six plus ten right having a one point estimate right er oh that coefficient is not going to be particularly useful to us we want to know er whether our coefficients remain reasonably constant throughout our sample period particularly if we're using this er equation to make out of sample predictions right
the first thing we must er be sure of is that the coefficients within the sample are reasonably er reasonably constant right
if they are not reasonably constant then not only is the model er a poor one right within sample but it can't really be used for out of sample predictions because although on average er our coefficient that we estimate it might be nought point five then the out of sample could well be minus six or something like that
right so you need to know that our model is UNK by constant parameters over the sample
now the data that we've got here has been artificially generated
the last six observations of it has right the first six observations sorry the er the first twenty odd observations are real right that they haven't been made up but the last six observations have been made up right to er to illustrate structural change
we will assume that we don't know that there is structural change in this data although a UNK we might expect it
why might we expect structural change to occur in this example
anything in particular
okay yeah that's right this s this series a particularly UNK period of economic history in the nineteen thirties the great depression in addition what's at the end of the series
yeah the second world war right so er i can tell you now that in actual fact there's no structural change during the thirties here but there is structural change during the war
textile consumption or the parameters that we estimate during peacetime no longer er explain textile consumption during wartime
right i'm going to go through methods of how we can detect structural change by the non constant parameters
the first thing we'll do is look at the data alright so if you go from the action menu into option one right we're going to plot er go through to the UNK edit
option go into the data processing environment right where your three variables are listed t c i p
right if you just give the command plot t c plot space t c then press the return key
right that's textile consumption over our sample
now it's not immediately obvious from that time series that there's a structural break right textile consumption hasn't fallen dramatically right or risen dramatically over the post war period oh sorry du during the er the war period
nevertheless we can show that there is significant structural change er in the model that we'll
estimate
right so by looking at the graph i am just trying to impress upon you that structural change cannot always be spotted simply by looking at the data right anyway let's now move on to estimate our first model
what we are going to be doing is trying to explain that series right that er consumption series
so if you press the escape key we'll go back to the data processing environment right
what we're going to do is to log all our variables right so if you let l n t c equal open brackets t c close brackets right we going to define a new variable l n t c
that's going to be the natural UNK right of our original series t c textile consumption
if you now plot l n t c right if you plot l n t c you should have a very similar graph to the one that you had before
alright UNK the data doesn't change the nature of the data what it does do is that it re scales the data okay so the only thing that's changed by UNK right is the scale of the UNK is the vertical scale on the graph right but essentially we are still trying to model the same series and n t c is essentially the same series as t c
okay so if you press the escape key once you've had a look at the data er if you log all the other variables er if you let l n i equal log open brackets i close brackets let l n p equal log open brackets p close brackets press the return key
okay has everyone created those three variables in logs
okay right what we are going to er do now is create a constant we'll need a constant for our UNK so if you type the letter q to come out of the data processing environment right type the letter q right and then go into the er constant creation menu which is option one of the data processing menu right you'll be asked for a name for if you like call it c or constant or fred UNK just supply a name to your constant term
by the way has everybody changed erm the UNK or their UNK have you changed it to your date of birth have you all done that because if you haven't you've only got six grace log ins on erm where your UNK is your user name
if you don't change
your UNK within six er times of UNK in then you will be excluded from the network
so you won't be able to log on to UNK
right okay so has everybody created a constant right what we are going to do now is to er estimate the first model right equation one on the sheets that you've been given alright you've created a constant we've got our variables l n t c l n i l n p
right so if press the letter q to UNK from the data processing environment and press the return key head towards the action menu right when you are in the action menu go to option two which is the estimate option right and you should then be given a UNK box
if you then specify your equation so it's l n t c your dependent variable space whatever the name you called your constant then l n i space l n p
now just specify the variables that you want in this regression right your dependent variable first okay when you've specified the equation sorry once you specify the equation press the end key which is between the UNK and the UNK key pads that will then submit that request right
if you then er it will then ask you over what period do you want to right so if you press the end key that will submit the job erm it asks for the sample period we're going to use the whole of the sample so if you just press the return key that's the default for the whole of the sample right it then asks you what procedure you want to use to estimate the model we're going to use o l s option one just press the return key o l s then the computer has estimated the model right
before we move on let's just have a look at those numerical estimates can we look at the coefficients on income notice that in this model because we've UNK both dependent and the independent variables right the coefficients that we estimate are elasticities right so we can read those coefficients off directly as elasticities and that's the case for any model in which all the variables are UNK right in er if we didn't log the data in order to calculate the elasticity we have to multiply a coefficient the computer gives us by a erm price quantity ratio price less part of the income constant ratio to obtain the income elasticities
alright but in any double UNK mode right the coefficients you estimate are elasticities so we look at the incoming elasticity we get a measure or we get an estimate point six eight right that's a positive as we would expect suggesting that er erm textiles are a normal good right
notice that an incoming elasticity is less than unity and that's less than one as a result textiles textile industry in the UNK is going to be a declining sector in the economy right as incomes er per capita g d p rises the textile sector will benefit alright because human demand for textiles either they're demanding UNK less of any increases in incomes
right then so as a result the textiles would be a and relative decline to the rest of the economy
is that a t ratio on that incoming elasticity
is that coefficient UNK significant is it significantly different from zero
our estimate incoming elasticity just the t ratio would you say
t ratio of one point four nine
typically we use the rule of thumb to statistical significance so if we have a t ratio that's less than two
we can UNK that coefficient to which the t ratio is attached is not significantly zero
in actual fact our incoming elasticity there with er nought point six is UNK significant zero eighty five percent confidence level
confidence right the figure in the square brackets next to the t ratio gives you the significance level of the coefficient right
we normally use the five percent significance level or the ten percent significance level which UNK er ninety five percent confidence or ninety percent confidence right
so this t ratio on income elasticity is for the bit right and if we were using the five percent or ten percent as our sort of cut off point we'd actually UNK income from our consumption from our demand function
now as UNK we should have strong UNK about income in this model we would all we would expect income to be very important in explaining textile consumption although the model is telling us at the moment income doesn't seem to be significantly explained in textile consumption so that's something to worry about we're getting some er sort of peculiar results here
we now look at the er price unity as a t ratio minus ten right so it's highly significant right and the er figure in square brackets the probability value next to the t ratio tells you that we get least ninety nine point nine percent confidence UNK price elasticity demand significantly different from zero right now is everybody happy interpreting the coefficient right and the t ratio
if not say now and we can go through it
it is vitally important that you know
how to distinguish a UNK significant coefficient right rule of thumb is that the t ratio has to be greater than two with absolute value right and the figures in square brackets next to the t ratios tell us the exact level of significance right er of that coefficient right so the incoming elasticity of demand is UNK significant from zero only at the eighty five percent level a correspondence of fifteen percent significance that incoming the price elasticity demand highly significant right significance level as given by the UNK by the probability er unit in square brackets the timing level therefore we could be very highly confident about that coefficient okay
so we've got this model right we've estimated the model let's now have a look at the plot of actual and predicted
so if you press the return key right we just get a whole list of diagnostic test statistics that we won't look at the moment press the return key again come to the post regression menu you go into option three which is a list plot option
now the plot actual and fitted right so we try to explain the actual block of textile consumption as the blue line and to do that we are using our model with those fixed estimates the incoming elasticity and the price elasticity
as you can see there the model is breaking down during the latter period of our sample
the notice that appears to track the data quite well up until about nineteen thirty right and then after nineteen thirty it seems to get progressively worse
now we may suggest that that's the effect of the second world war UNK alright UNK the estimates that we've just produced from the whole sample
now because i'll leave that for a moment right so one way we may test the structural change right is to construct what's called a dummy variable and a dummy variables in a wide variety of applications they can be used to er get rid of er UNK observations very high or very low observations
they can also be used for tests for structural change right what we're going to do is to say during peacetime right we'll estimate our model we'll then estimate our model during wartime and we're going to assume that the coefficients or the income and price elasticity mark don't change during between peace and wartime all that happens is as they intercept this model shifts right now you may thinks that's not particularly er attractive you might expect the price of income elasticities to change between two periods and we could actually use dummy variables to see whether that is the case right however we'll get very similar results right if you just use a slope dummy so it'd intercept dummy right and all that's going to do is to say well the model runs like this in peacetime right and then wartime it suddenly shifts up or down depending on the effect of er of the war on textile consumption
right so what we're going to do is create a dummy variable to test that hypothesis right so if you press the escape key right and work your way back towards erm the data processing sort of environment so go back to the post regression menu through the UNK menu erm when you're in the UNK menu go to option six which is the process plot edit option right now press the return key in the data processing menu right and that will get you to the data processing environment when we can start messing about with our variables
right what we are going to do now is create a dummy variable right let's call it d one right so if you type d one equals zero and press the return key what you created there right is a new variable called d one and it assumes the value of zero right what i want you to do now is to edit this variable so type edit space d one press the return key right if you type on edit space d one you'll then get a sheet that has all the observations for our variable d one
using the cursor key move down to nineteen the observation for nineteen forty right when you've done that type the letter one and then press the return key right and you'll see that the observation is changed right from zero to one
move the cursor to nineteen forty one right and then press one again press return key
just go through the remainder of the of the observations so that you should have zeros up until nineteen forty and then at nineteen forty through to nineteen forty five right you have ones
when you've finished doing that press the end key
right the end key will save the edit that you've just made okay
right what we're now going to do is incorporate that dummy variable as the UNK in our model as an explanatory variable so what's going to happen is that dummy variable is turned off alright in the first part of the sample right up until the war that dummy UNK going to be off right so it has a value of zero right then in nineteen forty through to nineteen forty five it's switched on and what it's going to do is to pick up any differential effects right in the intercept between wartime and peacetime right we'll talk a little bit more about that in a second we're going to add it in as a UNK right because it only comes on during the wartime it will pick up any shift in the intercept right that occurs due to the war if there is one of course there may not be but it's quite likely that there may well be so if you type q to come out of the data processing environment go back to the action menu and test estimate forecast okay at the UNK box just add d one to your list of explanatory variables alright then press the end key right yeah we're gonna use the full sample right we gonna use o l s right you have now estimated the model with this dummy variable now just to see what's happened to those coefficients the er incoming elasticity was at nought point six is now doubled right to one point one four more importantly right its t ratio has jumped from one point eight five right to six point eight as a result we now say that the incoming elasticity the income coefficients right the significant zero it's important to explain the textiles as such the er we are now getting a very different estimate for our
our estimate for price elasticity is four and one to nought point eight minus one is one point eight notice though that its ratio has jumped considerably or has doubled and the dummy variable itself is very significant the t ratio ten the coefficient on that dummy variable tells us the effect of the war on textile consumption right so on average textile consumption rose by point two er see what the units of measurement are we don't actually have units of er ah so we'll
elasticity whatever it's multiplied by
that's right if you er so this point two UNK the effect of the war on our equation and where is the so the intercept well what you're saying is in peacetime the intercept is equation three point one seven however in war time the intercept shifts up and is now three point one seven plus point two
you could draw it like that you could say that this is the war which cuts in this time of year line shifts up
yes
so if you wanted it back you would actually get a new value for the intercept which increases by nought point two three point
three point one okay so this is where the model in effect what we've done which is a very crude way right of erm incorporating UNK influences right we haven't said tha that the war is going to affect the income or price elasticity what we did do right all that we're doing is that we're allowing the intercept of our model to change right now as a result we've got we can prove the st the statistical significance of all the variables in our model right the co the actual coefficients that we've estimated have changed quite significant particularly in the er the incoming elasticity right the incoming elasticity was less than one right and UNK before was now greater than one and height of r squared has also increased dramatically our measure of explanatory power
now if you just press the return key a couple of times right and have a lot of actual and fitted if you go into option three in the data post depression menu you will notice that the fit of our model is very different right so we are now getting a very good correspondence between actual and fitted notice that in our original model the thing started to break down at about nineteen thirty right just by allowing the intercept to vary right over the wartime we've now got a much better fit throughout the whole period why is that the case
why are we now getting a much better fit throughout the entire period simply by incorporating the dummy variable to the war period
any suggestions
well what's happening is it the during the war right we're UNK the computer to estimate like a single coefficient that is applicable to both war and peacetime er isn't the case right th there is a structural change right so when th when we UNK the computer to estimate the coefficients throughout the whole period right the coefficients are biased but if they don't apply either to the post er pre war peacetime sample neither do they er fit very well to the data during the wartime right if we allow the intercept to change but we're getting much better estimates both wartime and peacetime er UNK okay because we haven't got rid of we've got rid of that bias right in UNK the parameters to fit both wartime and peacetime er time periods
okay erm on this sheet i don't think well we won't go through it now because we've run out of time
on this sheet on page two we've er we've performed equation two right on the sheet and the second page and it says that there's there are two alternative ways of testing for structural change using dummy variables
one is to include corporate dummy variable of the intercept and see whether it's t ratio or significantly different is sorry it's greater than two right or we can use an f test right now that f test that's given me that formula in the middle of the page is a very important test which was developed by a chap called chow and as a result it become known as the chow test and it's a it's a test for parameter UNK er do we have constant parameters in our model now it tells you how to UNK this chow test in this particular case we're only UNK the intercept the chow test gives exactly the same results of t tests right erm we won't bother going through it if you want to go through this er sheet in your own time calculate that chow test and essentially what it involves is splitting with the s the whole sample now into two sub samples right the first sub sample right is peacetime the second sub sample wartime right and you just compare the residual sum of the squares on the UNK for variation right between actual and fitted values just compare the residual sum of squares between these two sub periods right and if you use the formula that's given there that will come out with exactly the same result well in actual fact you can square if you square the f statistic you get calculating one formula you will get t value got from er the computer right the er the sheet goes on to say how we can er use dummy variables in slightly more complicated ways right we could see actually see whether the income or price elasticities of demand changed
right instead of letting the intercept change we could just let er our elasticities change
anyway that's preferable because that's actually what's happening right the war is likely to affect the elasticities of demand rather than this er UNK concept intercept erm and the sheet on page three tells you how to do that okay
but essentially all these tests do the same thing because they're seeing whether the parameters that we estimate over the entire sample are UNK over all sub samples right we can't we wouldn't bother testing over all sub samples though we can do it's just if we have good reason to believe that behaviour in one sub sample different for behaviour in another e g use er chow test or UNK a dummy variable on the intercept to see whether there was any change
right okay we'll leave it there if you just press the escape key and then work your way out of UNK towards the action menu exit from UNK and don't forget to log out of the network
okay feel free to come down here at any time with this sheet and er going through the examples in greater detail q m four fit was the data file you'll always be able to access right when you've UNK out of the network feel free to go and a UNK christmas see you next year
the next meeting in march with very good reason it UNK with a conference that needs to attend so we're proposing with your agreement that we put it forward a week to the seventeenth of march is that a problem for anybody
when
same time ten thirty
possibly for me
could you just let us know
yes thank you
right
when is
the seventeenth of march
what's on the twenty second harry
it was on the twenty second we're putting it forward a week
that's not a week
five day week well five day week
okay right harold you can start your recorder if you wish now
apologies for absence
chairman apologies from sue mr and mr
who are as you probably all know erm in london or on their way to london lobbying i hope successfully but i fear probably not said he keeping an eye on the tape recorder trying to get more money out of the government in regard to our backing in this and we wish you well
it's supported by our local m p so i believe well it's okay minutes of the previous meeting which was held on the twelfth of october and i'll sign them as a true and accurate version
this takes us into item three this is the provision of service land er the
updating report chairman i've these past the contract for the on site services has now been let by the county council's private UNK department they're actually going in the present time
that contract is now completed the infrastructure contract on site itself has been let and er we have now resolved all the issues that were on that site and effectively we've already sold two of the UNK off that site before
details of those are on plot two
the UNK valley business park chairman the er the management board met to have a look at the site we're getting some demand for some smaller UNK have turned down and there is the proposal that was considered by the management but was turned down to put in a little round er so we could rate some of the UNK at the bottom of the site in to er mark out the UNK rather than pull any UNK erm if the construction of them would be funded from selling UNK in that area
recommendations chairman just to note the report and to UNK the decision of the UNK valley management body about the construction of a on that site
where is in relation to this
well if i can check it on the plan it's the plan actually shows half the site there's the central slide way coming down through the development site all that UNK all one side of the slide way
yes right
any other questions accept the report
item four a lot of these i think you'll find are items which are purely for information
it's important that they keep me UNK of what's happening paper c
a power to advance chairman
all the er all the units are let we've had two we've had notice of two UNK coming up but we have actually got a waiting list for units so i don't think we'll have any problem in filling those
interestingly all eighteen units on that site have been full from the day they were created and that's been a most successful run
we've come we've had to make at previous meetings chairman about the er about the fall off we've had in demand for the small units there now
we've actually had a pick up there's been a sort of renewed interest er it's quite significant that over the last month or so there's been quite an increase in people making enquiries about those units
we have actually let four of the units two have gone to a department of council for a service they're delivering in the area er but actually it's a manufacturing type of operation that they're running there so it's that you know is in keeping with the nature of the units and the other two units have gone elsewhere
i think that's really quite positive that we see erm that we see an increase in demand coming about in them areas
the UNK units erm have never been successful since the time they were they were constructed
the maximum i think we've ever let at any one time is three of the six units we're currently down only to one unit there at UNK
sandy lane we're now erm we're down to eleven of the eighteen units occupied at sandy lane
right members will recall from the last meeting there was an issue of it at shrewsbury college because of the transfer of the screw and UNK factory to the college or the UNK claim to the transfer of the screw and UNK factory to them because of the er the UNK the UNK of the college as an in independent body under the higher education act
we've had some discussion with the college to seek to resolve this and the proposals erm are set out in paragraph four three er in that it would mean that the college would not take over the ownership of the site er and it but they would continue to occupy their part of the site er effectively rent free from the county council but if at any time they decided they the college wanted to move away from the site it would revert to the county council it wouldn't actually become a college asset
i think probably chairman it's the best deal that we could get in the circumstances
i think chairman that's still subject to approval by the e a b erm which is at the end of the day the important party that has to be satisfied so these are very successful negotiations but we we're still awaiting erm confirmation they've been accepted
by whom
by the education assets board
who are they
a government body and if at the end of the day there is there is still disagreement between us and the e a b er then there is an appeal to the secretary of state but erm we're hoping that the e a b may accept these proposals
UNK it's just a very small point
yes you see he agreed to contribute to a suitable replacement upon terms that we agreed what happens if terms aren't can't be agreed
i mean
who's going to agree the terms
well it would be between the county council and the college i mean i can't envisage the situation that we would actually serve notice on the on the college to leave the site and therefore trigger that part of the agreement
but the minute the minute the college simply agreed at least they've agreed to close for ten million pounds at least if they don't agree what would happen then
well we if this only happens if we wish them to UNK the site and what it is to jump to a suitable
oh no it isn't we intend to UNK the site
and if a suitable replacement for the facilities they've got now
chair where erm agreements er leave things open wherever possible the courts will interpret them as the parties intended to act reasonably one to the other and er if there were a formal agreement and that was then tested it would be a matter for the courts to decide what was reasonable obviously asking for what was it you're suggesting ten million
would be regarded as unreasonable there'll be no question of that being enforced but er clearly where the thing's left open there there's some room for manoeuvre in negotiation eventually and settlement if need be before the courts
okay we're asked to approve these terms in para four three is anyone backing it
okay
five inward investment activities to pay the deed
just the report to note chairman
er just one question er chairman that we have success to report on that though i can't go into details
erm members who are also members of the business grants panel will recall that at the december meeting we agreed to grant to a company so he may UNK into the area creating twenty seven jobs and friday we learnt that UNK to go ahead to telford
to telford two companies that the UNK helped
right local report
chairman there's erm where where's can i ask where that UNK coming from
of course
UNK from telford
the west midlands conurbation
from the west midlands
erm on this paper i just wanted to ask you erm simon says it's from the erm american agency how many jobs i would really like to know how much we spend or how much is spent on trying to achieve jobs from american from companies in america and erm how many jobs have been created
i only say this because it's always been very difficult to get erm america to take any interest at all in developing in england and how and i'd wondered if it's still the same situation
with all due respect to have an UNK to getting american viewpoint to erm set up in england and i would just like to know how much it really comes to
i thought there were two answers to that madam through the chair er the first is that we don't actually spend any money directly ourselves as a county council in america we contribute towards the regional development organization the w m d a and our contribution is about twenty thousands pounds per year
erm which is a very proportion of their costs it's mostly funded by the d t i and some private sector investment
they in turn have consultants in japan erm in europe and in the united states and their particular consultant in america happens to be in UNK run by this chap called simon who by the way we feel is very effective and very good at his job
the second part of the question erm how do we evaluate it is extremely difficult
erm we get er leads unfortunately they become available across the whole of western europe or the whole of britain and we don't have hundreds of successes from america
it's clear they come one every so often as the one from germany but when they do come they're very worthwhile it justifies our effort
i can't give you a figure now on how many american firms there are in the county erm but i can do some work on it and come back to you
i would like chairman to know because er it always seems to me that unnecessary money is spent in the american lead so it's difficult to get any money
i don't know who's our representative to and
i think i can
and erm i just yes i mean europe yes the far east yes but are is a waste of money
my recollection and i'm speaking from memory and i could be wrong but i think that the last time i looked at lists of the various companies in telford where i'm obviously more concerned not well that's not to mean i'm not concerned elsewhere but i'm more familiar with respect to them my recollection is that the more american than anything else on that site
it's been certainly true er chair that america has been the largest source of inward investment in this country consistently
i mean UNK of the countries UNK as business in the way it changes and japan comes first UNK gone down in recent years because of that trouble but america has consistently been the major investor in this country
not always noticed because if it's called UNK it doesn't look like a foreign company but if it's called UNK or something well it will stand out
but it is worth attacking as a target market simply because of its size
could
the great i mean you've a valid point and i think it's due to the recession in america i think we were disappointed were we not UNK that the results of our trip to er new york state and this has nothing to do with the enthusiasm of the business people we met there everything to do in my view with the fact that the recession and UNK been through a very tough recession they just don't look to expand elsewhere but the reaction we had in er in america was very powerful of a wish to want to do something when things look better
one of the one of the i think what perhaps american companies have i have asked david to go upstairs and get the list of foreign companies operating in shropshire so we can actually see how many american companies there are among throughout the county
i think one of the things the american companies often do is that rather than set up on a green field site they often buy into an existing company erm and therefore it's a it's a somewhat different form of investment to the
like clarke
pardon
like clarke UNK
well i think erm UNK er UNK to let them
mm UNK to let them
have been bought by an american company as well then
so there is a flow of american source in but less i think in terms of building a new factory on green field a green site and more of erm buying an existing operation
and which might continue employment which doesn't actually create extra employment
sometimes it creates extra sure
erm i didn't say the question lightly it's just that i think it needs watching and i wondered how it was because i've heard so often in the past that people have so many lines of enquiries but the money goes and you know it's all marvellous and i'm not suggesting
the big christmas big christmas card company erm and it is big er is american and wholly owned american and that's not but they didn't build a factory they took one over that's already
right
yes sure
in five three it says we've only got seventeen u s enquiries in the last twelve months could i could i ask how many of those seventeen produced anything
yes a lot of those are actually spread over the whole of the u k
one of the problems about dealing with somebody like in the process is that one they get their enquiries from the investment income bureau the investment income bureau get their enquiries from the UNK so what is happening that they're only picking up those people who are searching everywhere
there's no direct relationship now what we attempted to do with the metropolitan development agency was to fill the direct link so you can get in earlier erm
can i just i think i think it's a hundred and er twenty eight foreign companies in shropshire thirty four of them are american
the next biggest is
the next biggest is erm the next biggest is germany and then followed by japan
and the american companies are er UNK life is an american company erm i'm just picking out the some of the big names that you see in telford UNK er UNK foods fruit of the UNK cards h f t trust and savings plan erm you know that that's just
well it's UNK there are erm
sometimes we have a listing of er of all the different foreign companies who are operating
er government of what's going on at the moment
okay any other points
right
business development section paper e
the er business grants panel share has now met on a number of occasions and the three results of its decisions are set in the report
the problem that is arising in this is that it is now clear that er that the grants panel are running out of money this year because of the take up of lots more grants
and it they're likely to need something like a further twenty thousand pounds er if they don't have sufficient funds to continue to at the balance of this financial year
i mean it isn't as though we have to operate a policy in which we heavily advertise the availability of grants it can develop via word of mouth if we advertise anything we would be UNK with demand for to a level that we couldn't cope with
the recommendation of the report on that chairman is that er we should erm transfer twenty thousand pounds to the er business grants from the either from existing budgets and any other existing sources of funds which are available within the department it would be if we merely UNK through everything we might find anyway we might have some fund spending UNK at the end of the year see if we keep things just let's keep the scheme going
any comment
this seems this seems a worthwhile thing to do to me chairman this may reflect that this position that we are in the business cycle that er you know with a slightly optimistic outlook a lot of firms are seeing themselves in a position to expand and need this to help them do so
yes any other comment
we agree the recommendations then
at all
yes
i think what we have got to bear in mind mr chairman is that the small business is it is a very dangerous time as we come out of recession more businesses get into difficulties when they're into expanding than when they're just surviving if you like so erm i think we have to keep a very careful eye on the next six months
true yes i'd agree UNK one point four
erm yes chairman the suggestion of the recommendation if you like that er UNK erm proposal it is er to participate is er rejected by er i don't particularly feel that way about it that erm if apart from the fact that the contribution is UNK and i don't think that we'll get all that many applications from the regional district council anyway but erm i wouldn't see harm at all of both oswestry and UNK being allowed to send a representative if there were any applications it'd be good for their area er and er even if they weren't allowed to vote on it and i suppose they shouldn't be allowed to vote on it erm i would see it as erm another attempt another avenue to towards partnership between district council and the county council development
which at this particular time is much more
i think i take your point UNK and we don't UNK from it what we have to guard against two things one that the committee becomes big and UNK and two of course we mustn't get into a situation where a regional representative is UNK is influencing decisions made elsewhere in the county that's the effect of the
yes well i make that point
quite providing there was only one representative and we weren't UNK providing it was clearly understood that they were there almost in the same way that a local member would be to speak on a given item and not to vote then i don't think we'd have any objections but it's entirely up to the committee how do you feel
can i just say chairman that the problem was that they asked for the region asked for equal representation with the county council now if all the districts did that then there'd be then the grants panel would have about twenty one people to i mean for the operation to go ahead
i would support the chairman's suggestion that if this is done at all that it be done exactly on that basis as if they were a local member allowed to speak on that specific item but not to vote on but not to have a vote on anything
yes right
i think chair a far better idea might be that it when we get particular applications from a given district that the officers actually ascertain er a bit of erm information from that particular district in order to present to the committee to take into account when they're doing things i think that would be a far better way because if we have politicians elected in that particular area they'd certainly probably come and try and hold the UNK for that particular item and there may be UNK grounds on a UNK basis not to concede it
mm it's a valid point
but we already consult on
we do yes
well how do we feel it seems to me not exactly consensus on this issue
we could introduce it for a trial period we could
i don't mind i i'm relaxed about it i think councillor 's point of view and it is a valid point of view erm shall we shall we permit the officers to negotiate using their best UNK and see how it goes but have a special meeting but play it by ear everybody happy with that then
so we're happy with the twenty thousand pounds which we need to find from our already er okay
tourist promotion
paper f
there're a number of items er chair erm the brochure has been produced and well received
the production at no cost to the authority because of the advertising revenue extensive press coverage erm and media coverage
sixty major articles since april ninety three erm in such publications as the UNK tourism magazine chat magazine those three alone the value of that publicity is fifty three thousand pounds so our officers are doing well on that front
world travel market attended the club promotion although it's still running hasn't been very successful over four hundred bed nights into the campaign as a result of that short running promotion
product development you have a leaflet on er rural churches in front of you
walking in time through time is erm being in proceeding
the objective to funding from the old objective programme is we've now learnt that we've been successful in getting a grant made towards the centre feasibility study shropshire UNK japan television advertisement on the japanese japan area towards the UNK promotion and the fly drive marketing initiative because er to get people from north america into the UNK and staying here so it looks as those projects will be almost fifty percent funded from europe to objective two
the UNK i beg your pardon initiative is proceeding er in terms of an advisory group and we have as a committee a councillor tony a regional member recently take took the place of er councillor on that group and he is willing to continue
we had to nominate a member
similarly the projects schemes that elect a member it's councillor who's also willing to continue and that's for this period of time
chairman erm i think that erm councillor who is on this committee is quite interesting in and interested in this UNK initiative and i think that he does as are representatives of the UNK advisory
is that seconded any further nominations
i propose that tony remains as our representative
that's seconded nice to know we have a straight choice as you favour we'll take them in reverse order
those in favour of councillor tony please show one two three four five those in favour of the other gentleman please show one two three four good grief
UNK
he's come closer than many do okay
can i propose councillor for the one
and councillor
any further nominations for county
no er
i think er committee ought just to say thanks for both of them i mean this isn't the way with reference to peace UNK them democratic though they're i think both mr and represent the county of UNK now and i'm grateful to both of them because they took a weight off my personal shoulders which was useful
come in
yes
could i say that there was
yes
yes mr chairman i erm i do appreciate that erm i've been invited through committee er to go through what i do represent er the building project erm on behalf of the economic development because as you all know i'm of course on the economic development before but er in the past i've found that i have er been shall we say relieved of my positions on other er position erm UNK to myself and of course i have er actually turned up on these planning functions and been there and to me in the past i have always found that if one is going to be missed one must then one's either asked if he wishes to continue if he's been doing his job properly if he doesn't do his job properly then it's only right to replace him
but at least give that person whose turn er on the management committee for representing er another committee give him the opportunity to s either speak on it or to say whether or not he wishes to carry on and of course to see what the vote people would take and to put himself forward even so which unfortunately i wasn't er able to do so
but i think this is why
but i think i do appreciate that the economic and development has invited me on
i think it would be wrong of this committee to comment on the er what happens in other committees certainly in this committee i don't think any anyone's ever criticized your erm representation on the community project we do perfectly we can't hurt their decisions so your relationship with this committee is good er elsewhere i don't know anything about it
now okay
no
perhaps erm we should note too that the recommendation of the contribution of five thousand pounds everybody happy with that
all i would say jerry is that it'll have to come out of something like our carry forwards for this
yes which will be an item on the agenda later on
but we do agree i it's silly not to support money in the work they're doing is good certainly the er the UNK in the tourist areas didn't look really well into making UNK to promote those
one of the big items there is the bridge project isn't it
which is struggling to get off the ground
did they ever get that under way
erm i think it's still under discussion
still mm yes
there are other things in development
yes well we listen well
right paper eight which is the sad paper the earnings level in shropshire
well the figures are there it's following the very substantial debate that took place at the last county council meeting on the issue of earnings within shropshire it's to give the committee a bit more detailed information about the position and particularly i think the position about female earnings in the county er where we're really at the bottom of the u k lists
erm it perhaps part of it has been that a lot of the job creation mentioned has actually been of female and part time work and a lot of the er new businesses in erm telford actually employ a lot of women in those areas
so we are looking to the effect of the aims a low paid county that's not something chairman i'm proud of because i do think that those that areas with a high paid economy are genuinely more UNK areas
high pay doesn't actually mean that everybody is less wealthy it generally means that people are more wealthy
the two out of here is
the other issue chair that's on is the issue of the low paid unit and the er the view as to whether we can keep it about the wish to join the new west midlands low paid unit who presumably know about the issue of pay er of certain people in shropshire
on the question of low pay there is a point of view which some hold that being an area of low pay attracts help attract inward investment and i can't deny that certain not all but certain companies certainly take into consideration
but in my personal experience in america not so much korea certainly japan erm the first question invariably that you're asked is communication
that's always been my experience and then even the question of your links with the local universities
in my experience it's always it's higher than low pay and i don't believe that companies go to an area because the payment of wages is low if everything else is not favourable to them as well in fact low pay in itself does not attract and UNK i don't think the UNK an UNK because i've talked to potential inward investors and UNK sort of teased them and if you get enough companies coming into shropshire then inevitably wages will go up and they're intelligent people and they realize it and they not the magic ball and of course when local UNK are concerned about their businesses then the amount of wages that are available to spend has an effect on your local small company
those are my opinions i don't expect everyone to share but they're there
on the in er not wish to help to support the low pay unit we've two options well we've three
one not to erm be involved at all two to be involved and i s think we should because we get very valuable information and help from them but my own opinion and i think i speak for my group is that we don't need to worry about having representation on the board if we go for option two which i believe represents the best value for money but it's up to this committee to decide and it's in your hands
any comments
yes
i would agree entirely with all of the first part of your UNK mr chairman
oh right
i feel what companies are looking for is an available skilled workforce not the opportunity to get a lot of unemployed people at a very low wage so i'm basically supporting what you've said
but i do feel that it is it would be a complete waste of this committee's money when we've many better things to spend it on to join this low pay unit
it would be yet another committee a group of UNK whatever they are that eat up our money and no use or purpose in my opinion
right any other comments
right er that the earnings figures and the unemployment figures in the next paper illustrate a labour market situation in shropshire in which workers are in a very weak and UNK position
i mean the phrase better low pay than no pay has been used to sort of describe the economic situation and the and almost the economic development strategy
but from the point of the people in that position they're in a dilemma they're in an extremely weak position
coupled to that the er sort of the statutory protection which has been in existence for er workers for many years in some cases is being UNK away
er has been and is continue continuing to be UNK away so workers in shropshire are in a poor position and this is an opportunity to give them some help to replace some of that statutory protection which is being removed
the low pay unit isn't er a government civil service type operation it's an independent body
i think it provides very good value for money er i think it will give shropshire workers some of the protection that they're lacking from the statutory instruments that are being removed and from the labour market conditions they face and erm maybe er a some successful operations by this er low pay unit would improve the position in shropshire and maybe er get employers to improve the er conditions and wages that they offer so i would certainly support er option two
chair
this causes problems er if i may say so er but erm it the paragraph doesn't make any reference to the date it's paragraph five point three now i want to see debate in the point in erm implementing it before the first of april
i think i'm before the first of april
no the intention is before next year by next year
yes one extra job
i was just going to say i think what you say on full employment erm elsewhere they're keeping wages and pay up isn't it erm and i've known a couple in telford again that there's work there a new company it's perfectly easy to take on all the good skilled labour they want then they say they feel they're very guilty because they're UNK it from across the road the british company has probably been two wages so that the jobs it does mount up so i don't i would like to know more about erm what the low pay unit would really do to help us and i look at this eight thousand two hundred and eighty pounds and i think that would go an awful long way in the mr chairman in helping to keep that going which creates all the people who leave and get jobs and good jobs and get skills and erm i it may be if there's going to be a big budget eight thousand pounds is not very much but i but when you think an individual project like that of course any sort of UNK it's a lot of money
UNK though if this committee instructed groups as it well could that it wanted regular UNK on the pay position of this county and he had to put someone to work on UNK them it would cost you what like that
yes keith
yes chair i mean i support the criteria that's been laid out in five two there i think it's very important that we do actually important that we do actually highlight the issue of low pay and where it's occurring and in some way that then prevents companies the unscrupulous type of companies that would come in to exploit that from actually doing it since most people would then be aware it and i think that the last UNK just suggested that it's an extremely cheap way of obtaining masses of information about UNK erm earnings levels and i think that's very important that we are and do come to grips with that and clearly couldn't afford officer time to be spent on merely UNK that all the time
it'd be a full time job i should say possibly one or two posts and perhaps even more than that
any further comment
well i would i would just like to draw the distinction between value added and other considerations and what will create high pay and giving high value added per employee and that's really where we should be directing our efforts
i think erm unfortunately an employer and even possibly any employer whether it's a nationalized industry or UNK industry will want to produce value added per employee and that's where the erm pay is going to come from
er that's assuming the employer wants to pass on in pay the rewards of adding value
i would have thought the labour market conditions are also a vital UNK if profitability is to be passed on or shared out in higher wages
it's inevitably if we've got a high value added per employee
he can
and he wants to increase his employee his value added by increasing the number of employees
i mean it's i really do feel on these tendency to come on all the reports i think we want i think we want to hear that jobs and wages will undoubtedly go up it's erm this is absolutely inevitable that wages will go up and rise in the situation
it's almost equally inevitable that they will go down in the low income bracket
anyway we aren't agreed on whether or not we support the low pay unit so to resolve it can i move from the chair and we take option two perhaps second it
seconded
is there an alternative motion or do we just simply vote against
yes
yes okay those in favour then of my motion please show
one two three four five
against
four
a bit UNK isn't it
okay i think i should point out to the committee i think it's self evident that the gains will be dependent upon the budget probably with regard to the position and the UNK question of carry forwards
but er that's another matter
okay i will now pronounce this single regeneration agency an integrated regional government or missed one sorry
paper h
ah yes paper h
right it's his turn then
sorry okay
who's doing h
again
it's isn't it
erm unemployment in shropshire chair erm a round up of the figures which are traditionally given there in para two one i don't remember under travel to work areas under what's called the narrow base
that's the way of calculating it
and the narrow base erm UNK certain types of people therefore the rates are always higher than the other way of calculating it erm it's the number of unemployed as a percentage of the number of employees in employment in their employment plus the unemployed
like that
right at the last committee it was suggested that the figures be presented to committee on a town by town basis i e not the wider travel to work areas the reason being that the travel to work areas are quite large and sometimes mask differences in rates of unemployment between different settlements
most figures are shown over the page and pa in para two five but they're calculated in a different way
that's not our choice that's the only way we can get these figures from UNK
that's why they're shown there they're different to the figures shown on the first page of the report but because they're calculated on the same base er one can compare at each other one can compare the different towns
and those are the figures that we have
if anybody is interested these unemployment rates are calculated by the number of unemployed as a percentage of the estimated total of the workforce the sum of the unemployed UNK employees and call it self employed h m forces and participants in work related training programmes
therefore these will always be lower but at least one can compare town with town and see the differences
then on the third page some wards with very high rates of unemployment i think they are the top twenty if memory serves me right
now this paper has produced er for information only to keep members informed of what's happening out there
i think we should be aware looking at these figures that the female figures are in my view many miles away from reality
that these are official figures of parliament let without money
if you did a survey of women of the age which people can work at who would be willing to work if work were available you'd have er completely different figures
assuming of course that most women see no point in UNK under unemployed or whatever because it UNK nothing
so that these are based on i think i'm correct in saying i'm not wrong these are based on people registered
registered and in receipt of benefit
benefit UNK so they're an UNK
note the report right
now we go to this single regeneration agency and integrated regional office
it's an important matter this isn't it
it i think it is actually er chair it's something that local governments as a whole needs to keep their eye on
because what the government have done is they've taken two steps they've created a really a joint regional office of government at civil service level and they now have a single regional director who is in charge of all the departments at the
now that actually has UNK is starting to change the nature of the way that government are control seeking to control the services
and i maybe i'm i may be wrong on this but it does seem to me that it is potentially a step down the road in the longer term to the development of regional members
er let's they are seem to be setting up the s the administrative structures for regional government without any democratic regional government taking part in the process
the second thing of course is that they are coordinating the erm through the single regeneration agency and the and the single regeneration budget the way in which they handle their monies which go into economic development type activities
the er single regeneration agency is taking on board the issues of things like derelict land and a number of other ways in which for example english partnership is in the regeneration industry and a number of other ways in which the government have acted to try to make things happen
but they've also UNK together in this single regeneration budget on and er as it says on the back page all those other budgets which were all handled separately before to create this very large pool of money that is available
now i think what we've got to try and ensure is that rural counties like shropshire get a fair crack at that money as well and we need to be starting to develop and i'll touch on this if i come gentlemen when i come on to development strategy we need to be developing a regeneration strategy for the county so that bids to the government for funding from the regeneration budget and from this from the UNK from the er the single regeneration agency er are seen against the background of a UNK strategy and we i think we will be much more successful when we go for government money bids on that particular basis
so really it's for information chairman but it's a watch this space one i think because i think there is probably more behind the steps that have been taken here as we're seeing on the face of it at the moment
i this could be a welcome providing that sooner or later the democratic element catches up with the bureaucratic one
chair i think that the pro the point is the emphasis is on partnerships is it not and that those who UNK partnerships within the community with other organizations through the region of the local authority structure then they will be the ones that will get the most of this funding
nobody else will get any unless they they've demonstrated that they've met the partnership criteria
so it's an important change i think in er the way it's structured
any other comments
i look forward to the day when we do have a regional tier of government and erm a very prominent local politician not of my party told me in confidence that he believes that erm there will be a regional tier of government sooner or later if only to react to the pressures from europe
and we do know that when we're negotiating in europe the fact that we do not negotiate as the er UNK the spanish the germans negotiate as a regional government it means that we carry less UNK and that is a fact of european life
right let us live in hope
right provision of help to overseas local authorities paper j
is this for information
yes we don't necessarily take any action unless the committee thinks otherwise
okay could you make the report
item twelve which is paper k er the order has UNK down in too many free meetings which right business links otherwise known as the one stop shop
otherwise known as the one stop shop yes just an updating for members on the basis of the report the there are a er number of recommendations attached to the report the business link proposal with it's core at park in telford is now erm processing to hoping to open in april or may nineteen ninety four
the suggestions are that the county council in particular should help in the development of UNK to that erm that business link one in oswestry and one at craven arms and we should seek to make sure those UNK are available by no later than the end of nineteen ninety four the beginning of nineteen ninety five
but the oswestry one i think would probably be only for the to be handled faster because that one is likely to take place in existing erm council owned er units at whereas the one at craven arms will require the building of a business development centre at craven arms on part of the on part of the joint development site between district and county and the rural development commission
obviously a longer lead in on that erm and the county would clearly need to put some funding into the development to ensure that those er those satellite businesses operate and only when you fund those out of the rural economic UNK initiative but it seems to me to be important that we should ensure that businesses operating in the rural parts of the county have equal access to the facilities of business link and business advice
two of course operate within telford
the recommendations er chairman are that the that we should support a payment of five thousand pounds to business link which we can find funds from existing resources that we've got
erm that the that we should support the principle we agreed the principle at the last meeting in support of the business link and satellite in oswestry that we should UNK support the principle of supporting a business link satellite in craven arms and that we should appoint a representative to the business links board
now the business links board will be er cons UNK of nine individuals three coming from the tech three from the chamber of commerce one from the county council one from the district council and one representative of the other district
okay yes
mr chairman i would like to slightly and trying not to be UNK but having looked at the erm figures i just cannot believe that those are honest figures i mean there are eleven hundred and sixty nine people unemployed in craven arms or something like that and they've lost over a thousand jobs over the last few years and erm very few of those have been replaced
what that obviously means is that they've drawn from a very from a very wide area and therefore they they've got the long main industrial estate which has thirteen factories of which only three are occupied and ten which are UNK which are erm in fact UNK
there's no maintenance no rates no UNK they're in they're in a sort of bad s or getting into a bad state so i do feel that we should try and put some priorities behind this erm particular business link in craven arms
i know the craven arms town council themselves are very keen on it and they are going to invite the county council to take part in the tasks and i would very much hope that this committee would support the county council doing everything they can to help craven arms and their particular erm UNK
thank you for that contribution
any other comments on the general report
i think equally we would support because the previous figures shows that the er erm the problems elsewhere craven arms has its problems i hear
i could take you into in craven arms on this wednesday morning and introduce you to more unemployed people than are shown on the register i think
yes
you've made the point very well
i can well believe that
that erm people don't necessarily go on this but er it's probably more or less typical of rural areas where people just don't feel that there's any hope here
apparently j p woods had a very large female workforce and a lot of those women were married and therefore not eligible to claim benefits when they're out of work and therefore don't appear on the unemployment statistics
i mean it is a very exceptional situation and i don't want to be UNK but it's not as if other areas
quite right well if it's yes
have got the same problem
i believe the problem is worse in craven arms that is shown up by the figures
i think everyone would accept that what we wouldn't want is for the impression wrongly to be created that we're UNK the craven arms higher than oswestry
no absolutely not no absolutely not
UNK figures are worse
i think craven arms the thing craven arms actually want money so much as support
erm
i think they really do want the support and they want the backing when they're negotiating with other bodies
there are so many bodies involved in this
we're spending i assume that the five thousand pounds will be funded from this year's budget and will be spent before the end of the er current financial year
yes can we then
as far as j p woods is concerned chairman erm they may well have their workforce and extended right up to
yes
can we take them item by item then do we agree the five thousand for business links from existing resources
any objections to that
there's the supporting the business link at craven arms which we've had that UNK appeal i don't detect any objections to that and finally we need to appoint the representative on the business link board
can i have nominations
can i propose yourself as the chair of this committee
certainly that's seconded
any further nominations
i think the word is by UNK is it
not taking it out or something
i'll do my best er i think i'm going out in london then aren't i looking at the rest of the
of the lads of the chamber of commerce
we might who knows who knows
okay well thank you very much erm where are we next
government yes paper l the government of the european union it sounds good
there is some ex i think exceptionally good news chairman and something which i think probably if there was one would write a UNK around the council at that particular meeting to ensure that all members are aware of what has gone on here
that there are three issues that have happened
the rural development area has been reviewed the county and the work principally done within the planning division the county has led a team of the county and district councils to bid for the retention of three areas which the rural development division were proposing to drop from the r d a
those three areas were erm whitchurch they were oswestry town and UNK
now at the end of the day the we were not successful in the bid to retain oswestry town within the r d a but i think we will be able to define the boundaries of oswestry town and count the unemployment then and it shouldn't actually create a problem in that area
what we have been successful at and particularly important in point of view is that we have been successful in keeping whitchurch within the rural development areas and retaining the status of the available which that gives
that is UNK important when one comes under the five b because what's UNK in those areas
so that what we have now in shropshire erm on the first of the maps if the new r d a's within shropshire which shows one in the south of the county one in the in the oswestry area there going across into UNK and this with around the whitchurch area
i think i think particularly important for whitchurch in keeping up the er degree of confidence in whitchurch that people will actually er are willing and able and prepared to exist in the area
march has objected five b status chairman we were delighted to hear this before christmas that the european union had recommended that the UNK bid for five b status be approved
er that means that the that the that area will be eligible for european er commission funding er on of fifty percent for eligible projects during the next six year period
it could mean bringing somewhere between about ten and fifteen million pounds into shropshire over that six years from europe into shropshire not in the whole of UNK area but into shropshire during that period to help projects in the rural west of the county
it's not all absolutely good news at the present time because the final boundaries of the area are not yet determined and we are currently in negotiation with the u k government about the precise boundaries of the five b area
the government i find it somewhat disappointing that having put in what i think was an extremely good bid i think having had that bid accepted at the first stage by government on their UNK having then had the bid accepted by the european union with the populations really that we submitted to them we now find that u k government are actually trying trade back some of that population and area coverage of the bid to be able to use some of that spare capacity which they would generate within the u k within the european population figure elsewhere within the country
i mean i think something chairman that we should actually seek to resist given the effort that everybody has put into has put into getting that five b status into the west of shropshire and into UNK
yes mark
er yes well i'd er i'd like to make two proposals first of all that we formally congratulate our officers for leading the team that er put together this successful bid erm but i'd also like to say something about these concerns about the boundaries because it's oswestry again amongst mainly the sort of north of the county around oswestry which like with the rural development area could be left out and of course economic development doesn't stop at a parish boundary people cross it it's part of their economic activity and erm i know that some of the sort of proposed projects put together for the use of this five b money er around the oswestry area are extremely desirable projects er and are achievable projects and it would be a tragedy if er if they were if we failed to achieve them because of er a kind of a bureaucratic dotted line which say you can't have the money because you're the wrong side of the line
erm i don't know how what we can do i would suggest that we er the council writes to the president of the board of trade making representations in support of the original boundaries of the bid and also writes to our m ps whose constituencies are involved in this bid area asking them to support these representations er and do the best we can to make sure that the five b area is as we submitted it
erm
yes thank you
this is a probably an appropriate moment for me to refer to the letter i've received from john who as you know who's been served in respect in london i he's asked me to read the letter but it's fairly lengthy and his first part simply UNK the point which UNK raised about the er attack on the boundaries
he then goes on to refer quite correctly to the fact that apparently they're using the nineteen eighty one census figures instead of the ninety one census figures this could result in er a reduction in the amount of the cash available and we should resist that i personally think that's less important
it is important but less important than keeping the boundaries that's only my view and he along with malcolm here suggests that either myself or the council or the chairman of council somebody writes to the appropriate secretary of state to bring these matters to their attention
it would be helpful if we can say that this had all party support is there any problem with that
can i adjust my proposal then to include the bit about the populations so that we can make representations about the boundary and the use of ninety one statistics rather than
keith
chairman i think this UNK the argument for having regional government does it not
because we're having this sort of interference from a central source er they're actually handling in UNK and all the information related to bids has been made throughout the whole of england and it's just too large to control and it's so unfair in the way that they will interpret different things from the UNK of london and i think it's important that to notice too that the amount of monies that have gone into the scottish regions since the im part of the e c prior to the e u and it's important to realize how much control they have actually have and how that money was dispersed
and we could actually have that in the west midlands should there be such a regional government ever UNK
chairman i must just say about other organizations it is approved that they're going part of the west midlands region is more better off than integral part of the region of great britain or whatever erm if they've got money into their region they jolly well keep it there we don't know where coventry is
that's exactly what i was going to say mr chairman it's it might be as mr says or it may it may well make matters worse i don't think we should get into the debate on how the national government are doing
no this issue is one of the er of what affects our county
we've got our point of view on this
well we'd rather be talking to the west midlands chair rather than fighting about where it's going throughout the whole of england which is a slight difference in geographical terms
anything else yes
