mr chairman i would just like to sort of add my congratulations to councillor because i have heard from numerous sources that our bid was extremely professional
i think the officers really are to be UNK and erm one can't sort of guess what could have happened if it hadn't been so professional but i suspect the fact that we won what we've won is a result of the UNK of our and i really would like to congratulate
i think
support and the list i mean problem with line twenty three reputation is involved
quite a UNK achievement for the party to pool that number of quite UNK opinions together professional country UNK association all the district councils have done an excellent job of unity and cooperation and i think that's very welcome indeed
and i can honestly say along with most people i'm UNK coming round to the concept that the probability is that the county will cease to exist shortly and there'll be hopefully not more than two other authorities doing the job we're currently doing
i must in honesty wonder whether the smaller reduced unitary
no
authority will have the UNK to pull this sort of thing together but again we are debating regional government and we aren't debating unitary authorities
anyway thank you very much for the you probably didn't hear all the UNK on the radio steve some about my er radio staff bottle
i listened to it with great interest and er i thought again that the county council was lead role was UNK but quite accurately described in that fairly lengthy er interview
and i've also found out that he's not interested in fishing
or bridge the man's one UNK two interests work and er UNK his house and his and he doesn't cook even
now isn't UNK
anyway
can i can i just say thank you chairman but could i just say on two three i think that one of things that built the partnership was actually the launch of UNK and that all those organizations were there and helped part of the process and i think one of the things we need to think about chairman is now we've got that b status even though we're arguing at the UNK we've actually got it is perhaps doing another event like UNK to involve all the organizations that will be participating in the programme to give them a so that they feel a common ownership of the programme they can put forward the projects they want they feel they are part of the process
i think it's those kind of things which holds the partnerships together and keep everybody good
right well following that then is it agreed that also we write to both the secretary of state and our local m ps
yes
putting our points of view and we agree to say that they are with complete all party support
and chairman that we've had support we've had a great deal of help from party in europe and it's kept us informed
yes indeed yes
now objective two status in telford a happy story but it's not as happy
well not as happy chairman because
there's still quite
as i said yesterday if i was a betting man i wouldn't have bet on getting anything actually erm and the partnership between the county council and the district council have put together the bid for objective two status in telford
the original bid was for the retention of the er objective status in the telford and regional travel to work area which is the whole of the region and UNK area
erm it became very clear that bid erm was in fact at an early stage that bid was not did not have a realistic chance of being successful so as you know chairman when you went on the delegation to see er mr in london actually at that meeting er the members of the delegation said to the secretary of state well we recognize secretary of state that it's the wrong area what we'd like to really argue for is a bid for the urban core out in UNK erm in at the end of the day we didn't even quite get that but what we did manage to get was objective two status for the urban core of telford still and i think that was probably against the odds
whereas i always felt that we would get five b i didn't feel confident we would manage to retain any objective two and the partnership in that area have managed to retain it
on that i think it is generally known that we that telford wasn't anywhere near the top of the list and it had been taken purely on the question of the er needs of the various areas it's unlikely that telford would have succeeded even with its reduced geographical area but i made UNK enquiries and was told that the factor which tipped er the commission in favour of telford and this has an important bearing on what we're going to discuss later was the fact that telford has been very good in taking up schemes and providing their section and not just the UNK district council other area other bodies in telford of getting good innovative schemes off the ground and providing the cash they didn't as some areas did get the status and then hardly do anything about it
now i think that's significant for us when we start looking at our own response to what we're doing both in objective two and in more importantly in five b
you will you note the recommendation and again thank you for general support on that issue
item fourteen rural economic development initiative
are you ready
yes chair it's er remember at the last meeting we touched on the first part of the report the worry about the issue of closing shops and rural post offices and garages and there's considerable interest from all members er as to what could be done
what we've come forward now is through is a series of proposals now these would apply to all of these there was some concern at the meeting that we didn't of them which appeared to have no chance at all as i told you so all of these issues would actually apply to all of them but the kind of things that are talked about is trying to get a standard of systems throughout shropshire so we need the importance of the way they sell a fruit shop within a rural are a rural village
erm where the authority not just the county council but the authority in the partnership get involved in lobbying exercises with the with the government to try to ensure that rural post offices can actually give out vehicle licences because it's very if you look in the north of the county outside the towns there's only four post offices i think that can actually give out vehicle licences and yet in the rural areas we have a lot of people with vehicles and we and the way that it counts towards the way that it counts up towards a post UNK survival it's these high value items are significant in keeping post offices open
that we should work with the r d c in helping to develop management skills in the village shops that we shouldn't see whether we can't use the village shops as tourist information points in the area
you know there are a string of the things of this kind of nature to try to make village shops er more viable to try and ensure their survival
erm there's just one item which m might be added or perhaps our representatives on this body could take it up some time and that's the amount of deposit which is needed by the post office from er new tenants i don't know if they're called tenants or UNK whatever to run rural post offices
i believe that if the post office changes hands that's quite a crucial time because the UNK may have to put up front quite a large sum of money
i know this was the case in an oswestry post office although it was a on a UNK estate where there had actually been er security problems or UNK problems there
but perhaps you could look into that
well thank you er yes
erm may i just add also that it's my feelings that the security aspects of rural post offices the face that we're giving out advice into given problems er i know in my particular area we had a post office erm UNK out erm there were tremendous costs involved in the security aspects in that particular post office or sub post office
and i think you'll probably find that is going to be a problem in rural areas
not that i don't wish it to carry on
you know to be aware of the situation
it's something the loans scheme could actually look at i should think
look at the whole thing and if they want to take out we should offer to help them
finance the security
yes sort of a one off payment an ongoing erm response
any other comments
we do need to appoint our representative or aren't we haven't reached the whitchurch initiative yet
alright sorry
right whitchurch seven the report they want where we're getting to and there is an appendix at the proposals of course for developing erm a forum for whitchurch er with a range of activities that we could undertake to try to UNK some confidence in whitchurch
i see us moving more and more towards what i call these kind of targets of activities we've got the victoria ward
in UNK we've to the er the whitchurch initiative there's something going on in UNK in UNK at present which is particularly education social service linked at but at the end of the day that's also about jobs two jobs of training and perhaps one of the ways in which we solve er land issues erm and of course craven arms is now is now coming up in each profile as needing something done and i'm also being approached about the east water block UNK where there are particular problems in those areas
the whitchurch one is probably the second most advanced one now after the victoria oswestry ward but the oswestry sorry the victoria ward instead of oswestry and there is a need i think chairman that i think will be very close now to forming a joint consortium to look at which goes between the county er the district the town council the tech the rural development commission local businesses in whitchurch the local chamber of commerce in whitchurch to try to pull everybody together to pool their efforts and resources for the town
and there is the need to appoint er three representatives chairman to serve upon this committee on this whitchurch forum
with regard to the three representatives can i propose from the chair that we split them very UNK one liberal one labour and one conservative
is that agreed as a fair way of proceeding
right fine nominations
well then i propose jack for our group
certainly
i've got a UNK proposal people
well i if i can anticipate it's quite possible for arthur to be in another two groups to er notify us who their representative is in due course
in writing
the same applies to our conservative members let us know in due course
okay
UNK studies whatever that is
yes just for information chairman
yes
erm really the other items are the other items on the report are for information apart the child care links
yes we need a we're spending money again
if we're spending much money UNK it'll be as big as this er code before we get any
well i think we may actually be able to get some of it actually with support towards it if we play it right because other things are particularly important that we support organizations which are trying to solve the problem of women returning to work when they have children and to UNK so that they can create the mechanisms that the children can be looked after school and during the school holidays
and in a sense it's trying to use an economic it's because they're setting up child care organizations people employing child care it's creating an economic development solution to the social problem
a hopeless
mr chairman it's just the sort of reason why we didn't su didn't support spending eight thousand pounds on some low pay unit this is just the sort of thing that we feel that committee's money should be spent on
well we welcome the latter part of your comment i was going to make a UNK about this is our idea of getting back to basics family values but i don't want i'm going to stay out of it
malcolm you indicate
do you do you happen to know will this service give benefit advice as well because the budget which introduced a an allowance of a kind for child care is actually quite complicated and it's kind of er an amount of income which can be disallowed before family credits are calculated and it involves a new kind of benefits trap as well and i can see people needing quite a lot of advice about how to get it and when not to get it and so on
i wasn't aware of that problem
yes
can something but if they don't do something which is suggested
yes
well there is general agreement on the free counselling for families thank you
any other points
chairman could i just mention to the committee on shropshire child care links erm the county council of course is also the registration body that erm registers UNK and day care and erm while obviously this is very much to be supported and ties in with social UNK own requirements to promote child care it should not be seen and we should perhaps UNK make a we can have discussions with we should be careful to endorse the giving of this money doesn't necessarily imply or endorse the standards of the people on their books who may be people that the county council in another arm are investigating and in some cases taking action to close down
so we just need to be clear that er we're not actually UNK the list necessarily
right paper m which follows
there is no paper m
that's the economic development strategy
sorry
erm the problem is that this should this agenda was prepared over the christmas period basically and we started on the UNK of an economic development strategy in accordance with the way we'd done it before which was basically a strategy of what we were going to do ourselves
and it did seem to me that in the light of erm of the single regeneration budget on the light of the need to be developing a regeneration strategy for shropshire perhaps the role of the county council in this affair should actually be er as the local government for the county should be to look at preparing a regeneration strategy for the whole county at which the work that we do to economic development is one of the pillars of support as is the work that the districts do is another UNK of support as is the work of the r d c and the objective five programme and all the various other bodies that are involved in economic development and similar activities in
so really starting towards looking at the different nature of strategies the new one would have
it would UNK within it a traditional economic development strategy for the work this committee's helping but it should look in a wider issue and seek to influence wider things that happen within the county
and it should have a view on issues like education and transport and those kind of things because they're all critical to the long term future of economic viability within shropshire
what i was going to suggest then chairman in the light of in a sense a change of a change of thought by me over the christmas period in a way it's probably best it happened is to ask if we could because i'm keen that this kind of different kind of strategy there is a there is a member ownership of the strategy rather than just put something to you that you would then have to you know you have the paper in front of you it's a thirty page document and you decided is actually to suggest that you have actually a member group of a few members perhaps three or four members erm to actually work with me on this in the development of that strategy so there was actually a member involvement because it's UNK more into the political field
there is a member involvement in the process of developing that overall strategy in into the kind of shropshire that we would wish to see in the future
any comment
well i think it's a sound idea i think it's sad at a time of local government reorganization when we're likely to see authorities getting smaller and yet the issues won't get any smaller and the new authorities may well be having to look at ways of getting together with their neighbours to look at strategies which cover areas of the sort of size of the old county areas and also getting together to meet erm organizations which will still on county size boundaries like UNK and similar
so yes i would certainly support that we look into this proposition
doesn't that make a UNK of smaller unitary authorities
well yes
of course it does we look at the guidance notes and they say things like the police and the health authorities want erm larger units the size of the present county council i'm sorry to go on
no you don't have to apologise to me
you know i can't help it
it highlights the need for us to take a rational approach does it not to er the local government review and realize that cooperation is essential between all parties concerned for the best interests of shropshire as a whole the people of shropshire as a whole
it's very important
i'm UNK temptation to get involved in this debate
let's stick to this concept i welcome it i think it shows good thinking on the part of our officers and i would like to suggest that er i take er a back seat on this one and i i'd feel probably set up a sub committee i would think four or five is ample and i would like to propose that malcolm chairs this meeting so that we have a fresh brain and a younger brain looking at the UNK problems
how do you feel about it
i still think the p a g is probably about the right size body isn't it
how many in that
seven i think
seven a bit big i would i wouldn't go bigger than five you get through a lot more business with four or five
still i don't i don't mind
you do want it cross party
absolutely
i'll second it
two one yes
two one and the groups tell us who the representatives are and i won't serve on the committee i think i'll er that i'll you've given me enough to do anyway there's a limit and unlike our officer i do have to do some cooking
you'll never live that down then frank
yes i thought that was a bit of UNK that we've got
do you get a better breakfast at school
right on the other comments on this strategy
could i just say to chairman
yes
i could do with knowing those the names fairly quickly on that one because mhm get started on
yes and get some dates yes
that exercise to produce something by the end of january consultation
right
erm training for work paper o it's for information isn't it
right chairman yes the UNK for information there are a few things to update occupancy remains healthy erm the working total has fallen slightly over the christmas UNK but erm really by ten there
i have put into the report that we did erm sign contract variations on friday last week which will have UNK all the training we're doing so we're now in the comfortable position where erm people wanting to add a further right hand column to that table there erm we've now got contracts which cover a band of two percent of the training
in other words we get paid for it and er that's very satisfactory
erm over the page the section and the session training needs position erm the erm the work of the consultants has been completed and we've still not got a report from tech or any indication of erm what their reaction would be to the to the report which comes out
erm so it's still a issue on this
erm leisure services product erm project erm closure really that was an opportunity to erm to close the loss making element of provision without cost and in view of the erm rather poor outlook for maintenance work for the next contract year it seemed sensible for us to do that
erm likewise there's still been no formal response on training travel budgets from the tech
erm i'm not in a position to add anything very much to the article for next year i spent most of friday afternoon with the tech last week erm but there's still obviously a good deal of uncertainty about programmes for next year erm what i think has been very positive is that we have now er this year for the first time since the UNK formation they've started to discuss some of the issues about the programmes with a group of providers
good
we hope that will lead to improved programmes
the tech is not expecting to have their budget levels set erm by the government until towards the end of this month which means that once again er there is going to be a rush to get contracts in place before the old ones UNK
on community action this is an employment service programme er it's got off to a very slow start
erm on friday there were only six erm trainees on the programme
erm but quite a lot of work had been done and there are another twenty four classes going to be this week erm staff recruitment is complete staff training is complete
on the staff side we have recruited nine individuals er but since we've lost three members of staff at the same time that is a net increase of six and since most of them are part time there's actually only three full time UNK we've been able to do that entirely within the we had on establishments at work
erm i think the next item that requires an update is redundancy in paragraph eleven erm UNK at UNK are updating their bishop's castle factory erm in the last week in february with a loss of seventy three jobs arrangements have been er now made for the first erm redundancy counselling and job search support course to start on the twenty fourth of january
erm the employment services has agreed to fund that entirely so it's not erm the company's not having to make any contribution towards it and very probably there will be a second course a week or two later
erm there's also been progress made on erm army redundancies
the first pilot residential course has been planned for the twenty first of february and it's going to take place at c o d at UNK and subject to that course working out successfully erm the employment service in the army will be working on this the employment service department asked to deliver the army to post six more courses erm next year
that's the next financial year
progress has already has also been made on erm the UNK pressed for county council support to launch their best trained workforce of britain promotion and a day's been set the twenty second of april far forward
erm in paragraph thirteen invest in people the target date for er achievement in the award has been delayed from the twenty seventh of sorry the twenty eighth of february until the twentieth of may and the reason for that has been staff effort required to get community action going
it seemed far more important to out and the programmes on the top line and then the UNK on the cake which is community service
now that's all chairman the report is for information
thank you UNK any comment questions
i think we should er minute our approval of thanks to the UNK team they are i think accepted as the most efficient and the best training managers in the county and it's nothing we do it's everything that the officers and the staff do
okay
item seventeen paper p
the central sc screen commission chair
erm UNK big business to get a film to come into your area you spend a lot of money and it's direct expenditure of the local economy on a combination of food and provision of supplies and if it's the right type of film it can encourage tourism in the medium and long term
the big cities new york london and liverpool even can afford to have units set up to encourage the production of films and videos and so on in their areas in fact there was a report in last UNK thirtieth of UNK shropshire star about UNK office
a hundred and fifty films television and video UNK they've attracted in four years
we obviously can't afford to do that on that scale but what we can do is fund into the regional UNK er screen commission at birmingham to their register where they will hold details on what's available er what houses what large houses are available things that can be set in what lo what er countryside there is what facilities there are what firms there are locally that can provide services to for a cost
excuse me
now it's obviously a bit of a UNK we might give them some money we might not get anything from it but we might get a major feature film or a major television series which would be very worthwhile indeed
they have asked for two thousand pounds the centre have asked for two thousand pounds from all county councils but i know that they would accept less if we negotiate that a lower figure
so erm the report asks the committee for their views because i think it would be a worthwhile thing to do
well i feel fairly positive this chair i look forward to when UNK is replaced by victoria ward
we've got our own UNK
oh right erm i think UNK well placed for this sort of work i remember when shrewsbury was chosen for christmas carol i mean not UNK not UNK not the obvious places that spring to mind but somewhere different and i think shropshire may be full of places which are not the obvious place but which film companies may be able to find if they're shown in the right direction so i would certainly propose that we you know follow this line
yes
i feel mr chairman shropshire is the obvious place
erm some film UNK sitting in london thinks of a rural county he'll probably think of shropshire and i think this is typical example of how we can UNK away our UNK resources on a couple of thousand here a couple of thousand there to other bodies erm i am i'm against this proposal we'll keep our money for essential items
mm well bread on the waters if not on the waters of the severn any other comments
i think chair you have to speculate to accumulate don't you
and if you don't not prepared to promote yourself then nobody else is going to do it for you and this is an ideal way of doing it at fairly minimal cost
i would
i think we could promote ourselves mr chairman but what i can say is that i'm against contributing to all these west midland bodies that probably won't give us any help at all
i think chairman that i having to put very good money after bad doing it this way i think it's perfectly true people think of shropshire as a rural county and i think film producers will be people erm if they want to come here they will and it's hardly council business taking huge amounts erm well known production but er quite often major films have been
well i suspect today didn't ever change anybody's
well no
opinion so if i take UNK yours is it a motion that we support the recommendation is that seconded
yes
you will presumably right so those in favour of the recommendation show
one two three four five
against
four against
at least if a film does come we'll see that if the cameras come in anywhere we'll see that all party representation on it
i'll get a job as an extra
where are we
erm eighteen isn't it
yep liaison with wolverhampton well
promoting tech
they need promoting
i think the university are always welcome to always welcome people who who're interested and if anyone wants to have a sort of look round i'm sure it can be arranged
they're very keen that people should know what they're doing
item nineteen annual conference next
chair erm every year we try and hold er an event or something of interest to the local business community to local industries and we have contacts with local freight UNK banks and companies that have UNK and we're proposing that we erm hold the event this year on the subject of exporting and how to do it because we've had very many small companies that might be UNK and want to know erm exact nuts and bolts of it so if we could run an event on that basis and then use that event as the core of a group to take across in this case ireland but perhaps in the future holland who knows where else to actually sell using the services of erm the UNK in dublin our UNK and the chamber with whom we have very good links then it would be to the benefit of our businesses
erm we have experience of this erm or officers do from other authorities and many small companies are fearful of going out there and exporting
but if they go once with a group they then go a second and third and fourth times by themselves
then we've done our work i would say that my average of ten company representatives went over perhaps two would find it was useful fact finding mission but it didn't achieve much two would click instantly and have orders while they're there and the remainder would over the period of six or nine months later if they worked at it gain orders or perhaps more importantly agents or UNK to sell their products for them in that country
it need not cost the county council anything at all right the combination and so on we can do it for relatively low cost and may get financial support it's a it's something worth doing to exploit the links that we have with our UNK and chambers of commerce abroad
sorry that's my view of commerce it's an UNK view
right comments
i think it's a very welcome initiative
i'm absolutely amazed chairman in ireland
yes indeed yes mind you we make a lot of UNK in UNK you know
you know we make it over here
okay well we agree the er the recommendations
yes rural development new designation yes
this is actually the detailed report of the new r d a and the r d t process which is going ahead this week and also to the planning committee
erm i think that the most important point within the er report chairman is in paragraph erm three four where the rural development commission are saying very strongly that if there's more than one area designated within the county and there are now three areas designated within shropshire in the past there was only one r d r d a area that it all runs through there are now three separate r d a areas the r d the rural development commission are recommending very strongly that if you do have that then they should be managed by a single r UNK committee
and i think i would recommend that we support that line
the reason for it is that resources are likely to be allocated to the individual r d p committees on probably a per capita basis and if you do that say with a small r d a like the whitchurch one it will just barely be possible to do any projects within that area given the level of resource you've got
so you're better having it within one pool and then you can decide locally the way your priorities lie within the area
what are the mechanics of setting up the new body
well i think it'll probably in shropshire terms largely follow on the existing body in which there are two county council representatives on the existing r d t and i would expect that to continue
i think one's yourself as chairman of planning
that's right any problems with the recommendation
good next UNK centre shrewsbury
shrewsbury request chairman
erm members will be aware of the at the bottom of abbey UNK opposite the abbey which work is currently under way on erm initial discussions with county council officers from e d department led to some suggestions being made
shrewsbury and borough council have taken up the UNK have decided to spend a considerable amount of money on providing a visitor attraction in those buildings around those buildings
develop will be erm shown but it is not about running it's about medieval shrewsbury many towns have these the UNK one's been UNK successful and has been copied in places like canterbury for those that saw songs of praise last night with even erm it is evident that this will be a new visitor attraction for the town with a generation of jobs permanent jobs in that er facility it will improve the erm appearance of main entrance into the town centre very important in terms of attracting other people in the future unfortunately the borough council haven't quite got enough money or they tell us
they're asking for a donation of twenty thousand pounds put that in the context of nearly say six hundred six UNK sorry five hundred and forty thousand pounds that they're spending and maybe ninety thousand pounds english heritage are spending they're asking for us to fund the shortfall
there's a gap of twenty thousand
now if we say no the project will still go ahead but it will be slightly scaled down and there will be a meeting later this month to decide how to revise the spec erm it's possible for example that the lift to allow disabled visitors to the first floor would not be included if the twenty thousand pounds weren't forthcoming
however erm it will go ahead with or without county funding
it will be enhanced with county funding which will be met by capital funding
well my own view is subject of course to our budget
not being too vicious is that i hesitate to support this until we see what the level is
could i just add to that mr chairman that all major local businesses have always have also been approached for er sponsorship of this project
it's too early to say yet what the response will be
but i personally certainly hope that quite a substantial money will come from the local businesses
mm i heard an interesting programme on radio shropshire which talked about the UNK bat which brought out the historical importance of the building and i learnt one or two things that i didn't know apparently one of the very early UNK who plays UNK i think and yet it wasn't er destroyed until the next revolution took place
quite interesting
does anyone object to giving er a comparatively small donation when you look at the total sum involved
unanimous
with the comment chairman the comment about erm us having an involvement with the scheme
an acknowledgement
an acknowledgement and acknowledgement in a manner to be agreed if that really is i mean if we put our twenty thousand pounds to pay for the lift for the disabled or something like that
no i think it's just it's just to ensure that there's a recognition that there have been a number of partners that have led to the creation of the project
well to put it very UNK in the current unitary authority debate they don't forget that we have helped
sometimes the districts occasionally but not always do
if i may chair sorry erm if it proves necessary that twe less than twenty thousand pounds is requested because local businesses come up with some of it therefore we presume on that basis we
i bet you they'll find a way of spending it all
i'm sure
okay perhaps the most important item that is the paper u which is the budget
right
thank you chair er obviously this comes at the end of er of er a series of reports where we've put back additional or UNK and the last item number t talked about a twenty thousand capital contribution er the budget will bring all this together and if i could just add one erm update on the first page where paragraph three and talk about the provision resource allocation to this committee being a reduction of fifty thousand from the community based budget
the policy and resources committee on friday considered the position that included a take a potential take of fifty thousand for this committee and similar reductions from other committees but which left the funding deficit problem of six hundred and seventy one thousand and what the policies and resources committee decided was to ask the committees all committees to look at how this six hundred and seventy one thousand gap would be funded and that should include committees like ourselves which had already identified and had put into the guidelines for reduction the full five percent reduction that had been requested to be identified early in the process
fifty thousand represents about a five percent reduction
so tell us which are these other committees have identified the five percent
there were three counties planning trading standards and economic development
yes but trading standards are part of public protection and if you lump the whole of public protection you don't get five percent do you
no you don't
so we are the only committee who are saving the that's taking our budget UNK as i think i think it's four point eight percent if you want to be UNK about it but we are planning and that's the only ones if you take that mode of view and if we took if we took training out
i take your point
okay so these are the fa the facts of the of the situation and one of the points about the strategy er and perhaps looking further that was highlighted was the use of carry forwards which UNK already referred to
ad UNK
it is it is seen as a possibility that if you use carry forwards as a way of finding the reductions a you wouldn't actually reduce a service on the face of it and you would also it would also give you a chance to examine where those reductions in services could be found in the coming months er rather than take decisions immediately
so i think that was one of the UNK in the course of UNK decision that er we should look and cast the net around again just to see if there were any way of erm of finding this six hundred and seventy one thousand without damage to the fabric of services
can i ask our officer to comment on what would be the effect of reducing our importance have on our hopefully potential
yes i think if i could if i could slightly widen it in my answer chair if i may
and deal with the issue actually on the economic development committee budget because er i mean in a sense economic development committee hasn't always played the game you never know when you're being asked to identify target reductions by an authority they have found those target reductions so have the planning committee so have trading standards
i mean in essence it's the small committees at the end of the day which actually find the target and the larger committees at the beginning of the list which don't find them
now i know a sum of money of nearly twenty thousand may not seem a lot of money in total it's not a lot of money in terms of it can be quite a large sum in terms of doing things with economic development
in nineteen ninety two three er we made er we made a four percent reduction in economic development a about erm about fifty thousand pounds
in nineteen ninety three four we made a seventy one thousand reduction in economic development and this year we're proposing to make a fifty thousand there're actually cuts i think that any committee of any council has made for the last three years
erm and i think economic development are actually contributing very fairly to the problems which are facing the county council
er those members chair that were actually at the at the consultation meeting with industry and commerce last week actually heard the business representatives in shropshire saying that the county council does not spend enough on economic development
it actually should spend more because it's community it's helping to create the wealth of the county in the future and that wealth of the county is what will pay for public services in the future
so there was there's a lot of sections of the community out there in terms of the business community who have actually indicated that the county council should be spending more in terms of economic development not less and they criticized the commission in terms of identifying some of the reductions which they have made erm as part of this year's budget alone
but the final thing that happened if i could draw the point chair is that in the in the report on the budget strategy ninety four five the policy and resources committee on friday paragraph thirty five says no provision has been made for the council's contributions into the european objective five b programme much of this will be but some hundred and twenty five thousand pounds of revenue spending per annum is likely to be is likely to required to match european and other UNK contributions
now of that hundred and twenty five thousand revenue spending which would be coming out of county council to match what is likely to happen in the five b programme most of that most of that is on economic development activities now the kind of way we can find that money without going to the authorities and asking for growth funding because this committee has not asked for any and that is not common in all the committees in the council is actually by finding it out of things like our monies and other projects actually funding it yourself as a committee funding the ability to draw in european money into shropshire
now if you take away er another lump of money including carry forwards you really do reduce your own ability to be able to pay to take advantage of the window of opportunity we now have to actually put european money into the county
i mean it's a double cost whatever you take away it's likely to cost twice as much because the europeans will not put in the other half of the money
is this the point where we whether UNK should be making contributions you know to give you an example
i don't know
well chair erm most of my money is under the resources management sub committee erm that has been very thoroughly examined i think the resources p a g have agreed with me on the other p a g and john has written that on to search for saving what i would say over and above the call of duty
he's done extremely well and he has a number of reports and examined every possible area
the p a g resources p a g met on friday and they found even further savings in the request to keep
er they've taken more carry forwards in my department and the other central departments er they've taken more from building maintenance
so further reductions have been found
all my staffing costs for UNK are in that budget and therefore i can promise chair that it would be extremely well examined
may i just point out to members that er we are making UNK are making a very considerable contribution this time
there is a twelve percent reduction in maintenance partly because we sold some UNK partly a cut in the service it is a it is a it's a it's a legal requirement to maintain the whole thing under the terms of the agreement and i'm also because of the change in our dropping our a land agent now that's a reduction of thirty three percent in the management of the estates so i really am doing my best and resources quite rightly have held my UNK in order to ensure that i do
any further comment
only to support UNK in what he said mr chairman that it is absolutely essential that we do keep some money after to take advantage of five b
i think you mentioned earlier on in the meeting that some authorities haven't taken advantage of european money and we don't want to fall into that trap
absolutely yes
it is worth just noting about it UNK up what we've voted to spend
some of which we voted against
there's a total of fifty eight thousand two UNK hundred and eighty so far
that we've actually voted to spend at this meeting
er i'm sorry i didn't quite get
i think we voted to spend fifty eight thousand two hundred and eighty pounds at this committee meeting so far
it's a pity in a way that we didn't have this discussion before because i do think it's important and i think parties these days goodness knows what we're matching is to should be a bit and they want more sort of less than putting in less fifty percent
is that saying in another way that perhaps we should push this over to consideration onto the p a g there aren't any meetings today but there will be the v a t i suppose
might have a committee chairman
yes the onus
you've got several new elements in which john 's recommended that unnecessarily ignore the situation
do we need a p a g though
can we not reach conclusions today which i sense has some possibility of consensus
it really does come down to i don't know i mean every year we play it very honestly and very straight and we push him in a position where next year if there is a next year i think the last time that we played it straight we got UNK so let's pay a little bit less and keep a bit back for when they come round a second time round
last year was erm an additional twenty thousand pounds at the last moment UNK for the big committees that's the annoying thing but what particularly UNK me and i have to say this i'll express it is the knowledge that what can be a UNK deprivation to this committee goes very little towards solving the major problems that this county faces it doesn't have a tremendous impact
and yet the impact on us is considerable and i'm seriously wondering whether the major spending committees ought not to look again at the budgets that they're erm and i've discussed this with and obviously education is the big problem but er i'm not convinced that erm the sums of money which we're being asked to pay out not be taken from the education budget without too UNK drastic an effect on the school
keith
chair we have through this what we've actually s what you're actually saying there because i happen to be of the view that when you ask for identification of five percent across all the committees and then you start to take that quite happily from the smaller spend committee then clearly you're in a position where you have to address the er question do we really want to provide this service at all and that would be tragic in the case of economic development because it's so vital to the erm economic development of the county as a whole and so yes there i would suggest that there's clearly the need to be a corporate view and a corporate er will to actually put up resources at your disposal er especially since five b wasn't actually although it was it hadn't actually been granted so it was a bit of an unknown quantity when perhaps the first p a g erm sat and UNK
so clearly now the there's some merit in looking UNK at it in the light of five b being able to match the kind of funding that's available there
the funding allowed
could we not agree today to ask the appropriate committee whether it be policy and resources the resources management of regional council that when they're examining this question of the carry forwards that they themselves review the impact that this will have on the benefits of five b for this county
now that's a positive thing
chairman can i just venture to s to suggest that the policy panel will be the next move surely dave yourself and the chief officers will be doing some formal presentation there and that clearly we need to take the strength from the vote in the co in this committee to support what you've what you've just said
yes policy panel and advisory panel
well yes indeed but it covers the influence
i would totally support the move that you're suggesting mr chairman if we are asked to provide another one percent or whatever can be done erm i would suggest that the obvious way to get that money would be to offer them the ten thousand that we agreed to spend this morning
mhm i like on west mid on west UNK body rather than on county bodies that's not
yes
not quite what i suggested but
it is a point mr chairman i'm sure it would be made but i have that i have made
five b status would not of course been allowed if this committee been sitting
this is the first time
and yet i think it's the english commission that abolished the english loans
five b status is going to bring in two to three million a year over the next five years the total cost of running the scheme is one point three million pounds in effect we're a net UNK
and have been for years
and have been for years because that doesn't take into account the money that is made when you know when sort of development that we have we have run from home
indeed valley is one
yes i mean it's er sort of
i think it's our feelings are quite strong about this in this contest that we're having with the town hall that er having exposed the five percent in the first place we have had particular innovation about five b being UNK as well
we are not subject at this UNK to identify any further UNK but that i mean that's what we're saying isn't it
yes it's not
are we content that goes forward or i mean i don't blame you for having your little piece about the earlier things but they really aren't particularly that issue that we're discussion are they
we're happy with that as a way forward
right the question of will crop up later on you know if you haven't just seen the paper
anything else you want to raise on this matter
chair what will what will happen is that er there're there are meetings planned for the policy panel on the twenty fourth and twenty fifth of january which will hear the views of all the committees in response to the request for p and r that would then be translated into a final proposal for the budget cuts which will go to the meeting of the policy and resources in february
and my guess is from what is being said is that the committee will be the policy panel will see this budget book that with all that UNK and will hear that although if you look on page three there are still carry forwards in hand that they of thirty thousand er the policy panel will be told that you you've already thought of ways of spending er i mean there's thirty eight thousand in total that we've talked about today well erm of that erm fifty eight grant that erm thirty eight of it is revenue the other twenty thousand relates to the capital project of centre
erm they'll take that into account if the potential value of thirty thousand but will state that there is really this erm problem about how to much five b erm contributions
let me put it another way if we lived in a magic world and weren't having things like essays and package deals together and any officer was being asked to forecast the money that would be needed for the sensible and UNK implementation of five b would you arrive at a figure of about thirty thousand pounds or not
now i'm not an accountant bob but you'd need way in excess of thirty thousand
well income revenue of hundred and twenty five thousand a year to manage the potential for getting in on the partners plan
and if that goes into partnership schemes it probably could be it could produce three or four times as much money actually in production
so we should be asking the other committees to look after their carry forwards to give some of their carry forwards to us to fund five b
and that's the logic of the issue but it won't work that one but at least we'll hang on to what we've got i hope
i think the other problem of course chair with using carry forwards is that just is a one year solution
absolutely
that you've then got to deal with the extent to which you've used the ninety four five against the five six one
so it's not one that really is a long term solution
yes
erm the only other item on the budget book at the that i particularly want to draw members' attention to is are the pink funds which are
er here the policy and resources committee also consider that only brought on capital which again issue guidelines which will be reviewed at the end of january for a final erm proposal in february
and those pro the guidelines would if accepted enable schemes two and three to continue on the basis that the capital receipts from the sale of the are earmarked for this sort of investments and that these in their turn will generate a flow of capital receipts which can be UNK back for the benefit of the to the UNK of county council's capital programme
so that was the philosophy behind that particular proposal that where you've got development works you take them out of the budget and the bidding process and try and get a rolling programme of expenditure and receipts so that if that's approved that would deal with two and three
on four there was a proposal to establish a two hundred and fifty thousand pound contingency capital sum against which bids could be made for schemes that would bring down action grant and i would've su thought that scheme number four would be a bid against that two hundred and fifty thousand erm contingency
now what was left was a guideline for economic development other of sixty five thousand which happens to be equivalent to pollution prevention schemes at one but was certainly not earmarked to anything in particular it was just a guideline that they were thinking of and i think it would be a help to policy panel and policy and resources committee to obtain a response to that non identified sixty five thousand pound item
this pollution prevention is this at UNK
in indeed chair yes
do you want to comment on it
it's a r it's an ongoing programme where they have sixty five thousand in into er deal with small problems of a capital nature but the far fixed er man is pollution prevention which is basically a legal requirement to stop UNK going into the stream and the like
we don't spend it unless we have to we seek to persuade the tenants to contribute towards it indeed even if we contribute we get a rent back on it
so we do our best with that
but with the sales of that are going on there are needs to move tenants around and make alterations to boundaries and buildings as we split up UNK so i would say chair it's essential that we have something in the kitty to do this work i mean it's obviously far exceeded by the capital receipts that the UNK is generating
well does that help you
well i think i'm covered around the heating out you ain't going to get anything out of the juice in the pollution prevention basically
i don't think we can
well what i think chair all that you can say to the policy panel then is they take their recommendation on to
testing
okay right so what we've been looking at this week is trade in agricultural commodities and er possibly a little bit of gatt as well
and i believe bob has asked you to er i think collect some data erm on trade in wheat and cotton erm as an example
we'll come on to that a bit later on
but can you just give me sort of a brief overview of what's happened to the composition of world trade right say over the last hundred years or so
what have been the main features
well the er proportion agricultural trade has decreased
right correct okay erm what absolute the absolute values of trade
so the relative share of agricultural trade has declined the relative share of manufacturing trade has increased
how about in absolute terms
it's increased
yes that's right
all trade has increased
why has trade in all commodities agricultural or non agricultural increased
better transport links
okay how does that affect trade
well it's easier to transport things overseas or wherever
also storage is easier improving
right super anything else
population growth
yes populations have increased
technology
yep i mean that might in a sense
yes we're gonna get
transport technology has er certainly er certainly improved
right okay so in ge in general we can say that world trade has risen over time due to essentially well is that is there anything else that
more countries have er a big surplus and more countries having a big deficit in food supply
yes
so therefore
so that says something about UNK of production possibly that countries are now more highly specialized than they once were
yep i mean that in a way is a function of UNK with which international trade can be conducted
you know if you if international trade is very difficult as it was say two hundred years ago then you've got to be self sufficient
whereas erm you can now exploit individual countries comparative advantage of this trade erm is UNK is relatively er is relatively easy
are there any other factors that might have increased for an UNK might have led to an increase in world trade
rising population improving transport and technologies
i know this might sound UNK but erm i read somewhere when that erm if you actually bring in protectionism it sounds like it could actually increase trade
if you bring in protectionism
don't know how it worked as in
as of UNK or if you increase
no if you actually you know if you have a little protectionism it does actually lead to an increase in trade but i don't know how that works
neither do i
no it doesn't you know it doesn't
i really didn't expect
right okay let's say that's a new one on me
okay
well we'll come onto protectionism in er in a minute
what other factors there's a big this fact that we're missing alright rising population improvements in transport and technology what else has happened over the last hundred years
increased consumption
yes that's right or right
income
yes income that's right incomes have risen er and as a result we're consuming more goods consuming more goods it followed well not automatically but there's a likelihood that trade will also will also rise
okay so that's they're the reasons to account for the rise in absolute values of er trade in all commodities what about erm why has the er trade in manufactures er increased as a proportion of total trade
i mean it's not divorced from the things that we've just been talking about
well cos incomes have risen so there's more consumption
okay
UNK as well er
good right okay i mean what income elasticities of demand for
higher for manufactured goods or high relative to agricultural goods
okay so because income elasticities of demand are generally high for manufactured goods as the world economy gets UNK it will want to consume UNK more of those
right now we could all become self sufficient alright
but why don't we be become more self sufficient
you know we can UNK we could consume a lot more manufactured goods but that doesn't necessarily mean that trade will rise
it's likely that trade will rise but it doesn't automatically follow
what's also happened to trade in manufactures
it's specialized
that's right okay
to well produce constant
yes that's right you've got because the market for er any one say manufactured goods in theory could be a world market now because there are relatively cheap methods of UNK this er this particular good
what's happened is because the potential market has risen firms have specialized
alright and this is why we get erm cars are an excellent example of this erm
you know UNK plant down the road in derby massive investment erm a huge production capacity
that makes all the UNK or whatever not only for the u k or for europe but for all sales of car throughout of that particular type of car throughout the world
you know and even in erm japan they're UNK the products that are made over in derby
UNK they doing that
it's because manufacturing production erm or this great scope in manufacturing production for economies of scale
alright this is why countries have specialized more because countries UNK more and consumers want to demand want to consume erm higher quantities of er manufactured goods
alright
trade automatically follows therefore
right we need the UNK and er the sort of demand elasticity erm in that argument to suggest that world UNK to explain why world trade has risen
what else before we come on to agricultural products what are there any other UNK features of trade in manufactures
alright it has risen right risen very dramatically erm well let's try and UNK this erm what's another major reason for the growth of manufacturing trade
manufacturing trade is seems to have grown very rapidly not only because we're producing erm or con consuming more of a particular UNK but also because consumers like
opportunities in taste
changes in taste yes consumers like
consumers like to have variety
yes consumers want more variety as well as just more consumption and this is why you know although we produce cars just about in the u k we still import a lot of cars to the u k
what's that what's the process of erm UNK import and export of the same UNK what's that called
erm intra industry trade
yes intra industry trade
and that's the UNK import and export of essentially similar products
alright now they're not exactly the same products but they are very similar
you know erm as far as the statistics might go you know a car is a car is a car
so you lump them all together but we know as consumers that the UNK is UNK different to the UNK or something alright
excuse me
hello tim speaking
hello UNK
very well thanks and yourself
right mhm essentially yeah use it as a erm as a motivation for the for the tutorial erm UNK particularly the first part of it talking about gatt sort of erm the er sort of characteristics of trade how it's changed indication of protectionism
no they don't
well yes it should it should be and there's some good figures in there that you may want to tell the students about and then what i would do is recommend that they have a look at it because the current issue
that came out of the current issues in agricultural economics book
alright if you tell them erm that's where it came from there are copies in the library it might be a good idea that they have a look at it
alright
that's it that's o that's okay i don't think there's anything else okay yes okay cheerio then UNK bye
right erm yes so UNK intra industry trade is growing very rapidly and that and this is sort of the main one of the main reasons why trade in manufactures has grown rapidly
why's intra UNK intra industry trade grown
well as consumers we like to er consume differentiated products right
manufactured goods are easily differentiated right you've only got to bung power steering on a car or a few go faster UNK and you have you know sort of to the consumer a different product
right although it is still a car it's it has different UNK
alright so there's plenty of scope for differentiation product differentiation
and also erm there's great scope for economies of scale er in manufactured goods therefore consumers can benefit right from er UNK the comparative advantage in particular in particular countries
production tends to be focused on very large plants erm and each plant will produce erm a particular good for the whole world market and so therefore trade must increase
so perhaps those explanations might account for declining er relative share in agriculture as well as the increasing share of manufactured goods because the other side of that coin is well income elasticities of demand for agricultural goods is less than unity so there's a de declining sector aspect there erm is it easy to differentiate agricultural products
very difficult
right it's not impossible because what tends to happen is that you can erm you can change the product mix of what the consumer receives
instead of him just buying purely the raw UNK you can er change the degree of processing erm the quality of the product erm so there is some scope for different product differentiation but certainly not the same scope that there is in manufactures
do you think the scope has increased because of erm packaging or whatever
mm i mean that's it's you know a potato is a potato is a potato in you know in UNK terms but you know you can change the way the product by UNK lots of services to that raw food product and that's where the scope for differentiation comes from it's the combination of UNK in er agricultural goods so you've t v UNK and all the rest of it
erm how about economies of scale you said that was important the increase in manufacturing trade you know implies that products will be produced at a lower unit value and therefore benefit consumers and er therefore increase his trade cos consumers will buy the cheapest product if that comes from abroad so be it
so what about economies of scale in agriculture
do you think there are economies of scale to the same extent
no
why not
it's more perfectly competitive isn't it i mean it's produced say the scope for it is less because it's on a smaller scale in general
mm that's right i mean the fact that agriculture tends to be perfectly com right why there tends to be a lot of independent small producers is because there are no economies of scale you know apart from beyond you know a certain size of farm you know stud studies in the u k show that once you get beyond about two thousand hectares there are there are significant dis economies of scale and although there are economies of scale up to that point and that's only in the case of very specialist types of production by and large once you've got a farm in excess of five hundred hectares erm you start to run into dis economy and mostly managerial dis economies of scale
that's not the same er well that's not the case with erm with things like car man car manufacturing
i mean we can UNK can produce you know sufficient UNK or whatever it is that they make at derby erm to sat to satisfy the whole of the world market for that particular car just from one plant
and that one plant UNK about sort of one hundred and fifty hectares or something like that
if you wanted to erm er satisfy the demand for a particular food UNK you'd need erm an area equivalent to the six biggest states in america
clearly that's not feasible
there's a geographical dimension involved in agricultural production that leads to dis economies of scale
alright and er essentially land is the UNK the UNK factor
right because we need land to produce food more so than we need land to produce cars or tape UNK or whatever that sort of UNK against economies of scale and that's why we have erm a large number of relatively small producers in this country and throughout the world
erm it's because you need land and er the bigger the area of land you've got the more time it takes to get your combine UNK from one side to the other er and so on and so forth
so the UNK size of plant in agriculture is very small compared to the UNK size of plant in manufacturing
okay and that could be another reason why international trade erm has had declined relatively in agriculture
now anything else that may have accounted for the erm decline of agricultural trade and the increase in manufacturing trade
because of erm protection policies
mm
like erm the c a p in france
that's right i mean protectionism in agricultural goods has risen particularly since er in the last fifty years
risen dramatically whereas in the same period protectionism on manufactured goods has generally er fallen alright
so protectionism is probably quite important erm reason
why erm does protectionism reduce trade
reduces the erm extra erm revenue you can get from exporting or it UNK increases the cost of UNK
okay yes that's one reason yes
reduced through UNK
okay yes leads to UNK anything else
leads to loss of market
mm yes leads to loss of market you know
if we're self sufficient due to a policy that UNK our farmers we're not going to want to import anything
so those are all reasons why trade in agricultural goods may have fallen is protectionism in UNK agriculture is second to none
there's no industry that's erm as heavily protected as er as agriculture on a world scale
okay so what so what other effects does protectionism have
it reduces er trade in agricultural goods anything else
what about prices of agricultural goods
they go up
sorry what
prices of on the world market
right they'd certainly go up in the domestic
yes
erm domestic country or the country where the protectionism is in place
well that must reduce trade as well cos if prices are high in the domestic market they're not going to want to sell them in another market are they
no yes that's very true and that's the effect of protectionism is to increase self sufficiency
alright however if you want to sell
yes it increases self sufficiency what about the prices of agricultural goods on the world market
the size of the world market in agricultural erm goods and the UNK of prices on the world market
aren't agricultural prices subsidized twice they're subsidized to the farmers so the farmer gets x for growing it which increases the price automatically on the market but aren't they subsidized so they can be sold abroad
yes that's true
so that's well before we can go in launch into this i mean it's often said that erm er well one of the major reasons why agricultural UNK trade hasn't been included in gatt like virtually every other er product has been is because governments are saying look this is a domestic policy it's got nothing to do with international trade we're supporting our farmers it's a domestic policy
it doesn't you know it doesn't have anything to do with trade
now clearly that's a very naive way of looking at er protectionism
but that's the main argument why agricultural policies have been allowed to increase in their UNK rather than erm fall
that makes no sense because they're selling that product abroad the farm product many of them are
they might be they might be yes
if they are selling it abroad it's international though
mm ah yes you can't any domestic policy has international UNK if it affects er resource allocation and demand and agricultural protectionism like any protectionism will er will UNK resources not according to comparative advantage but according to some erm some priority we want to support our agriculture therefore we'll erm give agricultural producers a lot of money
now clearly that's going to dis UNK trade because if we're increasing domestic production come in ah hi UNK
sorry you alright for tomorrow
yes i can go to the lecture but i'm teaching at eleven like yourself
i'll er i'll see you if UNK free at eleven
yes i've been to se i've a couple of people up to sort of promise a hand
yes is tony is tony er busy as well
UNK got a le meeting at ten thirty
ah which won't finish
fortunately i wasn't expecting to be UNK but er
right
i've had to lecture for paul
right well we'll sort we'll sort something out but i'll see if UNK i'll see if UNK available
yes i'm sorry about that yes okay
i mean if the worst comes to the worst we'll sort of cancel a lecture or something
ah well it's only a matter of giving them a cup of coffee afterwards
right okay i'm sure we can go we can look after we can get robert in or something
yes that's right we just get just grab a couple of people
sorry to UNK your class
that's okay i'll sort it out anyway later this afternoon yes that's right yes that's it
okay ten o'clock eight thirty nine
do you want me to introduce us
yes if you want to just to let the students know
sure yes
who he is and why he's there
that's grand thanks UNK cheers
yes okay thanks for everything
erm right where was i
yes so domestic policies you know can not be UNK at in isolation right
all domestic policies will have international implications okay and it's something that er governments tend to erm sort of over UNK when they're arguing the UNK case in gatt
then don't you think given that case we should set up a whole inter international thing which UNK all the governments
well that's what gatt is really
that's what you know that's why agriculture is trying to be sort of er UNK within the gatt
yes but it's failed
well it's failed at the moment but as you know if you've seen on television or read a paper lately you know you've got ten days to go
before erm you know if we're going to get a gatt agreement you've got ten days to negotiate it in
ten days to
er yes that's right
there's a lot of UNK going on at the moment a lot of er horse trading i dare say going on as well
erm but er okay
erm er okey doke domestic policies will affect world market
it's likely will world market prices fall
or rise as a result of protectionism
rise
why might why might they rise
because they cost more
what costs more
erm panic
it may not do
you know what tends to happen is that world prices fall alright in the presence of protectionism
alright because what you're doing is that you're increasing domestic production
right now it serves its purpose and increasing domestic production is going to increase world production if there's more supply prices will fall if everything else stays the same
so what tends to happen is that world agricultural prices fall right and that trend has been observed erm er it's an im UNK agricultural product prices tend to have fallen in general sort of over the last sort of eighteen hundred years
yes
so that erm the fact that you're increasing erm protection protectionism against it isn't it likely to upset the producers who are exporting it and who say it's no point exporting it there cos we're going to get erm huge thing put on our things and we're not going to sell that much it might be better just sell in our own country isn't that reduce world tr
no eventually protectionism will lead to a UNK of production in the most efficient er regions of the world which by and large are the are the regions that sell onto the world market
it's only the inefficient producers that support their UNK because it's those inefficient producers that need support erm so in the in the long run world supply world supply will contract but in the short run you know farmers in these er efficient countries of the world may well erm continue in production because they may be able to cut their average variable costs it's only when in the long run you know providing farmers can cover their average variable costs they'll continue in production in the short run
right in the long run they've got to cover all their costs right they will be driven out of business but that may take some time
alright so in the short run because more is being produced alright and demand has been increased very much or in world terms then market prices will fall
all market prices will fall
and world market prices also tend to fall because these erm sort of UNK programmes are often too successful so not only do we reach self sufficiency but you reach the status of net UNK
now for net exporting for a net UNK so our production UNK our own consumption how the hell do we er how the hell do we get rid of it
do we just burn it
or do we dump it
what tends to happen is that domestic agricultural production has already been subsidized alright it's subsidized again only to be sold on the world market
the world market becomes a residual a residual market as a result erm you know because we're dumping cheap products you know and the only way we can sell european grain right is to is to UNK the world market
now because we're a major player in grain markets and most other markets the european community increasing its supply on the world market will have a non trivial effect on price
prices will come down right
erm that's what we observe is that protectionism leads to a UNK of world prices
what about the UNK
does protectionism have an affect on UNK do you think
right think of it like this if all countries of the world right engage in free trade there is no protection
alright
then the world market alright is the is the world is the world market
everybody trades through this through this world market
as a result if there's a say bad weather in the northern UNK affecting supply right that may well be offset by good weather or average weather in the southern UNK right
as a result erm prices won't be quite as UNK as they are in the opposite case alright when the world market and virtually nobody let's assume that virtually nobody uses the world market to trade in they've all got their own agricultural policies right just a few countries trade in the world market it only takes erm a sort of poor harvest or a very good harvest in any one of these erm er sort of protected countries in order to get rid of this output they'll put it on the world market
because the world market is very tiny now because nobody uses it that will have a massive effect on world prices
so what you tend to observe is that when protectionism when everybody protects or when a lot of people protects the world market erm becomes a sink right for any excess production
right it becomes a residual market right
you know if you can't sell it at home you know you get rid of it on the world market
now if the world market is very small then the term world market is a bit of a UNK when er when most countries protect
the world market becomes very UNK and er so protectionism tends to lead to erm to price UNK and this is one reason why agricultural markets are so UNK
right it's because world markets are residual markets because there's so much agricultural protectionism
okay
right erm why bother why bother about agricultural trade
UNK we all UNK up about agricultural protectionism
what are we going to live on
sorry
if we don't live off agricultural trade what are we going to live on
we have to keep the track all turned on
i mean vital to life
well yes but it only represents two percent of g d p in this country it's UNK
ah that's the thing it's not UNK
because if you stop agricultural production you're going to be in big trouble
right okay
why might we be in big trouble if it's a problem
what you going to eat
well could we not import
exactly and then if the world broke world war breaks out
okay so there is this strategic argument
okay but why do we get the main thrust of erm to the economic argument seems to be that we ought to be UNK we ought to be facing that erm that problem
you know that problem isn't the most important one
why do we want to UNK world trade
so we can reduce the prices that we have to pay for everything
you know beef and things that we have to import from the e c at the moment we could import from like new UNK
it's far away but it's a lot cheaper to produce
okay so consumers would benefit erm from UNK
presumably also tax payers would erm tax payer cost of er the common agricultural policies is substantial and most the support comes from er most of the support under the common agricultural policy is given er in terms of higher food prices that consumers pay
there is a different n there is also however a tax payer burden in that some of our taxes that we pay to go erm into agricultural support i mean v a t for example
virtually all of v a t goes to you know
you know you pay v a t on everything er so consumers would benefit alright in er protecting countries tax payers should benefit in protected countries
any other beneficiaries
developing countries may now find a market
that's right so implications there for developing countries who are typically very dependent on agricultural exports as a source of export earnings
it's through foreign exchange earnings that they can develop
right if you're cutting off their UNK to development you're probably UNK the seeds of er of disaster further down the line
it's not only the developing countries that are dependent upon agricultural exports new UNK australia UNK other what you might not call developing countries are also erm UNK upon is UNK upon agricultural trade
so who are the beneficiaries are there are there any beneficiaries at the moment of UNK
clearly farmers in protecting countries benefit any anybody else that benefits
from protectionism
mm say if you're on the world if you if you're a net UNK right erm and you're buying your food commodities from the world market you must have been rubbing your hands over the last fifty years cos you're getting you're buying you're buying a food commodities will lower prices than you would have done in the presence of free trade cos there's all this dumping and european surpluses you know come in
yes he is here
win
yes erm UNK after you if you going she wants to know can you go to lunch in ten minutes
when
one o'clock
no i can't come i'm dining with er charles and a post UNK
so UNK his name erm remind me to see about are you free tomorrow at eleven
yes UNK just dropped that on me
oh
from a great height
no i'll speak to you i'll speak to you later
erm er clearly if you're a net UNK of agriculture you have benefited from other people's protectionism
okay and you will suffer as a result of UNK and by and large those costs or those benefits that er UNK at the moment by those countries are very small in comparison to the er the costs of protectionism to the rest of the world
right okay
tell you what we'll do is er leave it there now
i would recommend you do is look in this book there's a coup a couple of copies of which is i mean er is in the library right
current issues in agricultural economics er UNK by your lord and master professor UNK and also a chap called david UNK okay so current issues in agricultural economics by a UNK and d UNK
but if you look at chapter four in that book we have the title agricultural trade and the gatt
alright now the first part of this chapter spells out erm er developments in agricultural trade why it's why it's fallen in relative terms right
it then goes on to look at the costs of protectionism so they're looking at erm the numerical estimates as to how much erm protectionism costs not only for domestic producers and consumers and tax payers but also for third countries
it then goes on to look at erm why agriculture hasn't been included in the gatt up until now and prospects for a solution within the gatt
this er although it's not on your reading list erm the reading list that bob gave to you er it should be
it's essential to erm to what you've been going through in the last in the last few lectures
UNK full of erm empirical evidence about costs of agricultural protection and what's happened to agricultural prices and i re i do recommend that you have a look at it if you it's an invaluable if you look at anything look at look at this one article
and there should be a couple of er issues of this book in the library okay right well thanks very much
have a very good holiday and er tomorrow there won't be a normal UNK lecture there'll be a special lecture but it'll be in the same place same time
hello tim speaking i was on my way charles
okay i'll see you in a minute
bye
right that's it
right
ah well he'll tell you about that later
erm obviously all the information here in the get up of this session is copyright
now the defences that we're involved in er are taking UNK
your client is alleged to have taken a UNK
erm there's a possibility of dangerous driving as well
let's look at document two
is that your group
what would you say about document two
document two
right
section four
section four what
twenty four
sorry twenty four my mistake
okay
what does section twenty four require
there's an additional
that's not relevant here is it
yeah i think there's some confusion here
erm in a civil case the rules of hearsay are basically of little importance because they can almost always be got round
for example a person UNK a statement under a that statement can be introduced under cross section
four
four
right
there is an equivalent section that relates to criminal evidence which allows a statement to be introduced but only where the needs where the i hate that word the where justice requires it to be introduced
and the purpose of that section is to prevent trials becoming paper trials where the prosecution do not call evidence
now they call evidence under a section nine you can agree a section nine statement prosecution statement but you don't have to right
and in this case you would not agree to statement being written say being read out you wouldn't require him to be present and it could not be introduced under section twenty four because the court would find that it was in the interests of ju justice that it doesn't
why is it in the interests of justice that
why shouldn't the case be conducted just on cross examination because of cross examination
i mean criminal trials are oral trials where the evidence is given UNK so that the witnesses can be cross examined under a and be judged by the tribunal of fact
okay assume that a prosecution statements will be admissible in themselves and always assume that witnesses will give more evidence
okay
so will give evidence
if he doesn't want to give evidence that y alright
so assuming that he gives evidence any a UNK points
you can't see whether you you're acting for what's your attitude to this statement
anything in it you're not happy with
right what's the problem about that
so sorry what are you saying exactly
where are we exactly
are we at the in the statement
pardon
whereabouts are we in the statement
on the second page
right page eight
it was who took both cars okay
yeah
alright
you see what's happened there
that the police have got the witness to erm sign initial every line
that's not UNK
okey UNK
what is the state of those statements
it was he took both cars
self serving statements
it is indeed a self serving statement so what does that give us
if you were to UNK this interview what would you call it
it's a text
by who
part of the confession is a self serving part it's a er possibly mixed statement
er in which he UNK somebody else okay
what is the effect of that
against who
against your client
yes
do you agree with that
no
why not
right the confession is only admissible against the maker
the statement UNK is not admissible against
now when the police officer when the police officer comes to court and goes through this statement and it's a confession what would you normally call what he's reading out
i heard say suppose i
it's hearsay
but why does it have to be that
it's an exception to the hearsay rule
the confession is an exception to the hearsay rule
okay
but it's an exception to the hearsay rule that only applies against the maker
because it is something made against your own interest
erm the rule of evidence is that it is UNK unlikely that anybody would make a statement against their own interest unless it was true
right
you might very well say that you were the greatest law lecturer in the world because people tend to say these things about themselves
it would be unlikely that you would say that you were the worst law lecturer in the world unless you were
okay it's a statement against your own interest
this is a separate argument from whether you actually made the statement or not or whether it was bullied out of you like in the case
but if you did genuinely make that statement it's more likely to be true if it's against your interest rather than for your interest
okay
if a double glazing salesman tells you that his product is crap believe him
alright
get worried if he tells you it's very good
okay
right
because of that reason the confession is admissible against yourself as an admission as an exception to the hearsay rule
it is not admissible against the
does that mean that the parts that are UNK are stuck out and you can give evidence only to the parts that are not self serving
what do you think
what would be the point of the evidence if it's not UNK in trial
there's no point
the whole thing
now if the police think that this aspect of the case is important to them how would they get the evidence in
oral testimony of
call
okay
can give evidence about trial
what other circumstances
good
yes
relevant point
here is he's pleading guilty
what he's pleading guilty he is competent to give evidence against
his evidence is then direct evidence
i saw do this
okay
it is no longer hearsay
you no longer have to bring it within an exception
yes
not easy this stuff
not easy
alright now
i now want to go to back to the beginning of the statement
when you are dealing with statements you must start off and go through it step by step and not leap ahead
now is there anything in the first paragraph that anybody thinks raises an UNK point
i think so
i can tell a race when i see one
erm i go to UNK to see races for two reasons
one because they are advertised as that race and two i see them UNK around the track
i think that's irrelevant
okay
anything else
first paragraph
erm yes
i can probably say i asked the driver for his
yes
i think cross examine him
are we happy about cross examining do you think
yes
great yeah that's cross examining
yes
no problems about cross examining him
we if you comes and gives evidence against us then we can either show that he's incorrect in a substantive way or we can attack his credibility
how might we attack his credibility
he's got previous convictions right
we know about that
no problem about bringing up his previous convictions
right we lose our shield
we have a shield under the which prevents the prosecution in a normal case from bringing to the attention of the court the fact that we have previous convictions
we are a an innocent man until we are shown to be guilty
however if we don't and we say we're UNK white but the prosecution solicitor prosecution witnesses are all bent then we lose that shield and they can say hey you're not UNK white you're bent as well
right
so if gives evidence having become competent because he has pleaded guilty erm then we can cross examine him but we are in difficulties if we then bring up his previous convictions attack his credibility
in the same way as you lose your shield whenever you attack a prosecution witness
so for instance if you have an argument with the police er on a matter you might very well have to say to the police i think officer you were take that and say you're a lying UNK
if you take the latter point of view but you will also put your client's character
okay
if your client has good character fine if he's got bad character
what is the best tactical way of dealing with your client's bad character
now second paragraph
maybe
you don't really know how he had this information
it appears to be hearsay of some sort and therefore is erm UNK
what would you do about that if you were at court acting for your client that paragraph from the earlier comments
er what would you do
you could have a trial
i would suggest that is not very helpful
if you have a trial within a trial in the crown court what happens
if you have a trial within a trial at the magistrates court what happens
yeah
and deal with your objection and then puts it out of their mind if they find that the evidence is UNK doesn't work
right
so it's very important that you avoid magistrates court
why can't you avoid the magistrates court in this case
erm he did have the right to that trial for erm what the previous offence before taking UNK which was a clock taken without the UNK consent and previous offence before that taking but in order to reduce costs right mainly because they also want at the same time to remove the right for theft ah and they failed
that is of course because people who steal biscuits from are usually are usually middle class etcetera but people who steal cars generally tend to be UNK i think the expression is erm and therefore nobody much cares
right
so they lost their rights in that trial very bad idea
so how would you get round that
good
pointing out the evidence that you think is UNK and any reasonable will the police officer doesn't refer to it
okay
i'm still interested in paragraph one
you looked at this over the weekend and thought there's not much in this is there
hopefully you'll think again he's stating i'm for it now
distress it could be i suppose
it is UNK connected with the offence
does anybody understand exception to the hearsay rule
he could be but what is it really
does anybody know
it's not really hearsay
no because he's not actually UNK anything
i mean if the police stop you on the motorway you know you're for it whether you've done anything or not
you'll certainly have an unpleasant few minutes
true
it's admissible only reaction
the same as when you're charged you're asked if you have anything to say reaction only and not hearsay
remember that hearsay is a statement oral or written made outside of court introduced into court for the in order to show that it's true okay you look completely UNK
i am
why would it be hearsay anyway
because it's certainly a statement made out of court because or he's making it with reference to something else
ah
if it's oral yes
that would be hearsay
it would not be simply direct evidence yes
alright makes his confession let's assume at the moment that it is admissible and gives evidence
anything about the statement itself or the interview itself that you would object to on behalf of
why do you object to that
it's
it's completely UNK
okay
unless what
sure this is where i this is where erm i must say that i never quite understood this but if the prosecution witnesses in their statements or in their oral evidence refer to your client's bad character then that is UNK completely UNK
right
if you then cross examine them and attack their credibility your shield goes in and then after that your previous good character but only in the context of you being cross examined by the prosecution
right
so at no stage would this ever go in
at no stage would this reference ever be admissible because it's not going to be relevant after your UNK gone in because your shield going in relates to the questions understanding be agree or correct me but this is how i understand the situation
so references to bad character are never admissible
there are other references to bad character here
showed me how to do it
it was 's fault he made me do it
okay
UNK various other pathetic
what about
are you happy with his treatment at the police station
why not
no record of the tape at all
erm or what else UNK
more further crucial problem
were you arrested and taken to the police station and cautioned
erm
what's the fir who's the first manifest you see
it's the custody sergeant okay the custody officer the custody officer
so in so far as that affects the confession it may mean that it could be removed but that's really completely irrelevant to you because erm that's his confession not evidence against him
if he comes to court what happened at the police station doesn't matter because he'll then give direct evidence not what he said in the police station but what actually happened on that night in the in the estate
does everybody follow that
is anybody confused
do you want me to go through that again
so the fact that there was no solicitor relevant in this case because the whole confession isn't relevant to
it may be very relevant to what happens to but with regard to your client this statement is not evidence against him because his confession is admissible only against the maker
if he turns up for court and he says yes i had a terrible time at the police station and there were all sorts of UNK of but i am now here on a i'm gonna tell the truth that's no problem
it's the evidence he gives on UNK what matters
what happened before is irrelevant
yes
okay
right
let's go on to document three
we want to go through that line by line so
erm what were the words you'd complain about
erm not necessarily complain but interview police officer about when he was told that UNK my mother
sorry am i oh yes you're absolutely right
is that it object to it's just a point which we thought about raising later on
we might be able to just
so the rest of the paragraph you're obviously happy with
anybody else
anybody
any comments
a woman came to the door who i whom i recognized as 's mother
she said oh my god they've come for
hearsay exception relates to the state of mind of the defendant
what the relevance of
what
well what can you primarily UNK from the words
guilt or
conviction surely known to the police
he recognizes her but how many er let me put it this way if the police came to your house to talk to your mother would you expect them to recognize her or would you expect him to say oh my god they've come
you may or may not
it would seem to show that er is known to the police
okay
on the face of it the argument i think is this the words oh my god he's come for are hearsay sorry are not hearsay because although they're an out of court statement they're not introduced as the truth
they're just reported speech
okay
but they are almost certainly excluded by common law
does anybody know the common law principle
this may well be for those of you who did in fact agree
i don't think that the erm go into this properly and i don't i think will have dealt with it in lectures but essentially there's a common law principle that says if a matter is more UNK than UNK it should not be read
here it may be that er it's important to say er what she said value or what relevance it has to the trial of the son anyway
but let's say he did
it clearly is highly UNK and therefore whatever UNK relevance it may have should be UNK against UNK in fact should be excluded
okay
right
your client is interviewed document four are you happy with the contents
any other reasons for not being happy
anybody else
any other
erm possibly drunk or possibly
okay problems here
so what
is that what you're worried about
is that what you wanna do here
do you want to it
why do you want to it
it's not
it's not a paid profession and therefore the exclusion of this statement under section six two is irrelevant
this is not a confession
is there anything here that UNK anything approaching a confession
this is about being in lines
if you had it numbered you could refer to a number
what page are we on
er page eleven
it's twenty eight and sixty eight
what the man said i'll get you for this
right
is that a confession
was convicted on the murder of after the judge ruled that a statement to the police was admissible
the statement he made was you say you've got witnesses but none of them will give evidence against me
okay
that was held to be a confession
now
okay fair enough it was turned over on appeal eventually erm but erm it was a bit of a UNK of justice being kept in prison for that period of time until it was UNK pleaded guilty to another murder but that's by the by
potentially the UNK i'll get him for this could be a confession
it's pretty UNK but it is fairly ambiguous isn't it
but the problem is if this is taken out of context with the rest of the statement the judge might leave it to the jury
i don't think it would be right to do so
the judge should exclude it
so what you have to argue is that is not a confession
if it is not a confession the whole statement isn't a confession
it is other than that
is the statement admissible
can detective constable come to court show the jury hand out to the jury the statement which would stand up in court
no
why not
and
good
it is not an exception to the rule gives details of UNK witnesses
what should the police do about those UNK witnesses
find them
find them check 'em out
let's look at er document five
okay do you want to deal with that
comments in that should tell you that is retired
he's unemployed and retired in his sixties
i do understand the expression to know by sight
the oxford university library should be worried but i said what about his sight
i should i should warn you that it's best to say that only witnesses perhaps have problems with their sight not that they are UNK
because
alright
so there are problems about the identification
it's a case
what is the effect of that
now in some situations the magistrate might say there's so little value in the evidence here that i won't hear it all i'll just exclude it
is this such a case
is the i d evidence so weak
he's identified him in the i d
is the identification does the identification at the i d parade strengthen the original identification
it really does
if you think about it if you have a UNK of somebody you then identify that person at the i d parade you will the quality of your identification is now higher than it was in the UNK
yes
the fact that you've made your i d not UNK evidence
UNK evidence is really supportive evidence
what would the supporting evidence supporting evidence mean here
it can't be another identification
or could it be is with him at the end of the day only evidence against is weak identification evidence then the case would have been thrown out
sorry
so the court other evidence
one possibility is a failed UNK
the equivalent to being caught lying
what is the other possible UNK or supporting evidence here
the evidence of the co accused if he's pleading guilty
of course if you were to give evidence what would the co what would the magistrates do
they'd warn themselves
they'd have to warn themselves
i warn you
yes i warn you i warn myself
completely ridiculous but that is how it works
now what about the next one
six young
what points do you make about young
well she
erm
are you happy with this statement
well already happy with it
what's the effect of this statement
okay
questioning technique
er okay it's a little bit about questions we should ask so in summary then what sort of questions should we ask the group
okay what type of questions
just testing you
remember
over questions
which one shall we avoid then
if we should use what sort of to vary the style of questioning
if you ask a question to the group who's intending who can tend to ask for it
you just throw out a question
well let's see er what did you do last night
no one answers
either no one answers or what
the person you're looking at
the person you're looking at
so don't forget you can use by it doesn't work with you lot but it
you know i save a lot of time preparing that one okay
now what d'ya think the answer to that is
and this UNK voice from the other side
which is another thing you have to look out for in training if you're asking
there's one or two things that are naturally more forthcoming aren't there
yeah
the more readily answered questions nothing wrong with it it's great but again er you fall into patterns don't you i'm sure you on training courses we know that er one or two people are content to have the answer so what will the rest of us do
there's nothing wrong you know but again it seems the nomination of people
okay so ah the next question the remarks anyone looking across at him we put a bit of pressure on them and they take interest
so nomination of the person
post is the way of nomination and also direct nomination
a little tip for you i mean one of the things i do when i'm writing a training manual or something like that i will actually write my open questions in really bold letters on the script
you know i mean i haven't written this one and it makes it quite difficult for me to see some of the questions but i actually write i think that's the most important thing in training is asking questions er and i'll perhaps bring down some examples to show you
exactly the easy things to forget about especially when time's against you if you get to answer questions don't ask the questions what's gonna happen
don't understand
don't be frightened of asking testing questions
don't be frightened of what else
performance of silence give them a chance
what's the other side of questions we talked very briefly about questions to the group what's the other thing we should be looking at
yeah
the UNK asked you questions now
what should you do with questions from the group
you UNK you should be here
why do that
it's another way of
right
yeah
or d or else what else
because again as adults we realize that if every we ask a question to the trainer you're asking questions to him and they keep answering them what does it mean we can do as trainees
switch off sitting there with a row of people
what would happen then if that happened you know fifteen minute UNK
we all knew the answer
so good idea for questions from the group UNK at the group
so ask me a question
how to train
how could you use a
mm
i dunno
how often do you think we should use training session
needs
yeah
what would you use it on
it depends on the situation
probably you're right yeah i suspect
what would you do
it's all about technical stuff i mean a lot of you do technical training
erm you know people know the answers questions or they've got an idea material of your own experience you know a lot more than they do but it's good technique to throw it back to the group
alright when you get a question
very useful technique for handling er people are trying to catch you out
you get you do that to people yourself training the easiest way to do it is group and if they don't know the answer you don't look such a UNK do you
behind you it is something that people don't know you don't know
i think you're honest it's the people respect you more if you say i'm sorry i don't know the answer i'll find out for you and then you say tell you what john can you write that up on that issues form pad or you know another bit of UNK paper we'll come back to that
yeah
what you gotta do though
at some stage or other
another group
the group yeah alright
okay
now i suspect that when you do your role in place there won't be many questions for the group alright
you'll be sitting there saying to me
er certainly not today anyway but tomorrow you might find that erm
we'll ask you questions purely because you know that you know yeah you know it's good to see how you get on with it etcetera yeah
do you tell people when you questions like
well what do you think we should do
what
i know that
another use you see of UNK the question
i'm sorry that was very unfair
do you forgive me
yes
good question
well what do the others think i mean yeah it's a sort of when should you let trainees answer your questions
it depends on the question right to the end relevant as you go along
i know it's early in the morning still
like UNK now in her get up
don't worry that bridge has fallen down
okay erm it depends on the session
think about training though if somebody's got a question to ask what will about sort of something very early on and they don't get the opportunity to answer you what might happen
yeah
does that make sense
so really it would be i suspect the answer to your question you don't want to keep saying any questions but perhaps what's the answer
questions
what
that's right
so where might you say okay look er what i'd like to do is ask questions
if you've got a question shout out to start you on and that start up encourages cos it so often happens yeah bop and somebody is still basically looking for their UNK while all the rest are up the half way up the mountain
danger of sort of like if you've gotta time like yeah sort of thing somebody else questions ten minutes
brilliant
completely lost it haven't you
yeah brilliant that's a that's a good technique to take on UNK one of your colleagues to answer the questions
at least ten minutes er
totally UNK yeah
now there's another thing questions what i'm saying is that's something to take away with you or perhaps you won't get the chance er try now er
certainly you should encourage people to answer questions
most people think that they're being stupid if they have to ask a question they think that everyone else isn't probably thinking the same thing
chances are they are i think you owe it to your trainer to let them know
so building new introductions ask questions by definition build in
i would suggest that you build in a few nice easy open questions at the beginning of the session
you know like you might be doing some technical training they say what's er anyone know what motor insurance is
yeah
if you're running a training session on motor insurance what might be a nice easy question to begin to encourage people to participate
right
okay let's expand that yeah think about the beginning of the training session where you want to involve them
are we all drivers here
or how many of you are drivers
two of you
hello
earth calling moon base one to eight
how many of you are drivers
UNK
what's our next question
have you got motor insurance
car
what er what could we ask then
apart from have you got no cos that might under pressure
hey
yeah well that training session now
what sort of cover have you got
what sort of what sort of cover have you got
what does that tell you as a trainer
what sort of cover available
yeah so give you some knowledge about the level of your group wouldn't it and what does it give chance to do
yeah it gives you something nice and easy to tell you about cos we've all got we all roughly know what sort of cover we've got
we can build up from there some of the er some of the er UNK or something yeah something like that you can develop it from that
yeah
see what i'm saying is ask a nice open question an easy one at the beginning that you know most people are bound to understand you get a lot of participation and then start building it up
we will develop questioning techniques as we go through your training sessions
i think it's more when we actually see people doing it but it's all it's a nice idea to give you a little bit of basic just to think about and again we won't be expecting this to be demonstrated to the on this UNK role page you done all your UNK for that haven't you
perhaps tomorrow
so you'd like to take one and pass it on to me margaret
so we've looked at asking question UNK we've got involving trainees which with which we talking about involving trainees think about this side of it erm i suppose this is one of the best ways to show training should be UNK the idea is that you put in your input yeah you talked around a subject and give you some guidelines then we get a chance to practise the participation
so if you go back to the sort of where we gave it five or six headings yeah or three to six headings you should be aiming say well i'll input a bit of information on that side of it and at the end of that little section i'll build in some practice in participation and the participation can be any of those ones you've put in there on that list you gave us early on er practical allocations
UNK testing role playing and you get exercises whatever
it's simply to test cos if this side of the graph if that one there is knowledge this one here is time
if you went from there to there without any practice or participation since we've already said you might have left half your audience here and in actual fact so your practice and participation needs to be built in
you do a little bit of input well i say a little bit you do some input practice and participation then build on that okay
let's move on to our next section
bit more practice and participation input practice and participation
we use UNK give you something to focus on you can see everything's come out no wonder you
look
i can't really
this is my favourite slide of the whole course
some concentration
what do you reckon the concentration span of most adults is
nine
nine
much less aha
it varies from person to person obviously now know that UNK is talk to her ask a question after nine minutes erm absorbed to knowledge
this is for a straight lecture you know sometimes people stand up to give you a lecture
just talk at you training and they reckon that after ten minutes look at that UNK
so after about thirty five minutes what are you actually taking in
absolutely UNK
so why do we do lectures
doesn't make any sense at all does it
in training though you can still have the same problem erm you know perhaps towards the end of the session you've probably seen it as and i i'm guilty of it myself cos we're trying to UNK on through it as quickly as possible so we get in ya way by six o'clock or that so we break all the rules late in the day
you sort of
and you as well
right erm all the rules people are tired etcetera so their rates of and knowledge is probably downhill anyway and then we talk about thirty five minutes just to speed up make sure we train them we've given them all the input
what happens
you test it out the next morning isn't it interesting you remembered as proof of the pudding
what did you remember the training side it's pretty well the objectives
what about the last we did yesterday actually UNK and training it's quite a it's quite a struggle that had a long day been sitting here for a couple of hours i dunno it seems longer and there you are and you're actually struggling
you got the notes that's part of training as well you can refer back to that you struggle
so they reckon that after about ten minutes if people haven't been involved we haven't thrown out a question or something like that people start thinking about other things and there's been actually a bit of er UNK research on this that shows that people think about three things after about ten minutes they just switch off
any ideas what this might mean
yeah the environment yeah
could be very
they're hungry
food yeah
that's quite a frightening thought really when i'm up front here
i'll leave you with that thought
i should have turned the tape recorder off for that shouldn't i
tell you your mind does wander doesn't it yeah
i mean mine does but mine
mine does and i'm training so you know what chance have you got
alright so there's a couple of ideas for you including er getting the participation going but don't give too much of the verbal
what are the other techniques you do if you've do a bit of i mean as a sales trainer i tend to walk around quite a lot and talks about what
yeah but what does it do
what do you do
you have to focus
you follow me round don't you people you know you see them he's gonna ask me a question
also that's what that's the training staff we know from experience that our moving targets are
think about
so another thing we said on our list or your list what you put up here was UNK
UNK are very important in terms of information recall i UNK for this a couple of years ago
what does that tell us
yeah
they reckon that of the information our senses receive seventy five percent of it is received visually
reading yeah you look round at people and then somebody comes rushing in through the door and you've never seen then before what do you do
you just weigh up and take so much information in through your eyes don't you perhaps this person's in a panic or they look angry yeah this sort of stuff do it very naturally
seventy five percent is taken in through the eyes of which we're gonna recall about fifty percent so fifty percent of that seventy five percent yeah
through the years though more erm through the years we actually only receive thirty percent of our input i suppose one of the examples are and then we only remember twenty percent of that thirteen percent again the danger of you know every remembers this
well you've seen this before you remember it straight away
erm th the thing i think about is do you remember the green cross code
UNK club
yeah things like that
what was what is the UNK green cross code
no you've gotta be a bit more precise though
stop look and listen yeah
good
so you remember what you're supposed to do
what was what was the actual little UNK
something like that yeah
can you remember i mean what they sa what the actual steps as it were when the you know when the kids stop look and listen when you do your look left again
concentrate
yeah and also kids tend to listen
most accidents happen as kids run out in the road without looking alright
because most kids nowadays are brought up with constant noise of traffic and so covering ears doesn't mean anything does it because they're gonna get the information and absorb much more information none of it none of any use but so don't get much information from
this is a very informative handout
you know that sort of thing you can
right
a little bit else about making it interesting don't worry about UNK in my courses at least it shows you're still alive
can you share with margaret please
little again we'll develop these as practices more they're more dynamic to develop when we actually watch and see your role plays
presentation techniques a few things here that might help you in terms of making it interesting as it were and the actual delivery of your training your UNK keep your UNK but relaxed i don't really know what that means but er stand up
what's the da what would show if you're standing up what would demonstrate that you're not relaxed
like this
no i know what you're doing that means you're relaxed when you're actually training
what else then
i
right
movement
simply nervous trainers tend to stand in one spot UNK feet UNK like a tree to the ground
move around UNK the groups are more involved
again it's true though isn't it
people will stand there and they will UNK something you see their UNK are white you know and these sort of things erm or they'll have their notes you know here and let's be honest about it yeah i can remember when i started training i think you know you used to UNK to your notes a three feet UNK you know what can't you see
can't let go of this
anyway and all this sort of stuff so it's all about getting yourself prepared and knowing what you're gonna say etcetera
does th anyone worry about using notes it doesn't make you feel as though the trainers know what they're doing does it
if you see the trainers looking at their notes
what might make a difference though in terms of UNK
okay so erm i think it's also very important that we look at gestures
important gestures cannot be able too often and this UNK communication
we use gestures for emphasise normal conversation about what with our hands
gesture in front of a group exactly as if you were having an UNK conversation with a friend nothing more nothing less
do you understand that
what would that demonstrate UNK terrible isn't it
if you're talking about a subject that means gestures what should you be doing
yes course you should shouldn't you
so what's what sort of gestures should we use when we're up front
don't be rude
gestures big ones enough to you know you don't want to take off but open gestures get your hands moving doesn't matter does it
er again it's a sort of you know like that form that format don't worry about it if you do it it's just that sometimes people will say it's the change of gesture
get some movement out there we had a young a young lady who er she name and she's up front in the cabinet you know every opportunity she had she was looking for round the room but not sort of in the round the outside all the time and it's just that she wanted to be with a group of people all the time
it was great it was you know so when training rooms are set up we used to sit here behind this barrier as it were there's you there's me
so usually use gestures then it's got some things here it's got some little UNK men on the next page
the first one
keeping your hands in your pockets what's the danger of your hands in your pockets
i've never heard it described that way before but there you go er
you UNK your change dead right
er again after you do that very same thing erm you know UNK your change and one of them he said that i reckon you got three pound eighty
he UNK he's got six pounds you know and it's just so UNK
keep your hands out of your pocket UNK behind your back
yeah and what do we think she means that you know what do you UNK yeah
UNK
UNK yeah does that
might do because it's not close gestures differ
what are the others keeping your arm or keeping your arms crossed or in a UNK leaf position
if you would like to demonstrate a UNK leaf position
andy well stand up
demonstrate a UNK leaf position
i don't know a UNK leaf
cos i've no idea what it looks like
i'm sure it's like this or is it like that
no that doesn't look a UNK leaf does that look like a UNK leaf position to you
yeah
yeah it must be yeah
quite interesting really
it's just that UNK because you know basically
right or UNK your hands UNK
eye contact eye contact
what's it mean by eye contact
what's good eye contact
it's good though isn't it
eye contact
definitely trying to avoid my eyes now there's a few eyes round here that look more like route maps of the m twenty five
erm eye contact if people avoid eye contact what's it mean
they lack confidence
they lack confidence simple as that and one of the things is that as a group you come in and you probably look at people when you and you look at the trainers and the idea is that early on people can do can keep some eye contact gonna UNK you out but just keeping your eyes and don't UNK away and also when you're under pressure at this stage his eyes challenge you or something like that then your eyes go down
so again it's just thinking about the eyes the eye the beginning
it's says rule of thumb that eye contact is one to three seconds per person
ah that's you look
UNK does anyone remember UNK when one eye went this way and one eye went the other that you know watching this happen
using your voice your voice i'm not gonna be too worried about this erm UNK yeah
i'm not too worried about it because erm a lot of people natural accents regional accents and that so others come over as quite UNK don't they sort of thing
it's a big problem it's just that UNK you do if you are aware you've got some
some trainers go down
what else have we got talking too fast
now suspect that this is something that most people fall into on their first few training sessions which is all to be about this er have you got any questions and most people i was gonna say good morning but you got a paragraph down now and it's all about slowing down and you can speed up as you go through but it's certainly the opening slowing down
slow down slow yourself down in training sessions
yeah
we had we had a training session for ourselves like you know
right erm right what was i saying yeah erm slow down what's the other way have a drink of water yeah
breathing it does help you know sort of you know morning everyone
big UNK of it much easier
answer the question nice and easy question slow it down
problems with volume on the last page erm i don't that affect most of you erm you won't be you won't be talking to UNK places will you
if you do any of your training it will tend to be rooms about this size
so before i talk through some of those cos i think that some of those er if we just gave you the handout you've gotta read it training group seems to be far more aware of things like your body language
is that yours
er yeah
getting fed up okay just to finish up now because we're gonna be moving on in a minute
there's a couple of handouts here which i'm not gonna go into but there again somebody might think about when you're running group training and there's some there's some i dunno er points with a few heading samples so i'm gonna take one and pass them on take one pass them on which i really no and there's one over there so you've got involving trainees we've done humour we've touched upon UNK we've done before
testing role plays i've sent you a handout on that exercises and there's a handout on that
practical applications a thought about practical applications we need to build in practical applications don't we
actually give people chance to try what we've been talking about
any thoughts about that
what should we be doing with practical applications
past experience
yeah past experience to find out the level they're at the moment
anything else
oh no it's incredible
again on this very course a while back it was only three people in the group in the week that i was watching and the guy who was running the session had worked the equation wrongly on the rating or whatever and the other two never seen him before in their lives were saying that's wrong and he started getting really annoyed
it was really funny group after it was so funny er
with his permission he thought it was funny he saw the funny side of it as well but they had this big argument for five minutes cos he thought what he'd done was right and he said jesus i've been using this for three years for the training in the branch er it makes you wonder doesn't it erm but if you're gonna do practical applications you've gotta give people relevant examples perhaps you start off basics with an example that is correct and then you start building on that don't you then you start giving them the UNK and all this sort of stuff
don't deal with UNK first cos they'll never learn but build in lots of applications either by questions or by actual exercise
last thing just briefing cos this is designing the training session is your notes
what sort of notes what sort of things are you gonna do within your running of training sessions for a group training session or it could be one to one doesn't really matter
what are the sort of things you need to think about when you're putting in notes together script or
right that's a good idea bullet points in large print
cos you know all the content don't you
a lot of the training you do you probably only need to write bullet points
what might you write under your bullet point
it's just the yeah you've got your main point and there might be one two three four things a bit more information yeah
so that you don't UNK or forget things
what other things might you do in your notes
think of some questions to ask
yeah that's good
so you actually write down questions so much going on you can't be expected to remember everything and if you've got just you know sort of questions written down the page like what is your name it's simple as that it gets you to do what
involves the trainee
what else might you do
bullet points questions
okay so er what have we got there erm use supports use of support yeah material another thing you might think about is time
time basically that's it how you do it is up to you the danger of a script of a basic script is what
right yeah you're stuck to it aren't you and if you move away from it where are you if you gotta go back to it you might have done this for t for today don't worry but you know but it's not we're not gonna mark you down or anything like that the danger of is what
it's very and you're gonna just sat down reading it
and some of the other things what about you know erm
chances are you're not gonna use it or not use it
you write all this UNK down and then you never look at it
i'll give you examples perhaps of none of these i must admit i don't i don't think they're not my style i much more my page my training tend to have just two or three points on it rubber stamps on the side UNK all this sort of stuff big question
er it's just a thought to say well if i if this training is so important i will use it over and over again it makes sense to save the preparation time four or five months down the line by having a script and now only you can up with your examples
i'll just check what samples there is this would be more of er this one that's coming over now is entirely the session keep it flowing there's your content and your method of the UNK o h p UNK
so you're restricting yourself
that might be having and again we're not looking for you to do these or follow these patterns for tomorrow you do whatever you feel comfortable yeah
there's a blank page it's okay i might be able to use that er as a structure for more for when you've gotta run training courses at a lot of the time and sample three is just another side that's erm that one of sample two is landscape goes across the page this is
what
this example
i've been filling time wherever i am
haven't i team
yeah
what have we been talking about football last night er just an example of erm some of the scripts that we use down here
you see look here's a script all typed out
you know a lot probably to do this
you see there's not much on the page you know just some bullet points
that wasn't it
what
they're being rude they're being really rude
are they
no chance
out of all that stuff there what's the most important things
i know if i say that notes are really important alright
in summary while we're waiting for our to come back if she is coming back we don't know do we
designing training we started yesterday we are finishing the session now so in your opinion what are the most important things we should do first when designing training
right measuring understanding
yeah
you've thought of another element there which i'm gonna write down feedback
when do we want feedback
stages
so we want stages don't we
how should we design our training in terms of stages
come and draw it come and draw up and show us
draw it
yeah
come and show us how you do it i'll give you a red pen do you remember that earlier we said participation
the
that'll do for me
you oh no yeah it's alright yeah alright
thank you
not so bad is it
so input and then what
participation
repeat the process stages
anything else we should think about designing training
summary at the end of the session
alright let's we've looked at design of training as the first step you know identifying training needs and then design
on the areas that we might like to think about design and also delivering training is the different ways people learn and to do that go through learning styles
laugh
much done
do we need that questionnaire cos erm
yes
cos certain members tend
oh would you like to go and get your questionnaire those that haven't got them
that's me
well i've got
has anyone had an actual break or
have you scored more
yeah
yeah great
yeah
have you have you done it
yeah i've done it but i didn't bring it
oh right
you've all got yours questionnaires yet
you didn't last time did you do something this week lunch today have you got it
i just i just honest to god i hadn't realized at all the guy was sort of and says er oh it's probably i said no i'm sure i was really UNK
it was awful he said go and get it it'll be in there and i just went er and i could see it all
a nightmare and we had to actually ring the emergency number and in an emergency ring this number
yeah
she rang it and this bell started going
oh no
have you all scored your questionnaires
yep
and you've
oh yeah we've got the analysis we've got the questionnaires okay what we're gonna look at now is we gonna look at the work of honey and UNK and what honey and UNK spent a lot of time UNK was people's learning sides and they spent a lot of research and what they found out is that there are four different learning sides and we all learn in different ways
so far UNK taken you through how to put together a logical and effective training session
what we also need to think about is we learn in one way but our delegates may actually learn in a slightly different way
in a minute so what we're gonna have a look at is we're gonna have a look your identified preferred learning side and the questionnaire will actually help you do that
i'll tell you what honey and UNK actually found and what their findings were we'll also think about some more practical applications that if people learn in different ways what impact does this have on the trainers
it does have some impact i'm sure that you've been the training session and you thought it's really good really got a lot out of it and you're quite surprised to see someone sitting next to you didn't like that much at all you thought hmm wonder why that is because i found the content really interesting and it could have been the content matter didn't really sort of do anything for the people it could have been the way it was put together put over and the way it was actually structured
i'm sure you've also experienced sessions you thought something somebody's delivered in one session and found it really interesting you've got a lot from it and yet somebody else comes into the same subject matter and you think that you know wasn't very interesting didn't you know didn't i didn't really wanting to learn
the key reasons before that is that they've actually put the across in the way that's not totally compatible with learning side
what i'd like to do to start with is i'd like to actually put the scores up put your scores up on the charts and then we'll look at what exactly they mean what does a stand for but what does it all mean
so if you put the scores up first then we'll do some have some discussion about what they mean
so margaret if we start with you
eight fourteen six
eight fourteen six
thank you
mark
fifteen sixteen nine sixteen
okay john
twelve sixteen thirteen seventeen
andy
five sixteen thirteen
marie
nine fifteen twelve thirteen
UNK
five fourteen nine twelve
sixteen two three
two three and nine
yeah
two nineteen ten and thirteen
we've got quite a variety here haven't we
right what i'll do now is i'll introduce what means and then we'll go back and think UNK the impact that they have on training
so and i've got a handout on this
if we go to the first style of a this is an activist and some of you have got high scores here we've got sixteen fifteen and twelve these are these are hard activist
what honey and UNK found is that people learn in basically four ways the first of which is the activist
now what they're saying is that what they said is activist action learn best when they get the opportunity to experience new sort of problems situations opportunities when they're doing something quite new when they're sort of involved in very much you know here and now activities when they're sort of like business games exercises role plays team tasks that they can sort of get you know really get involved with themselves then there's lots of action and they're quite short and sharp so can move on to something else
activists also like being thrown in the deep end they quite like the challenge of being thrown in and sink or swim and learn from the experience rather than actually talking about too much and then a little bit of action later
activists like things which involve other people as well so they like team work they like team activities they like discussion groups they enjoy the sort of UNK ideas off other people
activists also like they love the opportunity in training to have a go but they do like getting involved they like a action
they also like this sort of excitement and you know when things chop and change and there's sort of erm almost like a crisis situation and lots of excitement lots of activity activists actually UNK on that they like that sort of challenge that UNK their learning
they also like things which are quite so if the activity involving UNK a meeting doing a role play doing a presentation although they may be nervous they actually enjoy that they find they gain a lot from that and they also like activities where to an extent there's a freedom from constraints policy structures they don't like to feel bound because if you think about it a lot of are actually exploring deep end situations trying new things out they don't like to feel that constrained
so that's the activist
a couple of you have got high marks john and you've got high activist you're higher than the others how do you feel about that
yeah it's pretty
yeah
i'm not so sure about liking the presentations though
oh
well like you say you feel nervous about it at first but once you do it you've got
so there are th that side of learning there are people who like to have a go who want action
you quite like erm learning from experience
when i was working at british airways we used to do a lot of technical training and erm it was sort of on er airline regulation stuff like that and you could always tell the activists cos they didn't really want to all they wanted to do was to get on the computers and actually trying out things out themselves they piece of furniture the activists don't want to read the instructions they want to start putting it together and then they'd learn from actually putting it together rather than them reading the instructions and regulation training you could always tell the activist cos they sort of always like UNK every bit they just want to they just want to get on the computers and start UNK numbers and they'll actually learn they prefer to do that and then somebody can come round and help them out when they get into trouble rather than some of the other which perhaps like to more up front and that's the activist
now we move on to the reflector and UNK in particular has got a very high a lot of the others
quite high
so what's the reflector all about
well as a the reflector is they actually learn from situations where they get the opportunity to sit back to watch to think about what's being said so they digest in information for themselves
situation they sort of they sit back they think about and UNK it
they also like activities as well UNK where they can stand back and watch and listen to others as well and sometimes within a group activity they actually like to pull back and listen to what others are saying
it doesn't mean to say they don't like participating but they'd like to you know see what the group view is before they put in their own views so they're analyzing thinking
a lot of people with high reflector scores like to think before they act
they UNK they analyze they consider and then they make a decision or act on things
it's similarly with similar to the situation for training while the activist would like to get straight into a role of play the reflector wants to stand back think about it think about how they're going to what they're going to do etcetera before they actually participate or get involved
activists actually enjoy activities within training while they can carry out some research where they can analyze and investigate situations
the things like a case study where you have to gather lots of information and analyze it i mean that's just what the UNK like cos they want to feel that there's you know they th working is not just it's actually working on some fact
they also enjoy reviewing experiences so when you've done a role play the reflector will actually get a lot out of doing feedback standing back and analyzing what did i do well what did i do less well and they actually learn a lot from that as well the role play
they love things which involve producing reports analysis UNK also like UNK views with others they like to think analyze UNK an opinion and then have the opportunity to discuss with others
UNK like reaching decisions in their own time and on training courses they actually like to feel that they consider the situation and they don't want feel sort of too rushed before they act
what i'd like say with these guys there's no right or wrong style there's no good or bad we're all different erm and we f we're all a combination of each as well
reflector UNK you've got the highest there what are your views on that
and you can always tell UNK in training cos sometimes you'll think what's happening nobody else wants participation UNK will actually stand back and think well what did they ask for what do i talk about then and it's always like a delayed response you get a lot of UNK and we had one course once and we had all high reflector scores and that actually told us a lot about participation cos people weren't UNK any they were thinking about it coming in had time to consider an opinion so that's a reflector
the next one is the UNK and the highest that we've got here are john and andy and thirteen
marie you you're popular on highest scores on reflector as well that i mean you what did you think about that
the er reflector and the activist actually
so the UNK so the theorists actually best from activities where something can actually give them a system a model or a theory or a concept so we've got andy and john and it was quite interesting andy when you were saying well whose work is this because you not really behind so you actually scored thirteen on that one
if you can sort of say well that has been proven this is the research this is the system this is the model theorists actually enjoy that because they think well this isn't just somebody's gut reaction this is something that somebody spends a long time actually thinking about it considering
they actually like well argued a sort of UNK concept so if you're gonna present a model theory they like it sort of well thought through rather than a half baked UNK fairy model
theorists are very UNK by sort of quite interesting and new ideas of concept because ultimately a lot of theorists like sort of to be UNK challenged they like things that they need to really sort of stretch their minds
theorists love sort of debating concepts and arguments they don't want to won't accept them at face value they'll actually challenge them and enjoy the rationale enjoy discussing them
they will question
we have some people on training courses who could tell that they're quite theorists cos question of challenge if you actually put forward some ideas they'll question them not in a negative way but they just want to know well where have these come from and why and why is this and on your training courses what theorists will do is if you're actually putting together forward and processing procedures that c u follow they'll question why they won't just accept it they'll actually question it not in the negative way but they'll want to understand it
as we said they like being stretched UNK so if you can put forward some concept theories they actually enjoy that
they like a clear structure they're logical they're UNK and they want things to be delivered in such a way
they like analyzing and they like sort of practising or getting involved with complex things sort of complex piece of work very they're really happy in the training session to get involved whereas some people if you put something very hard they'll actually back away from it won't they cos they think well this is new i don't really understand this whereas theorists will ac they actually enjoy they enjoy the stretch they enjoy the challenge
those two john and andy you were the highest on that john what are your views on that
yeah
andy
yeah
i'm actually i'm quite high on as UNK as well and i like to write everything out in full and i clear structures and if i go to training sessions and they're all over the place it's such a in about five minutes and i have to say hang on a minute it might not be structured in the way that you like it but you can actually learn from it
and the last one is the UNK erm we've got mark john and marie who have come out quite high on the on the UNK th the title that you suggest what the situations you actually learn best from and UNK like training its practical
job if there's gonna be an exercise or a they like it to be a real life practical situation almost like a UNK of the job rather than something that's er for example if you were to do a case study UNK would like it be in an insurance related case study and it could be related to their job very
if you were going to say a travel industry case study and insurance industry prefer it to be quite practical
they like training which they can actually apply that has practical applications so say if you're thinking of something like erm motivation styles or something like that if you were gonna introduce UNK i dunno at the motivation there are loads of them one's UNK one's UNK if you were introducing our training to a UNK what would be essential is you could actually show the practical application of it if you just put forward c v and no practical application the UNK would say well this is all very well in theory but how can i apply it to my job and if they can't they think well what's the value of this
they actually involve like participating in training that they can actually try out the techniques and they and they can try out the techniques in the training and on the job as well
they like things satisfy the UNK if you can give them something that they can put in practice straight away o on the job in their job
if you said well you can't apply this time you may be able to in three years time but UNK they like something that they can take away and then put into practice straight away and they can try out
they like training that's practical and they're dealing with real problems
real problems that they're currently facing or issues that the company's facing they like real problems UNK things
although some people are quite happy to just because it's training i it they're quite happy if it's a hypothetical situation cos they think well i can actually learn from this i can i know what the concept structure is i can learn from it
the UNK wants it to be they want the structure they also want it to apply you know to real life stuff they're not into hypothetical made up situations
there are valuation forms they usually show the all very well much more to erm give away of er their learning styles
right so those are the four styles
what we mustn't do with honey and UNK is just take things at face value because what honey and UNK did is they actually carried out interviews with a thousand people and what they decided that i mean they carried out interviews with er lots of people thousand and they had a general study where they carried out interviews with a thousand people and what they said was that in particular with the reflector a l some scores are naturally higher than others and that what we can't do is just sort of look at these and say well this is the highest score therefore i'm much more of a of a reflector than i have of i am of the other three all we actually need to do is compare our scores against the general UNK
if i show you the general UNK it makes a lot more sense
for example if you've got between thirteen and twenty for an activist that's a very strong preference however for a reflector a very strong preference is eighteen to twenty because by nature most of us tend you know most of us tend to stand back and think so what we actually need what we wh what we can see is that when we compare our scores against the general UNK it's a much more accurate picture of our learning style
so what we can see for the activist nought to three is a very low preference so UNK has come out as a very low preference on that four to six is a low preference so that's seven to ten is the sort of average so that one's the average that one
eleven to twelve is a strong preference so john's come out as strong and thirteen to twenty is a very strong preference so that's mark and UNK you've actually come out as very strong
the UNK the mean here is at thirteen the average is thirteen they're all slightly higher so eighteen to twenty would be a very strong whereas the others have just come out fifteen to seventeen which is strong you've actually come out fairly strong there because the highest score for anything is twenty
that is high but then again is very high the activist we don't on the courses we don't see many activists coming out as high as fifteen or sixteen they are
the UNK is quite in line really with the reflector the average there is about twelve and a half
so sixteen to twenty would be the very strong on that no one 's actually no one 's actually got this
fourteen to fifteen is strong no one 's got that
eleven to twelve so you're really sort of moderate preference it's not a it's not a strong preference a moderate preference and then the UNK again that's quite high very strong preference is seventeen to twenty and again john edge of that
what we need to do we've got a handout for you on this so you can spend more time looking at yourself or what you need to do is you need to compare your scores against those rather than just take the highest one
right for the UNK in the group we want to do something practical learn from that
erm so what does that tell us about training from the training when we're training others
and what's the sort of plus or the dangers on that
yeah
so what do you need to do
and that's why this is very interesting for you because you now know what your preference is and what you need to think about is that i may be a very high reflector but i can see there's UNK in particular was a very strong activist and when i put them together training i need to ensure that it's not the way i like to learn it is a balanced approach others can also gain i need to ensure that others gain from this
what else is it that it tells ya
how can we achieve a balance what's the ideal balance
yeah
yeah
yeah
we need to get a combination of all four
so how could we get a combination of all four
using a practical example
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
there's one other
to get the ideal session that's what we need we need a we need an exercise we need participation and martin was saying that earlier that essential anyway cos people learn best by doing well we need activity and we need to make it practical to satisfy the UNK to real life issues problems things that on the job
we need the theory concept behind the method and we need to build in that people can think digest analyze because as we've seen by nature most of us have higher reflector scores than we do the UNK and the reflector are higher than the theorists and the activists all have a tendency
right just one last thing that we need to think about is that as i said with the with the learning styles there's no right or wrong
you know it doesn't mean to say that you're wrong because you like to have a go or jump in and you're not wrong if you like to have time to spend there are no right or wrong styles and also what we can't associate the styles with which people try to do sometimes is they try and identify the UNK and UNK
i mean you can't do that there is no correlation between you can't say that all the activists are UNK cos are actually quite about the way they but they do like to have a go and it doesn't say all the UNK cos they're sitting back and thinking and they're actually quiet UNK
right so that's all we want to look at with regards learning styles i think the key thing to remember is that we mustn't fall into the trap because it's our learning style if we actually put together our training which reflects our style
so as you said the danger is that it's not balanced for our delegates and the ideal is that we want the combination of all four
so if you think back now at times when you've done a training session and you thought i can't understand why that didn't work you know i worked really hard this may actually reveal something to you did work really hard at it and you put it together just the way that you would like to receive it but it's not it just the way the delegates would actually have liked to have seen it done
and that's why when we experience different people's training you get different sort of views and feelings from it because their learning style is actually pushing through sometimes it suits us and sometimes it doesn't
so if you can get the balance and you can get all four also what's interesting as well is if you've got a very low score at something it may be they think well perhaps i need to develop that if i don't apparently learn a lot from getting and having a go perhaps i'd actually learn more if i can develop that more enjoyment from that and i can see the benefit from it
is it possible to develop
no there are natural we always have a strong preference for something but we can actually develop them just like management style we have a strong preference for one style but it is something that we can learn can get more and try and rationale sort of like theoretical we can try and UNK what's perhaps happening is that in situations when we're not gaining a lot and it could be that it's because it's had a lot of activity and we can actually gain more from it we can UNK it and analyze it
because if we can enjoy if we can become more balanced actually balance our training doesn't it
i know when i first came into training i was really high on er
drugs
drugs yeah
would of made the job a lot easier might have been high on drugs
i was actually quite low on the activists and higher on these three but i managed to wonder sometimes where i worked ever so hard on a session i can't really can't understand you know why it's not going very well and i thought well when i then watched other people do something that had a lot of action i thought well why did they like that more and i never i didn't know but i've actually learnt that you have to put activities in cos you know you do get people with a very strong activist preference
do you find people
erm you may think that
there will be some who have a strong preference th they like activity erm and what you can actually do if you're very interested in looking what honey and UNK have done is they've actually taken
right what er we're going to do er today is start er supply because we've UNK with our of demand we're now going to have a look at the nature of agricultural supply
what i'll do this morning is just give a general introduction to supply response erm and then er on friday we'll start to develop erm theoretical models of agricultural supply and response called a UNK supply and response model
the first thing to note about agricultural supply and response is that it is UNK complicated alright
i think what we'll do just start by writing up what we could describe as a sort of theoretical er supply function
right so the quantity supplied right let's just say as a function of price of x the prices of other products y right to n prices of inputs one to n er what other things can we include
the number of firms supplying the industry er we'll go through these in a bit more detail in a moment i'll just put them down
size distribution r technology used in production t stocks weather er risk UNK i'll go through all these later i mean
the list of possible influences on supply is UNK erm and as a result any models of agricultural supply response tend to be very simple and it's very easy to get a complicated model simply by looking erm at why one of these factors UNK er any other any other of these UNK
erm but agricultural supply is complicated simply by the actual nature of supply in that you know farmer has n products that he could produce
alright he could grow wheat or he could grow barley possibly he could transfer into milk production pig production erm so the prices of all those other commodities are going to be important
er this production of good x likewise inputs huge variety of inputs used in agricultural production er may again er will have UNK on the supply of any one particular good
right but nevertheless we can say that if the price of x rises right it's likely that the constant of x is going to rise
right it simply serves its purpose right higher prices will mean greater revenue and if other things remain constant then that means more profit
so we've got as i say we could UNK a er positive relationship between knowing the price and er quantity supplied
however just to UNK things at a very early level it's often observed that agricultural products have what's called a UNK supply response in that there's a negative relationship between prices and output
can you think of a reason why that might be the case
why if prices fall right should output rise or might it rise any ideas
because er to produce more output you have to have a bigger stock and therefore the price goes up so you produce more decreasing not quite so much and keep a greater percentage than you did last year so that for cows as the price goes up you've got to UNK it again cows this year and try to sort of keep my get my UNK bigger and bigger and profitable
that's right so instead of so if er say if the price of erm yes say meat went up erm so the price of beef went up you may want to increase the size of your beef UNK how do you increase the price of your beef UNK well you don't sell as many cows to the slaughterhouse as you might otherwise would you know would do because you want to increase your UNK for later years
alright so what's coming now is this idea of time is very important in agricultural supply response
right if we want to increase the long run output we may have to reduce short run output
okay yes that is er very good very good example
if you think of it the other way when what happens when a price when a price falls alright if farmers er assume that price fall will be sustained over a number of periods then they think right well in order to achieve the same level of income right as i did previously if prices have fallen i'm going to have to increase my output
right the sort of the agricultural UNK process this is often referred to er in that price reductions lead to increases in output as farmers try to maintain some satisfactory level of income
and this an argument that's often put forward by the national farmers union and other agricultural lobby groups essentially erm er it's saying to sort of er the european community when they're price setting look there's no point in you er reducing agricultural product prices cos all that's going to do is increase supply
one of the main problems of the european community is over supply alright so they try and use it as an argument this UNK supply response as an argument to maintain prices at their current level
alright now whether there is a UNK supply response is an empirical question erm and it's generally observed that UNK supply response is about as common as a that we looked at in demand analysis
attracts a great deal of attention erm from theorists but in er in reality it's not as common as some lobby groups might suggest that it is
but nevertheless we don't necessarily always need to observe a positive erm a positive relationship between own price and er quantity supplied
right if we UNK the number of commodities and recognize that er farming is a multi product enterprise alright farmers just don't produce one produce alright they tend to produce a whole range of products and therefore we've got to accommodate these inter relationships between prices of barley prices of wheat prices of oil seed rape s and er and so on and so forth and there can be a UNK a number of fairly complex inter relationships er there
alright if products are competing alright say like wheat and barley they could be termed competing products in supply so if the price of barley went up erm that may have implications on the amount of output of wheat produced
alright simply because farmers switch production alright away from wheat into the more UNK barley
alright now not all products are going to be you know you can't switch with the same amount of ease across all products there are only you know if you are erm a wheat farmer in the south east of england alright you're not likely to switch into milk production just UNK just because milk prices have risen
right you don't have er the UNK conditions or possibly even the expertise erm to sort of to switch
alright so although there may be some switching possible it's that's the degree of switching won't be the same for all er for all commodities
alright not only do we have competing products on the farm but we have joint products on the farm in that if you rear sheep are not only used for the meat that they produce but also the wheat the er the wool that's on that's on their backs
alright so increases in er say the subsidy on sheep will have impacts on the wool market
okay but if as a general statement if products erm are joint products in supply it's likely that there'll be a positive relationship right between the price of er the joint product and the quantity supplied of the of the product in question
right
so we need to know on what on what farms are products er competing or erm or are they produced jointly
okay
something else that's very important there t UNK the effect of technology
god this is really hello can you still hear me
oh well right so technology is very important
the effect of technology is UNK
the first effect of technology is that it increases the productivity of farms right
most UNK yields potato yields have risen between two and three percent per year er in the u k
right and that increase in production has come about through the use of technology whether it be UNK chemicals better seed varieties more UNK technology has increased production per unit of land alright per unit of labour
the technology also has the effect of increasing the variety of production methods farmers can either er rear UNK extensively or UNK where the technology for intensive production exists and if you're not familiar with the technology of intensive say milk production erm or it doesn't exist then clearly you won't be able to use those intensive tech techniques
you know you can grow bananas in scotland if you want the reason why you can do that is that we have the UNK know how in order to do that
okay we can't really say anything about agricultural supply unless we acknowledge the institutional setting in which farmers er actually produce food
now in most countries in the developed world the institutional setting is by far the most important factor alright simply because food subsidies and protectionism er is er second to none in agriculture
alright and policy measures designed to protect agriculture can have either a direct effect on production or an indirect effect
for a direct effect well think about milk UNK supply and control of potatoes in the potato market potato UNK clearly
clearly the government is saying you are only allowed to plant a certain UNK but that will clearly affect erm farmers UNK response
indirect effect is through prices in that most erm intervention in agricultural markets is through er price UNK
alright higher prices mean that in order to increase income the farmers need to produce more output right there so erm there's a UNK of support to output
right so the more that you produce the more in the higher income you'll get because prices are higher
right
so how do farmers produce more in that situation well they apply lots of technology
right they apply UNK chemicals er and so on use machinery etcetera
alright so although the institutional setting can have a direct effect alright it's much more likely that the effect will be indirect right through high prices and in order for farmers to er UNK the benefits of support they need to UNK their yields and that's what farmers have done in this country
that's why yields have grown so much because there's been a certainty of relatively high and growing prices and therefore in order to UNK their income farmers are er UNK yields
alright yield UNK is not a necessary condition for profit UNK alright in er in a free market
alright however when prices are fixed it cer certainly is
right that's we've already mentioned or UNK to the fact erm that time is very important in agricultural supply
right and in virtually any agricultural supply response model we'll need to include time
most agricultural response models er are dynamic in that they do incorporate time
why is that the case
why do we need a dynamic specification
well we ought to recognize that if prices are increased there won't be an UNK er change in supply which in UNK from our static models
essentially because there is a erm a production UNK or a growing season that we farmers will have to base their production decisions alright on previous prices
alright when the supply comes on to the market you know it may be nine months down the road if it's an annual crop if you're looking at something like erm production of cocoa right now a cocoa tree takes about nine years to mature therefore alright you're not going to know what prices are going to be nine years down the road you're going to have to base your production decisions and therefore your output decisions on what prices are nearly a decade nearly a decade ago
okay so because there is this production time UNK there is a growing season right we need to incorporate time into our models
so that's one reason why we need a dynamic specification
another reason is that farmers are often reluctant right to change their output erm or adjust their output UNK and either un unable or basically UNK and there is psychological resistance to changing the technique of production
alright if an innovation comes onto the market that enables a farmer to increase his output alright if that er UNK that lies outside of erm sort of UNK or traditional methods there may be a psychological resistance to actually adopting it simply because we're a UNK thing ooh i don't know how it's going to how it's going to work
they say it's going to increase production but it may involve other costs
it may although production on average may rise using this innovation may increase the UNK of output and farmers don't like variations in output
it may off it may also take time for farmers to acquire the skills necessary in order to increase or to use to adopt this technology
alright and will give rise to a delayed response so even though prices may rise UNK output response won't be immediate right not only because of the growing season that's involved but due but due to psychological resistance erm to the adoption of that technology and also it may take time to acquire the necessary skills to implement that technology
right er okay
other things that might er UNK upon the supply response over time might be things like erm er UNK
now UNK are frequently used in agriculture and if you're locked into a rotation it doesn't really matter what happens to current price you're not going to be able to af to change your output right because you've got to er keep into this in this rotation
you've got to leave land UNK or erm you know you can't UNK in UNK culture continuously or if you do you've got to be you've got to manage the soil condition very carefully indeed you can just er produce a desert if you're not if you're not careful
alright so where farmers are locked into a specific rotation and UNK are quite generally used alright they may not be able to erm change their output erm until they can change the rotation
alright a another reason erm we could term asset UNK it's in general erm fixed factors right erm or UNK factors of production in agriculture are dominated by fixed factors right
essentially land and expensive capital machinery
okay
so in the short run by definition you can only change output the response or by changing variable factors in production
changing the level of UNK chemical UNK right possibly er labour input
alright but you won't be able to change the d the underlying UNK factor erm of production which is the amount of land you have
alright
alright so short run supply response is generally much more UNK than long run supply response due to this asset UNK argument
also farmers are going to be because most of the assets on a farm are fixed assets right farmers are going to be very reluctant alright to cease production just because prices are low for a couple of years
right economic theory tells us that production will continue in the short run providing average variable costs are covered
alright
now if most of the erm factors of production used on the farm are fixed factors farmers may well continue for years and years erm because although they're not UNK covering total costs or total average costs they are covering average variable costs alright
the costs of the seed the cost of chemicals the cost of casual labour
alright
so even when prices do fall very low for quite long periods of time alright farmers will still maintain production even they're making losses
i mean you can make losses in the short run it's rational to do so alright where a large proportion of your costs are fixed costs essentially
i mean if you in the agricultural depression of the nineteen thirties that's a depression that lasted erm the best part of a decade you know but farmers didn't go out of production you know for about five six seven years down the line because virtually all of their assets were tied up in fixed assets
right they're able to cover their variable costs alright but not their not their fixed costs
and so it took a great deal of time erm in the nineteen thirties for farmers to cease production
it did occur because the depression was so er was so long erm but by and large farmers don't go out of don't cease erm production just because of a couple of years of er poor UNK or low prices
right i mean the exceptions to the sort of that general sort of rule of thumb are enterprises where variable costs account for a large proportion of total costs things like egg production pig production they tend to be very short run supply elasticities tend to be very high in those type of enterprises primarily because most of the costs alright are tied up in variable costs
alright you don't need expensive machinery large amount of land right to produce or pigs
i've got a number down here er seventy percent of total costs of egg production are UNK are variable costs and essentially that's the feed the chicken feed
right again UNK is another enterprise where fixed costs only represent a quite small proportion of total costs
alright in something like UNK right the main the main cost is going to be UNK costs the labour the labour costs right and this is why if you go into the er into somewhere like UNK when there's been a UNK harvest and just see the fruit UNK on the trees
farmers won't even bother to harvest it right simply because the bulk of it the total production costs will be labour will be the labour costs of UNK and if they can't cover those labour costs of UNK by selling their produce which they won't be able to if there's been a UNK harvest because prices are very low they'll just leave the things UNK on the trees and er that is that is what happens quite regularly in UNK markets which tend not to be markets that are supported through the common agricultural policy
right erm so UNK this effect of asset UNK may be erm the case where a number of similar products or competing products er their prices fall UNK so if you're you know if you're wheat if you're a UNK farmer in the south east of england alright and the prices of wheat barley and virtually all sort of oil seed rape anything else that you can use the land for if they all fall you know there's no point in switching production alright so you may continue to produce even though the price of the product has fallen alright because the prices of all other competing products has fallen
right and you simply may not be able to switch into milk production or UNK because you don't have the UNK know how or the soil may be inappropriate the climate may be inappropriate right so that's another factor influencing well making er supply quite rigid quite UNK in the short run
erm clearly in an in any agricultural supply function you may want to incorporate the fact that weather plays a vitally im important role
how do we incorporate that
i don't really know it's quite difficult
alright because the weather although clearly er important is a multi UNK concept in that it involves UNK sunshine hours and not only the amount of rain the amount of sun but when those things actually occur
alright i mean erm i don't know if you'll be able to see this right erm let's just do it like that i haven't got the overhead with me today
what i've got here is a time series of potato yields over time
right now potato yields are quite variable right and erm not only are they variable but on this time series of yields you can you can see the effects of technology
right potato yields are just er are rising quite dramatically particularly since this point here is the end of the second world war and over the last part of this graph you can see yields have risen dramatically
but notice here in seventy er seventy three and four is that right seventy three and four alright yields fell alright by about a third well over a third in two in the two years
that was the effect of weather right
in the first year right there was not enough rain right in order to UNK the UNK right presumably the same thing happened in the second year but no the reason why er yields were very low in nineteen seventy four was because there was too much rain
alright
okay
the UNK pretty complicated to model and er although it is vitally important in er agricultural supply it's very difficult to incorporate into models
if it is incorporated there's usually an index of er of UNK that's used
right another thing that we want to er want to incorporate is risk or un or uncertainty
agricultural production is UNK uncertain
in a free market that uncertainty comes from both erm production uncertainty good yields bad yields due to poor weather or good weather but also comes from price uncertainty
alright now farmers are UNK risk UNK right in the face of uncertainty
right so given a choice between erm an average a guaranteed income of say fifty pounds per hectare right if they're given a cer a certain if that fifty pounds is certain every year alright they will choose that every time in a er well just yes
a UNK certainty equivalent of fifty pounds per year would be erm would be desired or chosen virtually all the time in preference over erm incomes of sort of zero and a hundred in UNK years
i mean in the long run their both they both give the same outcome alright but farmers want to try and avoid that UNK of income alright so they'll much prefer to instead of having you know they probably prefer erm a certain income of forty pounds rather than erm an equal chance of getting one hundred pounds or zero
right clearly that's not erm profit UNK
right however UNK is something that isn't taken into account right in our normal models of profit UNK behaviour
right cos they're static models alright there's no uncertainty there
when we include uncertainty er we ought to acknowledge that farmers may behave not as profit UNK erm but as profit UNK and that's reflected in their in their risk UNK
right now if they're acting UNK right simply because you have a zero income of say two years on the UNK you may just well be driven out of business if you're er a farmer in the developed developing world you may er possibly thrown off the land or you may even UNK
alright so farmers like to er reduce erm UNK of their of their income
right
we'll come onto this later on but er it can be shown quite easily why farm how farm why farmers er behave what you may from what economic theory would tell you is an UNK manner alright and it's simply because they're trying to minimize their risks
alright risk and uncertainty is something that's excluded from most economic models
okay so they'll always choose options farmers will always choose options that are less risky
and the best way to do that on a farm is to UNK and this is why most farms in the u k are mixed farms
alright
they grow they grow a proportion of er some of their land is devoted to UNK some of their land is devoted to UNK
so they're all they're trading off their gains from economies of scale right with erm UNK of income that may result from sort of putting all their eggs in one basket so diversification is the main way in which farmers cope er with an uncertain environment
okay
erm right
so we can just if we have look now at the effect of time on output to supply diagram okay in the short run supply will be very UNK
alright but as you move through time the supply response becomes increasingly more UNK
right now let's just say p one p two right prices change from p one to p two in the short run the change in quantities can be very small
but due to the factors that we've mentioned alright the supply will ex will expand progressively over time right so our long run supply curve alright will become a lot more UNK than the short run supply curve right so if you think of our elasticity formula i over changing quantity over changing price times price over quantity right as we go through time our original our original prices and quantities are going to stay the same right p one q one that's not going to change through time right
if this price change is maintained and delta p is going to stay the same right the only that thing that changes is the level of output right which is in the UNK
and as a result long run elasticities alright are always greater than short run supply elasticities
the only thing that's changing is er UNK response to a to a price change
right erm i think in actual fact we'll er we'll leave things we'll leave things there
i won't bother starting this
right
sorry
oh er that was probably something hang on er probably structure of industry or something erm oh n that gives n number of number of firms supplying the market you know perfect competition in the
have you got that one
yes what i'm sorry have you got some time on tomorrow
is there by any chance any tea or coffee
if you say and it's true because right erm the er that was talking about yesterday in lecture involves erm the notion of UNK in and erm seems to be er a very deeply complicated er topic so erm i imagine there are questions that you folks had
there were certainly questions that i had in listening to the lecture and reading of the material and erm as herself said there does seem to be something of an in own thinking about this
erm would be erm as follows
we are aware that there are lots of individuals around us individual people like socrates erm and erm plato erm and then there is the possibility that in addition to these individual people er at the level of there are corresponding to these individual people at the level of intellect erm there are forms of these individuals
like there is also the level of
forms for all sorts of forms for all sorts of things erm the normal UNK range of forms plus possibly in addition forms for socrates and forms for plato
erm and the introduction of these forms of individuals erm might have arisen as the one passage that showed us might suggest the passage from five seven on page three of her handout number eleven there the need for forms of individuals might have arisen from the following
we are UNK to UNK our bodily UNK and we are UNK to erm move to the level of intellect through UNK that is by pursuing philosophy we will withdraw ourselves from our mere bodily UNK and be UNK to the realm of intellect
erm and one thing that you might worry about is okay once i get up there how do i get back down again
erm that worry might come in two different ways
er how do i get down at all erm of course that might not be a worry you might and just remain in the realm for all eternity
but then you might worry if i'm bound to come back down again how can i guarantee that i come back down into the right erm body again
that is how can i guarantee that i will remain erm being me after my UNK from the level of the forms
and the erm construction of forms for individuals might be an answer to that problem
that is when socrates UNK from his body to the level of intellect erm he's represented by UNK in the erm divine light by the form of socrates
erm and then erm he returns from the form of socrates to being socrates again and is not either er lost up in the soul erm or somehow UNK transported UNK from the level of intellect into the wrong body
erm socrates does some UNK er UNK from his empirical self becomes intellect and then afterwards er drops into the wrong empirical er self and turns into well some erm some ho UNK
erm who knows
he might turn into
think of the person you'd least like to find yourself becoming
is he actually UNK here erm i'm not we use the word forms here but in a more active modern sense to say
could be
it seems that would really more easily
well what's the contrast here
remaining an identity
right what's perhaps i should have started with the UNK picture in which at the level of intellect erm there would be no individual forms but only forms say for human beings
erm and another form over here for a horse erm and then when i found my true self erm here i am socrates and i'm trying to withdraw from my erm what erm called the empirical self
i'm trying to withdraw from the empirical self and erm return to the level of forms
and the form that i return to is the form of human being erm that's the form that i have and whatever UNK socrates from plato erm is not a matter of the form because they have exactly the same form
in fact whatever UNK these two happens only at the level of matter or the soul bodily things
now if that were right that is here's our bodily bit here that's what UNK them right socrates is shorter than plato is a bit UNK than socrates has funny UNK eyes erm plato must have been rather a normal looking person a variety of things that differentiate them but they're not different in respect of being human beings
erm but we're told this interesting thing about them mainly that er about them and about us as well that their true self is not their current bodily condition
their true self is more truly erm at the level of intellect or forms
right that's the whole part about one's true self
again one could draw as it were a sort of a picture of erm one's true self as a sort of UNK lump er much of which was the body and then within this smaller portion which is the soul and within that a still smaller portion which is the mind and then in all of us there is present to us the one and we're told that we ought to think about our body that it is not our true self
erm that this is a merely UNK and UNK something that erm somehow as it were has stuck on to us rather like some UNK substance on the sole of one's shoe
erm and so too our body has got stuck on our soul erm but we can shed it again erm to find our inner self
and in turn we can shed the soul to find our true self with the mind
there's tension here
erm the closer we get to our true self seems to be saying erm the less there is to distinguish er UNK true self from UNK true self erm so it's a little bit UNK about what he's gonna say
how if UNK true self is the form of human being and UNK true self is the form of human being erm then how can we tell their true UNK apart
yeah
okay
so erm your point is that erm you move upward from your body to a level of intellect and then at the level there's still a further journey to go up to no one and that's our true self
there's a fascinating journey here isn't there
because one gets the impression that it's an upward journey
aha
but i think myself it's an internal journey
so then it's an internal journey you've done it then you keep your identity because your journey is into the UNK self where you find you go through these levels
right
but not out there but in there
yeah there's no doubt that the one is in each of us
yeah so i mean it's an inward journey
right
so if that is the case how can we possibly lose our identity because we haven't we're not there's no suggestion if we go on an inward journey the inward journey must be within our UNK within our UNK not jumping out into some form of UNK context
well except that erm i think that even in defending our idea that we retain our UNK you relied on UNK movement that is when you say that or when i say that the one is within us clearly you must be speaking UNK
because the one doesn't have any location whatsoever nor for that matter do the forms even the matter of intellect is non UNK and non locational
erm so i agree with you that the UNK of UNK is only a UNK
it can't really be a matter of changing one's UNK
erm er there's no lift UNK
but neither can the idea of going inward being UNK either it's not as though there's any location within my body erm which is the location of the one
nor if the four of us get into your car are there four locations within the car location of the one
one of the problems it seems that i can see about this is that the little sort of semi diagram you could almost reverse the and have the same sort of problem in other words
and that seems to be more along the lines of a view er
yeah so this is this a little picture of what socrates looks like but as you're pointing out erm er also sometimes likes to UNK the whole UNK in the other direction
it's the one that's all UNK or all UNK
erm and the intellect is within the one somehow
cos now of course we're talking about the whole UNK the everything that there is the all the whole erm and then you're right he does talk about erm body at one er extraordinary point he talks about body the relation of body and soul being that of a er fishing net er floating through the ocean and erm the ocean is soul and this fishing net is er body floating erm through it
very erm UNK although i don't know exactly what it's extraordinary one erm the perhaps we should begin to step back a second here to think about how we normally UNK things
erm that is normally we think that we and lots of things around us are susceptible to change
erm er for instance this book could be changed by UNK a page out of it
erm and that would alter the book but nevertheless we would want to say what i did was to alter the book
it was the book that i altered
it's the same book which now is slightly different
that's very different from say er destroying this book and replacing it with this book
erm that's not a change of any one book that's just a replacement of one book by another
similarly if i tell you that i am going to move this piece of chalk in front of me and i demonstrate look here goes right okay same piece of chalk has moved across in front of me
that's rather different from saying here is the motion of a piece of chalk
okay
sorry that's not the motion of a piece of chalk that's the replacement of one piece of chalk by another
no piece of chalk had moved across the front of me
rather erm one was in one position and then a second took up a different position
in order that is for there to be some change whether er change er like having a page torn out or a change like moving from one location to another there also has to be something that stays the same mainly the subject of change
the thing of which i say the it changes
erm so how do we do that with people
er i can say for instance that i'm changing because i'm er getting older i'm getting UNK erm all sorts of things can be said about me
erm but they're still being said about me
er there's something that's me that UNK these different changes of location erm age and size erm all kinds of things are consistent with it still being me that's doing the changing rather than my having been replaced by something else
well erm what kinds of changes can be performed on me and still it would be the case that it's me
that the end be changed and has now been changed
what are those kind of changes on one hand
and on the other hand what are changes such that we want to say that at the end of the change there is just no me left there at all and i've been replaced by something else
erm i take it this is to ask the question what's essential to me and what's UNK to me
really this is not er a new division this is just oral distinction of essential and UNK properties
erm so right now i'm wearing a UNK jacket
erm having changed my jacket to a blue jacket i'll still nevertheless be me
because even if i weren't wearing the UNK jacket i'd still be me
if i were no longer a human being then one might wonder whether i was still me at all
if i were no longer er an animal of any kind one might be quite UNK to think that one could still talk about any of me surviving
and so on and so forth
we'd make different judgments about this
i'm not saying that there's any strict word answers to these questions but these are the questions we're asking when we think about what's erm UNK and what's essential to someone
the claim that's being made here is that no one 's body is at all essential to them
erm i'm perfectly comfortable that any bit of my UNK is completely UNK to me that i can lose it without losing my arm but the finger is rather stronger
there's nothing about me that erm excuse me there's nothing about my body that is essential to me nothing about my body that UNK me and that's why erm i take it one might think that erm i could actually be changed into a different body so
right any time you read a story whether it be religious or science fiction or whatever in which somebody is taken out of one body and put into another body erm and the story goes and then was turned into a pig or whatever erm presumably that author has it in mind that you can still identify that same guy first in one body and then in the body of a pig
that author presumably thinks that being in a human body is not essential to
you can agree with that or disagree with that or whatever but that's part of the defence being made here by erm
this is no part of our true self
yeah
this i was just gonna say this sounds remarkably like the origins of
well erm i don't
i don't know whether he got it from here or from another source but it's very UNK similar
that the that the erm right erm you can go back a fair ways earlier and already find people thinking that you can be transported from one body to another or even from one species to another
UNK
right
there's a story about er pythagoras which is actually the earliest and strongest evidence that the historical pythagoras actually believed in changing erm UNK from the five twenties or so
it's a bit of poetry by the UNK in which he er says that pythagoras once saw a puppy being beaten and said er don't beat that puppy that's a good friend of mine i recognize his voice
erm and so i think that even at that early age er in the five twenties or earlier somebody already there is saying we can track personal identity throughout change of not only body but change of species erm with these
and the same picture or a similar picture has as well
continuing that theme would it not be right to say though that plato only gave to come back into human form to those people such as UNK and that most other people would come back as some other form
doesn't actually say
is not over worried about the body
but the state of the soul the personality wouldn't change
hmm right
he doesn't really actually does he
he doesn't actually discuss the body as UNK
i think he's discussing our character and our personality rather than our body
would you not
i mean i don't know
i mean i get that impression
he doesn't he's not concerned about the UNK of the body but concerned about the UNK in UNK of our personality as it was before we ca we went on this journey to the one
am i right
i dunno
am i
yes right
and the body is completely trivial
it's no more than a change of clothing
it just doesn't tell you anything interesting about the person that very that very same person
yeah i agree with all of that
i don't know i
when we tell them in the what we say is that erm that very same person came back as a fox or you know that very same person came back as er you know ge UNK or whatever animal it might be
that is even in a different body in a different species we can still say that person that soul
and that's because plato would be UNK the UNK in the soul and not in the body
erm soul as you'll recollect stands in this funny relation erm between body and when we get up to intellect we're actually UNK the soul as well
d this is ever so important
i mean do you think that perhaps is more advanced than plato because plato on this incredible myth of his of going on this journey where ordinary people's view of the form wasn't very good so they would come back in an UNK perhaps in an inferior form but i get the feeling that with we have the opportunity of seeing something that is going to improve us anyway that we've all got an equal chance of some kind of improvement
different to the UNK myth of the journey across the universe like in
it seems to me an UNK
am i right
i mean i sense that it is
i sense that it is an improvement
it seems to me we're also coming across some sort of eastern influence here as well
it could be but i think that the question is asking is in UNK view do each of us have an equal chance of performing this UNK or in view do we each have an equal chance of performing this UNK
i don't know the answer to that UNK but it's i'm inclined to think that erm at least by the time of the republic there are things that some people are more naturally UNK towards philosophy and other people are less naturally UNK towards philosophy
i am also inclined to imagine that would say something like that
now he does think that the one and the mind is present to every one of us erm but i also take it that erm he er thought that he himself had been able to UNK to the one er four times in the course of his life and that he also thought that some of his students were of better UNK than others and erm so he may also have thought as plato did that some people are more inclined towards philosophy than others
erm
would have thought that the cow down the road had the same chance of getting to the one that he had
you know i just don't know
in some way the one is in both of them equally
yeah
of course the one is also in this piece of chalk too
i mean the one is just so it may not be any great compliment to say that the cow has an equal chance erm but i actually don't know the answer to that one whether thought that
apart from the fact that i mean aren't we actually looking at something similar to erm here in that most of these things were organized as far as i can work out was the one that organized all these lectures into but they were originally lectures
yeah i don't know how might that affect what we are
well in that we're i'm just i'm just bringing up a point that yes he it seems that he could well say something like well the cow UNK or the shepherd down the road has got as much of the right as anybody else
the difference is that the cow the cow UNK or the shepherd is not particularly interested in consciously realizing that whereas it seems to me that what you're saying is that he is
that pl that he is in
yes
erm and that this is a sort of a difference between
the cow UNK and
yes and also assume thereby the difference between a cow UNK and a student of his or whatever
yeah were right then that might push us back towards the UNK view that some people are more
i'd like to get back to what was saying about how it's soul that really UNK us it's soul that carries out UNK and not the body
i mean that does have a lot of UNK for all of us feel that erm i could have been the same person erm with lots of different changes to my body
i could have had erm brown eyes instead of blue i could have been UNK or shorter i could have been lots of different erm bodily arrangements erm and still be me just be the same er person
one may say that one may say well it's really your soul or your character that makes you who you are
what kinds of features are we pointing to there
erm for instance suppose that i think that one of the things that er makes me who i am is erm that i have a good head for numbers
erm not that that's true
erm but someone else might think this erm about themselves
then would having a good head for numbers be the sort of thing that would UNK them at the level of their soul
would that be the sort of thing that
or perhaps
looking for UNK
i mean UNK are looking for UNK aren't they in a way
so being UNK of the truth would be the sort of thing that would
yeah
distinguish one person from another
i'd have thought so
a good memory or a bad memory would be oh sorry
i see so memory of your personal life history
yeah that does
sure it does seem that memory has a role in it
and yet it also seems that er i can also make this statement
erm here is a complete list of the contents of my memory right now
erm a slightly different set of things that happened to me
then the contents of my memory would be this rather than this
erm i wouldn't er remember having erm broken my arm on this date erm i remember rather having broken my leg on this date
erm so the contents of my memory would differ and yet that doesn't seem yet to UNK me from someone else
erm it's true that in general we do have different memories than other people do er but it doesn't seem to be fully UNK in that any change in the contents of the memory would produce a change in
but yeah certainly that's one of the things that we think is that our er it's our memory of our own historical life events is part of what makes us who we are
erm another reason why i can't give you the whole story of course is because then there'd be no reason to take this baby rather than this baby at the hospital you know so their UNK are exactly identical i e nil erm nothing UNK them on that account
erm one reason why can't help himself to that is because that would be a history of change that would be a history of the body and that is not UNK to us
that he seemed to insist cannot be the UNK of our UNK
erm can we link it up to any earlier pattern
i'm thinking now in particular of UNK four so if that particular UNK to be i dunno UNK or UNK then that would be a kind of UNK of us
yeah so perhaps the things that the things that erm seem to us more important than your bodily UNK whether i have blue eyes or brown eyes something that's more important seems to be the sorts of UNK i have
do i want the truth or do i want money
the sorts of UNK that i have
erm am i good at this or am i good at that
erm perhaps my UNK
erm there's some UNK to all these things right
i take it that i don't like modern art and yet i can imagine that while being the same person that i am i might have liked modern art
that's not er UNK it wouldn't involve a complete change of personality well some of it
so those are the sorts of things i take it that er we do think are a more interesting way of UNK people than their bodily
and i'm sure that that's part of why sounds pretty good when he's saying that it's not the body that makes us who we are it's not the body that matters
erm to the kind of soul that i have right now erm drag that out of my body erm make sure that it's the same soul that i started with drop it into some other body and you'll still be able to tell the story that i still me am now in a different body
erm that seems like the right sort of thing to say
what though if we wanted to make a further move of UNK
what if we wanted to say that our true self was not even our UNK or UNK or UNK
because our true self isn't the soul that's not our true self either
that's a mere er
our true self is mind
erm or at least mind is our UNK self
the sorts of things i happen to like the sorts of things i happen to be good at or bad at
those really are not any part of my true self either tells us
erm my true self is merely the part that does intellectual UNK
erm so that i apparently would be still me even if i had completely different UNK er preferences er so on and so forth
now it's gonna be a bit harder to hang on to the thought here
erm can i imagine erm two UNK each of them doing UNK and say about the two of them is they go through the group of er the infinity of prime numbers each of them is working that through
can i say about them er now that one that is clearly fred erm you know just look at the way he does that proof erm oh well now that one that's clearly UNK erm that's the way UNK does a proof
erm you know people do say these things about computer codes
i've heard people say that erm er software writers have certain individual styles
you can sometimes you know tell one person writes software in this way and another
they used to have that in er when they put
some people's hands right
yeah same thought
and yet erm what er what seems to have be going against that is that erm at least so far as is concerned the proof is any UNK is a unique UNK
erm there are not too often UNK for any UNK
there's a proof because so if two people were UNK the proof of the infinity of UNK they wouldn't be going about it in different ways erm if they're UNK the proof they'd be UNK exactly the same steps in the same order
it's getting rather hard to think about what it is that lets me see them as distinct individuals if all that they're doing are
what happens if one of them's looking at it from a viewpoint and the other one's looking at it from a viewpoint
would that not same kind of UNK
okay or for instance erm i could write up the theory excuse me i could write up the proof of the infinity of UNK for a variety of reasons
i might be teaching you some er number theory or i might be teaching you the structure of number theory
i might be saying look it doesn't matter what proof i choose but you know here is an interesting example of it
or i might be saying here's an example of a UNK
or i might be saying here's the sort of silly thing i was taught when i was at UNK
erm and what and the these er for a different reason erm
i guess my UNK would be to say that there's only one of those in which we are actually doing the proof
there's only actually one of those which we're thinking about the proof as a proof
but what i'm saying is that there may only be one proof sense is what we as individuals derive from that proof
it somehow becomes coloured into
right now so that's where we need to get that's what we need to push for
how can we think about something colouring our that doesn't have anything to do with our bodies nothing to do with our history nothing to do with a particular that we've gone through nothing to do with our soul UNK
erm some UNK that would make it still ours
terrific
say something completely different
well no but and i were just thinking well why can't it just be all things together that make us what we are and when you're trying to find a single thing the only single thing is the one which is the unity and then there's no differentiation but i don't think that we are we are our body as well and that then can affect the soul you know if you if you've got a big nose and all your life people UNK at you you're gonna you're not going to be UNK by it
sure
so i don't know
but then when you do peel them away whether you can have a UNK like the when talked about he talked about either side of his face UNK void that you had to see the limit of it so that you could have erm that i was in this body and there's something about this body that i'm going to go back into the body and then that could differentiate perhaps
erm otherwise i just think it's very tricky when you when you when you try and take away the layers that you're going to just end up with the one that you can't talk about anyway
mhm yeah i think i actually think you've made an excellent UNK point about philosophy in general
that is erm whenever people look for an analysis of something here i've been looking for an analysis of UNK there's a tendency to consider candidate UNK one by one UNK
erm it does this er by UNK
erm well no
well let me throw that aside
erm does this suffice for UNK
no well UNK that aside
and your point which i think is very important is erm maybe this is an analysis that has to be given erm by a UNK of necessary conditions none of which is UNK sufficient but all of which are jointly necessary and UNK
so erm for instance if i were to say UNK what is the essence of UNK cake
erm is it flour
er no we'll UNK that aside
is it eggs
no can't be eggs throw those out
er you know go through all the UNK
gosh UNK cake doesn't have any essence at all you know erm that'll be astonishing finding is whereas your point is look it might just be some of all these things in some proportion or some ratio
right but then i suppose that you could say that it's the idea of the UNK cake which it would be on the level of the in intellect
mhm
so the essence of UNK cake so it's alright to go from the body to intellect maybe that is alright if you just forget the body
but then it's the per it's the if you're going to the union with the one it's that coming back
i take it that our explanation you and i who are the children of the children of freud do think that our body erm adds a great contribution to our UNK
that brief story you told about how my physical appearance might affect my social UNK and my social UNK might affect my UNK make up
erm that sounds very persuasive to all of us nowadays and i fully believe it that part of what makes me is in fact er the fact that i'm this shape and this size
yeah except that is just nothing in the end
that in the end it doesn't make it doesn't mean anything
well as far as thinks it sure doesn't that's the big difference between us right
no
i mean i mean lots of different pupils would say that it doesn't mean anything in the end because erm you know what are we here for what can we do you know and like why you know i mean i i'm sure it doesn't mean very much
in fact this is what socrates is going when he's asked well what do you want us to do with your body he said you can do what you like i won't be in it anyway
right r right mhm
i think i think it's important to remember what said about the body
i think i mean he makes the emphasis here that the body is not any more than a tool
ya that's right
and i think you know i mean it's not how we feel we're trying to understand what is saying to us
and that's a real
that's a real deep difference that we're inclined to suppose that the body does have some role in UNK and clearly as you're pointing out doesn't
that is when you ask erm er who are we is any part of what we are made up by the body the UNK quite UNK no we er already identified use the body this other thing
erm the body is something else from us and we are the things erm not that are made up of our body but that merely use our body
erm popping out of your body is no different i think in from erm driving along in your car and er turning off and UNK out of the car
you know you're not using that particular tool any more and you hop out of it and walk away
erm the body's rather like that i suppose
it makes it quite clear that we should be in charge of the tool
sure no problem there
you certainly don't want your tools running you but the crucial is that the tool is a completely separate thing from us
when i try to give up who i am erm none of who i am has to do with this external er additional tool
yeah
erm if you're trying to UNK erm rather than take a proof
mhm
take an argument or a problem
i mean no two UNK would give you a sort of similar approach would they
right yeah no it's a very
i mean you can a completely different viewpoint
right
erm but i think that we also think this is in an in the state of philosophy nowadays
that is one of the reasons why i think that man is in much better shape than i think UNK in
