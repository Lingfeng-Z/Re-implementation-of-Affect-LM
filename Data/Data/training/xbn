because if i go to two different UNK and i say erm can you work these sums for me
generally and for the most part they'll come up with the same sum at the end of the day and if i go to two different UNK and say erm can you tell me about free will
er generally and for the most part and for the most part at the end of the day they'll come up with completely irrelevant er things
erm and
isn't this just the difference between a UNK and concepts
could be but i guess my thought was that
i mean why do we need two UNK
we obviously need more UNK
i guess my thought was that was that in view that there we were doing philosophy the more convergence there would be if we really knew what we were about as UNK
we would not be UNK with one another any more
erm and that er what causes erm david lewis to tell the sorts of stories about he tells is this kind of UNK accident that happened to him when he was three years old and then was exaggerated by his
having the UNK that he does
erm and what causes erm you know so tells is another series of accidents that are completely at the level of historical and bodily erm
erm if er if they had been erm all along they would be telling the same story as if they really could do their in UNK properly
but if you're not trying to
that th so that's what you need to get a hold of that's when you need to think how can we cash that out how can we give that some content
does the idea of there being a colouring to
i don't wanna stray that much erm from the text we've got but there is some text that has written namely the one on UNK beauty
mhm
where he seems to indicate that erm for example he says in there that he UNK to the UNK heaven wherever that is i assume intellect
erm and he says there all things are in all things but each is coloured according to the host
their host i suspect
so in other words
the one
well or the individual
there
you're talking about a group of individual things
right we'd have to take a look at that cos i suspect that if he says each is coloured by the host
no by the host in which the things are
he's talking about a multitude
mhm
each the same sort of components the same components are each colour say in a red individual they'd all be UNK red colours and in a blue individual they'd all be a blue colour
but there is this thing that all of the forms are in the intellect and all of the forms ah are in the intellect and all of the forms do somehow UNK together into some sort of unitary thing
there's some sort of er unity and UNK at the level intellect erm
the point i'm raising with this is that he does seem in that particular piece he does quite strongly to me anyway that UNK is still very strong
sorry i thought you said that each of them was in all the rest of them and each of them was coloured by the host
no it was the other way round
rather like the sort of there are various glasses full of different marbles
is this something we could look up cos
yeah it's UNK it's the one on individual
i can't remember what the erm is it one six
yeah it's really quite an amazing
one six is it
yeah great
erm which
it's quite an amazing er dialogue
i wonder if i have er
the UNK he uses he is using there he says that the sun the moon and the stars are all there
aha
and in each of the stars are all the sun the moon and the stars
mhm
but each star contains the sun the moon and the stars according to its own UNK of them
right sorry one six is on beauty and five eight is on UNK beauty
which one of those
it would be five eight
probably five eight rather than cos yeah i erm okay see erm right erm so the thing that i would be looking for if i could find this would be what's doing the colouring and how does that work
that is the colour rising up from underneath in an UNK way or is it a light cast from down er from on top by the one which then couldn't UNK them with respect to people for instance
it would be as it were a UNK light
erm so that's just a question to ask when you next come to erm this passage
er if i can't find it right now which
yeah the other phrase he uses is something like all is in each
yeah
and each is in the all
oh sure
so all orange in i assume the one but also the one is in all in each of the
even at the level of forms they're all in each
even at the level of forms
yeah
this is this notion of they're all being UNK together
erm in plato talks about the weaving together of forms and it says erm er it's er through the weaving together of forms that reason arises in us and but then again this is the level of as well so i think that this is the origin of this notion that all the forms are in each they're all UNK together somehow
erm but erm will that help us
think about two people's abstract UNK would still be the UNK of two different people
erm and then once we sort that all out what will we say again at the level of the one
erm that is how can we make sure that erm plato or socrates doesn't UNK to this level and then UNK to the one as everyone else is erm and then having got up this side somehow come down this
erm what when one is at the level of the one what makes you who you are
how can you guarantee that you will be restored to your proper un self
how can you trap that individual through their UNK and UNK that is
erm well i mean he seems to be UNK somehow here that the more that you go up to soul and intellect to the one the more you properly become your true self
therefore yourself your UNK is somehow enhanced by this
yes there's no doubt he says all that right
and that really would lead to the of self not of UNK of self
yes there's no doubt that that's exactly what he thinks
and yes well i don't see what the problem is i mean you become properly yourself in that case so what's the problem
perhaps this is a limited individual problem
i can't make any sense of what he's saying because it seems to me that erm our common and everyday and perhaps very UNK notion of UNK is what makes me different from the rest of you
okay so look at two individuals in two different ways
take a pencil x and say what is it that makes x a separate individual from y okay that'd be a different thing
now take a and say what is it that allows me to say that the individual x in this s erm cell of the film is the same individual x as in this cell of the film
that is what is the underlying subject of change
think of those as the two deep questions about UNK
how can you tell x from y and how can you tell that x is still x that it's still the same thing it was
when we think about those questions of UNK in our normal affairs the best we can do is to say that what UNK us and also what makes us the same person through changes over time is a great UNK of factors some of which are bodily some of which involve our UNK
yeah but he would say that you can't do it in terms of space and time
he certainly would but what in UNK name is he talking about
if it's some notion of UNK which has nothing to do with the body nothing to do with the soul and nothing to do ultimately with the intellect either
yeah that's why it's an
i mean th this is this is exactly what was saying he UNK us more of an account
erm he has stripped away from these true UNK everything that we normally think of as institute of a self
in a sense and a i'm not sure if it's only in a sense that when we talk now of say aren't we trying to approach the same
erm could be
well i mean if we're talking about sort of and they're looking for a sense of identity of whatever it is that they're having of
that is i think that when i refer to and when i refer to i am referring to the same thing
yeah
and that each remain the same thing although being described by a variety of different er descriptions
er just as i think that erm a variety of descriptions can pick out me
erm the only person in the room standing er the only person in the room holding a book erm you know the er sole american in the room
lots of different descriptions always pick out the same me
erm and all of which in that case seem to me completely and have nothing really to do with me
that is i take it would still be me even if i were seated i would still be me even if i weren't holding a book possibly i'd still be me even if i weren't american
chances are
in all possible UNK you'd still be you
nevertheless right there seems to be something that UNK all of those changes er that we can talk about and still me
i mean it does seem on page three nine really what we're talking about trying to get some sense into that
right
er i dunno what you think but i mean it does state there it's quite interesting if one reads it out
mhm
what we're trying to address now
definitely this is the UNK
that is the UNK of the whole of that lecture really number nine
yes i agree i agree right
so
i don't know how to interpret that
i mean you can understand it but then you get his but now another man wishes to exist
yes
you see i mean how can you interpret that
i don't know i don't know although i ought to warn you that another way of interpreting the greek would be but now a man wishes to be another approached that man
erm you could take the as one unit and say but now a man wishing to be another approached that man and when he found us for we were not outside the all he wound himself round us and attached himself to that man who was then each one of us
that man okay UNK who was then each one of us plural erm i take it that erm one of the things that we could conclude from this entire discussion is that our notion of UNK erm which is our modern notion of UNK deeply bound up with erm personal history you know locke's erm what is locke's example
the UNK er the locke tells a story about someone who in their youth was a k a UNK officer erm and how this person in later life their memory of being a UNK off UNK officer is part of what UNK them
erm so in UNK has lots to do with physical UNK lots to do with personal history and memory lots to do with UNK characteristics such as UNK abilities preferences UNK and so on and so forth
maybe what we should say at the end of the day is erm just isn't talking about that he's on about a completely different subject and we really shouldn't erm we shouldn't beat over the head for having a bad theory of the self
maybe he just doesn't you know he doesn't wanna talk about the self
maybe he's talking about it all
maybe he's under a different notion
erm er he might be doing a very good job of explaining some other notion not the notion of a self or an individual but er something else
erm maybe that would be the more fair thing to say at the end of the day
erm
well when she when it was but now another man wishing to exist approaches that man did she say that man was the intellect
it's tough i don't know erm take a look about four lines above
now even if or erm er let's start from the top
but we who are we
are we two choices that which draws nearer and comes to be in time that's the first choice
no even before this coming to be er came to be we were there and we were men who were different and some of us were even gods and we were pure UNK and UNK
okay so apparently that original we had something to do with UNK united with the whole of reality
UNK a bad translation
united with the whole of being
remember being is a level of intellect whereas the one is above being
so it says united with the whole of reality that means at the level of intellect being
what are we t where are we going to face reality then
being or intellect is reality
reality is at the level of er intellect
erm we were pure UNK and intellect united with the whole of being
we were parts of the UNK
not marked off or cut off but belonging to the whole
erm i should also say that bit about some of us were even gods erm that also is erm there are some options there on translation erm you could also say men who were different and particular that is we were and erm particular humans and we were gods
that would be to say not some of us were gods but all of us were gods
erm so that's another possibility
er men who were different and particular and gods
erm so we were pure UNK and we were UNK united with the whole of being i e the forms
we were parts of the UNK not marked off or cut off but belonging to the whole
er i take it to the whole of reality er or being
not the one
er not if the
not UNK in the one
er if the whole there in the sixth line refers back to the whole of being in the fourth line then it would be erm not the one but intellect
erm but now another man erm wishing to exist or perhaps but not a man wishing to be other erm approached them er and when he found us for we were not outside the all
not outside the all
mhm although i take it that we're in fact
what does he mean by the all
not the one
in other words is that another way of saying the one
i don't think so because
what does he mean by the all then
could be again the level of intellect erm
yes
erm because i you might er
it's the UNK of this these words that makes it difficult to understand
terribly difficult yeah it's just it's just miserable stuff erm to try to make sense of
erm another er the UNK makes the comment on this particular that in no other is as casual about not UNK the three highest UNK
he doesn't really seem to be very careful about UNK intellect from the one and so forth doesn't really he's not he's not really focusing on that difference and so seems to let it lapse in a less than useful way
erm
he says he UNK he wound himself round us now who's he referring to he
it's this other man apparently
erm
the intellectual man the intellectual we're talking about we're not talking about a man in body we're talking about intellect
yeah although the one who UNK himself around might be a bodily man
do come in
erm yes it's just a desperately difficult passage
yeah no it's tough stuff
yes indeed
well good morning ladies and gentlemen
before we start the presentation i'd mention there will be hard copies of the slides available the video is for internal use only and there should be plenty of time for questions at the end
six months ago we reported interim results fifty eight percent down on the previous year but held out hope for a stronger performance in the second half in the event our os optimism was justified
and in the second half when we always make the bulk of our profits we fought back and our second pre tax er performance exceeded by some five million er that of nineteen ninety
this wasn't sufficient to make up the ground lost in the first half and the outcome for the year as a whole you now see
i'd like to draw your attention to a couple of points on this slide
first the high earnings per share after extraordinary items which is increasingly relevant to the proposed new accounting standards and secondly that we're recommending a maintained dividend which we can UNK do bearing in mind our reasonable dividend cover and low net debt
we now come to the breakdown of trading profit by sector
profits er from oil services were well and educational publishing in the u s er put in a very strong performance
frank will be going into more detail on these and our other businesses which are all facing an UNK struggle particularly in the u k and north america both in deep recession and which you can see continue to make up the bulk of our markets
i'd add that at the moment we do not see any UNK in any of our major markets
before handing over to frank i'd like to emphasise some of the key points of nineteen ninety one
yes we did have a strong profits recovery in the second half greatly helped by oil services and u s educational publishing
we had a strong improvement in operating cash generation and that and the sale of brought net debt down to a low level
b sky b is now profitable of trading level we increased our stake in it during the year from eleven percent to sixteen percent
frank became the new chairman and we believe that in due course it's gonna generate substantial profits
finally i'd like to mention that we shall be recommending for shareholders a one for one UNK issue
this isn't intended as any particular message but we are now one of the UNK shares in the f t s e index and be we believe that it should improve the market UNK of the shares
now frank
good morning everyone
i think when we talked to you er when we presented the UNK er we talked about the action we would be taking given the difficult circumstances and er if i could just remind you
we said we'd be going for cost space reductions
well we've done that as we said we would and of course in a business such as pearson which is a people business er although we regularly monitor employment statistics such as total employ total number of employees er revenue per employee cost per employee profit per employee there are times when we have to take er difficult decisions and er so we've gone in for a lot of redundancy which we'll see in er during the next slide or two
but not just redundancy we've taken initiatives in lots of other areas we'll show you those as well
on capital spending we tended to concentrate on that spending which would show a return on the investment and if we could we've UNK er maintenance spending erm renewal of cars and that kind of thing
all of our chief executives accept er cash generation targets erm either cash generation or ratio of working capital to er to sales and that kind of thing and erm as well as er profit to turn over issues and that's er stood us in good UNK this year
and we've been saying to chief executives if you can't get the profit or you can't get the sales well at least concentrate on trying to trying to get the cash get the UNK in that kind of thing
and we think that's er gone well too
and of course we've tried to reinforce our market positions and i think we've succeeded in er in virtually all of our businesses
er now if we look at the er staff reduction by sector
again when i spoke to you during the UNK i was expecting redundancies during the year of er about a thousand
in the event we've achieved fourteen hundred nearly fourteen hundred and that follows on the six hundred redundancies we had last year
er and as well as the erm staff reduction initiatives er staff reduction initiatives that this showed you the savings er in the year
most of the savings of course coming next year a small saving this year
as well as that we managed to restrict the pay round for the whole of pearson in the u k to four percent
going to other cost saving initiatives erm in the newspapers we've we made lots of savings in UNK
this was usually negotiating better discounts in some of our production centres reducing the UNK width which of course saves UNK and in many areas er in the regional newspapers reducing the distribution of our freeze in areas where we thought it er it wouldn't affect it wouldn't have affected the performance of the title
er on the book side we've managed er considerable reductions in freight costs UNK and printing
in entertainment i'd think the UNK cost reductions there were pretty well er restricted to good housekeeping but from fine china er we managed to transfer the er work in the UNK factory to the UNK street factory and that allowed us to close the UNK factory and quite apart from the redundancies that UNK we saved something like two hundred and fifty thousand er non staff related overhead
er group wide in the u s a the er new york headquarters staff under david 's direction achieved a very worthwhile er reduction in UNK two million a year and this was by er UNK our UNK erm business and negotiating an er one contract
and they've just about completed a second one on freight which will save two million dollars a year
and we're looking to do similar transactions in the u k but of course with the lack of or the reduced competition in the u k we may not do quite as well
er on capital ex expenditure er most of the capital you see there was erm investment which will show a return er on investment
er the big items were brighton where we're spending ten eleven millions er with the new press and the new building which is pretty well completed er it very shortly will be on stream
erm the oil company continue to invest in capital expenditure as it should do and er most of that is spent between services UNK and UNK and at UNK we continue to invest er alton towers has got er the ghost house opening today and the UNK train and we were finishing off the UNK road project which is a very big project involving er re the complete refurbishment er new shops and a view right there in the basement
and so the er the reward for our firm grip on costs and the concentration on cash is a favourable swing of forty seven er million pounds in the full year and there should be more to come because now we're at the end of our er capital spend on newspapers er the newspapers will of course become very substantial cash generators
we look at the er profit of the newspapers individually
of course it was a very difficult year for the financial times
ad sales were down fourteen percent er but we er we increased our market share and in fact our market share was the best since nineteen eighty six er when the f t was the market leader
circulation was down four percent but overseas we increased our circulation by five percent and again in the u k in newspaper sales we held our market share
er profile did very well increasing sales by twelve percent last year and following the deal with UNK er sales moving well ahead again this year
er les echo had problems on the medical side partly government regulation partly the market and we've UNK er two medical divisions into one and that should give us er give us some cost saving there
the newspaper circulation was up three percent to a new record at one hundred and twelve thousand seven hundred and that was a very good performance
ad volume was down erm but not as much as in the u k
the UNK had a tremendous year erm really UNK the trend and contributing about five million pounds to er f t's er associates profits
the circulation was a new record and four hundred and eighty five thousand nine hundred by year end and it just seems to go from strength to strength
er we UNK our sharing expense on the er sp spanish financial daily er with cash for a twenty five percent stake in the group and er one of the things this er does is to give us a stake in UNK which is the second biggest newspaper in spain and incidentally has the same social and economic profile as el the times of spain er and it's a sport paper which sells seven days a week two hundred and thirty four thousand circulation and its nearer nearest competitor sells one fifty thousand
it's a very big cash generator for the very high cover price and that should benefit from this year's UNK
expansion itself went up erm circulation by twenty three er percent last year and ad sales were up fourteen percent
westminster press had a very difficult year
ad volume was down er three point four percent overall
nearly all of that was in UNK where erm the volume was down about er eleven point eight nearly twelve percent and er revenue down by eight point three percent
situations vacant in particular showed a very a very big drop and erm and in fact we the yield was lower than the year before but we've er continued with our UNK press UNK programme and er i think as i mentioned at the UNK the UNK evening echo is now printed on the f t's UNK which incidentally has got the contract to and is printing er
erm but w p continued to er hang on to its market leadership in virtually every centre and erm despite the difficult year managed to launch er several new titles
er if we turn to the revenue split i think this UNK the recession er and you'll notice that there's a much UNK lesser proportion of revenue coming from advertising
er they're overall figures but for instance the f t which er the year before seventy five percent of its revenue came from advertising and er in ninety one it was down to seventy percent
if we go on to books erm i think that longman performance is exceptionally good erm of course for book business it's very much first half second half most of the profit coming in second half but er erm longman only dropping seven percent on the year before seems to me a particularly good performance given the environment and in fact it generated more operating cash flow than the year before
it did very well with english language teaching sales er in europe and UNK as planned and its medical and professional sponsored UNK erm business in japan grew much quicker than we expected
but education in the u k and canada was very tough indeed
UNK which is the u k leading er business book UNK increased sales by sixteen percent and UNK after the er reorganization is doing rather well and the first book we've published on the new spanish educational curriculum is forty percent ahead of er budget
UNK addison wesley was er one of our stars this year
er a fourth year of record profits record er sales record margin with the schools business thirty seven percent ahead of the previous year with our successful maths programme UNK and UNK by er the business that produces the UNK to go with the maths programme
the college market in the u s a was the UNK for decades but our college sales were up ten percent
internationally we're up thirteen percent and in the europe and europe and pacific twenty percent
and on the er general book front the erm iron john was on the new york times best sellers list for fifty one weeks and twelve of those at number one
i'll deal with penguin separately
federal and capital we er is a small business er but highly profitable and er it's a subscription business so that the cash comes in advance and er the er the only criticism i have of federal and capital is that it's it would be nice if it was five times bigger than it is
but we're working on that
looking at penguin er it was a very difficult year but the profit you see was erm is after providing for the losses up to the date we UNK of smith mark and also making further provision on er UNK when we moved out of the other buildings UNK the UNK and er administrative functions into one office and but for that you would see that the er the penguin profit would have moved ahead from the year before
erm some of you are very critical of the penguin operation when you were in the u s a but i have to tell you they did achieve record sales there last year and increased market share and in fact the children's er book publishing was twenty percent ahead of the year before
in the u k the improvement plans we've been working on for the last two years have been very successfully implemented but they've been UNK by the u k recession
in the u s a we've appointed john president and so we've got the structure that we wanted with peter as chairman at the top and concentrating on er on publishing as he ought to one of the great UNK of the world dealing with the authors dealing with the agents and dealing with the UNK staff
with a managing director in u k trevor and a managing director president in the u s a john and er john had a very good start and we're sure this will be an improved er UNK from our business
turning to turning to entertainment and media investments er it was a very tough year for the UNK group and starting with the er gulf war er and erm the only UNK business that does a lot of business in the first quarter is erm UNK road and you may remember that the gulf war caused foreign tourists to stop coming to london and er also erm british tourists stopped coming to london and during that time attendances were actually twenty five percent down so the recovery from there is has been very good
our highlight was the opening of UNK our dutch exhibition which opened in mid year and that's well ahead of budget and by year end we'd had six hundred thousand admissions through the UNK
alton er did well er to restrict attendances to a five percent drop
i should remind you of course that we have the usual three million black hole alton this year the first quarter
at UNK attendances pretty well stood still again a very good performance in my view and er justification for the capital spending that's gone on in recent years to bring that er to bring UNK to where we want it to be
UNK too had a very good performance and er and maintained its er attendances
er turning to the media investments well we all tend to think that the er the bids tended to be on the high side but er at least yorkshire got the licence for the next ten years and they have the option in ninety eight to go for a further ten years and i can tell you er because i've had er lots of conversations with UNK that they're really working on making the best improving their returns from that franchise and i'm quite sure they'll succeed
UNK as you know we sold er during the year or sorry when the year ended this year
turning to er camco our old services campaign again that er i think that was a very good performance er sales were ahead of last year trading profit ahead of last year and they even proved improved the margin very slightly and that's our second star of the year
erm products and services did very well internationally in fact the entire business did well internationally generally particularly in UNK and by year end the er joint venture in russia was er was complete and ready to start
we also did a very important er technology transfer to UNK which er UNK pump neck technology and that's tended to erm hide a slight UNK er decline in the last quarter of the year normally in oil most of the profit or more of the profit comes in the second half than the first but with the gulf war last year oil prices were pretty firm and er so we've made er quite reasonable profits in the in the er first half and so too in the second half but in the last quarter they've been showed up by that technology er transfer and the er u s oil price is er is er UNK the u k's is UNK the u s is UNK in oil and the gas prices are very far down they're well down
turning to investment banking and i should just remind you that er we take fifty percent of UNK profits and ten percent of new york and paris and given the conditions given the environment last year i don't think need be ashamed of the performance er although in london the only business to really come in come in with impressive returns was er asset trading money UNK and banking
there was erm a great reduction in corporate activity but corporate finance kept very busy er with their value services and money raising and er we were responsible for the national power UNK and the disposal of UNK
in paris er were top of the m a league but the volume was well down on the record nineteen ninety
new york too did well advising on thirty seven acquisitions er thirty seven transactions including acquisition of UNK and acquisition of the max factor division of UNK
on fine china erm although profits were down royal UNK did manage a margin of eight point five percent and here again improved the cash flow on nineteen ninety
and they continued to develop their distribution and retail network and now over half of our sales are overseas and er we developed our direct mail and our chain store business er even though demand was down
in fact we made most of our profits or a lot of our profits last year by erm sheer volume and a decline in yield
erm a bigger sale of the smaller price it of the lesser priced items
i mentioned earlier that we closed the erm royal UNK factory and four other factories are on short time but we continued to invest in operation efficiency to improve our competitive position and er now over to er to james
james
good morning everyone
well as you can see from what frank said the six main sectors overall didn't fare too badly sixteen percent drop in UNK at the trading level and in fact er our other interest less expenses were actually ended on eleven percent because we had a million pounds more profit from UNK when we sold the UNK site
however the damage was done at the UNK line which simply reflects the fact that we had er UNK in for two and a half months in nineteen ninety one as opposed to twelve months the year before
so trading profits down twenty four percent and although the interest charge was down er quite UNK largely of course as a reduction in net depth through the UNK sale profits before tax ended up as you heard before twenty three percent lower
if we go from that to the earnings there's another erm er slide to take us through that
i think the most interesting point here is the tax charge which is two percentage points down on the year before and that really is prior year adjustments there are other pluses and UNK but that's a significant reason
extraordinary profits you may be surprised to see are only twelve point nine million after the UNK sale but that is a function of the write back of good will on the disposal of UNK which you will see explained in the preliminary statement thus reducing the er profit from two hundred and twenty nine million which was the estimate at the interim to thirty five million for the year as a whole
we did that in the with the erm urgent issues task force new standard on good will
we had to do it cos i'm a member of the task force
i mean i'd be sacked otherwise
so earnings after UNK up fifty four percent er even so
now the profits the profits you've seen where the profits came down let's look at it another way and that is really to see er the impact per the year before
fifty three million down in profits overall
foreign exchange worked to our advantage this year the dollar was at one seventy two on average
er we had obviously no help from acquisitions because of the UNK effect less interest
our exceptional items were rather heavier in nineteen ninety one you won't be surprised after what you heard from frank about the er number reductions
we had redundancy cost we had lease provision and one or two other items
so the underlying performance in fact accounted for only forty million out of the fifty three million reduction in profits
now again we need to distribute the underlying performance because it wasn't equally distributed between the various sectors
now clearly the two major er UNK there were the newspapers and investment banking and that reflects their operational UNK and the sharp decline in revenue you are well aware of
the two pluses are books thanks largely to addison wesley UNK so and the oil services business and the only other item worth reflecting i think worth er UNK on is in fact that if you take out the black hole effect er the entertainment fall was only two million and i think that is a UNK performance
so if we now leave profits and go to cash
er the cash flow is slightly UNK and to we've split it into two slides
you can see er at the top of course the profits were down but nonetheless er i think quite UNK we have higher operational cash flow and i'll go into a little detail of that later
er a sharp fall in the interest tax and dividends line led to the forty five million UNK at what we regard the crucial measure net funds from operation
this tells you whether you're generating money for shareholders or where they consume you
if we look at the next slide you'll then see er the change from net funds from operations plus eighteen million down to the various large reduction in UNK you're already aware of and of course the erm UNK less acquisitions as it should read for ninety one er stands out there
we spent only really modest amounts apart from there was a small further investment in b sky b nothing else worth recording
so UNK in a net debt of three hundred and twenty million and i think we will look again now at the net funds from operation and look at the analysis a little further
trading profit less potential was only down twenty five million because of course a good slice of the reduction in trading profits came from er associates mainly UNK which is rather UNK in UNK
the working capital UNK was controlled and was only er sixteen million more working capital which is considerably better than the year before and then finally you had the er improvement in the capital expenditure
capital expenditure less UNK is eighteen million better that's of course a function of two er elements
the reduction in the and the persistent rise the UNK charge which is going over the last four years as we maintain a high level of capital spending
improvement in operating cash flow was then UNK by er the financing line and that really is UNK er a reduction in tax paid function of the lower profits than previous years and of course the impact of consortium relief in b sky b
net change forty five million pounds and that we regard as one of the most satisfying outcomes for the year
now UNK also UNK of course UNK on the balance sheet as the next slide will show us
UNK net trading assets are virtually unchanged between the two years
this is obviously a coincidence since it's a function of so many different things including exchange effects
however the balance between debt and equity is remarkably changed
you'll have the sharp improvement in UNK funds resulting from the write back of good will on the UNK disposal and the UNK reduction in net UNK from four hundred and five to a hundred and eighteen million
now net debt of the hundred and eighteen million is of course er a balance of two items
we have our debt itself the gross debt which came down about a hundred and twenty million and that is all set by a substantially increased cash balance
the cash is UNK held in sterling
we need a hundred million of it to er pay back UNK bond that UNK in may and by the same reason the final column shows that the balance of our debt between fixed and floating er will change other things being equal on the pro UNK basis
at the moment or at the year end of our variable debt commercial paper in the united states a very cheap form of debt formed the overwhelming proportion
our fixed debt is accounted for by our quoted sterling bonds and er the balance of a medium tone note programme which we have outstanding in the united states
on the pro UNK basis our hopes which of course not yet been born out that interest rates will be declining er will give us some advantage by the year end as a number of UNK and UNK which we put in place during nineteen ninety one UNK
now balance sheet with the lower debt and UNK cash flow of course impacts on financial ratios and i think that this is the best measure of how we come through nineteen ninety one rather than the profits
the dividend cover is not wonderful but it's perfectly UNK adequate as michael said at the beginning
interest cover was already strong and is now at nearly ten times UNK er a very healthy level and whether or not you add back the good will on other er acquisitions i dare say the ratio is at a very low level indeed
clearly we have plenty of powder and it's dry
thank you
er we are going to be joined er for questions by david who is er the chairman of camco and the u the pearson executive director resident in the u s
michael who is er c e o group and hugh who is c e o of westminster press er financial newspapers
when you er ask a question first time could you could you say your name and the organization that you represent
could i have the first question please
it's mark from the daily telegraph
can i just ask you if your position on the daily mirror is still that you're not at all interested in it or is there a prospect that you may change your mind when you've seen the figures from the mirror
er we had a good look at the figures although they weren't totally UNK we had a pretty good understanding of the situation and i think it is highly unlikely that we would er seek to re open any negotiations
er UNK from the independent
just a supplementary on that
this er your comment that you had a good look at the figures severely confused the merchant bankers who are advising the mirror group as they didn't feel that they'd UNK the figures themselves
so did you have a mole inside the mirror group
er james would you like to answer that question
well i'm not a mole
no i think that we had a fairly clear idea certainly on the pension fund we've not obviously got accurate numbers a clear idea of the broad er shape of the problems and erm that allowed us without having to wait for very accurate figures to draw the conclusions about the scale of the problem the amount of investment we'd like to we need to make and thus erm whether or not it was of interest to pursue
you didn't need to have a long form report in front of you i think to draw the conclusion
er richard from the UNK
can i just ask you to be slightly more specific on your first answer
does that mean you're not actually interested in any parts of the mirror group
i refer particularly also to the daily record and the sunday mail in scotland
er i'll be more i'll be clearer
er we are not interested in any parts of the mirror group
er UNK financial times
companies with as strong a balance sheet as yours have been known to seek acquisitions er in the midst of a very deep recession
why have you not done so
er there are a couple of factors there
one is that we do make acquisitions we on the whole er prefer er organic growth because it is normally more profitable and the prices you have to pay for acquisitions er tend to put significant premiums on the companies you buy which you may er in the longer run eventually erm er turn into UNK value
but er any acquisition has to fit extremely well UNK and it has to be at a price that we consider to be a good price
now so far er the acquisitions that have come onto the market haven't really reflected er the trading conditions in which all companies in this country have been operating for the last eighteen months
in oth other words there haven't been particularly good value acquisitions that are UNK suitable for us
it doesn't mean to say that we are not on the alert and on the look out and er i think those opportunities erm er will still occur and that er we will be involved
now there's one other element that's worth mentioning
erm it is perhaps only in the last er six months or so that the erm UNK in the UNK of erm er b sky b have been acknowledged and er i think there has been an element in our thinking that we wanted to keep our dry er until such time as er b sky b which we have great belief and faith in and our as you know we increased our investment during the year erm sees its way through to profitability and i'm happy to say that that's happening now at a UNK reasonable rate and that means that it is highly unlikely that the hundred and thirty million of guarantees that we still have outstanding to b sky b are likely to be called
so we're in a pretty strong position to make acquisitions if they appear at the right price and they fit our strategic framework
sorry that was rather a long answer
yes sir
william daily mail
erm you a lot of people now talk as though it's erm plain sailing or flying for b sky b and it's gonna be er UNK whereas anglia television have just written their stake down to a UNK amount because they don't think it's gonna make stand a chance of making a profit before the turn of the UNK
do you think they're being too UNK and do you think certain other people are being too UNK
i think that the reasons people have written down their erm er UNK in b sky b have varied
er sometimes it's for tax reasons sometimes it's for er for erm er reasons such as last year when er we wrote down our stake by some seventy one million erm it was because at that point the financing for b sky b was not yet er at all clear because the shareholders had been unable to agree at that point erm that they would guarantee the two hundred or so million that er needed to go in before the er project became successful and so there was a genuine doubt on the financing
er i don't know if james again you might like to comment
we'll keep frank in reserve he's a chairman at b sky b
er i think er frank will correct me if we're closer to the to the sharp edge than anglia who have got a very small stake and only in the equity of b s b h are coming very low in the UNK order to get their money whereas er where there is a whole complex er schedule of who will participate in the er substantial cash flow that we expect to UNK from b sky b in due course but i think that's the main reason why anglia i haven't talked to david
frank do you talk
well i mean it's definitely tax driven
i mean erm anglia talked er talked to me anyway as chairman of b sky b erm before they before they did the write off and it's just tax driven
so you're right at the head of the UNK order
pardon
you're right at the head of the UNK order when the cash generation starts you'll be first in line
er we will but the UNK order er the UNK order is the subject of agreement and it's public
er but i mean clearly the debt and the guarantees are paid down first and so for the reason we are high up in the UNK order because we provided the er the loans and the guarantees
yes
following that up when can your long suffering shareholders er expect to see any return on the b sky b stake and a follow up on that
now you've got sixteen percent and you're the chairman when shouldn't you equity account it
well i'm not certain our shareholders are long suffering
erm in fact i think the UNK has er has been remarkably quick and remember we saved our shareholders from having to write the lot off
so i wouldn't accept your description justified
mick
mm
take issue beyond that
sorry what was the second part of the question
well the first part of the question was when will they start seeing a return back on that money and secondly when shouldn't you equity account it
well er equity accounting james is better placed to answer that question than me
erm i'd be very surprised if cash if b sky b doesn't start to trade at a profit overall in erm in the second half of ninety three
and thereafter cash can flow out because the first thing that flows out are loans and guarantees
so we're quite close to getting cash back from b sky b
sorry can i get it absolutely clear
i didn't fully understand that
are you actually saying er money will actually be raised in addition to the financing charges in the second half of ninety three
no i'm talking about profit from the from the business
money from the business
just to clear another point up
last autumn it was stated in a document that there would have to be further subscriptions of finance before er the project became profitable
are you now saying that's no longer necessary
that is the two hundred million that i was referring to er earlier wasn't in place at the time that we made our write there
so that was all the remark applied to
well yes but that remember we provided for up to two hundred million which we thought would see us through to the end of ninety two
now it looks as if not all of that will be called but we can't be sure at this stage
but it looks as if it may not all be called
should i just comment on the assessing the equity accounting point
er the present situation is that there's complex erm arrangements for the exercise of votes basically UNK is required and in those circumstances we as a UNK cannot exercise material influence which is a necessary pre condition for equity accounting
ourselves
roger from the guardian
erm can we er two separate questions
one is going back to the issue of acquisitions erm where are you most interested both geographically and er as far as your operation is concerned where are you most interested in making acquisitions
er and a completely separate question now entertainment er could you just tell us a bit more about what's happening at alton towers and also how you think it's gonna be affected by UNK
yes er well i think we might i'll answer the second question but we'll answer the first question but we'll ask michael who's right here to comment on entertainment
in fact today this afternoon we're launching a whole new area at alton towers which is additional to anything before erm frank referred to it briefly there's a UNK so called UNK train ride there's a ghost house and that's all part of a new complex which we've got longer term plans to expand further
er that's costing something up to ten million pounds approximately
so we have erm underlying confidence in the long term future of alton towers i think that's very important to state
as far as UNK is concerned i personally welcome its establishment in france
i think that it is going to have a good effect on improving trading for the better parks and attractions in this country and as you know i think alton towers is the leading er park of its kind in this country UNK which we also own is the second er leading park one and a half million visitors a year alton towers approximately two million visitors a year in this country
both offering excellent value for money
the point i think that has to be understood about UNK which perhaps hasn't been properly perceived yet by the public is that it is very much a destination for the british public
it is not a place you can just go to for the day and therefore you need to spend at least a couple of days getting there overnight coming back again and er for a family of four i calculate that even taking one's own car across the channel the average cost for a family of four is of the order of five or six hundred pounds
i don't see how you can do it cheaper for that
don't forget to get into UNK is twenty five pounds which is more than double what we're charging at alton towers for example
er the comparable cost for a family of four in this country to go to somewhere like alton towers or to UNK in your own car including the cost of petrol of getting there is of the order of fifty or sixty pounds at the outside
in other words only ten percent of the total costs of going to UNK
therefore the one is a destination which you'll probably find you'd prefer to go to for a long weekend or perhaps a part of your annual holiday etcetera our parks are places you go to for a day out and i think therefore there is a very er strong difference between the sort of visit and because i feel that UNK which will undoubtedly will be good it's a proven formula er it's run well er it appeals to a lot of people and therefore it will be i think er successful exactly how successful i obviously can't say but it will be successful it will certainly attract british visitors but they'll come back looking er with certain higher expectation a value for money quality etcetera
and we believe we already offer that i think the figures indicate that and therefore in the medium and the longer term i believe that our attractions will undoubtedly benefit and i would finally say that if you er go back and look at the history of UNK in america after the establishment of UNK parks in america there was a big improvement in extension of the UNK parks in the rest of america which er the traditional theme parks so called in america grew in the period after the establishment of UNK land in california and i think a similar sort of thing is going to happen not perhaps just in this country er but also in europe generally
in certain locations there are clearly planning problems environmental problems that sort of thing in establishing parks but i believe er and i know a lot other people in the leisure business believe that there will be a growth
but the ones that'll gain will be the quality ones offering the best value for money and as you know pearson believes in quality and certainly value for money and therefore i believe we will benefit from that
thank you michael
on acquisitions well running through the group the best of banking er strategies to remain non capital intensive and strongly cash UNK er know you know we've had a twenty million investment erm a er a UNK er house we're extending our networks
we're not er we're not the best thing about money and i wouldn't see that happening in the future
on fine china we're already the largest fine china fine bone china manufacturer in the world
we might make the odd selective acquisition but not vast amounts of money going on acquisitions there either
in oil services in the future there could be further major acquisitions but er over the past three years we've er undertaken a whole series of acquisitions and er and for the moment i wouldn't see anything er in the in the major line there although you never know if some even sometimes opportunities you aren't capable of creating erm er because the er situation is not right er do occur and i wouldn't rule it out but erm er we haven't erm any major acquisition er on the carpet there at the moment
erm on entertainment we're spending a lot of money on organic growth and have done over the past two or three years and er it's very well spent but again we're growing our businesses erm er rather than UNK them
alton towers clearly is an exception but again you have to pay a lot of money for it and it takes quite some time to get the return er back and i would say that erm many of UNK erm er organic erm er expenditure will erm provide er a really good return rather quicker but in the long run we think alton is good
erm now that leaves us with er really the er the publishing the educational publishing er the newspapers magazines electronic publishing in all those areas we're active and on the UNK
we certainly if you look at the breakdown of our sales er we only sell about a hundred and fifty er million pounds worth er of goods and services in UNK pacific erm we would certainly like to make acquisitions in that area just as we did in north america er in the seventies and eighties and we have now small pearson er office for instance in UNK it's quite slow erm er in that area but certainly we're on the UNK for acquisitions in UNK pacific
in all of those publishing areas that you've mentioned newspapers books electronic
yes
karen from news australia
would that include taking a stake in the er the UNK float when erm that takes place later this year
erm we really er like to be in a position of control in any of the acquisitions er that we make er where we are associates rather than having a hundred percent or a least erm over fifty
it is because for strategic reasons we've very want to make the investment there's no other way of doing it
erm to cut a long story short if a attractive UNK erm individual enterprise came up we would be far more interested than taking a stake that was a just an investment
er the chances of it coming up seem to me highly unlikely
clearly if it did we'd be interested
is your cost er programme effectively complete er or are we gonna be seeing more substantial redundancies this year
well we've got our cost reductions as an ongoing process er so it's never complete you're always looking for ways to become more efficient or effective but i don't anticipate any redundancies er any further redundancies but obviously if systems become available which improve our efficiency and effectiveness we have to take account of it
what effect would a labour government have on in the u k on UNK businesses
well there's been quite a lot of chat recently that erm because of cross media ownership erm companies that are involved in cross media ownership would have problems
i think that it is difficult to see under any clear UNK of government that our present UNK er in newspapers which are mainly the financial times which has a small erm comparatively small circulation for a national newspaper and less than twenty percent in a television company would be affected by any government
er whether they a different government would UNK erm against people having more than a twenty percent stake in er b sky b for instance remains to be seen
it must be quite possible which might mean that there will be some more shares er available there but er that is complete speculation
erm i don't think that er in structural terms therefore a change of government would er make a great deal a difference then you come to er the general effect of a change of government er i think at the moment we're living in a situation of uncertainty and er a clear majority erm for any party would probably from a business point of view erm remove the uncertain short term
i think the view you take of the longer term erm er becomes individual and speculative er as once again you've got to erm er come to conclusions about inflation about encouragement to the economy and er you can read in many a good newspaper erm their views on that
thanks er did the provision for er properties like penguin and four and a half million for the year did all of that come in the second half because it's UNK that penguin is ahead something like what thirty two percent second half on second half
so if that four and a half million was all incurred in the second half its underlying growth rate was something like sixty percent
er were there any sort of UNK there in the second half period
well penguin always makes er most of its profits in the second half but james would you like to answer
it's more in the second half
my colleague mr who is closer to the ground reminds me that i think there was a small provision in the first half
but we then took a view about future years because in a sense we've always been obviously had to provide for the er year impression
discretion now taking a much more realistic view about the new york property market which is office market which is as UNK if not UNK than erm than london and say that we ain't gonna UNK these we're not gonna sub let these properties let's take let's take a hit let's clean it out now
and that was that element was in the second half
sorry would there be any exceptional stock provisions that were released made in the first half released into the second half for example
so you talked about
penguin
yes cos you talked about
no don't make no
that wouldn't be the case no
are you er going to have an extraordinary profit from the sale of the stake in UNK
small loss
small loss
er hugh would you haven't had a chance to say anything
would you like to er make any comments on er how a change of government might effect the westminster press
well i think it erm very i mean i think as you said chairman if erm there's a clear majority for one party it'll UNK a whole lot of delay and decision making which i think is going on and i think that should be helpful
i suppose the only problem is if there's er gonna be another general election shortly after the one we're about to have that'll just er create a bit more uncertainty for a bit longer i'm afraid
er right
robert of robert UNK
i noticed one of the sunday papers had a little bit of a dig on you on strategy over the weekend
perhaps er you'd just like to remind us erm what your strategy is and no doubt how unfair you felt that comment was
well our strategy is to be a concentrated UNK
in other words sticking to those sectors that we know and understand and which we chose for the nineties because we believe they had good growth prospects
er we built on those sectors during the er past year with the initial uncertainty on the b sky b situation er we have been managing erm our way through the recession you've heard from frank er about the er immediate short term measures we've taken
er but in the long run we're on the UNK to continue to build both UNK and by acquisition where appropriate er on the main sectors
and you've all heard the theme of quality which runs throughout our strategic picking
sorry eric er there was something put up there beyond your at first
yes james
erm james put a slide up about accept included a figure of erm eight million for UNK
i wonder if you could just explain the consistent parts of that figure
the eight million on UNK james would you
that is the change in UNK compared with nineteen ninety
it isn't the total charge
and it comprises er redundancy provisions er costs on UNK er acquisitions or erm consulting projects er lease provisions in penguin and other odds and UNK
i think we're talking at cross purposes
i think the slide that frank was referring to was the total charge for the year
the eight million is the difference in the exceptional charge for ninety one compared with nineteen ninety
that was a various analysis
er eric
can i
you indicated that there's no sign of any er improvement in your main markets er but looking for er optimistic er calculations could you give us any indications of the er the benefits of the er non recurrence of the gulf war in the first half
well the non recurrence of gulf war in the first half is pretty well balanced by the recession that is taking place at the moment and is er showing as we all know little signs of lifting
i think a change in the political direct and when say it i don't mean a change i mean a erm the outcome of the solution erm to the present uncertainty i think er will be greatly helpful er once the election is over in the u k
er but it is it's very it's very early days er as we all know
you showed us a slide with net savings for nineteen ninety two of twenty million
can you actually just take us through those er on one of you slides you had a thing net savings
er the net savings on redundancies of twenty million pounds
are they only redundancies or is it just a net saving
oh the net savings altogether
frank will now take us through the net savings of twenty million on redundancies
you've done it once
yeah
well the twenty million obviously just comes er in prop well not in proportion because the salary levels differ but in proportion to the numbers er made redundant in the individual companies
it's quite difficult to get at erm the other all the other costs because they're a UNK of tiny things
i mean the big ones erm obviously are the erm savings of the u s a on UNK and freight er but then there's lots and lots of things for instance the one i mentioned at UNK two hundred and fifty thousand and so in all of our businesses you know those many small items
is this a combination of the impact of the redundancies plus all these other not just redundancies
yes
can i pick up on your comment you do not see any UNK in any of your major markets
advertising revenue seems to be there seems to be sometimes that there is some slight pick up the advertising associations UNK a pick up there one or two companies who have been reporting have been talking about a little UNK in the first quarter of this year
did you don't see any
does that mean that they are wrong or you're losing market share
er it doesn't mean that we're wrong there are some categories of advertising er that are showing slight signs and others that are not
er frank would you like to comment
i'd actually i think the problem is that you get the odd week er and even the odd month where things look better erm but overall then it slips again and er overall erm the end of february there's no sign that volume is increasing from the previous year
erm and that's in the f t and that's in w p and the odd category will move
and i talked to other UNK erm including a very large one which will be UNK and they have a pretty good spread and their experience was the same as ours
so erm i don't think there's any signs of advertising here
and on the on the on the television front again erm there isn't a great deal on the television front and there's quite a bit of UNK going on but erm there isn't a great deal of UNK
b sky b is ahead of last year but i mean that's a growing business you would expect it to be
no advertising is still down
it's still it's been in the first two months it's been going down on last year in volume terms
we have hugh here er hugh any sign of us losing market share
no sign of our newspapers losing market share no
i think the i mean the huge drop that we had in situations vacant advertising in ninety nineteen ninety one when we fell from i mean our job advertising was about twenty million pounds in nineteen ninety and was down to about eleven million in ninety one
but erm the position at the moment is that i mean the situation doesn't seem to be getting any worse
erm and there are there are some signs of erm odd categories of advertising being slightly up but they are need to be counter balanced by others which are down too
it's really very hard to detect any trend
your share price seemed to take a bit of a knock the other day when roy made some comments about referring media UNK to the UNK and UNK commission
firstly would you see any problem with that under a led government directly and secondly if UNK were forced to sell off either some of his stake in b sky b or some of his newspaper interests er what would be your attitude to er buying
er i don't think that er we would be likely to have a problem in selling down
we only have sixteen percent of b sky b and we have one national newspaper the financial times which although influential is relatively small circulation
i don't see erm a government of any UNK being likely to insist er on our going down er below twenty percent er in television
so i don't i don't personally see that as a direct threat at all and i think that also our er our newspapers don't have any particular political bias of any sort i think they treat each issue on its merits
so i don't see from UNK point of view that a government of any UNK will alter what we can and er or can't do in relation to our current er UNK
er if any UNK in b sky b er was selling shares we would obviously consider er whether we went up from our present sixteen percent er to twenty percent but it would depend on the circumstances at the time
derek
could you comment briefly on addison wesley and the pattern of the major programmes in that business and er what the outlook is for the current year
the pattern of trading at addison wesley and the prospects for the current year er frank
well the prospects for the er current year are still good
erm i mean i really can't i don't expect them to UNK ahead as they did last year but all the signs are that they're doing very well and er it's a very well managed business erm great cost control er i don't know whether you noticed recently that UNK des described the erm the management of erm of a w as the er i think it was the UNK de la UNK of the
class act of the industry
class act of the industry
so it's a very well managed business
the pattern is very much first half er erm loss or small profit second half all the profit and in fact you should watch out for the bigger the bigger addison wesley gets the more the loss in the second half will be because we're investing for that sale
in the first half
in the first half
they're investing in the first half in that second half
so the chances are it will UNK more than anything else
er and we have a very strong college front list er which we would hope would er would make a contribution again this year more of a contribution
er david resident in america
would you like to make any general comments on the u s
on the u s as a whole or on
well in relation perhaps to addison wesley
well i think that the erm the as frank has said they have a strong college list for this year the school business should be they can't repeat the maths programme success of last year although there is follow up business in other states
so there's strong UNK with what they've got and they are in the right areas of the market
erm could i ask er a little about er longman and er and er penguin in nineteen ninety two and particularly in the case of longman is the momentum of profits improvement in the second half carrying through into nineteen ninety two
longman and penguin in ninety two
er what do we say about that
longman have made a very good start to the year and erm and so they've progressed from day one making last year i expect to continue
erm and penguin u s again have er made a good start and the one area david can talk about this better than i but the one area that er where there is an UNK in business activity and mo promise have come into the u s a
so you know we expect erm penguin and a w er penguin u s certainly to go on and longman to carry on as they are improving
david do you want to say anything about the u s
no i think erm in the certainly in the consumer area which affects both penguin and to some extent royal UNK there are definite signs now of the u s economy turning around and that is likely to continue as the year goes on
and certainly trade book publishing did not do at all badly in nineteen ninety one in a UNK environment and erm there are as frank has mentioned particularly within penguin quite a lot of internal restructuring has gone on and one would hope that margins would improve over the next few years as a result of that
while we're on the u s could you say on the oil services er how much of the er good performances do you pumps turning round and again what are the prospects of that division for the current year
well erm can everybody hear the questions or is it bet helpful to repeat
it is helpful to repeat
er to what extent er was the er was the performance of camco erm er dependent on a good performance from
well i'd like to qualify your question if i may put words into your mouth
i think in fact er had been doing quite well and the specific point that frank was referring to was erm the technology transfer that they did with a mar large chip manufacturer which probably made a contribution in the second half a net contribution of about five million dollars and that offset some of the weakness in other parts of UNK business in the last quarter of the year
and that er technology transfer covers UNK pump technology which will be the standard pump line and the UNK will have a non exclusive erm li er licence to sell it in the soviet union which is a prime market er and in other areas behind the old iron curtain
and that's an arrangement which will be carrying on over the next few years
could you tell us please how much we spent on ghost house and UNK train and what you expect it to bring in rewards this year
how much we spent on ghost house and UNK train er and how much er profit we'll bring in this year
er michael
the erm total figure will end up it isn't all completely spent yet but it'll end up er something between eight and ten million pounds
it's impossible to judge exactly how many people will come in as a result of that and er how much expenditure will be incurred because as you know we're in a UNK period and as you've already heard there is concern about current trading but i would hope that it would bring in er something like a hundred and fifty thousand extra people certainly in a good year i'd expect more than that but really that's about as much as i'm prepared to say with some additional spending which will be incurred at alton towers
but obviously in a UNK period which we are certainly not out of yet you have to remember that alton towers has a per cap of something like fourteen pounds a head at the moment er average of all people
and therefore in a UNK period when pressure is on people spending er that sort of figure is under tremendous pressure
erm a comment on b sky b and contribution
i mean will there be any contribution by way of UNK loan guarantees over the forecast over the next two forecast years or i mean my understanding was that there was a guarantee fee that erm was still owed this year
b sky b and its contribution erm to pearson
frank
well i mean we don't we don't intend to equity account b sky b for the present time anyway
er obviously the guarantee fees are a UNK obligation of b sky b and er so we er we pearson are entitled to those and i mean obviously as b sky b becomes cash UNK and erm then cash will flow into pearson and i th you know the schedule erm and in that in that way
james would you
james just said that we haven't taken any guarantee fees into this year's profit er nor any interest on loan stocks
that's something that we obviously would consider next this time next year in the light of the performance and prospects and clearly on advice from those on the board
but as the business continues to do better as they're already doing rather well er that becomes an issue
two completely different questions
can you just tell us what you've done to your entrance pricing for your various entertainment centres and also can you tell us why the canadian UNK almost doubled in the year
i couldn't hear the second question myself
your erm on your allocation of geographical profits er UNK profits have almost doubled in the year
two totally separate questions the first relating to entrance pricing at our entertainment businesses and we'll deal with that first
michael
the erm entrance price increases generally have been in line or slightly above inflation
we normally aim and have achieved very successfully in recent years real price increases above inflation
last year you'll remember we had to absorb in fact in the UNK group about three quarters of a million er pounds on the increase in v a t and that was a blow to us at the beginning of the season you remember it was the budget more or less this time last year
er this year hopefully er with pressure again as i said earlier but nevertheless we are hoping and having er put in our new price increases for the season which is more or less beginning now
i hope everybody understands er alton towers is launching its new things today UNK opened this weekend so we haven't been trading until this weekend in effect in our parks business
london of course and our amsterdam exhibition has been trading since the beginning of the year and the price increase is generally coming at the beginning of the season which is more or less now for the parks earlier for the exhibitions
and the separate question related to trading profits erm in canada
why have they gone from eight million to fifteen million
er james
the er combination of things
first of all during the course of the year our holding in the canadian financial post reduced therefore we took in less losses from that business
secondly penguin canada returned the profits
thirdly both camco and addison wesley had very good years in that territory
further questions
sorry can i ask another one
er on your erm west UNK er receipt and profits i think this is the last er the last year erm can you give us an indication of er thought that you might have of filling the hole er in nineteen ninety three when you cease to
er the major contribution from one transaction in relation to west UNK er which will be coming to an end er james would you like to comment on that
well you're absolutely right eric it does come to an end
er to what extent the UNK er filled i don't think it can be wholly filled as a function of the recovery in er the market for land
you know we have a considerable holding of er land immediately adjacent to the reasonable shopping centre there and erm if and when things become UNK again and i went down there a couple of weeks and i was rather impressed by the look of the area then clearly land prices go up and we have the capacity to generate more profit
but i think it would be UNK to think that we can maintain our profits from land in ninety three at the same level as it had been for ninety one and two
that was the final question
well yes we have a final question
tony from
you say if all your loans to b sky b were performing and you UNK them erm what your income would be
if we UNK
if you if all your loans to b sky b were performing and you took credit for them what would the contribution be
ah
er james
you mean if we took the interest from guarantee fees
yeah
you got an answer for that
a useful few million
an exciting shot
it's like all good things to come i don't like to count my chickens so i'd rather not the little UNK say oh you've got another x million if only we could take them in this year
any of my colleagues have a number in their mind
fifteen
thanks charles
er we have another question
what criteria i mean will you use to determine whether or not you actually erm take those into account in determining nineteen ninety two's figures
whether and when they're gonna be paid
string that to whether james
when james not whether
well i regard the answer to whether as academic
so on happy on that happy note could we go next door and have some coffee
right okay log on to the network get into UNK call up q m four fit and say data last of the finished testing for structural change and then we'll move on to and UNK
person is it
the windows a bit
a little bit
coming straight at me
thanks very much
it's not working is that right
sometimes it gets UNK when everybody UNK the same
oh right
data file sorry but i'm using windows
oh i beg your pardon
right if you er if you get access to data erm go into the data processing environment log to the data right so log t c i m p can you remember this as textile data this is textile consumption in the u s right and we are explaining it in terms of consumer income and the relative price of textiles
what are we doing
i've got this far
right okay can you go into the just log the data okay last week we were looking at test for structural change and we said that the chow test is the most commonly used test for structural change in actual fact chow developed two tests erm the parameter UNK i e structural change fir the first one is where you remember what the principle behind the chow test that you split the whole sample into two sub periods right and you see whether the some of the res residual sum of squares from each sub sample right is significantly different from the residual sum of squares from a single UNK over the who whole sample period right if they are significantly different that suggests that the parameters that are estimated over the full er sample period right aren't as good estimates as the UNK estimates when we are allowing two different sets of parameters just to be estimated
right what we'll do is i mean we can confuse the chow test looking at the residual sum of squares er from each of these sums as the UNK on sub samples comparing them with the residual sum of squares on a UNK of the whole sample and the computer will actually do it for us
right so it's one i want to i didn't get time to do last week was to tell you where you specify that you want to perform a chow test right and the computer will generate both of both of UNK tests with one the first one is where we've got enough observations in each sub sample right to estimate the regression right however you may you may detect and figure there is some structural change right at the end of your er sample of observations or alternatively right at the beginning
now in those cases we can't use the normal chow tests we've got more parameters to estimate than we have observations right as a result chow developed a second test right from structural change where we don't need er erm to estimate essentially the regression in the sub sample which has got very few UNK observations but in that chow that chow second test is often called a test of predicted failure right UNK will calculate both of those tests and bear in mind i mean that we're spending a lot of time on er parameter UNK we must bear in mind that parameter UNK is vitally important if we are going to make these UNK possible be about policy making on the basis of our estimates
now if our estimates say for the marginal to consume or the incoming elasticity of demand right if our estimates are based on a regression in which the real or the underlying marginal UNK to consume or income elasticity demand is varying from plus four to minus two you know is our point test generate from regression analysis they are going to be completely meaningless
we want to have some degree of confidence in that er the parameters that we estimate right have remained relatively constant over our sample period
if they haven't remained constant over our UNK period right then there's no point in making our sample predictions alright we've got to have at least the confidence that our model is re relatively stable over our small sample right in order to make any sort of predictions about the behaviour of the dependent variable that we are looking at and the parameter of interest out of sample more often than not when we have parameter instability that doesn't always signal a change in government policy it often signals the fact that you've got a very poor model a model er is mis specified and so if we detect a structural change in our model we first of all try and explain why it may come about
was there a major change in government policy why was why did consumer behaviour change at this period right if we don't have any erm er justification for changing behaviour it probably means that our original model is mis specified we've got the wrong variables explaining erm the variable of interest on dependent variable
so parameter UNK is a necessary condition right for good applied UNK work if you don't have parameter UNK look at another model basically right
right so what we'll do is i'll show you how we can UNK chow tests in UNK if you come out of the data processing environment type q erm and move to the action menu i guess do that linear regression
ah yes we will yeah thanks very much
yeah well sorry if you come out of the action menu you will need to create the constant so you press the escape key erm then move back to er the process UNK edit save option
right that will take you back to the data processing menu then you then you just create a constant call it whatever you like
now once you've created a constant go into the er estimated test forecast option in the action menu right specify your equation l n t c space l n i space l n p a constant whatever you called it right then press the end key
now when it asks you for the sample statement ah done it right before it will ask you for the sample statement er over what period would you like to estimate this equation right instead of pressing the return key which gives you the default right if you specify nineteen twenty three to nineteen forty sorry just a dash between it like that nineteen twenty three space nineteen forty okay it asks you for the number of observations to be used in the structural stability tests right erm if you er press the default er if you press the return key then it should give you the maximum number available right five observations in this case right and then it will perform the regression over the entire sample period those will be the results you obtain right it will also er present chow erm test statistics
right so if you go er into squared and estimate the equation right it has actually estimated over the full sample period has it no it hasn't no alright it hasn't estimated so that's an equation estimated over the first sum first sub sample right if you press the return key again right at the bottom in the table of diagnostic tests you'll see UNK failure test right and also erm the chow test
right so there the er chow tests statistic f right is UNK first test right and er e is UNK second test which is often called UNK failure
now if you look at the test statistics there are two versions of test statistics one is an UNK version right assuming that we've got an incredibly large sample and one is the small sample that's the that's the l m version
now we've got the small sample version which is an f distribution
now what i recommend is that you always use the f version of any of these diagnostic test statistics and we can go on to look at the others erm in a moment
always use the f statistics unless there are circumstances in which you can't right if the computer doesn't generate an f statistic then you will just have to use the l m version
the reason why it's better to use the f statistic is that the f statistic has much greater power right on the small samples
both statistics are equally powerful in large samples but by and large you will always be using a small sample so use the test statistic which is designed for small sample work that's the f statistic
right what i want to do now is just hand out before you press any other keys sort of hand out some sheets on er critical values
the UNK does help by and large by computing er the probability value of it all the critical values which er are UNK significant are different from zero
ho however that won't be the case for all erm computer programs we use right as a result we will need to know how to use er t tables and tables
hopefully you are all erm familiar with these but just in case you are not right let's just er run through them
could you look at the distribution of t okay
let's just say that we are forming a t test on an estimated coefficient and we want to know whether t ratio will be generated on the computer is significantly different from zero
now let's say that we've got a sample of erm thirty observations right
now we want to know and say we generate a statistic of two point five a t ratio of two point five
is that significantly different from zero right well you just go down the right hand column in degrees of freedom until we reach thirty
actual fact degrees of freedom is n minus k
right n is the number of the sample and k is the number of parameters that you've estimated in your model
right so say that we have thirty three observations right we've got three parameters in this particular model right therefore degrees of freedom will be thirty right and we've UNK the critical values run across the rows alright
now the more certain that we want to be about a particular UNK right the smaller is the significance level
right so if we want to be er ninety percent certain about UNK that UNK with ten percent significance level and our critical value there is one point seven zero
right so if we had a test statistic greater than one point seven zero on a t ratio
one point seven zero then we could UNK the null hypothesis
right the coefficient was zero
as we increase our confidence right so if we are ninety five percent confident we are now looking at the five percent significance level t UNK er the critical value rate rises to two point zero point two and if you want to be even more confident to be ninety nine percent confident about our UNK you look at the one percent level right and that has a t ratio of two point seven five
right so if we had a t ratio of two point five right we could reject the null hypothesis of the five percent level but we wouldn't be able to reject the null hypothesis at the one percent level
this is a very common problem in er statistical UNK and th or which significance level do we choose
and there's no right and wrong answer to that
you mention the prevention of the equal user five and ten percent level right but bear in mind that the more confident you want to be about UNK i e the smaller the significance level right the lower is the power of the test
this is why we don't test at the ninety nine point nine percent confidence level because the higher you'll the smaller the probability making a type one error essentially er is significance level right the larger the probability will make a type two error right a type two error UNK the power of the test
right so normally we you know we want to be reasonably confident right so we want to have a reasonably small significance level we don't want that significance level to be too small otherwise the power of the test will UNK very rapidly so we normally use the ten or the five percent five percent level and if you just look at the er the five percent column right overall realistic sample sizes right from a hundred and twenty down to about twenty i those t ratios were the critical value they are all about two and that's why we say you can have a t ratio of about greater than two then you can be at least ninety five percent confident about your UNK
right they don't change much as a result of the degrees of freedom er adjustment okay with er squared distribution yes sort of different distribution but we interpret the tables in exactly the same way so if you just have a look on your screen erm there's an l m version of the serial correlation test right and that has a squared distribution one right and the test statistic we obtain on your screens is calculated in two point eight no two point zero eight
alright is that significantly different from zero or you could go to a pie squared tables look at the degrees of freedom which is one right
at the five percent level the critical value cup of squared is three point eight
right so if we had a test statistic greater than three point eight it would reject our null hypothesis
right in this particular case it is of no serial correlation is our null hypothesis
right so again large test statistics whether they're UNK or UNK squares
larger dis large test statistics mean UNK of the goal right erm there's no simple rule of thumb with UNK squared you just have to look at the erm actual tables to find out what the critical values are
however latest th er UNK not only gives you the test statistic but gives you erm the significance level probability value er which erm that test statistic is significantly different from zero right so if we are looking at that serial correlation test statistic of two point zero eight right we would accept the null hypothesis of er no serial correlation right or wouldn't be able to reject it strictly
wouldn't be able to reject the null of no serial correlation right until we reach fifteen percent significance level
so if our if you wanted to be eighty five percent confident about our UNK right we would reject that null UNK of no serial correlation right if we wanted to be ninety five percent confident about our UNK we would accept the null point of no serial correlation in tha in that case
okay erm if we just turn over the sheet look at distribution of er of the f statistic
in the f test we have two measures of the degrees of freedom right you need to have the degrees of freedom in the UNK n one and in UNK n two
right the degrees of freedom in the UNK just UNK the number of restrictions that you are actually making the test
right so if you look at erm the chow test at the bottom of your screens right the f test right is an f three in seventeen test
three in the UNK that we are making three restrictions to be restricting our parameters of three parameters in this particular model constant coefficient on log of prices and log of you are restricting those er at a zero when we estimate over the entire over the UNK the entire sample okay and yeah
do you have to say an n two would you round up or round down to be sure
then you just er UNK so erm if you are looking at an f one fifty test this which we've got tables here that give f one thirty and f one forty oh sorry f one forty and f one sixty just UNK so the critical value would be nought point nought five sorry four point nought five right so you just average the difference there
right so if we're erm want to compare an f statistic to see whether it's significant right you just go if it's a f three seventeen
as in this case we go down the three column the three is a in the UNK n one right till we reach seventeen right and now test to see if it's three point two right so if we
our chow test here indicates strongly that we have structural change because we've got a test statistic of twenty two right far away different from three point two our critical value
when you are actually sort of writing er say if you are when you are doing your project or doing your work it's not just sufficient to say always t ratio is greater than two therefore it's UNK significant you must calculate the er correct critical value you use right for th for each t ratio and also if you are looking at any UNK or looking at the significance of the regression which is an f statistic right you must give the five percent or ten percent whichever you choose
you must give the exact critical values right if those critical values that you are using to compare with the UNK significant whether you have serial correlation or not erm so they're very important and they ought to be included erm because otherwise we don't know whether a test statistic is er UNK significant or not
right okay so when you're performing test for structural change right if you just erm go through the simple UNK routine as we've done the way you think
if you don't know a UNK where the break will come right only we can get some you can get a handle where the break in this series may come by looking at the rolling regression like you did last week
that will give you er a good idea as to where the break comes
if you are not too bothered erm if you don't know a UNK where the break comes you can just split the sample size in half and just estimate erm an equation for each not less you won't but the computer will if you just specify half the sample size right and when it asks for the number of observations failure or chow tests you just press the return key and it will use all the remaining observations right but when you are doing the empirical work you should always test for structural stability right and er either of UNK tests will suffice right but if you've got a very small stock sample where there are fewer observations than there are parameters to be estimated you will have to use UNK second test failure
although it does have lower power than his first test right but if you can't calculate his first test then it's the best thing to use
right okay erm let's now move on to er these other UNK right like test for structural change these diagnostic test statistics that are calculated for right because essentially what they're doing is that they're testing the assumptions on which ordinary UNK squares is based
now if you UNK any of the assumptions ordinary squares right then the procedure will produce or may produce misleading results we can only be confident in statistical terms about ordinary UNK squares parameters right because we know and show in theory that they hold providing a number of assumptions are met like you have UNK errors right we don't have m multi co UNK amongst the UNK right we have constant variance throughout the sample now if any of those er assumptions are UNK then our any statistical results that are generated from erm the technique that assumes that those assumptions haven't been UNK erm are UNK and we can get very misleading er parameter estimates right in the presence of auto correlation or multi UNK erm
right UNK holds this in this regard and every regression that you estimate will always have a table of diagnostic test statistics after it right so although we are interested in the parameter values of our UNK estimated right in order to have any confidence in those parameter values you must ensure that we haven't UNK any of the assumptions
in which is based right
in UNK you've got tests for serial correlation functional form UNK of the residuals right and UNK right if you reduce the sample size at the beginning of the UNK period you will also get chow tests in there as well
we can use the whole sample but just get those four erm four test statistics okay
now if we just look at the er test statistics for this particular model right if we chose say the five percent significance level right then we can see serial correlation we've got a test statistic of two point zero eight right we wouldn't reject the null hypothesis there the null is that we have no serial correlation we have UNK errors right clearly we want UNK errors right so we'd be quite happy with that particular test statistic it doesn't exceed the er five percent critical value
so it doesn't look like this model UNK serial correlation
second test for functional form and there should read you know we've UNK our data here UNK implies there's a multi UNK relationship between the variable expressed in absolute value is that the case or is there a linear relationship or some other type of relationship there
so UNK the functional form test will see erm will tell us whether we ought to possibly log the data or whether we ought to UNK the data and just do a regression in er in absolute levels as opposed to logs
right so the functional form test if we look at the UNK squared version right again we've got a very small er test statistic implying there's no breach of functional form right the log er specification right seems to be working okay there's no problems with it erm if we now look at UNK we've got a bit of a problem with UNK right in that our test statistic is now four point nine if we look at the critical value at the five percent level of UNK when UNK squared two ah it's not too bad our five percent critical value of the UNK squared two is five point nine so although that test statistic is reasonably high i mean you'd probably reject oh yes we can reject the null at ten percent of normally distributed errors we wouldn't reject the null at five percent erm let's just have a look at in actual fact at those errors to see what the problem is
so if you erm press the return key er go into option three right and what we'll do is we'll plot erm plot the UNK of the residuals because what this test for UNK is doing is seeing whether the residuals we get from our regression are normally distributed right o and s assumes that they will be
now the reason why we're getting a fairly high test statistic is that er that distribution although it looks normal on the left hand side it doesn't look particularly normal erm on the right and that we are missing some observations we are missing some values of the residuals er in one area of the graph nevertheless if we had a larger sample right we probably erm right it doesn't look that looks quite encouraging in actual fact those residuals do seem to be er normally distributed er what the test statistic is doing er it's saying it's performing a it's a UNK two test it's making two restrictions one of which is saying is the distribution of these residuals UNK er and also it's testing whether there's one of the tails is a lot larger or a lot longer than the other tail of the distribution and er test statistics fairly high but we wouldn't reject the null of UNK at the five percent level so our test statistic is four point zero eight and the critical value is five point nine and that the five percent significance level so we've got reasonably er UNK residuals
right if you just want to come out of there and we'll just have a look at the plot of the residuals if you plot the residuals the test for serial correlation there well the test for serial correlation right and try and determine whether there's a auto UNK structure to those parameters and i think steve was talking to you about er auto UNK so what the computer is doing essentially it is getting the residuals from the model raised and it's UNK them right on the residuals in the previous period right and it's testing whether this parameter row right is significantly different from zero right now if this is if row is significantly different from zero let's say it's nought point six that implies the residuals in t are not independent of the residuals in t minus one
right there's some correlation between the two right auto UNK the residuals right so where we don't have residual auto correlation which is the case here you could actually save the residuals perform an error less and you wouldn't find coefficient on residuals with t minus one significant you've got an potentially that's what these tests for serial correlation do right they you can think of them as r saving the residuals running a running this regression right
where we this is first order correlation you may want to specify erm some second order serial correlation in which case you'd be seeing whether the residuals in t were related to the residuals in t minus one
well if we specified our model correctly right then these residuals should be just one noise they should just be appear with random UNK with mean zero
right and if you look at those they look pretty er pretty UNK
clearly there's no systematic structure in those residuals right if the residuals were moving in a UNK manner erm that would imply that we are missing an important explanatory variable in our model and its systematic effect has been just thrown into the error term and as a result we are picking up that systematic effect in residuals
okay press the er escape key and go back to the regression results erm so return to the post regression menu and then display regression results UNK results again
case of the diagnostic tests this model looks reasonably okay we haven't got erm significant serial correlation we haven't UNK form we have reasonably normally distributed residuals right test for UNK that just a test to see whether the residuals are growing over time right UNK is where we have non constant non constant variance of our of our error term right and very often you find that the variance through the residuals something like that the residuals will look like that i think they're growing UNK over time right these are UNK right and these are UNK right residuals and again we wouldn't want to have a model of UNK residuals right simply because that UNK one of the assumptions on which the blue properties are based
UNK means to erm we don't have biased estimates for our parameters we have estimates that don't have minimum variables and they won't be the most efficient estimates
got a very low test statistic either in terms of UNK or f right so we haven't reached but the model is still a poor model because we don't have erm er stable parameters right so you would actually reject this model as it stands alright because it didn't pass the diagnostic test statistics but there is no point generating parameters w if they if they are not constant and you're gonna say UNK demand is one point four six or really it it's UNK between minus three plus six over the sample so you put estimate means so it must have constant parameters
what you might do although i say you'd reject this particular model and that
this is a structural change what you could do or the easiest thing would be to do was just to incorporate a dummy variable right if you incorporated a dummy variable to a erm and to explain the and to take out the effect of structural change right er in that dummy inclusive model right all the diagnostic test statistics were okay right you would use you would therefore use that particular model what we might do is just see if that is the case erm so if you come out of er UNK work towards the data processing environment and generate a dummy variable right so if you go into the erm data processing environment if it's in the er sort of process plot option what we'll do create a dummy variable call it d and let d pull zero press the return key and then edit d oh and if you just set erm observations for
nineteen thirty nine through to nineteen er forty five or whatever the end of the sample is to one set them all to one
is forty
well thirty nine or forty all do it to thirty nine just to keep so all have the same results
i mean where we could dummy into the war here so the war starts in thirty nine so unless you've got good reason to believe that consumption wasn't affected until nineteen forty we use a dummy for the whole war period once you've UNK once you've UNK the variable you press the end key that saves the edit
all i do now is UNK our model right including just a cons a constant dummy right so if you specify your regression equation just add d to the list of explanatory variables right so we are assuming that the effect on the textile consumption is simply just to move the demand function up right use the entire sample period amongst this UNK
you know that the parameters were non constant but hopefully they will be now constant now that we've er included the dummy variable okay er so if you go to the diagnostic menu
we've got a bit of a problem right the dummy variable that we've included erm er you might you might get away with this amount
it seems that we now have serial correlation in our model as a result of including the dummy right now we've got to test statistic i mean always look at the f version of the test right er our f statistic of three point seven six is significantly different from zero right that leaves seven percent level so a five percent test we probably accept that we didn't have any serial UNK and we just got there by the skin of our teeth on that particular test erm yes you could probably get away with this one functional forms fine no problem there UNK right are f statistic three point nine but significantly different from zero that's six percent level right so again we just UNK it if we were looking at the ninety five percent confidence it wants to be five percent if you are using as five percent significance level
right we can just get there
so this model would be er you can say it's reasonably UNK bear in mind though that those test statistics on serial correlation and er UNK are very close to the critical value used
had you chosen the ten percent significance level as your cut off point erm you would UNK there is both serial correlation and UNK in the model
right so you know there's no UNK by no means the science and you can essentially get the computer to er tell the story that you want simply by choosing er critical values but nevertheless we've re probably be reasonably confident in our estimate particularly if those estimates we'll just go back to them er the er display the regression results again display them again but those coefficients are elasticities right they're UNK with our a UNK reasoning right we put ah unit elasticity you may want to test the hypothesis that the elasticity on erm the income variable that income elasticity is significant given one just generate computer a t ratio in the hypothesis value being one instead of zero as in a normal t test right and that coefficient point nine five is sufficiently close to one by looking at the standard error to er further that is an estimate of one you've got very UNK er demand erm for the textiles that coefficient is that the time i can't believe it if that's all oh no that's eight don't worry
eight
yeah so it's point eight so it is you do have price elasticity demand for textiles is price UNK
right and we may we may expect that to be the case you know clothes don't have textiles don't have many UNK
as a result erm changes in demand are gonna be er fairly UNK to changes in price because you've got to use textiles in order to make clothes and everything else that you make textiles with
right okay i think that's probably er about it we'll leave it there if you come out of UNK don't forget to tell it to log off the network
what's er steve doing with you at the moment in lectures has he started auto UNK models
yes
right
evening ladies and gentlemen
good evening
in case you're wondering why the UNK being recorded this evening
perhaps you'd care to explain mr chairman to those who don't know
certainly i would thank you vice chairman
er yes this is a follow up erm if you remember at the last full council meeting we recorded er proceedings for the er british corpus is it town clerk
yes
and er they were so pleased with your efforts that they've sent the town clerk some more tapes and they'd like a few more
i'm not quite sure that we will appear darling UNK of may but it's something similar mhm
there right
thank you graham
right item one have we any apologies
councillors and
sorry
anyone else
yes but has been wet all day
right item two reports and correspondence town clerk
i've got a couple of pieces of correspondence about things you've already looked at erm just minor alterations
the first was alterations and link UNK to west UNK and UNK road
the minor amendments altering the roof design of a garage UNK from head to UNK on the west elevation and all other UNK of the development UNK remains unchanged well
erm the second item is er a conversion of a bungalow to house west hill
and the amendment is oh the UNK of a second UNK of the second floor
all other respects of the development remains unchanged so not UNK to a house then
doesn't look like it
so they're doing nothing then are they
is that what they're saying
if it's already a bungalow
i just read these things
sorry
i would imagine what they're doing is raising the roof and not putting in the second storey
yes it says it's a UNK of bungalow to house west hill
i would like to notify you of the following amendments to the planning permission for the above development
to remind people of the of the UNK of the second floor
in all other respects the development remains unchanged
this matter was approved and myself deputy chairman rural area planning
they've done nothing
i think they just had to admit that it's not they can't they can't do any s sin because it'd say so right
it's UNK
well i don't understand that
no i didn't either
i'm sorry this confusion that er that the upstairs is in fact the first floor
and the two yes and the second floor which in fact is a third storey
indeed could well be couldn't it
could be like
mr chairman would i er can i ask that we ask for er more explanation on what they're doing there
yes
i don't like the way that's done
it's been approved but i mean as interest exactly what what's been approved
i think they're let us know what they've done
yes er i thought the council afraid doesn't understand
i must object
i can al always recall what permission we got
the problem is when you get these letters out unless you've got a plan in front of you it's impossible to know
mm
see we don't keep a plan that's the problem
all we got is a piece of paper which probably on that one tells the council they recommend approval of this
they don't get no UNK do you
no
perhaps mr chairman we should erm take copies of the plans
your figure
you're not late are you
no
i think we'll end up with a massive filing problem if we er
yeah
try to do that
we've got time
this is it
any offers but i don't
realize you realize that these may want a new machine for UNK plans which is not er sort of
i always wanted an a one UNK
right UNK
erm that concludes of course the correspondence
no
no
oh sorry that was
circulated here
yes graham have you got
erm very briefly erm councillor passed over to me erm a report from the planning committee about planning policy guidelines the countryside and the rural economy and i thought it was quite a good paper so we've copied it and sent it round to you
i don't propose that we make a any more discussion than that on it but it is obviously erm changing to the way in which they will be looking at certain items in the countryside
okay
fine
tha that seems a fair comment yes
indeed thought you all had copies of that i know cos i have a copy here and i'll leave you to digest at your own leisure
okay
i think it's a useful document er mr chairman
er yes
and i think it gives a balanced view on something you know may be you may be interested in the future
but i don't think we should make too much of it at this stage
no
i would agree with that
right anything else
yes we do by the looks of it
no thought you were going through the erm plans this is all the background history to the er house
right well then that concludes of course the correspondence
if we move on to item three we see
we have erm
they're only three in the last
no that's when they finally agreed
i said perhaps some time afterwards
right okay
right moving on to item four which agreed to consider a term following plan applications
application one is outline for an agricultural growing farm
do we need background to this one
not really no er we've had several people in to examine it who thought it was erm you know okay where it was and as it stands
somebody who lives nearby came in and examined it the other day and that's all i know
well i think this is erm replacing the house that's been sold off really isn't it i don't think it was a good idea really
which house
the original UNK at
park they called it didn't they sold off the UNK they're living in another one really
yes
erm mr chairman it's been brought to my attention in actual fact the drawings aren't correct
er as on the drawing service it does show there are already two buildings there
i don't believe there are
there's only one and it says that it was built in ninety one and it wasn't it was built in ninety three
so i think there is a little bit of controversy over it
yeah on one is in fact proposed and one is an existing farm building
yeah
there's only one shop that's existing
oh i see
and one shop is proposed
it's it it's a grain storage isn't it
storage of UNK you see
i don't know
well i be i believe we should pass it
i don't believe th that there's any relevance at all in the fact that there's something been sold off
i think what you gotta look out for is a block of grain here which supports a dwelling
i can't see anything wrong in planning terms whatsoever
yeah
i would agree with that chairman but i think that it should be so considered that the UNK been built first
yep
i agree with that
can i just add that the information in this is in fact incorrect
the building was not built in ninety one whether there's any relevance or not where they're trying to prove that the building has been up for some time they'd say it's not that building was put up this year
i built it
i think really i need to say that someone been creating happens to be that they're not sold off and
i don't believe they have sold off
sold it off
but let's be fair about this
you don't know in this case you probably do know that the personalities are the same
but if the UNK if that block of land had been sold off and somebody came along and wanted to put up farm buildings and a house then we would support it probably because there's an area of land there that's viable
i agree UNK with what we were saying what we don't want to see is a whole one house block in the countryside he wants to see it as part of a UNK and order to prove that it's going to be part of a UNK the buildings should be UNK to go up first before the house does
is there not a time scale
that's for the put the
details
on a on a UNK
well that's a completely different thing
ah
so they're saying you know to prove that it's viable they they'll give you UNK if you could have a UNK tunnel
then they want you to run it for two year have a mobile home and if you could prove it's viable after two years then there would be a reminder and we'll consider giving you permission for a house otherwise everybody could just put up one UNK tunnel in half an acre and get a house couldn't they
mm
immediately
here it's a little bit different you've got a five hundred acre holding
erm i think is partially right
some of that land belonged to subsequent farmers
i believe some of that land was UNK with bishop's court
and i think this
i think i might be right
and i think it's because of the way the farmers have been split differently and i think this is where it is very essential isn't it
i tell you what
the actual lands i think it is a little bit of different things
i the UNK rostrum you know i'm glad you've made it
what we're actually talking about here is the creation of a new farm isn't it
other part of the other farm
other bits isn't it they took it back you say
is that house in the middle of the building plot
yeah
yes
as well as the circumstance in all those cases
yes
yes
so when they sold off the buildings they made us no UNK that the was gonna farm it he was in another job
yes
and then what happened then he decided to follow his brother's UNK and farm it because the farm the plot of land was available
so i think we've got to support this mr chairman
in respect of what happened in the past
yes
no i didn't know where the rules stood time wise about at least established as a farm for a certain number of years which i why i believe
i think chairman if i may is that we're going to be enough the agricultural buildings should be built first but it should UNK relatively close to them
and i think he's settled on
creation of a UNK
it should be a UNK
we don't want to settle on
tie up
oh yes of course
but as it says in the report which we've had this evening a bit of flexibility a bit of balance
it's a good job that somebody wants to UNK these areas of land
yes
and as UNK said growth is the only evidence of life
and we could
and you proved it
so can i ju just summarize
what qualifications would you like to put on this if we approve it
something some adequate dwelling
buildings are put up first
first yeah
i'll erm
well related to the
related to the existing er agricultural or related to the agricultural buildings that will be put up before this is built
aye
yes
all in favour
approval any objections no carried
there we go
application two is a full application for a mr in for a detached garage at
i must confess when i first saw the plan i was totally confused by it
the roads are not quite as they are shown
erm does anyone have any feelings on this application
UNK
with approval
yes
approval
with approval
item three another full application from a mr for a single storey extension up at
looks alright
again i had a look at it seems perfectly in keeping
for what's there
does anyone have any views
i do support it but this really was a case here where people were a little naughty when this was originally built
it was passed for a conversion and there was a stone barn wasn't there
yeah
that's right
and they er when they did it they knocked it all down and that was really wrong and unnecessary and though i think some of the UNK was used a lot of the UNK went back in the UNK yard and it was a criminal thing at the time
so you know whilst i'm a little bit reluctant in a way i think that's water under the bridge and in my view actually the extension UNK it all
it does
it appears we've done the same thing with the brick and the UNK
i have to say there's a little bit UNK in the way
oh yeah but er all to do with the planning not past history
i think that erm this particular erm the way that this the UNK once were developed in actual fact were part of the death UNK of erm
yes
barn policy as we knew it
and part of that barn policy even were it not worthy of extra has always been that the once you carried out the UNK to the barn that was the actual extent of the building
so that you know they didn't actually look too far gone
in fact in a lot of cases where they took away the rights for
UNK
the UNK rights
taken away
and certainly the percentages very never as high as they were on other buildings were they
no you could con twenty percent more than the barn that was existing
yeah
and i don't know if that was exceeded in this case
yeah
they did used to take away rights which mainly why he's put his application in for this relative
yeah
i actually think they probably did use up all that was possible available to them at the time and so in some ways this is against the spirit of the policy although the policies have been changed and i hear what councillor said about improvement to the place and so i don't think we'd serve any useful purpose in stopping these people doing this because they're probably not the people who were responsible for the UNK of the rules at the time
mm
but would that in any way affect what's happening now
this is just to give you
oh that's unfair because
right
all those sorry you spoke
that mr chairman to hear councillor say that because all we're saying is that these council officers aren't doing their job didn't they inspect these buildings
we did on several occasions
but
no i'm talking about building inspectors because if it was supposed to have been retained and they demolished it and used it you know in another way and not built it back
i mean surely somebody's not carrying out their work
i mean it's not for us to look into but
no
it seems that as councillor brought it up i don't like to hear that very much
this was all took into consideration when this application
yeah
this was all brought up
yeah
but that isn't that would be part of regular
of course it would yes but
it's not the right subject for application
so all approval
okay
carried
item four application by homes in conjunction with the for thirty six flats for residential development on the land which i assume is at the rear of house in erm i will need some guides on it because it's a ghost before my time erm does anyone like to
yeah
can i just put the point that it stands at the moment
mr chairman we were interested in buying house so i think i'm not necessarily to be found erm
can i offer if you like guidance
i think it is for you purely to decide that this application does not affect the house
this application is only the grounds
mm
i would feel you don't have to put a particular interest on
thinks that's the house
no you that's it you're confusing the plan erm
right
sorry
they've just UNK the old plan and just drawn a red line round the bit they want us to look at erm this bit know it's a computer
yeah i've got i believe that should be made clear to you all that the area concerned here is the area which is surrounded by the red line
although the plan has been UNK over an existing plan erm to be charitable it's at best confusing erm my feeling is that in actual fact the plan there doesn't actually show us well enough and you may consider that we ought to be asking for a much clearer plan before we make a decision
so what'll they do some back for thirty more
in the first UNK in the first place they tried for sixty or something they
should i call back when
could you could you do this for me
current permission i think at the moment stands for forty seven sheltered units
that was won on appeal after withdrawal of the highway reasons and the fact that the local authority hadn't backed up their refusal with more of the reasons which we put forward for instance
that was nineteen eighty six
nineteen eighty six that was the appeal i attended here
so they
what they've done now they've got planning permission for forty seven sheltered units
the reason the reason i keep is obviously the parking qualifications for sheltered units are about urgh forty five parking spaces per unit
this application is for a lesser number of flats but is not is looking to clear itself of any UNK over UNK occupancy
so they're not sheltered they're purely residential units of residential accommodation so you've been asked to look at a at an application for a completely new residential block on the same grounds as was occupied by forty seven sheltered units
and doesn't take in the house
mm
is that alright
yes thank you
erm i erm i am actually dead against this for various reasons and i don't think i would bring up all the reasons that i am because some of them are not absolutely purely planning reasons which shouldn't be UNK at this meeting but i do feel that the provision there for thirty six properties will create a traffic hazard and access problems which i feel will support this council at the traffic authority after having done a sufficiently detailed survey i think was the problem wasn't it
that was quite right at the time
but to access all those so close to the cable way access i've given it as unacceptable
i feel that the density thirty six in there is totally unacceptable
i also feel that the affect on the adjoining list of properties is unacceptable
i think that's the other properties is that there's only
UNK urgh i tried to argue the point at appeal erm if you look up the listing for these properties er in the area which back onto the mill stream it's all the grounds are listed because it says quite clearly that in the opinion of they form a group and it was one of the reasons which i'm glad you well as you can see this piece of ground is part of a listing and although this existing permission we're looking at it as a clean site tonight we're not looking at what has been passed
our job is to look at putting those thirty six units on what is a clean site
what is a clean site
that is because of my third contribution
the fourth i think is the effect that thirty six of them remember it's not older people it's not UNK affect on the medical centre and my fifth reason is i don't believe that the plan the that er the application we've got is detailed enough for us to give permission for outline thirty six
if you were giving outline for building it would be different
but they're asking for thirty six
yeah
and i don't believe that is detailed for us has enabled us sit here and say yes a there's room for them and b there's enough parking and c there's enough turning
so for all those reasons i have to refuse
i would support er most of what councillor has said
what worries me as well is the parking
with that you must have thirty four parking spaces
one point five thirty six times got to have fifty four parking spaces
i cannot see that land
in actual fact the one point five UNK i think east devon have now put up to two haven't they
i don't know
they're in the process of putting it up to two
for this type of
yeah
for any residential accommodation
you're absolutely correct but the plan is very confusing very vague
i can't even see thirty six going on there
no
there may be you know may be fifty odd parking spaces but there's certainly not erm
what isn't clear
wasn't too sure
two three storey passed is it
one point i'd like to make to er
yes
backing up when i er at the appeal the medical centre made a very long presentation over the UNK the UNK to their erm surgery and they argued about the height of buildings now it got passed as sheltered united er which means elderly and quiet occupancy
the fact that we've got partnership holders and UNK housing association would seem to me that we're quite likely to get UNK and we've had all round the town at the moment and you would have to agree that here is a very strong reason for the medical centre to be worried about the effect on the medical centre
that's right yeah
i couldn't back that up more strongly
right anyone else
care to say anything
list of erm
yeah
common to that
we've got two letters from erm the two adjacent neighbours erm particularly concerned with lack of privacy car park next to the wall of the properties resulting in noise pollution and potential danger of property from UNK
pedestrian access will be a short cut for everyone especially the school children
they've made it a sort of through cut there which is now going to allow people to cross over erm it's going to make erm two points of pedestrian access shown on the north boundary at the site will create new rights of way and will become short cuts for UNK and especially children
this is UNK and i ask that they be disallowed that a child proof fence be required at this boundary which is already being eroded
well that's that one
now when this very similar application came up before it was opposed by the county highway authority erm had no objection county conservation er recommended refusal
erm the basis there was development UNK and affect privacy of nearby dwellings of the medical centre
affect the setting of listed buildings detrimental to conservation areas increasing traffic danger to UNK high standard of design not achieved to the site in the conservation area affect a boundary wall and UNK problems of UNK and no provision for future use of house if used UNK its future should be secured
we also recommended refusal so did the ward member and refusal was indeed recommended
erm we commented also on the limited access and UNK area UNK service vehicles removals delivery vans which are forced to park in the main road
inadequate parking UNK in this place indicated
site UNK would develop into a UNK run down area
psychological trap whole site too UNK with UNK noise pollution and physical stress to the residents
fire hazard poor access in confined space for emergency services
inadequate sewage facilities with UNK
house would be isolated
gross UNK of privacy from adjacent properties
size and shape of the site UNK with surrounding area
movement into and out of site would create a traffic hazard
hazard to UNK regular use of UNK by king's school pupils and would be UNK by vehicles using entry
trees would be lost during construction of buildings
sites adjacent too UNK the medical centre and this well this one maybe not so now anticipated age range and type of resident UNK from original concept
that's enough isn't it
mm
yeah
one of two things
i think you'll find the reason we said about the on the site and the design was it was a detailed application
mm
so we were able to consider that
well of course we can't consider that this time because it's outline so we can't you know you must con
mm
we have to go to
we take the risk
but a lot of are actually applicable right now but if those in favour basically UNK
i think we should be saying that whilst we agree with the site in outline we are completely against the proposed usage of that site
why
we can't really say we've never approved it in outline can we
can't put
it's in the plan
you can't put too many reasons if you're gonna say the plan is not explanatory
if that's your reason or you want a fresh plan
conditions
you cannot put conditions where you gonna refuse it if you can't accept the plan
you can't have both of it
well except some of these reasons were actually still quite clear despite the state of the plan
you know you gotta forget that you must remember them that it's been passed by the minister
something's gotta go down
something's gotta go whether you give permission before this or an appeal
you gotta have something on
that was for wasn't it
yeah
and that was
you could actually can't it
mm
yeah
the basis the basis that the appeal was that because it was sheltered several other providers didn't mean anything
yes the traffic
because there wouldn't be the traffic generation because you could although they argued long and hard over the ability of service vehicles to service the site
and the inspector would in all probability have UNK the refusal had it not been for the withdrawal three days before the appeal of the UNK reasons for the refusal
that was done because the applicants did a detailed traffic survey albeit on a wednesday afternoon and the county council hadn't done a detailed traffic survey so they felt that if they went to appeal without that detailed traffic survey to back 'em up they would have been rightly shouted that or UNK by the applicants that had done one
i think you've got to add a little bit to that
it was another one of the er the UNK major jobs the east devon officers didn't carry forward all our re
all our recent UNK
so they only had them i think the major they relied on such reports as the strong traffic reason at that stage
that it would never get passed just on highways alone
that was the UNK view at the time
well i must ad i'm a bit confused by all this erm and i don't mean
can i say
one or two more reasons here to add that in the main i did move refusal for the reasons that i'd listed which in the main are covered
i'll run through them again if you like
if you would please
the first reason was highways
and i would say it's on highways with your traffic on the access and on parking and added that to the list i didn't say that in the first instant
so i think that still is the large play on
it appears from what i can see there that the density in there would be too high which it would not if it were sheltered
it it's worth remembering isn't it thirty six properties on one acre
on one acre
dense
dense
it's ridiculous when you take into account all the parking that's got to be provided on it
yes how much do you
erm and the effects on the listed adjoining properties
can you pass it up please
which would be the and i forget the three of them maybe we would list them as well as UNK house
well i can't remember how much room there was left at UNK house
i need a majority
how much parking is there left in UNK house
well what are you going to do with UNK house i mean you haven't got nothing yet
no parking at all
so
no at all
no at all
so it must be the effect not only on the adjoining properties but also on UNK house itself and the inadequate amount of UNK left with UNK house
erm my fourth one was the effect on the medical centre bearing in mind but i didn't say that at the time that there's to be no longer sheltered and there could be young families remember more UNK an element and maybe we should make details of that
the fifth was i considered the plans were not detailed enough for us to give permission for outline for thirty six
you may be able to give UNK you may be able to
yeah
give just outline of the site but certainly not
they've asked for a number haven't they spec specifically here which i think that's detailed enough
you may wish to add drainage i mean we're not sure there is er adequate er capacity in the drainage
well that's the sewage again
sewage and erm some developers in the area about contributions don't they
you know if they wish to consider that
well some of the reasons here can be repeated but erm if i can just run through these again
these ones probably haven't been raised
hasn't been raised
because they might be applicable
erm the first reason is the size of the conservation area adjacent to the listed buildings
it does not preserve or enhance the area in any way
i think that's a fair comment to say despite not having clear plans
two storey three storey
we've got plans of the houses haven't we
pictures of the houses
there are pictures of the individual UNK of the property
in actual fact you see it it's there's quite a confusion that they come for outline and given you a
detailed plan
detailed plan
yeah
it is chairman that actually they are down against the erm mill stream the three UNK site some of them about three UNK high
is that clear from the elevation
yeah it says so on here yeah
two houses
well that plan is a disgrace
it's UNK all over it
mm
difficult to see what you've got
you know just by looking at it
certainly say we wouldn't want
well erm let's look haven't got enough reasons to put down erm
to what do we have parking within
no i
well if they're gonna put variations does anyone put three million
two and three million
it's eighteen but that's
eighteen to twenty three
i know it's not specifically related to farming
you know i do i know we can't take that
that's the reason that's right yeah
i think we covered that
without saying that
well i think erm i'll just run through them
can't say that let me see er inadequate parking spaces you can't say that because we're not we UNK we think we suspect inadequate parking but it's still not clear from that plan what we actually
no i think what we are saying
we've actually said the effect on the listed properties including UNK house which would be left with insufficient UNK i think that was the point we made
you got that one
mm
right
you got
and i think chairman we should be reminded that this is a new application nothing to do with the other one and i think we should consider this as a new application
yeah
i think we have
yeah
the reasons were brought forward
yes
so how many vote did you get erm
well i got erm highways at the traffic end with traffic problems access and but obviously that start doing this
yeah
the too high density for the area
the effect on listed adjoining properties UNK house and er the other one the name UNK me at the moment erm and that it will give insufficient UNK to UNK house when er whatever development takes place there
the effect on the medical centre with erm possibly erm different types of people living there plans not detailed enough to erm show for thirty six
sewage and site in a UNK area the houses are not appropriate
yeah
you keep mentioning three storey building if they got to the amendment
i think that's
the reason basically the building
weeks' solid trouble with them
gentlemen i might i think we should add that the presumption for two UNK on the boundary against the land that is run
because i think that one of them actually enters in the medical centre doesn't it
yes one of the access in the back of the centre yes i'm not sure
yeah
see that
it's on the site plan there yeah they've marked it in
what do you want to know
pedestrian access is it
close one of those
close pedestrian UNK
these two of
the trouble is you've got a job to read them haven't you
there's one there one further to the left
one's into the land that play area or just below it
then one's right in the doctor's area
so
so the presumption that they would be allowed to do that's wrong i don't think that should do it
that's right well why can't they go out beside the medical centre again
what are you trying to do
that goes into the erm
playground doesn't it
UNK or i don't know
children's playground goes right into the playground
yeah
right
bet the UNK have their say
plenty of
i think that's a good enough reason when i say i don't particularly want to add anything else
yeah that's right
do we have a proposal
i second it
second it
second it
all in agreement with views that are recommended
all agreement with refusal
ye yes sorry yeah
oh yes
did UNK or what
right well the next the next application is not on your agenda it's application four a
erm it was an UNK an UNK
it got UNK on the back of that one with a large paper clip
it is for a mr erm UNK and it's for a two storey extension to an existing house
do you have any comments on that
i've looked at the house looked at the site
can't see it look up to anybody else
give it approval
i would agree with that
how do we how do we
i second that
how do we stand legally
okay
that's okay we don't have to advertise
we don't advertise
no we don't advertise
so that's all right we don't really
that's it
right
it was an UNK on our part
yes i just wondered whether we've got a problem or not
we would have if we didn't do it because the applicant quite rightly said what he said was gonna do it without us
yeah
not with the timescale
i understand it may well be delegated anyway
single storey
right
extension
two storey
two storey
what's the existing
looks fine
move for agreement
item five is a full application from mr t for er
UNK of the
oh UNK commercial oh i was domestic commercial couldn't think
UNK commercial for the construction of a pair of UNK cottages at ottery st mary
does anyone have any comments on that
we do mr chairman that
looks like it's very UNK
yes it looks very nice
the old slaughterhouse wasn't it
hasn't the UNK gone
the old slaughterhouse wasn't it
the UNK still there and the back
not a patch on the UNK
and er all the neighbours are extremely happy to see a pair of cottages rather than any new conversion
what about the traffic though
well they have to put up the
there is access to the area
is that the site or is it under development not really
no they're only just actually fit if you look at the plan by creating an access some UNK
there's a maximum allowed to do there
maximum you can get in
what garages as well
garages as well
parking
ain't gonna affect the light of the houses that's already there in the street is there
no
cos they're always UNK about er
is that
in actual fact you see the plan the two houses are going to the bottom end of the site as far away to the UNK adjacent to west UNK
so don't think they should put three
three properties on that little on that coming out between the butchers and erm
oh that's access oh that's access to back of the grocery ones
and we the permission was given to take away the garage
one turned it into a front room and one going down and two in the UNK on the left hand side one in the UNK on the right hand side
access to three round the back
access to what was once but is now house and was the access to the UNK
right
motorway next
yes motorway access is going to be a problem there the increase traffic
no
i don't see it
i
it's decreased traffic it's decreased the traffic for what was using it as a commercial premises
right
i
getting rid of a nuisance that could be there
yeah
like getting rid of a nuisance that could be there
yes
if they could use this as a
it is also worth remembering that when they put in for an application for ten flats the advice from the authority was that was only development and no parking
yes
but that they would look UNK on two
yeah
because i was quite heavily involved with that and they UNK that application pending putting in one to com comply with what they were told from east devon
move approval
right move approval
yes
has anyone else giving reason for these
i think we should there
i think we should say that we consider that that's er would be far better than the old commercial units
very attractive
enhancement of the area
yeah enhancement that's a good term
i don't know
s
begins with an e
well done
you've got that word
i was afraid that he would say what a pair
right
i don't see it
er manor UNK homes detached bungalow double garage at west hill
incidentally erm west hill had copies of those two that are relevant to them and have no objection
mm
they have relied or
oh they did yes
i have no objection mr chairman
approved
move approval
fine
moved
yes
right
approved
application number seven
full application by the UNK trust for anne UNK extension and it is an amendment to an approved scheme
this is an UNK
it's alright isn't it
how do you feel about
it looks alright
move approval
agree
approval
item eight is a full application for a mr j for a UNK at
miss it's a
oh sorry
i knew i'd be corrected there
miss stroke mr
west hill and i'm sure you're all familiar with the site
of the site
what's left of it
could i make the point that i think the UNK were already there because they'd started their double garage which they then weren't allowed to have and i think this is gonna stand on the UNK
i think it's a very attractive site and i
don't see anything wrong with the UNK
i think the UNK in very well
yeah
i already approved of it
whilst i was against it initially i am now very much in favour of it
what i'm gonna say
if it goes anything like that plan i think that UNK looks UNK actually
well it's a UNK work with a UNK roof
against it already
yes
it is a temporary i would say it's more temporary than permanent
i mean i know on the plans are not very good but it doesn't show where there is a roof presumably there's a roof beside it just like UNK
i mean i don't know what it is and i think it looks pretty horrible
it in there but i think a double garage would have looked better than that actually
i think that's worse than the double garage and i'm afraid that i disagree mr chairman
in my opinion i think we'll have an application for a garage in twelve months' time
yeah
i think i think so
what happened up there once that was lost on appeal right the whole of the handling of that by east devon council just been poor and then what did they do they decided to go for appeal which was UNK over the garage
what they were really fighting was the principle of what had gone on before
now what you're saying is if we don't allow 'em a UNK or something there they're gonna park outside
quite rightly
now do you want to provide them with any parking facilities off parking
no
parking there without a UNK
well i can't con i think that could be very attractive myself with the UNK work and roses
and UNK grow something up it
yeah
if it matches in like the rest
er
i mean i sold up around west hill you said many a time how we think that's
yes
yeah but it's very it is very unfortunate in my view the way this system it's not this council it's east devon that UNK this
you must get back to this every time
the access was never meant to be it was meant to be further in and we all for well know the permission was for a drive to come down through the wood which would have been very attractive and a garage on the end of the property
which would have been very attractive UNK and none of us would have been against it and when they came to put in the application to convert it making it a meter wider and turn that into an extra bedroom or whatever was we said that there was no parking and we said what would happen and east devon went ahead and approved that and exactly in everything we've said which was recorded in this council
quite right
and then you know
i feel quite UNK in the way that we've handled it and east devon have UNK it
it's gone into us and we've done it's here that's looked at it properly and walked through the trees and even looked at every marking in the trees that were gonna come down
done the whole job properly and what happens in come the major authority and just everything we done out the window
right well
record as well
i was just thinking
selling
that you may make it a condition of the UNK roof that they would put four inches of UNK and plant grass there
it looks to me on the plan
though that it looks such a UNK structure that you know its gonna be UNK up with walls
it has to be UNK
on the application the walls are in wood and that's as much you get with a UNK roof
yeah
well i must
hold it up
it's going to look like a garage
yeah well
how do you feel about this application
are we in approval
put it to the vote and let's get on with it
right
all those in favour of approval
all those against
i just pass it
that's right
i think we ought to record it to west hill council
yes
no
come on everybody come on clerk
alright let's have it
approved
yeah
did you say that the UNK approved
yes
they did
it should be noted
i think we should put that on the list
no objections from the
but approval recommended by the west hill UNK
may i suggest you do that then i don't like to look the other way
may i suggest you do that
that's brilliant
they're a standard but they like your UNK
this is an interesting thing you and i vote against it we are obviously dead against
well i don't se
well i don't say that everything you do is lost
i don't plan the agenda any other planning business
anyone have any other planning business
no thank you
planning committee closed i wish you all a very happy christmas
thank you councillor
same to you
same to you
i got to phone the councillors
what tonight or what
tomorrow night
sorry
i think i'm gonna have to give my apologies for tomorrow night
anybody who does fancy it just but if you fancy popping round my house christmas morning
yes
UNK afternoon and in the evening
for a bit of UNK
er i shall be unable to attend unfortunately
what a shame
is there a bus laid on
microphone up here so i don't need to speak up
that's four hundred and eighty what we're doing right okay so you're doing trade at the moment in lectures and er bob has asked you to collect some data on er world trade in wheat and cotton is that correct
right so erm what's happened to world trade over time say in the last century what major changes have taken place in world trade
is the composition of world trade still the same
matthew
erm to be honest with you i couldn't tell you
the first opportunity i got to look at this stuff is on sunday on the library
right anybody else want to help matthew out
i mean are we still trading as much agricultural goods or as much manufacturing goods as we
because as a percentage in the erm as a percentage of trade agriculture has gone down hasn't it
right okay yeah that's true
what's happened to trade in manufacturers
that that's increased as part of the trade in services as a percentage of total trade and they've increased while UNK beginning to decline
okay so i think what we can say is that agricultural trade in absolute terms has probably risen
mm
over the century er although as a proportion agricultural trade has fallen as a proportion of total trade right and that reflects a number of influences
why might er agricultural trade increase in absolute terms
increased productivity
yes okay
anything else i mean something fairly straightforward nothing too tricky
incomes increasing
yes incomes have risen what else has risen
the number of people on the planet
mm
that needn't necessarily increase trade across countries just UNK could possibly become er more self sufficient
however rising populations have been an underlying influence for increasing trade in all products not just in er agricultural products
er certainly in sort of transportation technology the easier it is to trade the more trade there will be and transportation technology has increased dramatically over this year so we can now ex exploit the comparative advantage that other countries have in particular commodities whether they be agricultural or manufacturing quite simply because transport costs are no longer UNK
at one point you know there was no point buying wheat from the united states alright because although they had a comparative advantage in production the costs of transportation were UNK and in essence we can produce it cheaper over here than the er the import cost of foreign produced wheat
okay so er transport technology has certainly been important in er increasing trade
as has as have rising incomes and rising population
okay so what UNK what may have accounted for UNK decline in relative terms in world trade
erm in UNK countries the demand for food is generally
mhm
and the more er developed countries you get the less trade there's likely to be towards developing countries who actually become more UNK then the market leaders generally become more
yes that's right i mean as we get UNK we want to consume er more manufactured goods basically
manufactured goods tend to have income elasticities greater than one so when we buy more of those then it's quite likely that we'll actually be erm UNK more of those
right why might we be UNK more manufactured goods
what factor i mean we could become self sufficient in all our in all our manufactured goods
what's one of the major reasons for growth in manufactures
greater trade in manufactures
mm then why aren't we self sufficient in say manufacture manufactured goods why do we import cars from germany as well as producing cars ourselves
because of demand because of the demand exists in the first place
that's right why does that demand exist what we what are we demanding
more variation of product
yes more product UNK variety
alright as we tend to as each is observed UNK as we as we get UNK not only do we want to consume more of some good but we want to consume different varieties of some of some good
so what do we call UNK import and export of a similar good the same good
intra industry trade
yes in intra industry trade alright which is different from inter industry trade where we're trading food er food for manufactures intra industry trade is where we UNK import and export what is essentially the same good
alright intra industry trade has become very important in terms of erm world trade in general
right we like to UNK we like to consume different varieties
right
but can you think of another reason why erm why we import erm goods that are similar to the goods that we produce at home
it certainly is variety sort of if you think of that as being a demand side influencing the consumers demand more variety
can you think of a supply side reason
what happens if you increase say there's one country that is exporting to all countries of the world alright its production may well be very large therefore er what benefits might that have
economies of scale
yes economies of scale
alright so manufactured goods are a class of goods in which it's easy to differentiate the product right
very easy because the goods are essentially differentiated alright
although a car if you think of a car being a car we know as consumers that one car is not exactly the same as another car very easy to put power steering on the car or to put go faster UNK on a car you can differentiate the product very easily alright
as a result and because consumers like variety it's likely that they'll want to er consume different types of what is essentially the same the same good
UNK that influence is the fact that economies of scale in manufacturing production alright are non trivial
they're important
like we can produce we can reduce the unit cost of car production dramatically by increasing the s increasing the size of the plant alright and so even if this is one reason why we don't why street trade has risen dramatically in manufactures it's because in manufactures there are powerful erm economies of scale effects alright
and so even if we could produce UNK over here alright we probably wouldn't alright unless all UNK production were specialized over here production has become a lot more specialized in manufacturing where you just have large plants producing erm the entire world production of that particular erm product
so you know all erm UNK or something are produced in derby and those cars made in derby will not only UNK the u k demand but they'll also be UNK to all other countries in the world including japan itself
alright so economies of scale are a major driving force in er increasing erm trade in manufactures and most of that increased trade in manufactures is intra industry trade
okay so perhaps the other side of that coin might explain why agricultural trade right has declined in relative terms alright
income elasticities of demand for food tend to be less than unity can we differentiate agricultural products
no
no there's just not the scope
alright you know a potato is a potato is a potato
although there are you can differentiate the products but it's much er much more difficult to do so there's much less scope
the differentiation affects mostly the service factor anyway doesn't it the retail
that's right that's right yes how we consume these products yes i mean you're right so a potato is a potato is a potato but if it's pre packed graded and washed that is sort of UNK different from er sort of UNK old potatoes that you could buy at a UNK
alright and that that's where most of differentiation of food products erm has UNK from it's not changing the food product itself right because it's very difficult to do that but it's the combination of food products and marketing services that erm UNK the differentiation
food commodities
okay so income elasticities are less than one for agriculture whereas they're greater than one for manufacturing er much less scope to differentiate in agricultural products much more scope to differentiate in manufactured goods
how about economies of scale
do you think there's there are economies of scale in agricultural
not erm not in the sense that there are in manufacturing because erm simply from the fact that in the scale of production isn't really erm it's not under the farmer's influence as much as manufacturing production is under the erm certain UNK influence because it's er risky
yes
weather conditions things like that so he can't increase the scale of production at his own will and therefore can't exploit the economies of scale which can give an increase in production
that's right yes i mean that's very true and another point that UNK the fact economies of scale in agriculture i mean there are there are economies of scale to a certain degree as you as you said there matthew but there's certainly not er erm they're not as large as the as the economies of scale in manufacturing primarily because in agriculture you effectively need land alright to increase erm your output
alright and you because that means of UNK of the geographical constraint which isn't present in er most industrial erm plants i mean you know a very large say in the plant at toy UNK er that's in derby
it probably covers about three hundred acres and that serves world demand for one for one car
you know three hundred acres is a fairly medium a fairly small farm in the u k
alright in order to UNK the demand for wheat in the world we'd need a farm you know the size of wales or something or bigger than that the size of europe or half the size of europe alright so the because of the nature of agricultural production economies of scale just aren't there
you know we start to run into dis economies of scale er much sooner
that's simply because we're production is dependent upon physical factors rather than machinery okay
so this meant these sort of er theoretical reasons may well explain a change in composition of world trade UNK relative decline UNK relative rise
i mean i've got some statistics here erm
okay erm before the first world war UNK share of world trade was over fifty percent a half of our of all world trade prior to the first world war was agricultural products alright
today it's less than fourteen percent
sorry could you repeat that please
yes before the first world war over half of all world trade was in agricultural goods whereas now there's less than fourteen percent
so there's a marked decline there
okay erm what other factor is often UNK to UNK of trade or decline in UNK erm composition of world trade
something that gatt is trying to sort out
yes protectionism is often erm suggested as the major reason why er agricultural trade is er has declined so much
protectionism since the second world war particularly erm has grown rapidly however there was you know we agricultural protectionism isn't a thing erm isn't a recent phenomenon agricultural protectionism was around in the u k er in the last century eighteen twenties erm the corn laws as they as they were called that was erm a major set of UNK on UNK of er wheat primarily into the u k prior to that erm in the seventeenth century in sort of sixteen hundreds alright the u k used to be a net UNK of our wheat and we had a comparative advantage in those in those times
and er in actual fact our wheat exports were taxed alright as a means of raising revenue primarily that's why they were taxed erm a very easy way to obtain government UNK
so protectionism i mean there's still protectionism if you're taxing your exports it's a t so protectionism is not er a recent phenomenon however the extent of protectionism has risen dramatically in this century particularly since the second world war
okay so why might protectionism erm affect world trade
erm because the governments are trying to protect domestic industries through and erm they are trying to do this by actually physically blocking UNK so domestic consumers have to have to buy from domestic producers rather than from abroad to stop the domestic industry declining
right okay i mean essentially that's it
if you're supporting your own domestic agriculture right what are you doing you're increasing your self sufficiency if you're increasing your self sufficiency er you may well be erm well you will be UNK for import what was what's imported is now produced UNK alright so the demand for imported agricultural goods will decline
okay it is often argued that i mean this is the principal reason why agricultural trade hasn't been in the gatt negotiations because agricultural er protectionism has been UNK in domestic agricultural policy UNK policy makers will say we are protecting er our own domestic industries right because we because of er erm UNK effects that would be imposed or the UNK that would be imposed on domestic agriculture if we didn't we don't think that the fabric of the rural society could UNK the UNK to UNK in agricultural goods
it it's a domestic policy hands off it's got nothing to do with international trade at all it is purely a domestic policy and that is essentially the argument that is erm prevented agriculture erm from sort of UNK through the gatt net
alright it's domestic policy it's got nothing to do with international trade it shouldn't er be included in international trade
clearly there's a very naive and UNK view of er protectionism
protectionism in any form will affect tr will affect trade and er but nevertheless the agricultural UNK have been sufficiently strong to UNK pressure from gatt to include agriculture in the negotiations
if you bear in mind that virtually every other product is has been able to er to be accommodated within gatt it shows that the agricultural lobby is pretty damn powerful alright not only in this country but throughout the world erm to prevent that you know much more so than steel coal cars computers any of those industries that you might think oh pretty powerful lobby groups er haven't got a patch on the farmers but er right okay so those reasons may count for erm for protectionism er sorry for er the relative de decline of er agricultural trade
what other effects does protectionism have on agricultural markets
alright it reduces trade in agricultural products but it has other effects
over time it makes the domestic industry less competitive
yes very true
if there's more competition it makes if there's the same amount of protection amongst er rival countries it's not their hard luck but if they're trading UNK enough
yes i mean any protectionism right will UNK resources alright away from the most efficient uses of resources and UNK inefficient uses of resources
that's what protectionism is just UNK of resources
alright so supporting agriculture right means losses elsewhere in the economy and this is why protectionism is always a bad is always a bad thing in terms of net welfare
alright although the farmers are UNK alright from protectionism alright you know we're we as tax payers and consumers are UNK er resources into agriculture away from somewhere else
alright and because that protectionism is required to do that we must be taking resources away from more efficient industries and putting them into agriculture
like instead of you know spending erm in the hundreds of millions of or UNK of pounds that we spend on agriculture supporting agriculture we could use those resources to produce a lot more of other goods
alright so a pound spent in agriculture alright is much less is worth a lot less than a pound spent elsewhere right cos farmers are relatively inefficient
i know in the free market resources will be allocated erm in an UNK way in that those er those sectors that are the most productive in economic terms you know they can produce more output per unit input alright those sectors that can do that will get the resources
alright what's happening now is that we're taking resources away from those efficient sectors and giving it to inefficient agriculture
now there are good reasons why we might want to do that but in economic terms you'll reduce the net welfare of the economy or the world simply because you're UNK resources away from efficient UNK of production into inefficient UNK of production
it's quite a UNK policy if you look at the er because if you erm if you introduce subsidies to actually protect the domestic industry then that's often going to cause UNK from other countries and therefore effectively UNK off any trade any effective trade at all and consequently because there's no competitive pressure on the domestic industries they're not going to feel the need to make themselves more productive which they would do when there was competition
so therefore the decline is just going to become a natural part of agricultural
that's right that's right and er you know we see this in all sorts of sectors where you know protectionism has effectively UNK trade
you know you've only got to go to eastern europe and china you know these places have been completely erm UNK from any world trade
they've been heavily er subsidized
what happens when you open up the market twenty years down the line you realize that these industries are UNK they're using technology that's thirty years out of date
right now that hasn't happened to quite the same degree in agriculture because a lot of agriculture erm the protectionism that we've given is in terms of high prices
alright and so there's an incentive for these small producers alright to UNK their yields alright because the more they produce the higher income they they'll have
alright so how do they UNK their yields
well they erm they use the latest techniques agriculture hasn't become er hasn't UNK in the presence of protectionism because there's always been an incentive there for farmers to UNK their yields
you know they haven't been given erm er an income regardless of what they produce
alright this was this was often the case say er eastern european industries where they just sort of said right okay you're we're going to UNK this erm plant that produces cars
alright there were no there were very few production targets if there were production targets erm er they were very low essentially the support that eastern european car manufacturers got was not coupled right to production
whereas the support the farmers received right has always been coupled to production so the more they produce the more support they get the higher the higher their incomes
and as a result there's always been erm an incentive there to increase agricultural production
how do they do that well they employ the latest technology cos they you know u k farmers are some are some of the most erm er well they use some of the most highly capital intensive techniques of production
you know using artificial UNK techniques they're using erm some er UNK er seeds for their er for their UNK they're using UNK chemicals they're using state of the art machinery and they're using those that technology to increase output because the more they produce the more support or the higher their income will be
alright so they haven't become
they haven't become UNK in the same way as the eastern european car manufacturers might have done
erm so we've got resources are always going to be taken out of the most efficient sectors if we if we use protectionism
what happens what other effects have there been as a result of protectionism in agricultural trade
trade is reduced relatively but it's had impacts on the world market
what has the world market become
what's happening to prices
artificially UNK
well UNK yes that that's true
domestic farmers receive high higher prices but what happens to the world market
that's good erm yes there's a there's a continuing debate as to whether agricultural prices have fallen right but it appears that agricultural prices have in have indeed fallen over the over the last century
right there's been a decline if you think back to our that marketing we did in agricultural transformation process one of the results of that model was that the prices of agricultural goods relative to manufactures would fall over time right
and this seems to this seems to have occurred
erm i've got some more statistics here that er right i mean there have been the reason why it's difficult to pick out trend long run trends in agricultural prices is because in very sort of erm short periods throughout any long sample alright there will be very high agricultural prices
alright simply because erm there is UNK demand alright and if there's a very bad crop throughout the world prices will suddenly just sky rocket for one or two years so that makes it difficult to pick out an underlying trend because sometimes agricultural prices are very high
but by and large when we take out these very unusual or exceptional years agricultural prices do seem to have fallen
erm let me just see in the report if you look at the nineteen eighties erm yes between nineteen eighty and nineteen eighty nine the volume of agricultural trade alright grew by twenty six percent alright now that was a third of the growth of manufactures alright manufactures were growing by nearly ninety percent over that period alright
during that same period food export prices fell by eleven percent alright whereas manufactured export prices of manufactured exports rose by twenty percent
how much did it fall by
eleven percent
okay
manufactured goods
rose by twenty percent
okay
protectionism also leads to price UNK on world markets
why might protectionism lead to UNK
if we think if we assume there's a world a world market for say wheat right
UNK growing virtually throughout the world right
if there's a supply side shock erm if we take bad weather in say the northern UNK that's going to affect prices but because there are some producers who sell on the world market who come from the southern UNK right perhaps there's good weather in the southern UNK and that's because there's a larger geographical area over which erm production is spread it's less likely that we we're going to see major UNK in supply right and as a result it's less likely that we're going to see major UNK in price
now if you contrast that with the UNK case we say virtually in the whole of western europe japan erm to a lesser extent america but the main consuming areas for say a UNK like wheat right they're all self sufficient
let's assume they're all self sufficient the world market essentially becomes a residual market it's not the market place where everyone goes any longer it's the market where just a few people will go
those countries that are not self sufficient who can't afford to have erm er expensive agricultural support policies in place
because the market becomes much smaller right there is world trade in agricultural products has fallen relatively speaking right as a result that market is going to be very UNK it only takes say er bad harvest in UNK or er australia in one country that doesn't have support programmes to affect the world market substantially because that one supplier is now relatively large because most major erm countries are self are now self sufficient
so the world market is a bit of UNK it's not a world market right it's a residual market
right UNK the erm the suppliers and consumers of all those countries that don't have that aren't self sufficient
and seeing that most countries are self sufficient either through well primarily through protectionism in that UNK going to be very UNK it's going to very susceptible to changes in output from one region or UNK or one country
and this is why one of the reasons why we've seen we've witnessed increased price UNK over the last forty years right it's because world markets have tended to become much more residual much less world much less UNK
why's that been the case
well it's because protectionism has meant has led to self sufficiency in the main er in the main consuming countries
okay right erm tell me tell me something wheat and cotton
you were asked to collect some data on wheat and cotton
what er what have you found out then
for wheat er total world trade has increased over the last thirty years from er it's there somewhere er from about sixty from forty one thousand three hundred and seventy seven thousand UNK tonnes to er to about eighty four thousand four hundred and four thousand UNK tonnes
right
somewhere in that region so it's increased a lot but trade say in europe has decreased in wheat over that period
okay so we've been saying that i mean clearly i mean that that's good evidence to suggest that world trade in absolute terms in agricultural goods is increasing but as a proportion of world trade erm it's er we know we know that we know that it it's falling
right now i've got some data here which says let's just have a look er well the important point is that oh yes okay erm i'll just read this out developed countries dominate most aspects of world agricultural trade as UNK or UNK they were involved in eighty seven percent of all world trade in nineteen eighty eight
now some fifty percent of this commerce takes place among developed countries
over of which half over half is accounted for by intra UNK transactions under the common agricultural policy
right so nearly ninety percent of all world trade right occurs between developed countries
can you just repeat those figures again please
yes eighty seven percent right in nineteen eighty eight of world agricultural trade was between developed countries
erm right now half of that erm eighty seven percent of world agricultural trade half of that is accounted for right by intra UNK trade in agricultural goods
okay so the european community there are a lot of world ag a lot of world trade right it's not world trade it's trade within the european community right and that trade has been UNK by the common agricultural policy
right so although world wheat trade has risen there okay a lot of that world wheat trade will have been the u k selling wheat to germany and er germany selling wheat to the u to the u k
alright so a lot of that world trade will be intra UNK not what we would think of as world trade because they're both very inefficient producers they're just selling er inefficient products to one another
right erm i think yes we'd better we'd probably better leave it there
what i recommend you look at i don't think it's on your reading list no it's not it's not on your reading list but there are copies of it in the library
you get a very good feel for world trade and the problems that are currently in the news at the moment with gatt it's a book entitled current issues in agricultural economics right current issues in ag UNK it's UNK by er the one and only tony UNK and er david UNK so UNK and UNK are the UNK
how do you spell UNK
r a y n e r and that's your head of department in case erm so if you look in that book in chapter four right there's er agricultural trade and the gatt if you look er if you read that chapter it'll give you all the information you need to know about erm agricultural trade erm how it's changed what the costs there are a lot of estimates of the costs of agricultural protectionism and as the benefits to UNK of er of trade and also it gives er a view of erm er the UNK round of gatt
why agriculture has been introduced in into the gatt negotiations after forty after forty years
why has it taken forty years for agriculture to be incorporated
but i think there's a couple of copies in the in the library erm because this UNK often used in other in other years
if you just have look at that chapter four that will give you a some good erm some good information some good statistics
right okay i think we'll wrap it up there thanks very much
testing
alright okay
what did what did anybody do
did you do the migration
no
i think the mi yes no one did the migration one apart from the dean he did a UNK er essay
well i think what we'll have a look at is this er mi migration essay
erm what i'll also do we'll only sort of talk for about twenty five minutes about the essay and then we'll look at sh writing short answers er for the exam
erm sorry when are we having a tutorial next term
erm i don't think we will be
we won't
i think this is our last tutorial for this UNK
right
for development or UNK trade
you may well have an ex erm
one with another one
a tutorial with you know somebody else for health or banking or you know whatever
yes cos if you think about it we've had two banking we've had two everything
two we haven't had two banking have we
we've got two of everything or we've got two of everything to come
we've got two management
so that means that okay supposing we have a tutorial does that mean we haven't got anything next term until the exams start
mhm
some UNK perhaps have some lectures you know for
you may you may have UNK the lectures are supposed to finish at the end of this term but if you know a lecturer has been ill or hasn't managed to get through the stuff erm you may have some lectures next term but er
they said that at someone from third year last year er she said that professor is having an extra lecture you know telling what's on the exam those things
well if he tells you he's er he's in the UNK minority
er he may he may be you'll have to ask him but generally speaking he does have er
yes
you'd think he'd er target to finish early this term
yes well we'll just ask you to lecture us
yes that's right i mean he should you know the lecturer should say this is the last lecture of term
the last lecture of the UNK
now what they try and do is finish at the end of this term so you've got from now on until mid january to revise erm but you may have
or if you do
you may you may you may have the er you may have some lectures and possibly some tutorials next term although i doubt it
it just depends on how behind people are
okay
erm so the title of er this migration essay is something i what are the factors erm so in your opinion no not the right one
i've got it here
can somebody can someone
what factors influence rural UNK urban migration decisions in l d cs and how can they effect the level of unemployment
ah right okay so what factors influence rural urban migration er in l d cs and how can these affect the level of urban unemployment
okay
so what factors do influence migration in developing countries
we took UNK into economic and non economic
it does seem a sensible way to approach things possibly
what er what sort of factors are important
differences of income
differences of income
okay income differentials yes so presumably the larger the differential between urban and rural wages the er the more or the greater the incentive
education
why education i mean
because erm the greater the education er supposedly increases your chance of getting a job opens up more opportunities up for you so erm you know if there's only a certain number of jobs the one with the most education is more likely to get it
okay
erm and all
wait a second can we leave education
what about you know if someone is relatively well educated and they come from an urban rural area why don't they get a job in the rural area using those qualifications
cos there isn't any
right okay that's the er that's the er long and short of it by and large there isn't erm employment er there are very few erm administrative type jobs
also to add to that is that erm we know that a great of basically UNK sort of under employed there's a lot of under employment in agriculture
and erm so the there's more opportunity to actually improve your situation by being in an urban area erm by UNK even internationally to improve your situation
basically people are UNK their situations in agriculture
they're born into maximum situations
right so they're
in the majority of cases i would say there's probably a few there
okay so the there what you're saying is that the rural wage is a sub a subsistence wage which is im by definition sort the minimum wage you require to live on and er there are possibilities of much higher incomes else elsewhere so the subsistence wage itself may well act as quite er strong sort of push factor out of the rural areas let alone erm high wages in er the urban areas
cost of migration
okay what's what do you mean by that
well erm there is a cost involved in moving from physically moving from one to the other and also when you have to weigh up er costs of moving your family or the risks involved and things like that so that's all involved in that
erm and for some people well for the whole of the rural economy it's harder to or they're in a lesser income situation and it's also availability of credit or access to funds is much you know people have less savings and so forth because they don't save
they employ it and put it back into the land if they do make anything
okay
so you know for a lot of i wouldn't say a lot but there is a group in the population that are basically concerned with just surviving in agriculture and wouldn't even consider even if they are say have got a high UNK or something they just physically can't migrate because of the cost
okay yes that's fine
true
did anything else
do they automatically get jobs if they move
UNK
okay so the probability of getting a job is going to be quite important
erm the amount of information available determines on the probability of thereby you can reverse it round and say the amount of unemployment
so like we know we can we see on television the rates of unemployment say in france and germany and so forth so that influences our decision to up say to liverpool or edinburgh somewhere and influences our decision to migrate
now it's a bit different because normally we apply to a job in glasgow we might get it or we might not but you look at we've got more of information but in less developed countries that information is even if it were collected sometimes it's not even collected erm it's not widely available so people's perceptions or hearsay from people who've gone before is the information and that's often erm wrong
and even if it was close to being right say the unemployment is say twenty percent it doesn't account for like under employment in the in the informal sector and things like that
so is lack of information or lack of relevant information is that why we get this apparent paradox of erm people UNK from rural to urban areas despite there is in actual fact twenty or thirty percent unemployment in the urban areas and the migrants have very little chance of ever getting a job
is that is that a reason
yes
yes does that carry much weight do you think
don't know
well there's one school of thought says yes that is why we get this apparent paradox of people UNK right when we actually have very high unemployment
you know what are you UNK for
well it's to get a job to improve your living standards
alright and perhaps the reason why people are UNK when there is very high unemployment is because they don't realize that there is such high unemployment
but that sort of view has been has been challenged in more in more recent years with empirical studies saying erm er sort of rural labour forces is quite likely to migrate or some parts of the rural labour force are quite likely to migrate right and it is rational to migrate even in the presence of very high unemployment
but the what are they measuring
how is unemployment measured they're measuring it in the formal sector and you can actually live by being employed in the informal sector which is often not recorded
okay
so i believe it's alright to say well people will migrate in the presence of it's rational for a person to migrate in the presence of high unemployment if high unemployment only refers to the formal sector but it's not rational if it implies that it refers to informal and formal
well could it be well it still could be
can i just ask a question
mm
right you said that the reason is there's lack of information so that's why people migrate because they don't realize they're not going to get a job
and the counter arguments to this is that there isn't lack of information people know they're not going to get a job but they're still better off to move so that's a rubbish theory
is that what you're saying
mm that's right i mean that's what sort of people like harrison sort of were saying is that it it's still rational to move even in the presence of very high very high unemployment
okay
why
why is that the case well tell me why might people why might you move to a if you were a rural UNK why might you move to erm to an urban area where you knew there were some jobs
because they're most likely to get social support if anybody's going get anything
how do you mean UNK
well if they start introducing measures to help the people out who are if you're in an urban area like in a UNK they're more likely to help those people first
be it
i don't i don't know
be it the expected
interesting theory
is about the expected wage and he says that people erm base their decision a rational mind would base his decision on erm probability of getting a job times the erm urban wage rate equals the expected rate wage rate and he's saying that because urban wage rates are so much higher erm that unemployment rate can also be quite high and the expected gains can still be positive
mm that's right because what's what are UNK doing
they're summing expected income over all future periods
they're yes they're making a present value of
mm so they're you're doing a present value expression
so although erm current rates of unemployment are very high you may be prepared to erm to accept unemployment in the short term you know because a year down the line you may well be able to get employment
you know if particularly so if you're only on a subsistence wage in the first place
you know if not you know if you're very poor in a in a rural area you may think well look there's this chance no matter how slim of me getting a sort of proper job in the urban area thus you may well take that chance
you could you may what you may feel confident in er your employment prospects you know if you're the most able in the village or you know in your little sort of social environment
UNK
UNK or whatever
you know you may you may be the best and therefore think you have a or have a high opinion of yourself and therefore try your luck you know if somebody must be getting those jobs it could be me
erm rather than so people may make rational decisions and this is what harrison were taking about is that erm it still may be rational to move even though there's very high unemployment alright simply because people may accept a period of erm of unemployment if it means that they in the long run obtain a relatively high paid job
erm we can do a little design round here
time on this axis and wages rates rural wage or against urban wages
now this is saying that that's the wage rate in er in a rural centre
so if we just add up over sort of the time horizon of this person this person's life right his expected wage in agriculture right it's going to be this area here
alright if erm if we now so this is going to be his sort of his opportunity cost right his wage rate in the rural sense is going to opportunity cost and the sum of the opportunity cost over time right is going to be the present you know if we discount that by some er if we turn it into a present a present value right the present value of that sum there right will determine life times income in agriculture
right if we oh ah right let's not discount it right now let's just explain this again
this is the wage rate in agriculture right now if we discount sorry i've made a cock up of this that's erm that's not discounted right if we discounted it's going to look
why just discount it and then
well it's just that you know a pound or a hundred pounds today is not the same as a hundred pounds in a year's time or two years' time
right
so that would be opportunity cost
that's right yes that's right so in actual fact this area here right is going to be the discounted sum of all future rural incomes
alright now if we look at the rural instead of the urban wage rate right up here alright now let's just say that it takes that amount of time before this individual gets a job in the urban area alright now if we discount alright the erm the rural the urban wages right that's all this
why have you just discounted it to there
sorry
why have you discounted it to w r
well it's well er there's no need why that should be the case it could be you know it could look something like that
but up in the there the UNK decision making process will be is this area here right is that area there greater than that area there
alright so this is the discounted sum in er in non agriculture in the urban area and this is the value the discounted sum in agriculture
now clearly on the on the way i've drawn this diagram it is
right but that's going to depend on right not only the wage differential now if the wage differential is very large it's likely that this discounted sum is going to you know be larger than that
but it also depends on the time it takes to get the job
i mean if we got a job somewhere out here then it clearly wouldn't be
so it's this it's the time taken to get this erm er to get the job's going to be important
now if we think of w u as being er the expected value of the urban wage and that equals the probability of getting a job multiplied by the actual urban wages alright then this probability of getting a job is going to be important as well
and that's it then UNK diagram but what more have we got
an urban wage a rural wage right we discount those wages over time right and that area there UNK the area in the blue sort of box then this it's erm it's going to be rational for this er UNK this person to become a UNK
even though i mean this doesn't say anything about unemployment levels of unemployment
UNK the level of unemployment is UNK between well within the time it takes to get a job and also the probability of getting a job
alright
so this sort of even that's just what the harrison model erm tells us right so that's unemployment rates are virtually erm UNK in the UNK decision
unemployment rates now it's because they may well be if they're acting UNK discount over a very large long period of time
okay just er just to ask is this erm migration it does it cause a problem
i mean i thought that migration was the er would be the cure of all UNK in that you know we've got wage differentials here in this in this hypothetical economy
surely if you migrate that increases the supply of labour it reduces the supply of labour in the rural sector it increases the supply of labour in er the urban sector unless wage rates should UNK
no
what why don't why doesn't why don't wage rates UNK
because erm the urban sector is normally considered to be capital intensive a sector and the rural area in l d cs are considered more labour intensive and so erm obviously when you get an UNK of labour and changes to the capital to labour ratio
mhm
erm and you would see er a shift in capital to agriculture as the return on capital in urban falls
mhm
and this would you would think because there's a shift back of capital to agriculture you'd get a rise in agricultural wage rates because that changes the capital to labour ratio again and so this would UNK the movement
however there is a problem capital is not perfectly mobile like you can apply a new machine into well maybe you could cos that's
whatever you can't apply the urban type of capital back onto the land so it's okay to say this would work if capital was completely and perfectly mobile but it isn't so you don't get that and you don't get balanced growth of that
because er everything shifts in the wrong direction
that's right i mean in order to UNK wages between sector labour and also capital has to be perfectly mobile
now if it's not we know that labour isn't perfectly mobile it appeared migration would seem to suggest it's pretty mobile geographically but it may not be particularly mobile UNK
so that these people go to the urban areas to get the jobs they're not trained erm for these jobs right and as a result these wages rates still may still be maintained despite the fact there are lots of people who are quite happy to take wages erm in take up jobs in the urban sectors it's the fact that sort of employers don't want them because they don't have the UNK skills
also where what are the erm what're the highest paid jobs in the urban sector
they are essentially in developing countries
they are essentially government jobs
right
now er without wishing to UNK too much UNK you know it's not what you know it's who you know are very important factors in er in employment in developing countries
and as a result they are
it's much nicer to say UNK you promise to say UNK
ah UNK okay that's er a nice UNK to see the
then you don't like UNK people
that's right in that erm you're the probability of you getting a well paid job is greatly enhanced if not guaranteed if you know er the people who are employing you
and this sort of thing goes is UNK in developing countries
i mean the old boy network is pretty bad in this country but er it's similar sorts of things go on in developing countries and because there's much less of an industrial sector there the government sector itself erm plays a very important role in employment
now was it you UNK who had some statistics some saying er what proportion
fine i've got i've got to use UNK statistics to
well it works erm there were some
yes
i can't remember if it was you or somebody else had er some data as to how many of the er jobs in urban areas where the government
i put erm studies by helen and UNK nineteen eighty three found public sector employment UNK forty four percent of non agricultural employment in twenty l d cs and in extreme cases were UNK and UNK were as high as seventy eight and eighty one percent respectively
and i think he quote those or they didn't quote them in much as much detail as i did in the lectures
i'd got these figures down but i hadn't really got anything against them he just quickly went through the percentages so yes
okay so
and developed countries UNK twenty four percent so it's twice as much as developed countries
right so given sort of erm public and semi public institutions right represent a large proportion of the non agricultural erm employment opportunities and as a result alright the rates of pay in the in the civil service essentially are going to going to determine erm the urban the urban wage rate
now if those erm wages in the civil service are set not through sort of market process but sort of through institutional er constraints you know it's unlikely there's going to be sort of er union power erm in these sorts of jobs but nevertheless civil servants tend to do quite well at giving themselves pay increases
conservative government
and er and as a result you know UNK the wages in government bodies tend to be quite high and because UNK government bodies represent such a large proportion of er non agricultural employment they represent a much more sort of a much more UNK influence than they would do in a in a developed country where the government sector is much smaller
erm okay what was the importance of implication of er harrison model
there was one policy implication
that what was it that erm people still move
obviously we that right people will still move if UNK high but if you try if the government tries and gets rid of UNK urban unemployment say people have moved because of it so there's unemployment there to start with because of the reasons we've discussed earlier so then the government said okay well let's get rid of the unemployment that has occurred already by erm either at the same wage rate trying to well yes the same they'll keep wage rates the same but erm increase you know make the public sector bigger or do something to create urban jobs and basically all it will do is encourage more migrants because they'll see the probability of getting a job will increase so the expected wage will increase so you'll get migration on top of what's already occurring
and erm you won't solve anything
that's right so if you want to try and erm minimize urban unemployment right or it's UNK to try and minimize urban unemployment by erm er establishing employment er job creation schemes in urban areas because that will increase the probability of getting a job if you're a UNK
right so there are these government job creation schemes alright
now because it's typically observed in the harrison model shows this under certain circumstances to be the case that erm a sort of erm migration elasticity with respect to income differentials right is much greater than the erm
the rate of unemployment the level of unemployment
that's right yes that's right because erm there's a UNK there's a higher elasticity of migration UNK in respect to income differentials than there is to unemployment any job creation schemes will lead to more migration rather than rather than less so how best to get round the problem
if job creation schemes aren't in urban areas are the best way to get round them isn't it if we can show quite simply that job creation schemes lead to more migration which lead to more unemployment
the UNK self repeating what policies might
a policy of cross training for all areas
okay yeah so what might those what form might those policies take what might they be
on it
yes population controls that's right that's one i mean one reason one way of getting rid of the migration is to is to is to limit population growth
where's the population growth highest
it's at its highest in rural areas this is what's being done
erm population control is always focused out in the rural areas the most difficult place to do it because populations are dispersed er that's where population growth right is the highest
any other
making incentives to actually raise the wage rates in the in the rural areas so sort of to increase production or and through farming
to improve their situation
right yeah
improve their wages through farming and perhaps
that's right
put more infrastructure in so that then the farmers can send their children to school rather than work on the land
yeah that's right what we want to try and do is to improve the erm the returns to agriculture which is the main form of er sort of income in rural areas
i mean if you do things like that while improving infrastructure erm setting up credit government credit facilities er so we can lend we could lend money to small farms
increase in information about UNK unemployment itself that is a that is a problem people have this UNK about the probability of getting a job
you could also erm start to recognize the benefit of the rural sector and one reason why they were UNK l d cs tended to want to ignore that and sort of UNK it because it's not sort of a UNK image they were trying to hope for in the urban sector and so if they did help them say give them units like the repair men units to work in and they put them in really totally UNK accommodation and up not where you need it and not where people pass by with their UNK and things they they'd put them somewhere up on a hill UNK a city so erm to encourage the informal sector by erm sort of on a par with the formal sector because erm their inter reacting inter relating now like they're providing cheap inputs for the formal industries and the formal industries are pro providing UNK all for the informal sector and so it's all inter linked and it's there now
it's not going to disappear cos it's quite a large part of urban areas
they could do that
yes we want to try and improve resource allocation in the economy and one way of doing that is not necessarily UNK agricultural production but remove the taxes on agricultural growth
alright and effectively what's happening is that the government sectors in erm in developing countries are very highly subsidized
right they're UNK alright they have very high wages alright er that is one of the major courses of er causes of resource mis allocation it's this very large very inefficient government sector
and er one way to get people to stay on the land is to introduce some sort of what we might call market disciplines if that wasn't such a dirty word er into the government the government sector where there are clear UNK
okay right erm it's nearly time to go but before we do can i just give you some bits and pieces you may well have copies of last year's exam paper but if you haven't this is for development and integration of trade er have a look at those sorts of essays you're being asked to do
but also look as those er those short answers now it's important that you answer the short answer questions well alright because it's a lot easier to get good marks on a short answer question providing you do it well than it is on a long answer question
alright erm but most people don't UNK don't answer short answer questions very well at all and that's why they get low marks for them
always re bear in mind that whenever you do a short answer question right you've only got fifteen minutes to do it in
right there isn't a great deal that you can get in fifteen minutes
but what you must have right is a definition of erm the er sort of thing that you're asked to write about
i mean factor price UNK intra industry measuring intra industry trade UNK intervention UNK dumping they're all jargon bits of jargon effect effectively so you must you must have a definition
right now although the UNK in industrial UNK within countries alright now although you can't really define that you might be able to say something about industrial UNK
you know it's fairly obvious what it is but with most of these will require a definition
right so you must put a definition a definition in there
an example of it in use and you must have ex what i'm saying it's very important to have empirical erm examples in your essays right because they will also be required in the short answer questions as well
right you know what is an example of erm UNK dumping
right now you may erm don't know anything in particular but i know that the european community and the united states are always trying to out erm beat each other in terms of subsidies on food products so put that in
UNK dumping erm you know one very good example would be agricultural trade between european community and erm and america
alright if it's a so you you've got to have a definition alright you must have a an example of it in action
any form of empirical evidence is useful alright erm sometimes you know you're asked you know what is the effective protection or define or write brief a brief essay on effective protection right you'll want to say something there about how it's measured
now what essentially what you're doing is that you're writing an essay in very UNK form so it's just i mean you still must have the same recipe in there when you write a short answer right but you just have to be very brief so you know para paragraph on definition you know paragraph of examples right erm paragraph on some sort of explanation or erm how it's how it's measured erm has it been a contentious issue erm what are the problems with this er with this concept erm right you've got to get those sort of things in there like you would in an essay if you were asked to write an essay on UNK dumping you'd have all those things in there right but you only need to write a sentence a sentence about them
you know nobody's expecting three or four sides right you've got quarter of an hour not erm you know if you can write a side a half you you'll be doing much better than most people alright so you're just thinking about a side really depending on how big your handwriting is
but you must have you know don't UNK on about the same thing right cos for any more than a couple of sentences cos then you know you c start entering into sort of UNK marginal returns very quickly on these short answer questions what you want to do is sort of say a sentence about as much as you can rather than go into in depth discussion about erm any particular aspect
alright so it's a bit of er a sort of UNK type of approach that you've got that you've got to use
get a definition in get an application in get empirical evidence in get measurement problems in erm get sort of contentious issues type of or criticisms in erm don't draw don't do diagrams as they're probably the only the only principal difference between this and an essay you just haven't got the time right so don't be tempted unless you can do a very quick diagram that sum sums it up
alright i don't recommend doing diagrams cos you spend five ten minutes drawing the diagram and explaining you know what the curves are on it erm so you don't really need to draw diagrams in these short answer questions
again that's only a general principle
occasionally you might be but erm if i can if you look at er the erm the european UNK erm short answers right they've actually given you an except there a UNK diagram right
question one question two alright
it's a pretty complicated diagram i wouldn't expect you to draw that in fifteen minutes and explain the
if they give you a diagram like that can you just talk about the lines you don't have to say what they are
no that's right yes
basically you could say like with gains or something gains are a b c
yes
that's right
i reckon that's the way that
it will be UNK it will be assumed that yes
everything on there is known about that just specific areas
alright but you know you've got so little time you know fifteen minutes is very short period of time so whatever you say
not wanting to UNK
what i do recommend you do is er you know use these short answers in your in your revision and sort of you know revise on say interim district trade and then just write a question in fifteen minutes and you realize that you can't really write very much and it's good discipline because once you've made the mistake you know of writing you know two paragraphs on some aspect of it you realize you haven't got any time to do anything else
you won't hopefully you won't make that mistake again so short sweet UNK answers to these erm these short answer questions
don't bother doing diagrams get a sentence in on everything you know right although it's not
