well that doesn't sound very sophisticated to say these are the questions when you just write everything you know about a particular issue
but they are you do straight out what you can think up about it
yes that's essentially it
apart from the essays
write anyway for thirty minutes
not quite the same approach there but i mean it's not everything you know but write something about everything you know about
alright
the short answers
a sentence on everything you can think of that relates to it but if you do practise them it's only just to talk about it it's difficult to know what you can write in fifteen minutes
right i'm here UNK virtually throughout the UNK erm i'll be here until the beginning of next term so if you are having problems of any sort or want me to run through something with you just er feel free to disturb me
sorry
it's alright so come along and see me if you have any problems it's much better you talk it over with me before the problem gets out of hand
alright so come and see me as soon as the problems start to emerge and i can probably tell you that you're wasting time and energy worrying about it so
we're going to sit and
so er come and see me before you know if you are having any problems just come along
okay don't forget to have a few days break over christmas don't work all the time have a jolly good time
see you next year
yes bye
i think it actually does end up by saying have a nice day
oh
have you changed the disk before you get anything
read the s read the screen
thank you
i'm very glad you're here
i UNK i definitely should have done this tomorrow night
or th or last night
last night would have been very nice actually
right disk number four
three
which you might have already had actually but it did say insert three
i had three ready here
right
and you can it's alright it'll only ask and say i don't like it put the proper one in silly UNK
probably yeah
yeah it's got all these little pop up utilities
i don't know what the parents of some of my students are going to think when i'm showing them how to do g c s e maths on the computer instead of the rather
er it's not a problem it just er it shows up in odd little corners of the
oh one of the things it'll load shortly is er
files
ooh
pretty sounds through the speaker
i do like that and it is so easy to do and
mm
it's been proved
well worth it
time and time again hasn't it
people don't mind waiting if they know
the frustration
how long they're waiting for
exactly
er yeah you get loads of nice things you get UNK er UNK
card file even
er you get you get quite a good editor just comes free with windows
mm
quite a good word processor
a word processor
which is UNK it's basically a UNK of word
erm
mm
it looks a lot nicer than works and yo it allows you to obviously it allows you to access windows UNK which is a great advantage
this is the reason i wanted it
yeah
is to have UNK and then i
yeah
you've got a super UNK selection
erm
right
it lacks some capabilities of microsoft works
mm
i mean obviously what they want you to do is buy word
yeah
erm er for example s
mm
UNK tried to persuade sue to ask er them if the they could all change to word at work
are they on UNK wordperfect at work
yeah
and stuck on it for life i think
all the ones the old secretaries who've been using it for years think it's absolutely wonderful
mm
i d i don't think
think it's so bad
i you know
mm
it is UNK in the sense that it doesn't
yeah
i think it's things like i was trying to do setup last night i was trying to set page length you know paper size and
yeah
erm the default UNK
and they're all on different menus and they're a you're trying all sorts of different keys
f one i don't i don't f three f one
mm
f one f one to get your keys up your
yeah
UNK for your keys and try and find out which one does what
oops a new disk
UNK
course there are versions of windows for the two eight six
yes
i wonder if that would be worth getting
probably not
i think they've probably lost the backward UNK by now
erm they're somewhat cheaper
they weren't very good
no
erm
huge complaints at the time weren't there
UNK i think were selling them about sort of fifteen quid each
erm i've got a three eight six version
windows three eight six is no good to you
no
in one of the er UNK was selling i think
right
it was like windows one that was it said the last windows version that would run on two eight sixes
you playing with your mouse again
no i'm just turning the UNK up
oh
oh it's got a UNK er database called UNK
yeah
you know if you were just keeping your
yeah
records collection on it or something
i was i i've always said
actually it would be ideal for these wouldn't it for these tapes
yeah keep your accounts
set records for that and just
i only got it cos we were going to run this d t p package
mm
and erm when i when i installed it i was very UNK surprised at the basically at the number of useful little applications that they threw in with it
mm
i think it's great for the price
oh
i was reading the other day th you can check this out
there's supposed to be something in here called erm it's an UNK feature of windows three point one an
or
n er n no it's a it's a it's a an er UNK utility
ah
for
yes
er dos or something called a d m or something like or d m a or i dunno what
yeah i read that
but it's just hanging about somewhere
yeah
so i guess you just do a directory of all the UNK files and see if there's anything in there erm but i like diagnostic programs
does it set up a lot of directories
just two i think one within the other
i think it sets up windows
i like
and windows flash system
good
well that's tidy the way i like it
mm
smart drive going in the new smart drive p presumably it will put my mouse UNK my new mouse driver in for me for the day when i want one
think so
and then i can ah well i'll try a i don't know whether to try a mouse or a UNK
i should have had UNK in there and then it would have picked up the UNK driver
mm
but presumably i can put a mouse driver in later
yeah you can just
yeah
get once your windows
is running it has its own setup menu
yeah
which you can go to and p
mm
do things like that
i've read a bit about sort of erm there's a special editor for a system file isn't there
erm i don't know much about that
there's
th a
th there's basically there's an UNK it has an ordinary editor which is sub right it's an UNK editor that appears in a window and it's for using for editing the UNK files
but i don't know UNK much about the system part of windows
well this is this compared to wordperfect is an absolute dream
i only actually sort of drink want a coffee or something
yeah yes please
there's one of my UNK you see
what's that
erm when i'm doing things like loading things that are close to the operating system i don't turn UNK on
avoid UNK
oh dear
i almost turn the fridge off but not quite no
i think oh well so what you know the fridge is going on a lot
mm
the kettle
yeah
they got all these stupid fucking suggestions now would be a great time to remove the serial number
now would be a great time to get off my screen and go back to microsoft
are they going to ask for this at the end of the installation
i dunno
hey
type UNK
oh better
ones than that
that's just the beginning
bold
now this is this is going at a fantastic rate
yeah
compared to the wordperfect
UNK ten fifteen
it hasn't asked me any questions about how weird my machine is or wh what are you doing with an amstrad or anything
modern
er i think
and this is the other thing that
yeah
o UNK d l stuff i can just whip stuff from spreadsheets to word UNK and st stick it on a UNK
supposedly i think there are problems with it working
i er i ge end up never really tackled these problems but i have heard UNK that
mm
erm not enough people UNK enough implement o l e in their applications
file
yeah
or you'd be able to exchange it
so the capability is there but not used
UNK we've got a version of it
what's this
UNK
UNK
we've got a version of UNK that doesn't write
there you go times roman in
hey
that's a cambridge i think
that's a UNK one that
yeah
it's a good one
yeah
i've got erm proportional space code which is very similar to it on the microsoft works
have you got UNK
depends on your printer
yeah
driver
UNK
mm
i did have a UNK times
has this got erm joined up writing as well
two types
er don't remember
it's got all kinds of funny ones
UNK
it might ask you a question about the a twenty driver
it should be okay actually
erm dos five was one of the best buys i ever made because
there's something there called w s swap i wonder if that's a word processor to word processor UNK another UNK feature
i think
i s i never really played with windows i just installed it to do the job of running this one application and then left it alone
well i
i got it cos sue needs to know i mean the things they do at her work are just unbelievable
mm
i mean there's one woman there working on a three eight sixes twenty five UNK and she works off the floppy all the time she doesn't use the hard drive
she's got an eighty UNK hard drive
yeah presumably it's what she's used to she's used to floppy
it's what she's used to
and she was sort of telling sue to do this and sue said this isn't is it
and i'm thinking work on your work on your hard drive and when you've got it the way you want it and when you've got it the way you want it save it to the floppy and
yeah
erm n they won't buy disks they got about twenty sort of UNK heads
yeah
and they can all give them work
there are about half a dozen who regularly do and
yeah
say you need a box of disks for each of them
yeah
and you keep their work on their disks and if they want it
yeah
doesn't belong to the UNK it belongs to the
mm
the UNK head
and if she wants to do her own bit of typing and give it to someone else sh
b selection
right no printer attached so i will have a
you need your mouse
a UNK
can i page down
you can probably cursor down yeah
or tab
cursor down
tab will move you to a different part of the
erm page
se search
down
yeah should be able to do that you might even be able to jump by typing initial letter
erm
but i doubt it
y yes
ah there you go
i did i didn't doubt it for a minute i thought i know this
which one have you got
i've got the k x b one hundred and twenty four
that's a huge one that is
it really is
yeah
it doesn't do colour
well what do you expect
okay
erm
that's all i want really
good
you might not know how to select multiple ones but
erm if i want another one i
ah do you know what you want
i do want
what's e p t is that like a network
ooh i don't know
printer port or something i've never seen that before on a menu
e p t e p t crunch
now wordperfect did that
mm
it UNK about on it
mm
and
UNK
and ever since then er well the only thing i've done on it since then is to just er sue loaded
mm
wordperfect on it to compare it with the other one and it was i er said
presumably it's just UNK your
yeah
i said i'm going to have to clear that and delete a bit of stuff off and load it with and load wordperfect again
do you want to use my disk
UNK ce UNK
yes i would love to i would love to erm ooh look at that
that's so cool
yeah i've wanted to
UNK me disk
about the last month or so i've felt it getting slower
and you haven't got a utility to do it you just have to take it out and put it back on again
yeah
yeah
erm UNK
wow
oh this is where it er loads all your applications
er this i don't understand i UNK up at this stage
right
setup needs to know the application name for dos edit
select the application name form the following list and choose okay or press enter and its dos editor
it is in fact it is that isn't
that's what i would call it yeah
yeah
so it was a good guess there
mm
you got gem have you
yeah
the disks that might work
real gem
real gem
log off
the gem
gem
well i've got one that came with erm UNK which is it works properly and
mm
it looks nice
mm
ah this looks UNK though
yeah
let's see
power
that's okay
that's that is works two isn't it
yeah that's works two
i could i would very much like works for windows some time
perhaps we can
mm
buy it between us one day
might buy it
the people upstairs who must have got it
and the i had a look at it once it did look a bit
it is
UNK
it is better it's got erm there are things i think one of the i'm
yeah
not sure but i think one of the things is
yeah that's right
erm that you can have character UNK as the arguments of functions in the spreadsheet and database
bloody ages doing things like if mode so and so to work out whether it's a monday or a tuesday or something and then trying and everything else to try and get
yeah
set something to a monday
mm
erm that was okay wasn't it
no
ah
right sorry that's erm none of those
okay so that was loading w p fifty one
doesn't it allow to type in
i don't know
you do it late okay
yeah
ah that's an old version of it works
so should i say none of those
might as well i don't know
i'll say none of those because
yeah
in case they don't want to handle because it's going to yeah and it's gonna get it's just a backup for works
mm
for a quick and dirty on the same disk
ooh it knows about wordperfect
it would
UNK office and all sorts of things it knows about
slow
i don't think o s two runs windows faster than that
somehow
it's quite a fast hard drive you've got isn't it
it's a
you've got g w basic and m s microsoft basic
yeah
i'm getting rid of one of those
so they'll all get UNK now they'll appear as UNK on your er applications
on m on my highly
oh that's good i can go round
and your mouse driver still doesn't work
er well there's no point running the tutorial until
go to mouse
yeah er so the tutorial
exit setup exit setup
n er s UNK skip tutorial don't exit the setup no exit the setup might eliminate further setup
right
steps
okay right okay
skip tutorial
probably exit
yeah
i wasn't thinking there
now setup remove any UNK from your drives thank you i'd forgotten
yes i always d forget that
we'll leave the last one in
soft boot UNK your computer
so erm if i
we turn him over to dos first and modify your mouse driver file from
exactly
mine
mm
yeah
and my button pops in and out does it
oh well i think i'll ju i'll just play with the tab and make it pop in and out a few times
oh alright
oh
it's great isn't it
mm
right loading windows and it was just like that eh
that
mm
was that was
really UNK wasn't it considering the amount of software that was loaded
yeah
right it
funny to see how much disk space was you've got left
ah now we won't edit
first of all let's use the mouse to edit see what UNK driver it picks up
mhm
no it's not UNK it's microsoft it's amstrad mouse cos i haven't got me real mouse with
mm
me
right
mouse slash d one slash nothing default
it'll figure it out
right microsoft six point two six that's my old one
i think
maybe it reads all the microsoft
there's a i think there's oh i don't know
i think that's the old mouse driver
well when you have a look in the UNK you'll probably find that there's been a few
anyway
UNK made
we won't save their version in case we UNK it will we
er
yes we will but watch this
UNK my mouse off
UNK
it works
oh good
good what i though it was
i haven't got a mouse pad unfortunately
right erm
now what's it done
it's added s windows to your path that was very UNK of it
so rem UNK
it's put smart drive in at the front
that wasn't there before was it
er no it wasn't
smart drive goes in first eh
then comes dis it UNK out the com spec
yeah
stuck a few things hmm
it's put in front of the path hasn't it
and it's
yeah
declared a UNK variable for UNK files
okay
and i UNK out those echo on
yeah prompt
prompt
keyboard error
i UNK out the graphics
erm
was there a c colon in front of that slash dos
no there wasn't
perhaps there used to be and i lost it
well there wasn't when i first looked at that file
yeah
perhaps there was at some stage and i lost it
there doesn't need to be anyway
no got some more
well there you go
i didn't do much to that at all actually
yeah
erm i don't
need to touch that because
no
i don i don't put UNK in there i put mouse in choose which one i want it in okay
well when you UNK it then remember to type your mouse command before you start windows
it doesn't automatically boot into windows then
ah
no
win and various parameters to get it
yeah
so click on our we exit
we don't alter that
yeah
oh
yeah it will have done things like given you more files and UNK
we don't need to be editing w probably only gonna look at it now
yeah probably
no it doesn't
seem to have given you any more files and UNK
fifty perhaps
what you had before fifteen to twenty five
yeah okay
i guess you had enough
er rem shell
now you high load smart drive don't you
yeah
oh no you commented that out
or did it comment that out
i did
you did
cos you put the date in there
yeah
erm i thought that was a good idea putting the date of when i UNK it out
mm it is
i think only trouble is it's hard to put the date of when you UNK it back in
UNK it in
yes
er puts that in
right
it says in lots of we shouldn't put that in anyway but i wasn't sure what it did
i've no idea what it does
i think it's only a windows thing
okay that's fine isn't it
yeah
mm
character UNK
erm before we go anywhere
wow
i want to keep up q basic
er what do we want to do
see the survival guide
wow
erm index
that's great
you know what i have to do with my g w basic
i have to sit there like typing in random UNK to see if it's a UNK
yeah it's so easier
erm function
ah i'm not sure whether i ever did that
is the obvious one
UNK
ah
so it was worth it just for that going
yeah
into q basic
erm right
you want a copy of q basic
yes please
right well i think before we start windows i'll erm i'll UNK i i'll un rem that
this is my do it yourself manual that i just learned by trial and error
oh excellent
an ideal UNK word processor application that
okay so you can play with your own
so we'll get out of this i think okay
i mean we could load one if you want to play
where are we
er let's open something and see what we've got
erm star dot pass where does it keep its
in dos doesn't it
yeah
so over there then
e t
this is just like sort of microsoft works you can play about with that erm
yeah it's good that
dos
what is it
microsoft works is UNK written in q basic
yeah
erm UNK is throwing bananas at the UNK and you have to get that UNK right
so if you look at the source for UNK
ooh
you'll see i had to calculate UNK
yeah
erm UNK
UNK is an interesting one that i played one night and i was going cor
i can do this
let's have a quick UNK okay
loading and UNK one or two players
i c i won't be able to do any of this but you can have a quick go
erm shift f five
shift f five
okay
are you ready for this UNK
it goes creeping round and you have to pick up numbers in order
mm
mm
and you have to use your cursor keys
ah right
to turn it
you don't have to play if you don't want to
i don't think i'm capable
right okay
i wan i want to see windows going i want to see your mouse going on windows
okay you want to see the mouse going on windows
now
i'll tell you something else
yeah
on quite a few occasions windows ran until the first time i UNK the computer
oh UNK me
well if
yeah
it does that i suggest that we look at it again tomorrow
yeah that's a good idea
erm
so start your mouse d have you UNK yet
no
no i'm just thinking of using the of using UNK first no we'll do that tomorrow
no need yeah
because we it doesn't automatically draw up into windows that's what i keep thinking
right
yeah
do you think it needs a hard boot
it should UNK
w er i i've had a lots of problems with soft boots but that's cos i use UNK
mm
and funny er
mm
funny UNK
i have occasionally th just of sort of had a feeling i think i'll do a hard boot this time
UNK
is it very UNK in here or is it me
i dunno
maybe it is time to go and make a
that's alan sugar doing that isn't it
that display is UNK
yeah they erm i got dos five loaded it up and it says unable to find a twenty line and i was it was still under guarantee
mm
just about so i phoned up erm
graphics
UNK or whoever do it and erm eventually got to spoke to so get to speak to somebody
right
oh mice driver mouse driver
load your mouse driver
okay
you didn't load your mouse driver
no i will do
i only having a look at it
oh right
three eight six enhanced mode standard mode
you know all about this
there's on expanded mode and enhanced mode
the best one's is expanded mode
three eight six i reckon three eight six
you could set that up in your setup options so
right
you just start it in standard mode or in default mode
create file boot log
oh i don't remember that
how about a boot log
just in case something goes a bit wrong
sure yeah fine and
UNK for when windows does not start correctly now that is very
yeah
very confidence UNK isn't
yeah
it
ooh
well i can do with that cos i got a three eight six it should be perfectly fast
mine's
ah but you need a thirty two bit controller
yes
which you probably haven't got
four bit controller on this two bit controller
sixteen bit controller are standard
i'm sure it'll be a sixteen bit controller
yeah
i must say n nobody knows probably a two bit
okay
yeah
wrong address
er okay
you don't need any of that stuff
i probably might
it might be able to grab some er some of me video that's not being used
yeah
i just i just typed in
i will start me mouse UNK all of the
that's using video memory
so these are the include and exclude
mm
things
right let's have mouse
jolly good
that's right install
i've never thought of that as a v verb win
slash b
what for
block
block
okay
yeah alright i don't wanna UNK it though so
erm used for UNK when it doesn't start
you a d as well
you actually have to pick a sub option
does it does it mean does it does it mean that when you use d it then doesn't work
if you want it not to work use the slash b okay slash b and that's it
ah on one disk for sue this sort of woman who was there sort of telling
mm
a load of rubbish and
yeah
erm sue could probably do with spending a bit of time learning about dos but i don't see the point
i think she'd be better off spending they've got windows on the machines but they run under dos
right
erm but i don't see why she can't whenever she wants to look for files copy files and sort out other people's mess
why she doesn't erm this is the first this is it is it
ooh
nowhere
ooh
hang on
can you can we use the oh hang on num lock off can we use these
well hang on we should we should at least be able to oh
if we cursor about that's it
yeah
go into windows setup
can i cursor with these
don't know
set up the mouse
mouse microsoft oh it already thinks you've got a mouse
that's a bit of a shame
yeah we've got a wrong driver and i didn't have one in my things so i might have to UNK with a proper let's have a look in dos and see what mouse drivers it's got
or window
w i it'll be in UNK where will it keep its mouse driver in dos or windows
er
or do both
i you mean in terms of directories
yeah
er here i this is where you control it from anyway
yeah but where will the mouse driver live
the actual file
yeah
system probably but it might use them on
dos erm damn
erm
just change escape form that
just escape and then we won't have done
now we got to cursor key to go through the options
now systems now systems
ooh hang on hang on hang on hang on hang on hang on hang on hang on
what
the other one the other one is
sorry erm it isn't a bus do you think
what
this one
it's a special mouse port
oh then maybe this
actually i think it's m i would try
okay
p s two plus mouse p s two
and it's not
no well i don't think so
that UNK
see that's the
driver it's already using
yeah because that's the one it found if it doesn't find the amstrad one
mm
the amstrad is hidden and it's UNK
oh
so it's messy
so
mm
i would give it that one and i
right
think it might work
if it doesn't then we're no worse than we are at the moment really aren't we
mhm
oh dear
that's a socket that'll time for a cup of coffee i think while we have a look at and we'll have a look at the boot log file in a minute and see what it did
ee i'm glad you're here young man
let's go to m s dos and see if we can get the mouse working in m s dos
it was working wasn't it
yeah
now
mouse
something about using mouse in the in the dos box
oh this must be like mouse
right
double click test
let's have a test
er
oh this is where you really do need a mouse
yeah
changing mouse options
mm yeah very good bit confusing sometimes but
er right
what y what are you doing here
closing the closing
yeah
the window
closing and what were you doing to close it
alt er i er i a actually have three different methods there
all
mm
of them began by pressing alt in which
yeah
case the sort of top UNK menu highlighted
yeah
in some cases i opened that menu and selected exit
mhm
and some of them just hit return
if i had a mouse i just click in the top corner
yeah
which is the UNK way of doing it
right
erm
i'll have a look in drivers
change
but erm
its UNK for mouse let's have a look in drivers erm you haven't got a mouse have you
no
any other sort of mouse i could have brought me mouse with me and we could have run it off the serial port erm it's a pain that amstrad mouse
general help system
what i would like erm the UNK sell one that's amstrad compatible
so we don't want p s two mouse so it might be a it might be just a serial port there after all then
yeah i don't know
it's erm i UNK t really understand that
how that bit of hardware works
this is a er i think this is a slight UNK in the design of the interface
mhm
erm it the i the er means of closing a window is not always in the same place
here it seems that it's going be generally it's in the top left menu but some of them don't have menus
erm
right
general help mouse program manager now general help
oh i know what we can do
alt menu
erm we've already tried
oh yeah try to get into
let's go into file menu and have a look at what drivers are about
what do you mean
file manager help or file manager
er no file manager look at the fi look at the drivers that are in dos or in windows
where's your amstrad mouse driver
in the root directory i would think
when you were
this would only have looked in dos
now i'll tell you what happens
it's a weird thing erm it starts off in the root and then it erm u used a single mouse fix to patch it
and then dos dots it
erm how d how do we erm do it by er sort of d i r by extension
erm i think if it in this file menu there'll probably be an option to er t to specify
ah
a UNK
er y
name type is presumably extension is it
yeah
yeah
yes
all quite tidy
all quite tidy
drivers and stuff together then
directories
directories
and there's something called mouse
UNK mouse com mouse fix
right
right
now UNK com is for running the serial mouse
mhm
erm i mean nothing to do with this one
so what happens when you run mouse com
erm how about running
how about running
no i think you'd run mouse fix first
how about running mouse fix and see what happens
it can't make it any worse can it
shell out of dos first
oh it just gave us a nice thing saying i've fixed your mouse thank you very much
and it's i reckon
no
yeah you're right
i reckon
it's a funny thing for it to do
have a go
no it's alright
now we'll try now having fixed the mouse we'll try and run mouse com
oh i hit enter
i double UNK on it
what it might have done is that probably didn't need doing because mouse com was probably already fixed and now we're UNK it
mm well it will only be for this session anyway movement
no
erm no
so we haven't got a better mouse driver
let's get go let's have a look at dos
where's dos
it's awkward using this without a mouse
right let's get into dos directory and pick up a mouse com or a mouse driver from there erm and UNK it will copy it into the root
yeah
mm into what
we're UNK that mouse driver there because that is my old mouse driver i think
files
so a real mouse driver somewhere
well that mouse runs
mm
it runs everything erm and all you do is just say mouse
yeah
ah do i see mouse do i say mouse
you say UNK don't you
no i don't say UNK
erm have a look at
see it's working
okay so it's working it's loaded
it's alright in dos
yeah
and despite the fact that it's just been UNK
mhm
and run again it still
mhm and generally UNK about with
erm so right
UNK it start windows without running your mouse driver see if windows will run it itself
okay
soft boot
no hard boot with a mouse
mhm
want a cup of coffee while it's doing it
yeah it's definitely time for a cup of coffee
ooh
who's been painting the chair then
who's been painting my chair oh if i come into your bedroom in the night and UNK on you
yeah
it's nothing personal just i get lost
haven't we
we've got but it'll be alright
UNK i always wanted to do that i read an article somewhere this journalist
stick a pencil in
you can j you can just stick your pencil in your fan and it doesn't do any damage but
mm
it's the sort of thing you want to try on someone else's
get off
my fan stops by itself mine
yeah
wonderful
yeah
i was even thinking of
is th
paying
is that just yours then going
or
UNK fan
mine going rather
oh that's yours
yeah it's noisy this one
it's UNK my fan out
it cos i've got a three eight six see
oh that's right
a louder fan
yeah
UNK
UNK
all that energy UNK off the chip
right well i've
is that a key thingy
what's this here
don don't turn if off
that's the key
oh wow
take that off you see and no one can run programs
yeah
unless they open the case
right now i i've bought this copy of windows
i'm not sure what i've done with the instructions so it's it
oh
i suggest you start with disk one
th that's what i would say
unlike works where you start with start with disk four
disk four and then go on to
then it's disk three and then back to disk one and
oh
yeah
oh me biscuits
i'll ju i'm just going to go downstairs
oh okay
like to go downstairs for
right put that in and type install how about that for a guess
yeah er
cos it's microsoft
yeah i think so you could do a directory of it first
now i now he says
do a directory
it doesn't know
right
i think
yeah it might be called setup install
install wouldn't it
it might be setup
have you never done this before
never ever
you you've done this fourteen times
yeah
erm
i've done it with d r dos six which is much more complicated
it's really easy just to do it with windows
now what have got there that looks as if
the f the first thing they ask you right is i it says
expand
it says do you know what you're talking about
you know and the answer is no
it says
go and read the manual
it says would you like to accept the UNK or would you like to specify things yourself
so i always say oh specify things myself
and me
and me
yeah and then
right
it asks you er what would you like to do with that and you say i don't even know what it is
we've got a setup here
yeah
it looks like setup
i bet you're right just cos you've done it forty times
yeah
you're bound to be right
and the setup sh
oh
is there anything there called install
i don't think so
there's
oh
one way to find out
yeah
let's r log on to the a drive first presumably
don't have to
er oh
er
some of them you do
yeah sometimes you have to show added UNK
okay so
yeah
we'll try install and see if the respond
oh yeah there are two ways to do it d i r install
good
there you go installation wordperfect
ah
oh
that is the problem with typing install
would you like to continue
no
cos it's on the
yeah
path
it's a yeah
right we'll have we'll have
explicit that
a colon setup thank you
from a colon
we'll try install bu but give it an explicit path
okay
i'm pretty sure it's setup
mm
we'll see
yeah guess so
thank you
well that's a good name for an installation program isn't it
setup
this wouldn't work for me cos i've also got i've got d r dos setup on my path so whenever i'd type setup i'd get d r dos setup
or whatever it is i'm trying to UNK
my change someone's path
yeah
yeah
ooh that's doing something
UNK away on a floppy
this is dead slow
this
is it
floppy
erm he i complained
about the disk
when
yeah
i complained before it went out of UNK and again after it had gone out of UNK and it was sort of very dodgy and i had
yeah
let him do what he did
erm but he basically de UNK the UNK from the UNK another one in to make it run slower
how does that work
and why did he do that
and stuff like that
ah he said he was go he promised that he was going to bring a new disk and then he hadn't and then he did this and i thought mm i'm not going to get a new disk out of him now it's out of UNK and at least it's working now and
mm
it wasn't so
okay
but wh why would disks have different speeds anyway
erm
were they at different transfer rates
the processor speeds
the processor can't handle you know s similar to weight space
mhm
in memory but
it's like UNK factors and stuff
i mean my x t for example
yeah
just couldn't handle the transfer rate from that
yeah
it couldn't take one cylinder of it
right
it take two bytes at a time
sector and wait for it to come round again and take the next sector
yeah and wait for it to come round again and t by which time it will have shoved it off somewhere and
yeah
to take the next one
so
now why are you using append
append is the data version of UNK or something isn't it
append is where you look for data files if the path is not otherwise specified
right let's see what's it's got
it's just telling you to run it to get rid of UNK programs
y you've used append to declare an append
it says that the
directory
is running
yeah
erm they
used er well m s dos five setup append for me to append to its path
why
i don't know why
it did it
d you think it needs data files
erm
cos append is like a path for data
yeah
rather than f for programs isn't it
yeah and i usually UNK i mean don't like it but i usually think it's reasonably safe
yeah
join and UNK and stuff like that which i didn't touch
yeah
i never use append cos i don't have any need for it
no
well you're going to have to get rid of it so
well i can c to continue setup
er recommended that you UNK and get rid of it
alright let's
er
f three to UNK setup and have a look at it
if this is windows you should be able to open a window into setup dot t x t and then resume your installation procedure where you left off
rather than have to bail out and do it again
ah okay
it's not completely set up if you UNK setup now you will need to run setup again
i would a based on my hard won experience of fucking around with windows i suggest
that you take all recommendations
yes
do it totally by the book and
right
if it doesn't work
erm right
you start playing with things
okay
why are you in reverse video
are you normally in reverse video
if i've set my prompt to that
ah
cos i like looking at i think it's easier it's a change
yeah it could be
could be
to read sort of black on white rather than white on black
change
erm i'll give you the prompt if you like to do that
make it in blue and white
it's an escape sequence presumably
yeah
is it
yeah might as well
so we'll have a look at it in a minute
what's edit
is that a thing that comes with dos five
yeah it's a nice little editor
this is the editor that comes with dos six which is a UNK of UNK
it is better than it is a lot better than headline on the old
oh yeah
on the old dos and that's not saying much
no
a right handed mouse here
i'm just going to put a rem statement in my UNK which copies your prompt so that i can use it later
er i'm on the a drive that's why
right okay
wow menu driven
okay
it's nice it's mi sort of microsoft standard
mm
so it is my UNK sys i'm looking for isn't it while i find an edit
you can have edit actually if y if you should happen
ah
to want it because it's basic
it's a basic program
erm
with what basic
it does
you need q basic you need q basic
i haven't got q UNK supposed to be quite good
it's not bad
i had a little
i was talking to this guy the other day who works as a UNK and that's what he uses
mm it's pretty well structured and it's
mm
you know it does the things you need to do
where does this come from
now we've got a load of stuff in here erm after the path i would expect an append wouldn't you
can you search for words
y you sure can
you can even replace search and replace
search for the word append
i don't think it's case sensitive
it'll be in lower case anyway
mm
lying UNK
is it in my erm
it's in your UNK it won't be a
UNK
you can only y
right
you can only put dos commands in an
UNK file
okay so let's
i'd rather UNK
no yo you've just copied didn't you
so you've got your copy so you can edit this with UNK and it
yeah
probably won't be the first time you have to edit it either
no
and it might not anyway
UNK needless to say windows has not examined all the things it wants you to fix
it's just found the first one bombed out told you to fix it
right
i don't know what that does
what's that do
switch e
right path
well let's try it erm you haven't got dos on that
what if you prompt oh it's not there
can't
i'll tell you what i have got that you haven't got
yes there's me prompt me prompt
there's the prompt
oh
er
dollar e open square bracket ready
dollar e open square bracket zero UNK thirty four UNK forty seven m dollar p dollar g erm after the thirty four
yeah
probably
erm yes
so it's escape zero comma UNK thirty four UNK forty seven m dollar p dollar g ooh er
not even want to and see what happens next time yo you get it up
yeah
want to UNK your prompt to
well i wouldn't remember that one either
ah
right
oh yeah i had one of those i've got on i've got one of those on the x t date and time
right i'm going to find out about append
thank you
er i mean it's ancient it's for things where you can't give a path as an argument
use with care blah
slash e
kept in the environment
ah right
so it passes it when it UNK out
mhm
and the other one just UNK what the path is doesn't it
right
what was it
it was path er append c slash dos
so it's gon it's gonna muck up my path anyway erm
so it's looking for data files in directory dos why would it do that
why would it do that
because it'll have dos help for a start
from wherever you are you'd want
well would it not know where that is
okay so we'll knock it out eh
yeah bin it
then it won't object
do you know what UNK me off
is i haven't got any like super flash UNK type programs
you know i always get you know this could be an n d a display
when in fact it isn't if you run the o s two UNK it looks super fa you know super fantastic
i've got some of those
now alt s
oh yeah so you need more
it's that one that's the same one still on there
so
what's the mode check
erm it checks the video mode i think so if it's if it fails mode black and white
right
yeah mm right mm
more UNK
seems to go back to the start again
yeah it goes d off the bottom and back up to the start
so that'll do we'll save that okay
i could be doing this with the mouse but
right back to the installation thingy
oh have you got any windows directories on your hard drive
called win or windows or no not
cos if you do it i basically
can't cope with it
it tr
right
it does the worst possible thing
it tries to be clever
it tries to cope with it when it can't
rather than simply giving up
or
okay
whatever the other alternatives are
so i'm learning a lot and i haven't even got setup running
yeah
oh dear
no i've read sort of odd letters from b UNK of
yeah
i've i have tried for three weeks to get my windows loaded and
yeah
i keep getting mystery error number seventeen or
yeah
something
well next time buy it factory loaded
right
the best way
is the answer
is reading setup UNK that's sounds good
ye er it says that it says that before
erm
actually there is a kind of a UNK file which it might not be totally UNK to read before UNK
ah you haven't UNK so you will again
i've still got my old one drive
yeah
okay
er
so we'll f three and get out of that
yeah UNK let's have a look at that erm thingy file t to see if there are any other UNK waiting
okay
f three to exit and edit setup dot t x t on a
on b
not necessarily edit on a but edit sys dot t x t on a
have a look at a colon
edit or just have a look at it
ar
dunno
are we going to edit it or just to see it
no we're not going to edit it
no right we'll
why have you got a read only editor
w we'll UNK it
ooh
it's only a list show word thing
right
erm i just call it UNK
ah well the reason i always use an editor is so you can go back on yourself
mhm
you can d do things in this
yeah oh show me
show me
it's a colon have a c
impress me
have a copy of this over the over the magic link
UNK
and send your registration thing off shortly
oh no naturally
and you'll have to tell me the name of your
er setup dot t x t ooh
ooh that's a bit dark i can't see that at all
no i think probably if you pay for it you get it in black and white
right information about blah UNK and stuff
yeah it's mainly UNK of course
blue you know i think it says top of file
yeah
y you s
any of those
you can just go down a bit like that
hang on hang on
or you can page up and page down or
you're missing the content here
er but okay yeah if you can UNK back that's ideal isn't it
mm
that's all you need
erm so do you need any of those drivers UNK or whatever
i do i do
do they appear in that order
UNK sys
c m and UNK dot sys
who knows
not sure about the UNK but i would put the UNK before the erm three eight six
yeah you'd have to wouldn't you
or it wouldn't do much
yeah
erm i'm not using UNK okay so i'll page down
i haven't got
not using a UNK or a UNK
no
bet you wish you were using a UNK
i'd swap them
i wouldn't mind
you've got one on
i'll swap you for an old x t UNK
mm
hey i've got erm i've got a er a possibly v g a card with me somewhere
ooh
i think it's under the bed actually
right
i probably i probably UNK on it when i was getting the computer
oh no
erm
er
displays
this is a par this is a UNK
increase conventional
type and it it's
is it
it's compatible with most software
aha
so it's not
a t i graphics
it's not g i s
these are the super
yeah
advantage with
well UNK are quite flash aren't they
oh very yeah
okay er
er any of those
UNK is the six forty four eighty sixteen colour no
erm this is a
s threes are UNK aren't they
yeah s three yeah
you're not using stack
fortunately
or that do not use smart drive to UNK the compressed file
now i haven't got smart drive in
mm it's only
i had that's the problem i had with smart drive and
i'll take the
disk UNK
it okay i er smart UNK actually er
mm
good recommended
mm
but not if you've got a disk UNK of some sort
okay so i reckon
leave that
probably get it loaded and doing something and then UNK the smart drive
er well that's no er yeah
well you'll probably do it all in one go
that's the other problem with windows is there're a lot of things you can't UNK after you've installed it
right okay
and not only not only can't you UNK it but it will let you UNK it not
and then it and then
surprise it's now a disaster
and you c you can you can't
er thank you
you run it and it UNK and
right
okay
so do it right first time
ah what it is to have an expert
that's great
yeah
erm now set up sys smart drive
block device drivers
ooh what have they got
presumably that's a character device driver is it
removal hang on setup does not modify boot drive
okay
reference contains references to block device drivers
are they ta are they tape drivers or UNK
disks tend to be tend to be block device drivers and serial ports tend to be character device
yeah but erm ooh i wonder i think it might be a good idea
yeah
to take me UNK out
so if we're going to do any UNK
it might be prudent yeah
it might be better to do it before we put windows on
mm yeah
windows directory in disk start up er blah
rem it rem it out and put it back in later and see if it UNK
yeah that's a good thought
okay files are already installed and setup cannot be
that's a thought check for a read only er cos i do have a habit of making some of me dos files read only
yeah but there won't be any windows files on your disk
no
so be alright
right
changes
those changes
that's good
oh yeah and then you go through this like that's quite good actually you go through this erm split screen editor with
with its proposed UNK bat in one
mm
and yours in the other
and then in er on a case by case basis it says implement this change
yes i
or don't or UNK type it in
it's er
i was told
excellent
i was told this is the up to date version of
mm
i asked that when i bought it of course
UNK you wish
no p f two
out of environment space
that's not very likely er you haven't
got a network
got a network
t s UNK
right
got t s UNK
you must have UNK of them
erm i don't load many of them apart from the you know the usual dos ones
right which are what
erm well UNK
it'll try and take them
UNK dos sys graphics
yeah
and things like that
erm
yeah
mouse drivers
right mouse drivers
mouse drivers take the mouse drivers out
yeah cos if it own
it'll it will look for
mouse driver
right
er th it'll install for you so
oh as i remember it UNK a backward compatible mouse driver which will do
backwards
will do all your previous mouse jobs but also work with windows
i reckon
i know there should be i should have an up to date driver for this one and i haven't
okay like it
in UNK
good name for a computer
mm
yeah it's erm append
append do not use
names ooh
this is a different setup thing than the one i had i think
ah so you don't know how to do it at all then right
well probably it's got like an expanded
no
list
yeah
than
hopefully it's easier
mm
than the one you normally use
yeah
root com
ah
erm you haven't got that have you
erm i have got a copy
mm but
erm
you don't use it
but i haven't loaded it yet
just as well
i was just thinking that
boot sys ah actually it might be a boot sys i've got
right i don't think we'll try and get fancy like boot com and boot sys until we've had a good play with windows
UNK two point haven't got one of those
or that
how many UNK have you got in the hard disk
or that
just the one
sixty five UNK
yeah
cor
graphics
see that's erm
mm
that's a t s r could cause unexpected results
yeah
yeah
but why the graphics
is just so you can do screen UNK isn't it
screen UNK
erm screen
in certain circumstances
and something else
erm it definitely does is it you can't do screen UNK without
isn't it one of those sort of semi UNK things that only applies if you've got m s dos
yeah
one
yeah i think so
er i might have it in
graphics
still we will get shot of it
print screen key to print the graphics display on y on your printer
so what does the print screen key usually do
it prints erm it prints words not pictures so if you UNK
ah right
if you printed that what you got on there
you get the text but not the menu bar
this lot this lot all comes out as sort of xs and
yeah
stuff and gets thrown out so that it cuts everything cuts it all out
not really something you need on a routine basis is it
get the get the graphics off cos there might be graphics in there from
yeah
an old an old one
okay
disk
no took that out years ago
yeah r e m
no
someone's i b m UNK no haven't got that
join wouldn't use that
no
right
dot com
load it from starting window
presumably you have got a keyboard command
yeah
yeah
okay so that's erm keyboard and graphics so far
yeah
menu
i've got erm
oh and UNK dot sys to be at the end
yeah
i haven't got a
quite common that one
mirror in use
ye yes
you cannot remove it
okay
no
so that editor is written is erm is written in the interpreted q basic
the one that i was using
yeah
yeah
cor
so presumably th those menus are all like thirteen instructions
they're standard sort of microsoft menus with sort of
yeah
for files
yeah
alt f x to exit
but what i'm saying is that the er m q basic must have the facilities to put those menus up by just sort of saying put up menu
yeah it's part of the erm q basic
yeah
it's erm i haven't d
cos i've got g w basic and it's
i haven't done anything with it
i've just sort of i've just looked at it and thought that will be good one day when i ever get round to UNK
does thi that comes with m s dos five does it
yeah
i mean m s dos five i think was very good
okay it was only keeping up with
mm
with d r dos
yeah
erm
but it was an important step
yeah
p c quick
utilities p c quick
do not use
that's crap
well okay put it this way there's a big dispute
p c windows say do not use p c quick use smart drive
yeah
the people who make p c quick say do not use smart drive
use p c quick it will work
so there's a big argument over wh and they're both saying their one's better
they're both saying that they
well i'm sure i'm sure microsoft will prove it doesn't work by changing something and not telling
changing the code yeah
yeah and then say told you so
all in backwards so that on april UNK day or something
yeah
i mean it's so easy to put stuff like that in isn't it
that
yeah
only dos only microsoft programmes would know about
right little piece of code in to UNK everything
print
print
well you're not on a network so you're alright
printer assist no
screen UNK
we're going to start screen UNK that's one of the one of its many nice features
mhm
page no
i keep looking at them and thinking i wouldn't buy one of those
no
there's loads of stuff
UNK no
didn't we have p c quick before
yeah this is p c UNK dish disk UNK
ah right
erm
u m d
there is no reason to use two disk UNK utilities with windows
is there ever a reason to use two disk UNK utilities
UNK
again have a read and write UNK
super p c k say it's better
i actually use super p c well i've got i've got three machines around the office
some of them use super p c k and some of them use smart drive and UNK if i can tell the difference
so they're both better than the
yeah
sys
yeah
act like x m a it's UNK okay haven't got that
no you're alright
and you're as well so
and that's the end of the file
so go back and edit your UNK sys
right
and your UNK
hopefully you will remember which
so which shall we do first
do both do both
yeah which are we doing first
UNK first
right
ooh this is fun
i like UNK stuff actually even though it's sometimes frustrating
ooh it's a bit bright isn't it
yeah
get out of the erm
yeah
the green screen
yeah
okay so
so
you want to UNK dot sys and make sure it's after erm
which it looks like it isn't
there's UNK
oh
nobody's turned the mouse on
er
i don't i don't put the mouse on in the erm the UNK sys or UNK bat
what was
two of them
you got hi yeah UNK smart drive and c so they're in the right order
right order
er display dot sys problem with
right let's have a quick look through
yeah
we had a keyboard u k somewhere
oh yeah
countries
that had to go before windows
file control box and files and UNK it will have to probably
it'll change those
don't need files but it'll do those
it'll play with them so
right
yeah shell it'll sort that out
what's h d three eight six
oh it was one that came with this which was UNK out
oh okay yeah
erm
be nice
er dos high
prior to dos five
erm then
install equals k b dot com cos that's
going to go before windows is running so that's alright
er why have you UNK out fast open
erm i think i read it in a magazine somewhere
yeah
get used space
it does use a fair amount of environment space
i was looking for space for something i've forgotten what it wa oh i had a big spreadsheet
mm
and it suddenly starting erm UNK fucking about a lot
mm
UNK flashing
okay and it's got smart drive is UNK out er it'll probably try and put that back in
okay well we can put it back in for it if it likes
yeah
erm it can set its parameters to what it thinks is suitable then
yeah
okay erm now we'll rem out that i think
okay
yeah that would be prudent but yeah
use smart drive because it as you say it'll probably insert it with parameters
it thinks are appropriate
okay
erm it didn't say to put smart drive after UNK did it
it said to put UNK before windows or keyboard before windows
keyboard before windows
oh UNK that's the thing that make it pretend to not be the
yeah
version that it is
i've got one of those
it and the other thing is that i presume that it would h it would have a file
mm
it would have a list of and it would sort of say that sort of command dot com UNK version three or something
yeah
doesn't it holds it all it holds it in its in itself
mm
and saves itself again
ah
and i though oops i don't like playing with this
mm
i UNK it up i can't be a
different version
mm
i haven't got that and of course i couldn't run your version of UNK unless i had UNK cos it would say incorrect dos version
incorrect UNK
actually that would that would be interesting to see that erm
no i think i'll try
set UNK isn't it
well you could yeah i guess you i er mean it's something they had to write into the program to check the version number isn't it
yeah
so smart drive UNK let it put one in when it doesn't find one
okay now all these device UNK should be alright
yeah
oh UNK drive dot sys oh that's UNK okay so there's no
okay
problem
yeah
share should be okay
now share
you don't need share do you cos you've got five point o
i read somewhere at some stage some problem that's got rid of by using share
we'll take it out before it objects to it i think
i mean it's basically in if it's if in the main reason that people brought share in for the large media restriction of pre
yeah
dos four isn't it
yeah
erm cos otherwise it's er it's only if you have multiple applications running
which i guess theoretically you can do under windows but presumably it has its own UNK mechanism
and that should handle it
okay
yeah
okay so goodbye to that
so alt f to save
UNK
i do have to type it again
because it's a program and you can't just have three
you could use your dos key edit
so far so good
right UNK is UNK out cos i don't want i don't erm i choose when i start which mouse driver i start on one of the mouse port and one of the serial erm times
two why did you do that
well one of them is this
yeah
if you've ever used one of these you'll know why i use the other one
oh i see
and that erm probably possibly could run it off there as a p s two mouse but erm i've heard
that's intelligent
that amstrad mice are sort
mm
of UNK
ooh erm yeah
erm and i thought i don't want the risk of blowing
i've UNK a mouse and a port doing that
yeah so i thought well
right
you fool i thought
what are we looking for then down here
stuff basically just anything
path
there's keyboard com again
well this is what dos five for
so you've bo you've got it on the on the erm UNK sys and on the UNK
and on the UNK yeah
that can't be right can it
no
well i guess
yeah
mode check
there's a big menu here for mouse type
what is that
is that
er rem let's get rid of that
what is mirror
oh it's UNK out
sorry
what is mirror
erm you know that delete UNK
right
erm
yeah
keeps a file of what's gone
yeah
and how to get it back
yeah
that's a good UNK that is it
it's presumably it's a t s r is it
yeah
er rem
what does that call do
oh you're gonna anyway
oh that that's erm that gives me date and time
in great big something is UNK my clock
yeah
it's leaving the time
yeah
but it's UNK the date
shit
and erm i'm using me diary for my students and UNK straight into it
mm
and start s set an appointment for
mm
hang on what year
this shouldn't be a tuesday where are we
whoops
oh no
so i've just i'm run i i'm running
no that's terrible
my important things now i'm running with a batch file
yeah
and UNK when it when it boots up it shows that and save that
yeah
nothing else not nothing needs
yeah that's right
changing does it
no that's fine
right so we'll just exit
oh save anyway in case you did change something and you forgot it
okay
being redundant
right meanwhile back at the setup
back at the boring old setup program unless you bloody setup dot i n f file again
i got so sick of looking at that
i also got so sick at waiting for the bits that happen after you get through setup
there's more
oh god yeah
it sits there all day
UNK
many disks full
yeah
them
right er keyboard getting UNK
i have a UNK belief
mm
that if you're working on a floppy drive it's still better to have your log drive as a hard drive
yeah i
presumably UNK creating temporary files and things like
yeah
that
yeah
but a lot of these UNK want you to log onto the a
yeah
drive and then run it from there
oh it's not UNK
oh that's easily done
what a silly sausage you will take that out before we UNK
that's a good idea
i've n i've been using the other keyboard all on the x t and i can't get used to this one yet
i'm still going over here for the function keys
i wonder what happens if i UNK that super store host UNK
well maybe i'll find out one day
wendy assured my she's got UNK of everything
that looks very impressive by the way that
it is
it's a shame i never got
does your monitor colour
no
it erm i think the card does actually
er
i think it's a colour card
that's nice if you want oh you'll probably want to keep it won't you
i was thinking that if you do want to get a colour one at some time
mm
brenda is looking for a computer at the moment
oh right
erm so you might be able to sell her a monitor
yeah
or you might not i mean might not you might not want
then again i'm not sure i can afford a colour one cos it's a couple hundred quid really
well i've seen 'em for a hundred now actually a hundred quid
there are c g a ones about
one thing you've got to watch out for UNK i go i remember i was thinking about getting colour UNK for work and i read lots of articles about them
mm
and the cheap ones have sort of UNK dot resolution and
yeah
they're actually more
what do you think of that one
trouble than they're worth
i think that's good
i think that's very good
especially
especially i was looking at the c g a monitor all night
mhm
every letter composed of dots that seem to be six inches apart
yeah
no i think that's very comfortable especially in that blue and whatever that is UNK
blue and other blue i guess
oh
it's a bit easier to read isn't it
so ooh hang on hang on you're not UNK into a cos you haven't put the disk in
you want to UNK at that point oh yeah UNK do
no we won't forget about the a colon cos it's going to take it out of c drive first
so does sue use wordperfect on this machine
yeah erm she's go she's quite good at it actually
r good UNK she's learning the limitations
i mean what does wendy think of it
wendy likes it
i
i would not i genuinely would
yeah
not give it room on the disk
yeah
that that's always been my attitude and
i think it UNK
and that's always been my attitude and wendy has slowly
microsoft works
yeah UNK convinced me that if you're a power user which she is
yeah
you could do a lot with it
if you're a power user you can afford microsoft word or UNK or something decent
UNK
all that stuff
i mean i know it'll do it
yeah
it'll do everything i mean d base and all the other things
will do it
yeah
but if you were to spend five years learning weird codes
it's not that bad i mean
ah bu it's i mean thing about wordperfect
is you
yeah
do everything twice
you say erm you want to go into sort of c colon my d i r
yeah
right and it says and do you really want to do it
yeah you press enter again
it wants you to press enter again by the way
what
you do everything twice in this setup program
to learn more about windows press f one to set it up press enter
UNK
oh you're not going to the help are you
right here you go
no i pressed enter
this is express or custom
this is where it's says do you know what you're talking about
i am
which would you recommend
er i only used custom because
which do you
i was i was UNK it with d r dos
aha
erm so i'd go for express
this is a funny machine the amstrad
ah
so i would go for the recommended and hope by this version of windows it knows about UNK and will sort it out
because
mm
d r dos er sorry m s dos five did i thought i was going to have a lot of trouble and it didn't
it knew about UNK
mm
knew about funny way of handling the a twenty line and UNK
great okay we'll hav let's have a go at express
ah there is something about er an a twenty UNK for windows
something
mm
called win a twenty in fact
there is i've
er
got one
er
it's a device driver that it loads
so yeah go for express you can always try custom later
press enter
i don't know how to use wordperfect and i hate i occasionally have to
we get some disks from the states once a month that are in wordperfect
yeah
and i have to translate them into dos and it's a hassle and i don't like
but wendy you know can do a hell of a lot with it
i mean that is so simple to do and such a so much better than the wordperfect setup which
mm
last night on the x t
mm
ten minutes of disk fifteen minutes of disk maybe
mm
i remember thinking come on you're having me on
you're
yeah
just going to sit see how long i'll sit and wait here and
yeah
still think you're doing something
cos
mm
i'll
that's the installation program not the
yeah o on this erm this was the server
mm
so every now and again it was sort of it would sort of flash and say the server was being UNK and sort of UNK it was gone
mm
and then there'd be a five ten fifteen minute wait and nothing
mm
nothing happened with the
no five point one's probably not written with the x t in mind
no
i don't think so
but yes i mean it's very good to have this kind of feedback system when
you're doing a time consuming operation
yes and you can look at it and say okay we've go time to go and make a cup of coffee or oh this is going well
actually it looks like we've got time to make a cup a coffee
by the time we've calculated what's th the remaining sixty five percent of
which is now s down to sixty
UNK complete
well that's the second time i've done that tonight so it the UNK th the os UNK doesn't always get it right first time
or doesn't you know UNK it on the first pass all the time
beep
what
sometimes it does
insert disk labelled okay
now while it's there i'm going to move this
i won't pinch any of
you can't
i won't pinch any of your
well at least take the floppy out before you move it
why
cos the
cos the heads are very nearly in contact with that and they'll
okay
UNK on it
right can hang on to that for me
yeah sure
without pressing too many keys
oh
control UNK
this is quite a nice keyboard it's a yeah i like it
it's very nice i think
it's quite wonderful
mm
and four UNK cor UNK
cor UNK it's no good that four UNK
you wanna buy it then
you want to buy four UNK
i c i it's about four about hundred and eighty quid to update to sixteen UNK
yeah
which is the only update i can do cos they're in banks of four
right so you've got to swap them all out
so i've got to take the four one UNK out and put four UNK in
yeah
and some people do sort of amstrad UNK and
four hundred and eighty quid
wow
and i think for four hundred and eighty quid i could get a very nice real computer
mm
no it is very nice it was very good when i first got it
yeah
it's just like anything else once you've got it there are
as soon as you buy it it's UNK because it's a computer
that's it
that's it
so one's done
number seven number two
i thought it came on seven disks not six
right
ooh what will happen
the second disk in
i bet it reads
the really critical phase is on about disk three
it starts UNK itself under windows
as long
as long as it's not like UNK critical stage
which is when you've been there for a for genuinely over an hour and a half
it says now we're going to set up your printer drivers and you'll have wordperfect going and it goes
but yeah when it when it when it starts in when it starts
UNK itself under windows is when it first really goes UNK and you know
oh
it'll just say privileged instruction UNK
hey this is g this is going well
stuff you
i don't think there is time for
no
for coffee on this
go on ask for disk three next
and get disk three whether you ask for it or not
ah thi this is very helpful
sort of just having someone being there cos otherwise i'd spend a you know
yeah
two days reading the manual before i'd dare
yeah
do it
it's a fairly good
it's a
installation program
it's just
yeah
i had a lot of hassle cos i was mixing it up with d r dos
mm
i think
and also i took UNK which i shouldn't have taken
any of the microsoft UNK try at being
mm
very helpful and you can see what's going on and UNK
UNK
stepping machine guns ready to go
presumably that er that noise i indicates that it's crossing cylinder boundaries a lot
on its own particular
ooh we've got a
ooh it's UNK with a
well cathy what's sister do to you
just me back doctor
i've had an awful weekend right
i think maybe i've got a UNK or something
and i was
aha
just in there
you're a bad woman
you're a bad woman doing that to yourself
that and constant headaches
but i had to get an appointment i had to get something i put hot water
and it's made no difference made no difference
right
now what are you on in the way of tablets cathy
are you still on your UNK
aye
still on the UNK what about the UNK
i tried the they keep me now and again with them doctor they make
they're not
me awfully sick
they make you sick
but i don't tell that doctor
i've told him and he gave that wee white one and it's i still take the kind of but i do go on them you know when i'm really bad
aye
but this UNK down in here it's
right
it's awfully sore
i told them when i was over week but he just says to keep giving 'em a tr give 'em a chance
aha
well don't keep going too long with them if they're doing that to you cathy cos
no
nobody thanks you for it
it's the sickness it just you seem to take in every kind of sickness with it
that's right
even with the wee tablet
yeah
if it really gets bad take them
well
there we are now
i've given you something to kill the pain cathy and i've given you an UNK
aha
to get the UNK cleaned out as well
think maybe it's a UNK or something
sounds awful like it
oh it's awfully sore
sounds awful like it
there we are UNK and that'll set you out of UNK
for a wee while
just for a
just for a wee while
UNK
coming to bits coming to bits
right cathy
thanks very much
right cheerio now
cheerio
mother's house in because my father was in the first world war so my mum had to go to live with my grandmother and er i was born there and er then when my father came home we came back to my mum came back to she ha got a little house somewhere i forget where it was street doesn't s it's not there any more
and erm i think i was about three when i came back here
and erm i remember my father now even now n although i was only three i can still remember him in his uniform coming home on leave
you can
yes
strange isn't it how your mind goes back
and yet my s my oldest sister she was three years older than me and she couldn't remember him
and every time he c used to come home on leave she used to cry she didn't know him in uniform till he till he put his own clothes on
and er i b i remember him as if it were yesterday
but i think my sister was a bit scared of him she felt he was a stranger being in u in er UNK uniform you know
yeah
you said you went back to your the house in street
yes
what sort what sort of house was it
well that was a one up and one down and a little tiny little UNK and it had a little tiny back yard
and that's all we had there and we were for ever getting flooded out and there we we'd all clean our shoes before going to bed at night put 'em all underneath the UNK or whatever
and in the morning there was nothing to see they were floating about you know with the floods
they used to come without any warning whatsoever
i think it was the UNK that was in bad state
the UNK
but it was nothing new to get flooded out all the time there
there was only a tiny little row in between two streets there was about six houses i think it was
very small
tiny little things
were you aware at the time that it was a small house
no because all the others round about seemed to be the same
some you know some had like a living room and a little tiny back kitchen whatever you call them and erm two little tiny bedrooms above
b but until we moved from there to street and we still only had one bedroom and one down but a little tiny back kitchen
and er we were all brought up there the whole lot of us and i think i was about fifteen when i left there
and my mam finally got a council house with three bedrooms
oh and we were posh then
because we g we g we were all separated then you know with different bedrooms
but erm then my mam brought nine of us up in that one bedroom
how did you all organize it yourselves then being so UNK
well it was one big bedroom but there was more or less like a loft
there was there was no doors to the bedroom if you know what i mean
it was you walked up the stairs and there it was all open
like a landing or a loft or whatever
and then my mam had three big double beds in there and of course we were slept top and bottom
and then the boys and the girls and whatever
all s UNK together
so you were sort of head to tail
yes
oh yes
top to bottom yeah
yes
there were so many a the top so many in the bottom the boys in one and the girls in the other one
and my mum and dad and probably a couple of the s little kids with them as well
it's a wonder they didn't get er UNK some of the kids then in them days
and then there was always a UNK with a little one in you know in between i don't how we lived honest i don't
but there you are we weren't the only ones there was lots of people just the same
but it's incredible to think that such things happened in them days isn't it really
it was awful
i know the house was only erm we used to have to run down to offices there to pay the rent once a month and it was twelve and six a month for the house and that's about what it was worth too in them days
yeah
oh dear
who used to pay the rent then was it your mother or your father
my mother my mother my father was useless
you know as long as he had his pint and his food he d he wasn't bothered
he wasn't er wasn't what you call a good father at all no wasn't a good provider
my mother was the one that used to struggle and many a time she's gone without herself you know
she used she used to count all the kids round the t table UNK table white after every meal you know UNK and UNK after every meal
and she used to count us all and share it all out
and then suddenly she'd say oh i don't feel very hungry
i'm we knew very well she was but there was nothing left for her you know
yeah
th rotten days they were won't they
people say they were the good old days but oh i don't think
i think they were horrible days
and there was nothing for my father had a few drinks you know and he'd come home and he he'd just come he'd b be UNK coming up the street you know
and er soon as he come in the house he just UNK my mam for nothing
oh he was a awful man he really was
and erm i remember i was i was about fifteen now and my young brother was only a little UNK about two i think three and i remember my father came in and he did he went straight for my mam for nothing at all
oh and i happened to be standing in the back kitchen you know and i got hold of this UNK and i picked my little brother up and put him under my arm in case he got hurt and i oh i UNK my father from his head to his feet with the UNK
i don't know what UNK me to do it i went completely UNK
i thought what now what did she do to deserve that
for sh she was a good mother you know she really was a good mother
and i did i went completely mad and that's the only ever time i've ever hit anybody in my life honest
and i don't think he ever UNK me for it you know
but then he se he seemed then as if he'd think twice before he'd do anything when he used to come in you know i er i said to him i said look we used to call him in them days you know now what did you that for
poor mam hasn't done a thing you know
and i think it brought him to his senses a lot after that he thought well hello i've got what do you call it now
i gotta watch what i'm doing you know these are starting to grow up
because my elder sister she left home when she was about sixteen i think she went erm into she was working there as a UNK maid
and she used to sleep in and then a little bit after that she went to live in liverpool with my grandmother and went to work there so s i s i was the sort of erm eldest one at home then you know so i felt as if i was more or less responsible for looking after my mam sort of thing
but she certainly didn't deserve him anyway
mm
how did you help to support your mam through
well erm i remember when my father would never give my mother any money
we always had to chase after him for it and he'd never give her more than a pound a week
never
and we had to go from one pub to the other to look for him
this was on a saturday you know
and er my poor mam then used to go chasing down to shops late on saturday afternoon and things like that
she used to get meat cheap in the butchers
she used to know my mam th she had she had lo lots of kids
so erm they used to put some meat by for her to er on the cheap sort of thing what was left over on a saturday then my UNK get lots of meat and that you know cheap
but wh where could you start with a pound
how on earth could she manage
well she did you know i don't know how she did you know
she was a miracle
she must've been
then i remember one m my sister my younger sister she went to er to hospital with erm UNK fever
and she came she was coming home from hospital and do you know my mother never had a little piece of bread to give to her when she brought her home
sh we had nothing in the house at all
nothing
oh it was a dreadful time
no people don't know the half of it
but my father never did a regular job after he come out th out of the army you know i think it was something had happened to him in the army he'd got erm bomb blast or something or he was near s something when it went off and he got buried
and when they went to pick him up some somebody picked him up by his sort of under his arms sort of thing and he had a double hernia through that
and er whatever it was they said that er they wouldn't chance operating on him
so that meant that he was he couldn't sort of do a heavy work so he just used to do odd job things you know he'd sell horse and carts and er he'd go down to the pier when he used to do the fishing boats he used to come in and he'd buy a box of fish from them and go round the streets selling them you know
and then little did he know when he used to leave them in the house in the back yard that we'd been UNK some of them
to get have something to eat
and that's the way we survived
yeah one way or another you know
but h he wasn't a UNK man he was a very honest man
he was never in trouble with police or nothing
he wouldn't UNK he wouldn't he was too UNK to do anything like that
and yet in the house he was a er UNK man in the house
that's why i couldn't ooh i couldn't stand to marry a man that's UNK you know
i was UNK of having the same thing as my mother did
because she did have a hard life
so really the children were in effect brought by your mother
oh yes
if it'd depended on my father we'd have been dead years ago
yes i do i honestly don't ask me i haven't got a clue how she managed
but there were always a big UNK of whatever you know erm UNK or she'd make a cake in a in a big meat tin
and all done in the oven in the old fashioned UNK you know no fancy gas UNK with UNK or whatever on
it was all stuck there with the coal underneath
and it's amazing what w you know and you a she always baked her own bread
always
always baked her own bread and we used go we used to run that to the to the bakers to have it for baking sort of thing
and that was about every other day she used to UNK about ooh i forget whether it was fourteen pound or twenty eight pound of flour she us
i know we used to have to run to school in the UNK er for the shopping in the morning
before going to school
so that she'd be she'd be doing her baking during the day while we were at school
and erm i think that's the way you know that er we were fed because there was none of us that was not suffered from anything apart from little UNK illnesses cos if one got the UNK we all got the UNK you know the whole lot of us
one got the UNK cough we all did
and erm that's the way we went
and what happened er then when you when the family was going down like flies
how
ah my poor mam had us all in that one bedroom upstairs you know
oh it was terrible
i'm not saying we all had it together but you say you can er say that about four of 'em would then as that as that they got rid of it the other the UNK get it you know eventually and th we'd all have it in the end
with a few weeks in between
but er she managed somehow you know but she was like that my UNK manage UNK any illness at all and we never worried about that
she always knew what to get
for anything what was wrong with you
to the UNK she'd be yeah
so she'd go to the chemist not to the doctor then
oh n we'd go to the doctor
but er she had to pay her didn't she
although it was only about two shillings i think it was a lot of money for her you know
so unless it was something very desperate she always seemed to know what was wrong with you
she always oh she had a second sight like that i think she should've been a doctor if she'd lived in these this day and age
because no matter what was wrong people always used to run for my mother you know
and she used to go with the district nurses a lot to er to treat different people specially a long time i remember erm a young man erm h he had er i think it was UNK he had and er he was so fed up with himself he threw UNK over himself and er set light you know on the top of the stairs and threw himself down
and oh he burnt his back shocking terrible state his back was in
and my mam went to him every day with the nurses oh it was months and months and months until it was completely cleared
i don't know how she did it but she did
i could never take after her can my sister but not me
knock
what on UNK that
people moving in next door
yeah
so your mother was regarded in the neighbourhood as someone who knew how to treat illnesses
oh yes
or accidents anything like that
yeah
oh she was good you know
she used to know every medicine no matter what
she'd make her own cough mixture for winter time in pint bottles
and er that then we were alright for winter in case we caught cold
and then she'd dose you up with UNK oh dear that the thought of that now
and erm but that's what she believed in
but anybody er with an any child with an accident you know she was there whether they'd UNK burnt themselves or fell over or what
she was there
only she couldn't touch us if we were hurt
really
if we had a UNK oh go to auntie my other mm she wasn't our aunt really but er she was she was some relation but we used to call her auntie and we'd have to go to her to take a UNK out of our own finger she us she couldn't touch us wasn't that funny
and it's the same t UNK boils and all sorts of things out of other people you know
oh she was a she was a great person she really was
yeah
but i don't think any one of UNK take after my mother
no
no
no
i don't know we had a very hard life when we were kids but you know w er got on ourselves later on we had a fairly easy life but erm you don't forget those old times though do you not really
you said that er people would er would come to your m mother for UNK if they the children suffered from accidents
oh yes
oh yes
there was one girl she'd erm she'd burnt her leg right down the front of her leg er on the bone in the front of her leg and er her mother just wrapped up something an old stocking i think she put in it and of course it went bad didn't it
then er this er my mam saw her UNK one day she said what's the matter
and this little girl said i've burnt my leg
so my mam says come on she said come with me and took her home and er sat her down on oh and she'd go and get this stocking off of her little leg it was er hole in the leg like that
and er she got it away eventually bathing it and talking to the little girl and then she said to her now i want you to come here every day she said so i can i see to that for you
and to this day i see that woman
and she talks about it remember your mam the way she looked after my leg
yeah
i'm sure sh you know she would have been in dire trouble er only for my mother having seen her UNK that day but that's the sort of thing she would do
yeah
the fact that er people felt free to come and ask your mum
yeah
er w was that kind of service erm usual or unusual er ar around here
oh no it was a usual thing you know UNK go out of their way then to help
everybody's door was open whatever they had was shared you know whatever one ever had an even it was only half a loaf it was there
erm it was a mar it's was a wonderful place to live in this part of er you know bangor
oh yeah it was great
how would er how would the community know when someone was er in need of
well i dunno
you more or less guessed i suppose it would somehow get to be known by somebody you know
it's er like someone was having a child and they never had er never had er nappies or whatever
i've seen my mam take sheets off a bed and tear them up in squares
fo to make sh little nappies for the baby that was just been born and no clothes ready or fo and i've seen her you know as poor as we were my mam would sit there was UNK sheets and er but i've seen them UNK off the bed and put on somebody's bed while they were having a baby or whatever
so you know i that's the way s you sort of got to know er people's circumstances i think
not that people used to let you know about they were hard up i mean they just wouldn't would they
even though they were poor they still had their pride
to an extent i think
so th the sort of help that was that would come to the surface would it be at times like birth death accidents
that's right that's right yes it would
it would
people didn't have much to give but what they gave they gave with a good heart you know
because er well if there was a death er in the family at th that time they used to erm i don't suppose you remember it but er there used to always be a plate on a table whoever called would leave a little bit money on the plate to help pay for the funeral or whatever
very quietly
yeah nothing said as they went out people just used to put a little something on the plate or whatever
just to help but erm yes everybody was in the same position more or less but erm and yet they used to help in a s own little way
you said that er when people called at er when there'd been a death would that be calling to see
to UNK or t could they help more than anything
yes could they help you know
just to show that erm well they just were that those sort of people you know
if they thought er well i'd better go round just in case and she might need something or she might she might just want to talk or whatever you know
and er they just used to go and have a quiet word and not make a fuss no bother no nothing
at that time would it have been a custom to have had the coffin in the house
yes
well yes there was no such thing as er UNK of UNK then was there
everybody even though you only had the one room downstairs i remember when my brother died he w at twelve although there was a big crowd of us in that house there was er no there wasn't then there was er the four sisters wasn't there
and er that's right there was only four of us then and erm this little coffin was there and my sister was trying to feed him a piece of apple while he was in his coffin saying do you want a piece of apple in welsh to him
she didn't know she thought he was just sleeping
yeah
but oh yes everybody had the coffin in the house then no matter how small your house was
strange to think of it now isn't it
yeah
cos people here have done everything in that one room didn't they
so you would you well you would have to carry on your life not as normal but you'd have to eat wouldn't you
oh yes
it was there and i mean and the rooms were so small
we there wasn't room for a three piece suite sort of thing and then you'd have a UNK and a table chairs to sit on like hard chairs wooden chairs like kitchen chairs
but you wouldn't have er you wouldn't have easy chairs or nothing like that
you know that that's about all the room there was honestly was a table and chairs and more often than not a couple of us had to sit on the stairs
cos the stairs was in your living room then as you went in through your front door your stairs were facing the front door
your front door was in your living room
when you open the door
when you open the door you're in the living room
and then the stairs the stairs are facing you like that so you've only got about a metre of in between the bottom of the stairs and your front door and you s just sort of go in through there an and you're in the living room
no UNK no nothing
no it all open
just like the bedroom was upstairs
oh shocking to think of it now isn't it
yes it's erm it's a completely different time isn't it
yes
yes honestly it is isn't it
but ooh i wouldn't like to go back to them days i'm sure i wouldn't
can you give me some idea of the UNK the effect that say a death would ha when your what effect did your brother's death have on the family
well it was erm my mother was very upset
well it came so suddenly you see there's erm as i said playing football and then this accident and then he was sort of taken away from us in no time you know
and i remember i was sent to er a UNK house the day of the funeral i was erm seven
i was seven and i was i went to a UNK house and as it happened i was looking through the blooming window when the funeral went past so i was no better off you know
and er there was the er the kids from his erm he w he was going to school when he died and er there was children from his class walking along cos they we they used to walk to the UNK then and carrying a UNK of er flowers i remember it as if it was yesterday
the children from his class walking in the funeral yeah carrying a UNK from the class and mm
so although you would have i don't know but i hope i'm not sort of i really am trying to find out although you'd have his coffin in the front room where you would be living
oh yes
you wouldn't you still weren't allowed to go to the funeral
no i wasn't
i whether my mother couldn't afford to buy me clothes to go
or whether for some unknown reason she just didn't want me to go
at the time er did you think that was unusual or did you accept it
i accepted it whatever my mother said we accepted
because we always thought well she knows what sh you know she's right
my mother was always right s as far as we were concerned
and erm i think he died if i remember rightly he died on the erm twenty fifth of january and my other brother was born on the third of
thank you
er yes i was saying erm they only had the UNK in them days didn't they to come for the birth and that and anyway my mother was ill enough to have to send for a doctor
and that's the first time she'd ever had a doctor
and sh they she was given erm some sort of oh something to put her to sleep or whatever gas and i know sh she seemed to know what she was doing but this lady that was there with her she passed out with the smell of gas in the room so she wasn't much help
but erm this might not believe me but i'm gonna tell you just the same
he was over fourteen pounds born
good god
over fourteen pounds born he was the UNK child that they'd ever delivered
your poor mother
yes so that's why she had to have a doctor for that one
so anyway she got over it and all she had to do she tell her to stay in bed now for s so many days but she'd be up again the following day and then the UNK come and have a look under her feet and she'd say you been up again she'd say
cos she hadn't washed her feet for going back to bed
the soles of her feet and the then they knew she'd been up on her feet you know
but as she said she just had to she couldn't stay in bed when she had kids running all over the place
no i don't know how she ever put up with it poor mum
so at that time the midwife would only come for a quite a small proportion of the time then
that's right yes
just when the child was more or less the they used to call i think you know when before the baby was born
to sort of make out s make sure you've got this and that so you're ready for the UNK and er but they only came the last minute when they were the ma UNK were expecting their babies
and then they'd call for a few days afterwards er whatever
and that was it
finished
and yet again my mother used to go with him to deliver ba other babies as you know herself as we as we sort of grew up and we were off her hands
and she used to go with him a lot
well she's delivered many a baby herself with no nurse er about
you know they always used to come when it was too late
if they knew my mam was there they knew it sh they'd be alright
they never bothered
so your UNK mum would act as a midwife
as midwife yes
my sister ann she's delivered a couple of children herself
you wouldn't think so to look at her would you
she looks capable of it
yes she is quite yes
mm
but er my mam did
and another time ooh another time she went er somebody i tell you they always used to run for my mother when there was trouble and er a woman had hung herself just round the corner to where we lived
and my mam went there and she cut her down and everything you know
from a beam where she'd er she'd hung herself
and when she came home she said do you know what she said she must have taken ages she said to put that cord through that er beam she said
she must have taken a knife to push the cord through she said there was hardly any room for it
and then you know
and my poor mam you know she used to scrub her hands with erm it wasn't UNK it was UNK in them days wasn't it what they used to use
proper hospital smell UNK it was called
like UNK acid
aha
yeah
and oh gosh it used to burn your hands nearly
and she'd scrub herself the hands with that you know and of course my mam used to do all the baking didn't she
and then us kids wouldn't eat because she'd cut this lady down you know
and sh whatever's the matter with you she said you've seen me scrub
oh i said we're not hungry
i think she saved more money that week on food
we just didn't fancy anything she'd touched you know
oh it was a dreadful thing when you come to think of it now the poor women couldn't help it she was must have been in desperate UNK to do a thing like that
and she was such a lovely lady too you would never would have believed it
she was a really nice lady she was
mm
was it not UNK then for people to commit suicide or was it
well i don't know
no i d i didn't hear of many
i think she had this lady had tried to UNK herself in the quay before that
mm no i don't think so not that i can remember
i think there's more recently that's done things like that than there was in them days
mm
you said that erm your mother would after the UNK and after the birth she would erm have to do the normal UNK
yes oh yes
would er d during that period af immediately after would anyone else come in to give her a hand
yes well my grandmother i think she lived nearby and she'd sort of pop in
but erm what i was i was just seven my oldest sister was ten so she'd probably have been you know more capable of helping my mam out than i was
i suppose i was the one that used to run about for UNK or whatever
but erm i suppose she would have been the one to do the cleaning and washing up or whatever
but my mother wasn't the type that would lay in bed if you know what i mean
she wouldn't be happy laying there you know she'd be too worried about things
about what's happening to the rest of because she was very UNK she was m she was our mam
but she was er she was like a UNK hen with us you know she was forever watching and looking and making sure we were alright
that's why i keep saying she was a good mother
so
yeah
so you were aware all that time that er you were under her care
we were under her care until we were married
mhm
we did as we were told
yeah until we were married
and then she would be advising
i er i remember always don't buy what you can't afford don't get anything unless you can pay for it
she was that type of a person
you don't want people knocking your door and er you know she up to the time she died we used to be advised by her
she died at sixty bless her
mm
were you aware were you aware then at that time that although people were generally poor in the area that some people were suffering the consequences of being in debt more than others or being poor more than others
i don't think there were many people in debt because they knew they couldn't afford to go into debt you know
i think that's why they were poor they'd sooner go without
i'm sure that's er that was the reason my mother was poor
she just knew that they we she couldn't she couldn't go and get any you know anything on h p or whatever
because she knew she wouldn't have the money to pay for it so we just that was her way you see
whatever if you can't afford it go without
and that's the way we were brought up
and really you know on second thought many a time we've thought that her words ha have been there and you'd say oh no i won't have it you know
yes she was a very wise woman
was it generally thought of then er that is being in debt was it generally thought of as being something that was evil or
oh i think so
yes
i think so
yes
i mean i don't think there were many houses that th anybody knocked the door for any debt or anything
i'm sure there wasn't
because as i say people were that poor they knew that they just couldn't afford to er to get anything you know
not unless they had the money to pay for it which they didn't have
oh it was poor in them days there's no two ways about it
it was
it was nothing for you to have the er sole of your sh shoe flapping off and having to wear 'em till the p there was a little man that used to mend the shoes in UNK there and you'd go to him and he'd put a couple of nails never charge you for it you know
no
no
go sitting in his shop watching him mend the shoes
because he had he used to have a big open fire there and all the kids would be sitting round it keeping warm while he was UNK the shoes
and you'd say oh look mr my sole of my UNK come loose
oh take it off and he would stick a couple of nails in
had the nails in his mouth you know and er used to knock 'em with a file
and then you'd go you'd be UNK then your flap had gone you know
but er that was a UNK thing he used to do that for all the kids
nice little man he was
UNK
you said that you'd be sitting round the fire but wh when you were when you were in your own house
yeah
would you be sitting around the fire
well it wasn't big enough really
no i mean the fireplace was you'd get about three chairs round it was it was UNK
but the room was so small so no matter where you sat there you'd be warm
th with a crowd and er the UNK of the room
so you know erm my brother was er as i said i was er four when my brother died then my mam gradually had more children afterwards until there was nine of us in the end left there
in that same one room
before we before my mam had the house in road that was just what you might sort of still call it
and then we had the three bedrooms then
but erm there we had the living room and a parlour and we were posh
but er i dunno
but no nobody ever used to seem to sit round the fire
my mother would probably be the nearest one to it er sat at the corner near the fire and all the kids would be sitting round the table doing something you know
or out in the street playing out the way
yes i was going to ask y er wh where would you be playing as a as a as a young girl then
well we on the beach on the there we went th we were there from morning till night wh during school holidays
and then street where we lived it erm was a dead end it was a UNK de UNK
so we were safe to play there was no traffic up and down there you see
it was only a little narrow you could step from one pavement to the other on the other side of the road
and our UNK used to have skipping ropes you know one sat on the chair on one pavement the other one on pavement on the other side turning a rope er and we UNK for hours there with our UNK turning the ropes for us
things like that we used to play
never very far away you know
our UNK always watching us
but it was mainly on the beach we used to play all the time
cos when the well as soon as you could walk in the summer er you know when weather UNK my UNK take us down on the beach there and here you are sink or swim in you'd go into the water
did you
yeah
and she'd be watching you like a UNK you know
but er it comes natural to a baby a swim doesn't it
and er because that's where we were all the time so you had to learn to swim from no age at all
so i wonder if that's why they were good UNK around UNK you know
great UNK they were
yeah
so generally speaking then the children were taught to swim when they were little
oh yes
from a few weeks old she'd be sitting on there was an old er UNK of a boat there
my UNK er well not m my mother all the UNK would be sitting there with the kids with their feet in the water to get used to it even when they were a few weeks old
you know i can UNK it now you know
but as soon as you could walk then they'd throw you in then watching you every minute
and it used to come natural
oh they were really good UNK round here
specially the lads
i always felt safe there was always somebody about
mm
did the lads and the girls play together or
oh no together always
they did
yes
yes always together great
nothing for us knocking each UNK doors at nights about midnight coming for a swim and we'd all go down
yo you know UNK bathing and all sorts
quite innocent
yes even the lads and the girls you know
oh we were brought up together all on the same vicinity for over the years you get to know one another and erm thoroughly enjoy ourselves
quite UNK
yeah
when your mother was sort of having a lot of a lot of children and after you know you were growing up and she was still having children erm had you any idea of erm the processes by which all this was coming about
no i didn't
no i didn't i was very erm my mother was erm i don't know what can you call it very slow in coming forward i think
no she never told us anything about anything
and we when we came of age UNK i was frightened to death me because i was sitting on the UNK we were playing on the beach still a child of twelve cos we still went about with little socks on at twelve in them days
when i first started becoming a woman on playing on the beach and i ran home UNK
and she says there's nothing wrong with you she said and gave me a what you call it to p to er protect myself
there's you're not ill there's nothing wrong with you she said
but as from now she said you're a woman she said
so just take care of yourself
and that's all she told me
and i had no idea no idea at all honestly
no idea
when you came home did you and sh she told you this
yeah
did you fro just listening to th the way you were UNK what your mother said
yes
it seems that she was quite definite and quite firm
yeah
what sort of effect did it have on you that kind of UNK
er
well a as soon as she gave me this erm protective thing to wear and then told me that i was grown up and every
now she says i want you to go up town to get me whatever it was don't ask me i don't remember
and i s i can't walk
i'm ill i'm dying you know
but no you go up town and get me this you see now she meant that sh you know no UNK now off you go yo you this is going to happen to you for a long time to come
and erm anyway er it all passed over just like that and came natural afterwards you know
and it was girls in school then that s you know when you started talking about ooh what happened to me on the beach and that
oh didn't you know i could've told you that you know then we got to know all the all the things when it was too late but as regards my mother telling us anything UNK no
was that sort of thing quite usual then that the that the children had to find out
yes the hard way yes
they used to get UNK out of their lives you know before they knew anything about it it'd happened to you
and oh it really er it frightened me to death
it really did
and i wasn't the only one i think all my family was the same
after that we sort of passed it on to the one next you know what to expect but if it was down to my mother she'd never tell you
but us girls used to tell one another afterwards you know
yeah
were you involved at all in er looking after the younger children
oh what
we never used to be able to go and play anywhere take this one with you
UNK i near i nearly UNK my s ann my sister ann
oh she was a miserable child
oh i'll never UNK oh she was the most miserable child that god every created she was honestly
and oh god and every time i got take this one with you more misery
so oh i said mam do i have to
take her
and you always had one or two of them with you know no matter where you went you oh dear
oh mm terrible
no you were never allowed to er have much time for yourself you always had one or two of the other kids
mind you can't blame my mam really you know poor thing she wanted a rest didn't she
though you thought oh come on old misery can't i go out on my own some time
the only place i was allowed to go to school i think
but as regards going out to play we always had to take some of the others with us
but then we were never far away were we
was that er w was that sort of thing quite usual then for older children
oh yes
have younger ones in tow
oh yes it was yes
because we they were nearly all big families weren't they
in them days anyway
oh yes cos there was quite a few er kids in that little street of ours you know in street
gosh yes
quite a few kids in there
but i think my mam had the most
mm
you said that erm sometimes the mums one would sit on one side of the street and one the other skipping w
mm yeah
while you UNK
yeah
would they be talking to each other
oh yes
passing the p time of day about th things in general you know
and then erm oh nearly all the UNK be sitting out
all the houses were so small that er th nearly UNK take their chairs out in the evening time in the in the summer
and there they'd be chatting across to one another or come to each UNK doors and h you know pass time of day having a little chat about one thing and another
they were glad to get out the houses i think
cos when you think of 'em now they were UNK you know
they were low and er small
would your would there be any s visiting would your mum
oh no
there wouldn't be
no
no we never had visitors my mother couldn't she couldn't afford to have visitors you know
and she couldn't visit anybody otherwise she'd have to take some of us and y she wasn't very welcome anyway with two or three kids behind her
cos she could never go on her own
erm no she used to keep herself very much to herself
as we grew up she used to sometimes go a see an aunt of ours
but then we were big enough now to look after the kids for her while she went
or she'd go to the pictures perhaps
when us kids were growing up now so well there was myself and my oth younger sister ne the one next to me
mary she died
it was us two i think what took the UNK of looking after the younger ones because as i said my older sister she left bangor quite young
so it was m myself and my sister mary really that took care of the rest of them
but then it came natural we didn't take any notice of it we thought it was what was expected of us you know
er then my mam said er when a couple or two or three of us were at work that she w UNK old man out and she did
she did
yes she did
and it was i was working my sister was working in liverpool sending some money home
then i was working and my sister mary started work and my father went out one night and he came back knocked the door and he was drunk as per usual
so my mother UNK said and i'm not opening the door to you now or ever she said
and that was it
never came back
he went to live with his mother
the one whose house i was er born in still
and er he died there at fifty
he had a heart attack when he died at fifty
yeah
and he accepted the situation
well there wa hardly anything else he could do it was a big relief to us wasn't it
because then they knew that we a couple of the kids were really terrified of him and if they'd only have to hear his UNK walking up the street and they'd start to shake
they were UNK
not that he used to hit us kids he never did
he never lay a hand on any of us children
but he hit my mother instead you know
for no reason whatever
and he wasn't the sort of man what my mother could say now look this one's been naughty today will you UNK them
she couldn't she couldn't er talk to him like that you know at all so she had to UNK us
and yet he used to UNK her
did you find it very UNK as to why he
we did
i could i couldn't understand wh why he was doing it all
you know erm i can't understand to this day why he did it
you can't understand why
quite frankly no
no i can't
cos er she didn't deserve it
she really didn't you know
i mean what would have happened to us kids if she'd have been like him
we'd have died years ago
presumably also it placed when he went erm when it placed a bit of a burden on the rest of you to ensure
yes
yes
yes
you were aware of that responsibility
oh yes
and we accepted it
did you
yes
because we went b i think i wasn't er a very well child and the UNK when i left school the doctor said i left school at fourteen and he said i had to erm find a job out of doors
now where could you find a job out of doors
so i went to work to the old market place in the high street when it was an old market an open market you know where UNK is now UNK whatever
oh yes yeah
when it was an old fashion open market and erm i went to work there on the fruit and UNK stall
and i think our wages were about twelve and six a week and then it went to fifteen shillings a week
i think i ended up by having just over a pound a week or something like that
and of course a all that was given to my mother i us i never used to get nothing back
the whole of it
the whole of it yes
so she was getting oh i'd say about ten bob from my sister in liverpool and my wages and my sister mary's m money
so erm and she didn't have him to keep so she was better off that way you know
after the a er after the time when you began to support your mum
yeah
did you notice any change in her
oh she was a much happier person then
oh yes she was
she was much happier person because this she'd threatened to do for a long time
that when we grow up grew up to help support the home sort of thing
that she would you know throw him out so that she could just couldn't tolerate him any more
and of course we agreed with her
so because it er as i said it was a relief to her i were a relief to us as children because then we weren't living in terror of him coming home and you know causing the bother
do d do you think your father was unusual in UNK at that time or was that kind of behaviour by men accepted
oh it was accepted in them days
was it
british commercial law is amongst the most expensive in the world
with new firms in the north of england under cutting their city UNK is the writing on the wall for one of UNK most traditional UNK
behind the city calm a battle is raging
a business worth three billion pounds a year is at stake
the attack is being UNK headed from his new london offices by lawyer paul
there will be firms who are practising today who will probably figure in the er top one hundred in the city who in my opinion will not be practising in that shape or form three years from now
i think they've got their cost structures er a little bit out of line and i have to be honest that i think that some of them have thought that er all you have to do is you know keep a brass plate outside your door for fifty years and the work would roll in
paul is a managing partner of a controversial firm of yorkshire lawyers
UNK has long been used by the city institutions to UNK clients
it's now become the weapon of the UNK from the north to sell law
since moving in to the heart of the city last year has become the talk of the legal world
paul is a lawyer other lawyers love to hate but his is only one of a number of yorkshire law firms that are sending a UNK down the back of the london legal establishment
they may UNK and call them UNK and co but the revolution that these firms have brought to the legal market is probably here to stay
the city law firms all UNK within the boundaries of the square mile have dominated the market in legal services
like other city institutions they grew fat on the back of the eighties boom
even when the recession hit there was money to be made from UNK and UNK is britain's largest law firm and UNK a UNK new building in the city
we have er one thousand two hundred lawyers in our firm round the world er continuing to develop their skills continuing to deal with clients on a daily basis to make sure they're able to service those demands
with two hundred and thirty partners turned over two hundred million pounds last year
the profits UNK out at a quarter of a million pounds per partner
a recent survey showed the big london firms to be the most expensive in the world
they can charge over three hundred pounds an hour for a UNK services but that's increasingly subject to negotiation
clients are not naive they understand the job that needs to be done
they understand the price that is the market price to be paid for that
it's at the end of the day what you do for them
how you do it and whether you provide real value for money that is the important thing
this week's london motor show
general UNK is promoting it's latest models in face of falling demand in european markets
the recession has made it take a hard look at the cost of law and at the attitude of big london firms that it's used for more than fifty years
keith heads its u k legal department
they maybe haven't listened to their clients enough particularly their industrial and commercial clients over the years
i think there was a there tended to be a feeling that value for money was not a requirement along with quality
why
i think it relates perhaps to the fact that er the city institutions and the city law firms er concentrated on quality and UNK value for money cost saving wasn't necessary a part of the issue
and for many of britain's best known companies the cost of law has become an issue in a way it never was before
many years ago you didn't query the fees erm and er that's no longer the case
why don't you query the fees
well in th the year that i was brought up in there was a much more er traditional fee structure which simply wasn't negotiated in the same way as it is today
until recently there wasn't anywhere else increasingly cost conscious industrial firms could go
that was before the rise of the yorkshire lawyer
costs in the north are much lower and local lawyers have bred a hard UNK approach to business
one of the country's UNK growing law firms is
leeds has grown as a financial centre over the last four or five years probably more than any other city outside london
the law firms within it have been competing very strongly with each other there are six extremely good law firms in leeds and their i think that experience in competition over the last few years will stand them in very good UNK
yeah it wasn't bad at all
you came up by train
yeah
today the UNK a presentation to a major public company which is conducting a beauty parade
it's becoming the fashion among big clients to make lawyers pitch for their custom
we've er handled nearly ten percent of all u k UNK in nineteen ninety three
some of those have been very substantial companies coming to the market with er market UNK in excess of a hundred million pounds
it's the beauty parade that's allowed regional firms access to what had been exclusively london business
certainly if we're beauty UNK against er maybe london firms where perhaps the attitude might be a little bit more than it is from the UNK firms that perhaps are used to having closer relationships with their clients
and before beauty UNK presumably a lot of these clients you wouldn't even get to meet would you
erm no it'd be very difficult to get an opportunity to do so
it was through holding a beauty parade that i c i discovered the benefits of using a regional firm
the company decided to put all it's litigation work worth over a million pounds a year out to tender
it started with a list of city firms but it soon realized there were other options
there were only three er criteria when we set out to choose a firm
er expertise was the first and foremost requirement
cost effectiveness was the second and willingness to take some of our staff was the third
er met all those criteria and they had one additional benefit their UNK base er means that er their centre er their own centre of gravity is very near where i c i's centre of gravity is up in the north of england
the northern lawyers haven't been slow to see the marketing potential of providing legal services close to home
this year has done six major UNK of northern companies
the biggest was valued at over one hundred and fifty million pounds
if you go back seven or eight years ago er the city institutions would be saying to the companies you know this is a er a major matter in the in the growth of the company and you need you need city representation you need a firm of city lawyers to deal with it
erm nowadays that's not the case and erm all the institutions know that there are some damn good firms out in the UNK who can who can provide the service
but here in UNK legal UNK until recently has been played down
the strength of the largest city firms UNK from the international business that flows through the capital
is britain's fifth largest legal business
it's certainly true that er the big regional firms now do a lot of corporate work
but we don't find if you like at the top end of the corporate finance market that they are yet as significant a competitor as are er UNK among the leading firms
but do the city firms think that they will become tough competitors in that market
it depends really what happens to them i think
i think they've built they've opened london offices many of them if those offices grow so they acquire the sort of UNK and depth of experience in the relevant areas that the big firms have got and at the moment er they may not have then of course they'll be more and more competitive
because so much of the commercial law trade go through london have opened up a second front in the capital
determined to break up what it sees as a UNK it has already spent over a million pounds on marketing and corporate entertainment
today's party is to celebrate the UNK of a UNK the client is more than happy with his choice of lawyer
i know that it was erm very much more cost effective er than we would have got er for similar services from a traditional firm in the city of london
what sort of saving do you think you've made
probably about a third overall with all the various aspects of the transaction in terms of all the legal costs
and has another trick up it's UNK
it's been actively recruiting partners out of london law firms along with their clients
one firm to experience UNK is a second tier london firm
it's lost two senior partners to yorkshire firms in little over a year
they i think are UNK or er UNK their position in the market in london by erm er a very sensible strategy of looking for er able people with client following
no doubt its an attack but other firms are doing the same
they want to take your clients and see you off the map
well i don't think its quite er the level of aggression is quite up to that i'm sure that the market for legal services is now very much more competitive which is a healthy thing and er if er if we were simply sitting on our hands from the nineteen eighties and not UNK to respond to that kind of challenge then i would be worried about it but we're not
for all that there's no denying the UNK felt by many london lawyers for tactics
they've been seen as too aggressive and too greedy
aggressive
in what sense
aggressive in terms that we fight in the market place for clients and that we er then if that's what aggressive means the answer to that is yes
er in terms of greedy in what
in that we manage to take good lawyers from other people
that's not greedy that's just sound business sense
the city revolution is far from over
this week hopes to emerge with a large birmingham law firm to strengthen its hand further
the game plan is to grow big enough to threaten even the city UNK
with other regional firms joining in the battle for city work even the biggest london firms have had to cut their fees and shake up their ideas
that in itself could be a lasting UNK to the yorkshire terrier
at the meeting of the accounts and the reports o an of the directors and auditors for the year ended thirty first december eighty nine and the final dividend for nineteen eighty nine
secondly the re election of directors retiring er and thirdly the appointment of the audit auditors and their remuneration
the a g m will be followed er directly after this meeting er by an extraordinary general meeting erm to propose er an increase in the authorized share capital to seek authority to create new preference share capital to renew the board's power to UNK shares to seek authority to purchase our own shares to reduce share capital by UNK existing preference shares to make some amendments to the employee share schemes to increase the UNK amount available for directors' fees and to enable the company to issue summary financial statements
i'll now call upon david of UNK and UNK to read the report of the auditors to the members
thank you david
erm next er i shall be proposing a resolution to receive the report and accounts and to declare a dividend
then before putting the resolution to the vote i shall say a few words and ask whether ah there are any questions
the report and accounts have been in your hands for the statutory period er and you've had the chance to read my statement
i therefore propose that the report of the directors and the audited accounts for the year ended thirty first december nineteen eighty nine now submitted to this meeting be and are UNK er received and that the final dividend of twelve point five pence er net per share recommended by the directors be and is UNK declared payable on first june nineteen ninety to holders of ordinary shares of the company on the register three p m on fourth of may nineteen ninety
we are entering the nineteen nineties as a well defined well balanced company both in the spread of our businesses and the geographical spread of our markets
we now generate sixty five percent of our sales outside the united kingdom
we had another excellent year in nineteen eighty nine with a twenty percent increase in earnings per share and a nineteen percent increase in dividends per share
since eighty two er when we UNK the two pearson public companies we have increased UNK earnings per share and dividends four fold
we have achieved this by selling top quality products and services UNK and UNK in the international marketplace by UNK businesses which UNK and support our four chosen areas of operation and by UNK of businesses which had no obvious place in those areas
i explained in my statement in the annual report about the management reorganisation which occurred at the end of nineteen eighty nine
although frank has been a director of pearson since nineteen eighty six and those of you been to this meeting in the last few years will have seen him before i'd like to introduce ah frank to you in his new capacity managing director and chief operating officer at pearson
frank will you take a bow
erm many of you will also have seen jean UNK at previous meetings which he attended in the capacity as to UNK
i'd like to welcome jean UNK to this his first a g m as a full member of the board
er now to move on to events that have happened since the er annual report was printed many of you will no doubt have seen in the press that the same time as we announced our results at the end of march that we agreed to buy er the alton towers theme park er in UNK from john for sixty million pounds er the purchase has now been completed
erm alton towers is a really marvellous addition to the group er which UNK to develop the business further both by attracting more visitors er with new and exciting UNK and also er by through their unique UNK of increasing visitor spending levels
er we also announced at the same time as the alton er towers acquisition that longman had acquired rank training for eleven and a half million pounds
er this company has a leading position er in the fast expanding field of video training products for the corporate market and that's an area which longman has identified er as a new area for expansion
longman is already one of the u k's leading providers of business education materials and will use this base to develop and expand the rank training business
if the early nineteen nineties are as testing a time for u s and u k markets as many people predict i'm nonetheless confident that pearson is better placed than most companies to UNK this
in the first quarter of this year we've seen more moderate growth in those geographical areas but in nineteen eighty nine nearly forty percent of UNK trading ca profit came from economies outside the u k and north america and we expect our activities in these other areas to continue to grow at a satisfactory rate
well i think that concludes er the er remarks that i'd like to er make
i've already put the er resolution to the shareholders but erm er before voting on it i'd be pleased to answer any questions
and could you could you say your name and
my name is mr i am an ordinary UNK of some years' standing
i welcome your speech because you have a quite a good habit of optimistic outlook future which is contrary to what a lot of other UNK are saying
it does it does the company very no chance in the following year share prices have dropped enormously
i noted you that the company bought alton towers
now i'm not i'm asking is whether its shareholders could write in to apply for a UNK ticket to alton towers and get a reduced price if they so wish
thank you very much
thank you mr
er i've er i just i'm just saying that er that last year er when i made a few remarks that they were UNK by UNK and we did leave the meeting and the share price dropped by er several p and we had to send out a UNK statement so this year we've taken the UNK of issuing a press release er at the same time as er i'm making these remarks so i hope at least they won't be UNK
erm as to i think i heard you say er ask about UNK prices to alton towers was that correct
ya
well er we we've taken a policy view over the years because the group has a number of er very attractive er products and shareholders have frequently asked if was possible erm to have concessions in all sorts of areas and the view we've taken is that it involves a great deal of administration and that our real job is to er increase the profits of the business er a as well as we can and then to pay dividends to the shareholders erm who will er then use that money er hopefully to buy a good number of our products
yes sir
good morning
my name is and er it appears to me sir that you like to make life difficult for the managers to negotiate wage settlements with the employees of the company i note that your salary has increased by more than fifty percent in one year
that i don't think will please john major or mrs thatcher for being er seeing you UNK and other directors and all the directors of our public companies UNK inflation with their UNK wage rises doesn't seem reasonable whatsoever and i think that er one should consider this in a different light
thank you for er question
there's been quite a lot of comment in the press erm on high levels of salary of UNK remuneration for directors and i think it might be helpful er if i was were t were to make some general remarks on the background er of how we er approach directors' remuneration
on the question of my own er position i think i would ask er in a minute to have sir simon to say something because er i don't i you know i don't set my own remuneration
er and in general we have a er panel of the non executive directors who set the directors' salary in relation to the other directors i am also on that panel er but obviously not in relation to my own salary
erm we have er access to the advice of professional UNK namely and co our policy is to keep base salaries at the mid point of market competitive range erm and provide bonus opportunities that can lift total take home pay into the upper UNK
erm the bonus element of the pearson scheme is highly UNK we are very keen to achieve above average performance for our shareholders and let me give you an example if in nineteen ninety erm UNK as a company achieved say five percent growth in earnings per share erm the directors' remuneration and by the way that's not a forecast so i want to make that absolutely clear it's just an illustration if earnings per share increase by five percent and you could say er therefore we would expect directors' remuneration to be perhaps increased by five percent that wouldn't be the case at all our directors' salaries would actually UNK erm ill say that again directors' total take home pay would UNK because the salary element wouldn't alter
erm so er i er i think that erm er y you'll see that erm th the situation isn't erm er perhaps quite as simple a as you might erm as you might think erm and er next year if that happened er perhaps there'd be headlines saying pearson directors er half their remuneration
erm and the reason we set this is that we are erm er the er we believe that this above average er growth in the in the erm er earnings per share of the company is what UNK increases in UNK value really depend on and er again to give an example erm if you take the f t s e a hundred companies erm and you do UNK of their er growth rates and earnings per share you will find that the average growth rate was eleven and a half percent and ours er was er twenty percent so it's above average remuneration erm er for above UNK for above average performance
and i don't think i can say much more than that but perhaps simon
i hardly feel sir that erm you don't have some influence on your salaries and the other directors' salaries i've heard a lot of directors and UNK say that they have no influence on their own salaries
this doesn't cut any ice with me because i believe that none of these directors would be in on the board if they weren't invited there by yourself
so erm
erm well i beg to correct you
er these directors are the bosses of international erm companies themselves
they have no they have no personal erm relationship with me er i'll give you the example of one of our erm er erm er most recent directors who's just joined the board mr UNK who's the head of UNK and i just described to him to you how we erm how we er selected him
we went to er we felt that we needed er a u s director because much of our business is in the u s with wide marketing experience we went to erm UNK er in america who drew up er a list of sixty people UNK from their own research erm we UNK that down as an executive to twelve
we presented these twelve names er to the board of UNK erm the board selected three er we kept one in reserve and i was sent out to america by the board to see er the two er leading candidates
erm i met mr for the first time in the airport lounge at erm er kennedy airport erm we discussed at great length and had a very interesting discussion erm er UNK erm he accepted er the job and h i he has no obligation to me whatsoever and he is one of the er members of the er remuneration committee and i actually take offence at what you're saying
simon
i'm very sorry you take offence sir
no offence meant and i really hope that you do not take offence in that way
erm
this may be out of order but er personal experience is that the er non executive directors who were involved in the compensation made a recommendation that er michael 's salary be higher erm than he in fact a agreed with he requested that we lower it and in fact that was what was done
well i do hope that our public companies take into consideration inflation in the future
er thank you very much
i'm very
ladies
sorry sir that if you took offence at anything i said
there was no offence meant
thank you
la ladies and gentlemen
lord has asked me to say a few words about erm er directors' salaries and particularly about his own
now i don't stand here in any sense of defending these salaries in fact i think our policy is entirely right and it is not UNK
UNK we have to look i think at the record of this company over the last few years and as the chairman said in his introductory remarks the growth in the company the growth in the earnings per share has been very remarkable
the er credit to that goes to the chairman and chief executive and the executive directors and they are responsible for the business and it is right in my view that they should be UNK for it and encouraged to take risks to work very hard on our behalf to ensure that growth continues er that benefits the er company it benefits the country it benefits the er UNK people who are working for it is not UNK because we are looking at productivity and the productivity in the company has increased significantly
now as the chairman said we base the salaries of directors on two elements an element of base salary which looks at market levels and we UNK have a fair base which reflects a sort of medium to upper level of companies of this size we then leverage very carefully a bonus scheme related to performance and i believe that is the right thing to do and i believe and so do my fellow directors who sit on that committee believe that it is one of the reasons that we've seen the great growth in this company over the last five years which you've achieved and which actually the chancellor of the exchequer would very glad about because it is increasing the wealth and the benefit of this country particularly as a lot of those earnings are coming from overseas and will in time be UNK in britain
so i believe we're doing the right thing i think it's for the good of the country i think it's for the good of the company and the shareholders
i'd just like to add er that i didn't take offence at the question i think it was a perfectly qu fair question it was the UNK of UNK salaries
er right could we go on to perhaps a less UNK issue
er my name's john
could i make a constructive suggestion in this context of board salaries or UNK or compensation packages or bonuses i'm saying that in a slightly tongue in cheek way because i believe that the majority of shareholders don't understand the differences between these concepts as you gentlemen evidently do
most ordinary shareholders have never had a total remuneration package and have never been part of a performance related bonus scheme
would you be prepared er chairman and gentlemen to consider pearson giving a lead in spelling out in the next annual report the precise relationship between the bonus element and some parameter which i gather from your earlier remarks is probably earnings per share
i think this might help to UNK the whole situation which is getting a little bit hot i've been
to a lot of a g UNK recently and this topic is coming up at most and one feels that it almost may become an issue at the next general election
w would you be prepared to consider this at another at a future board meeting
i think that's a very constructive suggestion and we'll certainly er consider it er in drawing up the er annual report and accounts next year
yes lady at the back
erm er my name's an ordinary UNK for long standing erm it would be very interesting i don't know whether this is possible now or maybe following on from what the speaker has said if we had some idea of the american system which is er i only know very little about it er i just how that works because we have presidents and vice presidents and er i think it work rather differently
so it would be rather interesting if we could have some sort of comparison
would one of our american directors like to
i would have to confess that by american standards the er the er directors of pearson the executive directors of pearson and er the chairman of pearson and i think that the directors of most english companies are significantly UNK by u s standards that's not to say it's right but er that seems to be the er ha the current trend
actually i didn't mean that er regarding the actual amounts because i'm fully aware of the fact that the american ones are very much higher it's merely the method by which they are erm
my own feeling is that there is a great similarity and that there is a base salary normally which is set on a competitive level with a target as in this case perhaps at the mid point perhaps at the sixty percent level or whatever it would be and that a significant UNK in compensation can be obtained by a bonus scheme if the performance of the company as measured in earnings per share return on capital return on equity or any m other measure if those objectives are met
so i think that th the scheme that erm pearson uses is er not at all UNK to what would be a fairly standard practice in the united states
and people like that but er i believe that the way it's actually organized is different
it again i have to i have to say
that talk about the company of which i'm chairman is that there is a personnel and compensation committee which in the absence of a chief executive sets the chief UNK remuneration and with the presence of the chief executive although he's not i'm not a member of that committee we work on the other senior executives of the company it's quite similar to the process used here in your company
yes sir
my name is i have been a UNK and other members of my family for many years much has already been said about directors' and your particular erm fees in particular
but er it er it appears to have been UNK that erm some of the directors who were in the bracket in nineteen eighty eight of two hundred and thirty thousand to two ninety five thousand have been increased from three hundred and fifty five thousand this year to a top of four hundred thousand
er you have also erm mentioned about the bonus er can i take it from what you have said that this is profit related
if not i suggest it should be and er therefore if unfortunately the profits of the company did go down in the UNK future the salaries of yourself and your directors would be reduced
as regards the salaries of the u s a we've read and seen about so many companies that pay sky high for v various salaries and other schemes we don't want that in this country but we do want a degree of UNK and i would repeat as somebody has already said that your salary has gone up fifty six percent which is very high
now there was one other thing if you would care to take it is that you said that it would involve a great deal of organization for UNK tickets for alton towers or UNK or any others
erm ready mix have a theme park in th UNK park and there's no problem there of issuing tickets to shareholders for erm entertainment of their families
they d don't make so much fuss about it they distribute it and it gets on very satisfactory and people er are very happy to receive these tickets
i think the question of turning it down that a lot of work is er forgive my UNK nonsense
er one other thing is the share capital is sixty five billion pounds
it's true that we had a issue erm nineteen eighty five but the reserves are now six hundred and fifty million
whether you have given this the same consideration of the increase in er directors' salaries i don't know but i think y it's worthy of er a further consideration
er one last thing er do we need so many as eight non executive directors which also to be paid
you've got five executive directors i should think that's adequate with one or two outside directors to bring outside knowledge or experience but er thirteen is too many i suggest
er well there are a number of points there and i'll try and cover them all
the first you asked again about er directors' salaries er or directors' er remuneration erm and i would only say that all the directors are er bonuses are linked to earnings per share
er i hoped i'd made clear that if the profits of UNK erm er not only if they went down but even if er there was only a small erm increase in earnings per share er next year that the directors' salaries would be very considerably reduced and i thought i'd already made that erm er directors' erm remuneration total take home pay would be considerably reduced thought i'd already made that point
erm on er alton towers which you brought up again er the question is where do you stop
er it isn't just alton towers it's whether you should get discounts on penguin books it was whether you got er bottles of UNK le tour erm it requests for many different things and er you know alright er it we could we could if alton towers seemed to be what er all shareholders wanted er perhaps we could consider that but we do have a number of a attractive products
erm er your third point was about the balance sheet and i think i'd ask the finance director
yes we will give consideration to that of course erm
sorry can i
apologies
erm we will course we will give consideration to erm a further issue which i think is what you were asking us to do
all that does in effect as you know is i is reduce the unit price share price it has no other effect erm a and i think it's purely UNK myself and nowadays i think a share price of around seven hundred p which is er where the shares are currently UNK is not e enormously UNK but of course we'll keep it under consideration
erm and your last point was about erm er the number of directors and particularly er outside directors non executive directors
well all i can say is that erm sir simon was being extremely modest when he said that the development of this company er has been due er entirely to the executive directors
that isn't actually the case erm the non executive directors have been enormously helpful in er the field of strategy in giving the executive advice er they play a very full er role in the develop er m development of the company and erm they also er keep the er executives er in order
who would sack me
ch chairman i wonder if i may just add to that
i'm sure you know that the bank of england the bank of england have made a very strong point that on balance there should be more non executive directors than executive directors in the company and er it is felt very strongly that to get a good mix of non executive directors really does protect the UNK interests and er i think we're very much following the lead er of the bank of england erm in this particular respect
and i think that we are very lucky in the very high UNK of non executive directors we've been able to attract
name sir
on saturday afternoon last
what
your name
oh sorry
same as jam
er it's very difficult yes you all laughed when i asked a question last year from over there to get a capital p in pearson because you all laughed it took twenty weeks to get it in the times do you remember
right
now we've got a company secretary he is er an f c i s chartered institute secretaries that's much better than a chartered accountant they're no damn good as secretaries right
and the
l b people really they're not up to much are they
now this chap is supposed to have constructive UNK ability what do we mean the police
UNK to laugh off his twenty week delay in getting my capital p
right
now can we look at his pay cos you all been busy on the directors' pay and this chartered secretary is really important and so that he could be available on a saturday afternoon if he was wanted
well now the problem you say it's emotional shall i say it was UNK it was UNK
now erm the situation there was that my vicar came to see me and erm what happened was that we've got three churches well luckily one of them only has about twelve in it another has eighty and another sixty and he said well what did he do about UNK
and so well i didn't like what he was doing but at any rate it happened on sunday morning er somebody read the lesson and it was saint john and there were UNK and of course it was skipping about the verses all over the place you just got fed up with verses
right he then went to the UNK and he said that he was gonna UNK about UNK actually but he's a quiet fellow and he shouted at the top of his voice i'm speaking about UNK
er mr
yes is
er
that UNK
er n what er i think you need to do is ask your question because er
oh right
to have a UNK speech is not in order
i'm so sorry
yes right
is erm do we know anything about UNK or anything
another point is up in hull in october er somebody wrote a book about UNK and he got death threats so the vice chancellor of hull university he's in UNK he's a director of j h UNK in industrial
so i suggest the secretary rings up the secretary of UNK don't say you're listed in newspapers cos industrial people don't like that but have a word with UNK and they'll tell you what's gone on
so what is your question
the question is can a small UNK do anything for UNK am i doing damage for pearson
i'm trying
mm
to help pearson
mm
not pick it to bits over its directors' salaries
er well thank you for your offer of help it is er i it's er clearly a very difficult issue there are erm there are important issues of principle er in er conflicting directions it is not an easy one and erm er i don't er really know that there is anything er that er any UNK of UNK is able to do about it
thank you
are there any further questions
thank you
well i will now put the resolution to the meeting those in favour would they raise their hands thank you those against there is nobody so i can declare it carried unanimously
thank you very much
erm the next matter is the re election of the retiring directors and a separate resolution is required for each one er i've asked mr to propose the first resolution
i propose that mr j h a director retiring by rotation be and if UNK re elected a director of the company
right
thank you mr
i put the resolution to the meeting
those in favour any against
thank you
i declare the resolution carried
mr to propose sir simon
i propose that sir simon a director retiring by rotation be and if UNK re elected a director of the company
put the resolution to the meeting
those in favour any against thank you
i declare the resolution carried
er mr
i propose that mr a director retiring by rotation be and if UNK re elected a director of the company
i put the resolution to the meeting
those in favour any against i declare the resolution carried
mr
er i'd like to propose that mr j c a director retiring in accordance with article eighty of the company's articles of association be and is UNK re elected a director of the company
i put the resolution to the meeting
those in favour any against thank you
i declare the resolution carried
erm we now come to the appointment of the auditors and the question of their remuneration
under the provisions of the companies act nineteen eighty five their appointment er requires the annual approval of the shareholders
i therefore propose that UNK and UNK be and are UNK appointed auditors to the company to hold office from the conclusion of this meeting until the conclusion of the next meeting er of the company at which accounts are laid for the company in accordance with section two four one companies act nineteen eighty five and that their remuneration for this period be fixed by the directors
i put the resolution to the meeting
those in favour any against
thank you
i declare the resolution carried
well that concludes the business of the a g m and er it's now twelve forty and er we can move straight on to deal with the business of the extraordinary general meeting
erm you already had er the opportunity to read my letter of the eighteenth of april er circulated with the report and accounts which fully explains the proposals being put forward and which are for firstly increasing the authorized share capital of the company creating two new classes of preference share er UNK the board's authority to UNK shares UNK the board's power to modify UNK rights UNK the company to purchase its own er ordinary shares reducing the company's share capital by UNK the existing preference shares er making certain amendments to the company's employee share schemes increasing the UNK sum available for directors' fees and UNK the company to issue summary financial statements
erm i hope that the er circular er pretty fully explains er these proposals but er if there are er questions er i would be very pleased to answer them
well if there aren't any questions er i would return to the resolutions er separately and i would propose the first one which is an ordinary resolution namely it's resolution one set out in the notice of meeting to increase the authorized share capital of the company
i put the resolution to the meeting those in favour any against
i declare the resolution carried it's an ordinary resolution
erm secondly i propose a special resolution two set out in the notice of the meeting to create and UNK fifty thousand preference shares of u s dollars a hundred er each and a hundred billion er preference shares of one pound each er i put the resolution to the meeting those in favour any against
i declare the er special resolution er carried
erm i propose that ordinary resolution three set out in the notice of the meeting to grant authority to the board to exercise the powers of the company to UNK ordinary shares er this is an annual er event i put the resolution to the meeting those in favour any against
i declare the er resolution carried as an ordinary resolution
erm next i propose as a er resolution four which is a special resolution and s set out in the notice of the meeting and is to modify to a limited extent the obligations relating to the UNK of shares for cash contained in section eighty nine of the companies act
er i put the resolution to the meeting those in favour any against
i declare the resolution carried as a special resolution
next resolution five which is an ordinary resolution er set ou set out in the notice of the meeting which is to UNK the company to make market purchases of the ordinary shares of the company
this again is an annual
i put the resolution to the meeting those in favour any against i declare the resolution er carried er as an ordinary resolution
er resolution six is a special resolution set out in the notice of the meeting and is to reduce the company's share capital by UNK the five erm hundred and one thousand three and a half percent cumulative preference shares of one pound er each at par
i put the resolution to the meeting those in favour
s i well i asked for questions before mr but erm what is your question
why is there a need sir to UNK the five hundred and one thousand pounds of the three and a half percent cumulative UNK shares it's quite a low interest involved
what a low interest share
well this gives us the ability er for a UNK up operation but the finance director will give more details
thank you very much
it's helpful in the context of the dollar preference shares we want to issue because one of the factors of this very small and as you say cheap er historic issue of preference shares is that er no preference shares other than those can be UNK prior to that and the dollar shares we wish to issue which are permanent shares can be er can be erm UNK at our option and we do want to keep that flexibility in the context of either if interest rates get very high or if the tax treaty between the u s and the u k changes to make them more UNK on the company and in those circumstances we would be inhibited by the existence of this small historic issue of preference shares and therefore it is on balance although you're quite right there a cheap er source of capital in themselves it is helpful to the company in the wider sense i believe if they are UNK
i put the resolution to the meeting those in favour any against declare the resolution er carried as a special resolution
er next is resolution seven which is an ordinary resolution set out in the notice of the meeting and it is to UNK the directors to amend the company's employee share schemes in the manner set out in the circular dated eighteenth of april nineteen ninety to members of the company
i put the resolution to the meeting those in favour any against i declare the resolution carried as an ordinary resolution
erm resolution eight er set out in the notice of the meeting to increase the UNK annual sum available for directors' fees to two hundred and fifty thousand pounds i put the resolution to the meeting those in favour any against i declare the resolution carried as an ordinary re resolution
erm finally resolution nine which is a special resolution set out in the notice of the meeting er and it's to alter the company's articles to enable the company to issue summary financial statements
i put the resolution to the meeting those in favour any against thank you very much i declare the resolution carried as a special UNK resolution
erm that concludes the business of the extraordinary general meeting erm thank you very much for attending and making it a lively meeting and erm my colleagues and i will be pleased to erm meet you in the foyer er where refreshments are being served
thank you very much
hello
local UNK as the two big UNK cities of the east midlands lock UNK
and you know who's here to survey the UNK if indeed there is any
UNK of course and at the risk of UNK on goals you can see all the action that UNK from the first division yesterday
and there's more our profile of one of UNK men of the week aston UNK mark UNK
now on the subject of aston villa we can confirm that despite today's report to the contrary the two million pound transfer of tony UNK to is on
the former england UNK will shortly be on his way to italy as we're about to hear from ron UNK and gary UNK
there are reports in today's paper ron that there are problems with the tony UNK deal to italy because of personal terms is this true
i don't think so i mean i left it all last night and everything seemed er UNK and er i haven't heard anything to the contrary today
erm the way i understand the situation is UNK happy with er his arrangement and that the clubs have agreed and i think it's just a matter of them going back now to report back to their president the italian people and then the way i see it he'll go after the er game for a medical and you know there shouldn't be any problems there
looks good business at villa i mean he's an exciting player but two million pounds that's a huge fee
well in this day and age you get your reserve team player normally
erm i think what it is i think it's a it's a it's a deal that's should suit all parties
i mean UNK been at the club a long time he's expressed a wish to go erm his style and his age is probably just right to go on the continent he's twenty six years of age and er i would guess that his particular style wou possibly would be better suited to continental play than it is in england
yeah good UNK from ron cos i think that's a UNK deal for villa but anyway that's that sorted out
not half oh
let's turn our attention to today's little matter leicester and nottingham forest
yet another midlands derby and i think this season
well
we've worked out each of the midlands clubs has to play sixteen midlands UNK
yeah we
which is great for us
it's great for us we
is it good for them
well we say that but i mean they're not really UNK
if you take the extreme stoke peterborough you wouldn't call that a derby or oxford versus derby county
you would hardly call that a derby
there are games in our region and as you rightly say they're great for us but er i wouldn't say that they're UNK i mean the UNK are birmingham west UNK and west UNK
wolves
and wolves and obviously today's game is a derby
leicester forest derby yeah
that's right but you wouldn't say that they're all UNK tony would you not really i wouldn't have thought so anyway
UNK at the game is he
yeah alex UNK
alex UNK i wonder who he wants er i think it could be that he's after you know
he certainly needs some more players you know he's not got enough
well we'll probably find out now let's er go straight over to UNK street where we can join our UNK alan UNK and ron UNK
well the new UNK street taking shape the five million pound main stand official open since our last visit here and when the lower tier is completed by the end of the year the stand will house about ten thousand people all seated and under cover
one facility has already had plenty of use and that's the UNK room
leicester have had to cope with a lot of injuries in the early part of the season the most serious blow the loss of steve UNK
his height and strength will be badly missed in attacked as leicester field what must be the smallest striking partnership in the first division
UNK jochim the star of UNK youth team last season is just five feet six inches tall and david speedy towers over him with a UNK five feet seven
the message to UNK midfield is keep the ball on the ground
well leicester could go third in the table if they win today and as brian little points out that's a big improvement on their early position
i think the last time you were here we were actually in the bottom half of the table but shot up to about seventh and since then once we got close to the people with games in hand and catching on the extra games we've come up into the top three sometimes
so today puts us back into third place if we win and obviously we want to be there
and you hit a forest team that's UNK for the last five matches
yeah i think we're going to have a major say in what goes on this season
i mean er they've had so many problems injury wise i doubt whether they've played the same tw the same team twice at any stage this season and er on the day with the players they've got available they're going to have a major say in this league this season
well like leicester nottingham forest have been UNK by injuries
carl UNK and gary bull yet to kick a ball this season
ian UNK making slow UNK but at least there's good news in the return of centre half colin cooper who starts his first game for two months and two recently injured strikers are back in UNK ironically the biggest partnership in the division
leading UNK stan collimore a massive six feet four and his UNK robert rozario a UNK six foot three
does that mean forest midfield will keep the ball in the air i wonder
well forest have recently enjoyed an UNK spell frank UNK a much happier man
yes er we've five games now and er although we haven't won as many as i would've liked at least erm we've stayed UNK
er we're getting a few bodies back into the team UNK the treatment room and things are looking a lot better
a very hard game for you this against leicester but you do have collimore in form
yes i mean stan missed wednesday and i think we missed him and it's good to have him back today it will be a very difficult game
you know i think leicester are one of the er one of the real UNK in this division to go up
it's a local derby er and let's just hope it's a good game and everybody enjoys it
and the referee john UNK from sheffield starting the game and that's earlier than he should have done
you haven't missed anything though
cooper gets the first header away
it's a very UNK day here by the way and cold as well and i think that's gonna have some affect on the game
difficult to see which way the wind is blowing at the moment it's quite UNK
anyway he'll judge that one well but it's er falls neatly for gemmell and a good lay off here to UNK black early chance for nottingham forest and really UNK black will be as they say rather disappointed he didn't do better there ron UNK
well a great situation UNK gemmell followed up the long ball picked up the as they ran at the defence and then he's committed to play it and then he's just UNK it in nicely for UNK black on his left side
and really he should really have gone across the face of the goal with it
he's gone for the narrow side he's tried to squeeze it in the in the near post when he'd got all the far post to go for
but that's a shocking that's a shocking let off
and that was only about a minute of the game gone and i dare say er ian whose place he's taking on that left hand side would have UNK that kind of opportunity
anyway leicester have won a free kick UNK inside the forest half
the ball set up for to drive it straight into the wall speedy then tried the shot oldfield takes over
and leicester forced to go all the way back into their own half
this is hill speedy an excellent ball and a very good tackle on speedy by cooper
speedy won't agree at the moment because he's UNK in UNK and there's a little bit of UNK that followed that
but i personally felt that was a good tackle on speedy ron how did you see it
yeah i think colin cooper stepped in to play very quickly and that's something i think frank clarke w will be looking for from him
he's a quick UNK defender speedy was just hanging on waiting for the ball to be played into him and i must confess i didn't really see anything afterwards i mean well if you look at that doesn't seem anything UNK does it
well he's probably just caught him on the back of on the back of the calf but er i thought it was as you say i thought it was a nice sharp UNK tackle
another second forest player seemed to go in then i don't know whether it was him that caught speedy rather than cooper with the initial challenge
anyway david speedy
yeah was in a little UNK job there but i honestly don't think he if he caught him it was quite UNK
yeah i'm sure you're right
and i was just thinking then that er frank clarke will want will want that sort of speed across the across the ground from cooper it's perhaps something they've lack in recent games stability at the heart of their defence of notts forest
turn forward by phillips and then agnew UNK leicester wins it back again
this is whitlow driving it long to speedy
agnew loses out in the challenge in midfield but gemmell manages to find black not long for collimore but too long
UNK ward has missed only one game in UNK goal since he arrived in the summer from cardiff city
and with the aid of the wind got an awful lot of distance on that kick and almost earned side a corner it was only just kept in by his opposite number tommy UNK
i think the wind ron is er behind UNK backs in this half
yes you would you just wonder whether forest back four might just push up a little bit higher and let the ball carry through to the keeper every time
here goes UNK black again getting in behind the defenders but he rather over played his first touch then
and the northern ireland international surprisingly finding himself in the clear twice already in the first five minutes although that was er obviously not a chance
the first one certainly was
UNK header clear thomson wins it back for leicester gets it back again from greyson
lovely UNK of the ball steve thomson and he finds young neil lewis on the left and this UNK very effective indeed going forward
hill and collimore UNK and leicester did well to win that back
a long ball by greyson chettle is underneath it
UNK black
a little bit unfortunate there UNK black he's played he's played a nice ball down the side down the channel but that's the sort of ball collimore would have UNK on
i don't think it was that robert UNK admit to being the quickest player in the world
but that so we think that's an area where forest will try and try and exploit just playing down the sides of the er leicester centre halves and let er collimore use this great pace of his
i saw him play here last year for southend and to be fair he absolutely ripped er the leicester defence apart
oldfield taking a bit of a risk there on the edge of his own box but leicester got away with it
lewis forward to ormanroyd UNK sticking very tight and in the end pushing the leicester man
and the free kick goes in early to jochim just UNK his goalkeeper to come out and collect that one
yes they're gonna have a little bit of a problem leicester
i mean their stock play normally is er a quality ball from thomson into big UNK well you know with UNK missing they they've gotta sort of be a little bit more UNK with their free kicks
speedy can of course you know he's a good little UNK for a small lad but they're not just gonna be able to UNK the ball up there
they're gonna have to play their way in
yes incidentally steve UNK has er that serious knee injury UNK have been injured i think they're still not sure exactly how long he's gonna be out
but it is gonna be a lengthy er injury and that is a major blow so successfully converted from centre half to UNK
the UNK has UNK there and it's gone nottingham forest way
just talking of UNK incidentally he scored twenty goals in his thirty seven games since moving in to attack
that's how effective he'd been
rozario calling for the high ball and wins it colin collimore won back then by greyson and a difficult one for the goalkeeper as phillips came in on him and forest win the throw
stewart UNK very deep cross towards rozario and it dropped nicely for whitlow to clear
UNK lay off thomson UNK the forest man gemmell and the whistle has gone eventually for a free kick to forest
foul on steve stone
gemmell rozario he's gone well here rozario he's done very well and then he hit it straight against his own man
collimore thomson for leicester speedy agnew lewis on the left it's a bit short that ball lewis did well to get it
now agnew again great ball for speedy and that's the kind of defending that forest have been missing from colin cooper just hurt his shoulder then but he's er still holding it as play goes on and whitlow quite clearly holding collimore then
yes i think you saw there UNK respect for collimore he doesn't want him to get turn round and running at him because big UNK got great touch and he's got very he's got UNK pace
here is collimore phillips down the right UNK he was offside that was UNK from UNK point of view and collimore dumped to the ground when he played the ball away then and er he's just holding er his UNK just above his UNK there and cooper is still in trouble from that er shoulder he injured moments ago UNK all right to continue and the forest UNK graham UNK busy treating collimore
busy is something graham UNK has been all season with all forest injuries ward with a free kick gets it clear straight to thomson though greyson thomson gemmell closes down the room UNK that's a very good ball
agnew speedy coming in ormanroyd then got in his way rather but it comes still to thomson he lays it off to lewis and the cross is too hard
some good football there from leicester city all UNK by steve thomson
given time and space he's an excellent midfield player you know
he's got great feet he can pass the ball UNK and he sees things he UNK the play
i mean he tried the forest defence out on the left hand side t to start with switched the player and got young lewis in and really forest could have done with a better ball er sorry leicester could have done with a better final ball from lewis
well this is worrying now for forest because UNK gone down again holding that shoulder
it's his first er match or at least the first he's started since the opening weeks of the season
he did come on as a substitute against er oxford in UNK and frank UNK first signing injured his shoulder in this UNK with speedy
complete accident
got a kick on the head as well
it's the shoulder that's giving him a problem and er that's always tricky because er it can er obviously affect the way a defender approaches the more physical aspect of his job
they can't really expect him to have a physical game this afternoon can they with david speedy
well another physical challenge in midfield seen there by the referee and forest get the free kick and the ball was rolling when pearce took it
it was a great kick actually out to phillips on the right it was a pity it was moving
still nil eleven and a half minutes gone
chettle looking for rozario and finds him and it goes towards collimore just cleared in the nick of time by whitlow
now oldfield for leicester city
greyson all too easy for stone to win back
nice control on the ball by gemmell rozario UNK off the first challenge from whitlow and UNK black
has collimore outside him and collimore drives his cross in and is cleared by hill thomson playing it back in difficult one for greyson and he was a little bit fortunate i think there to find thomson who's given it away anyway
stewart pearce rozario wants it played in quickly
oldfield prevented the cross now collimore not quite and agnew did well
ormanroyd good ball for speedy and on it goes to jochim but it's too long
there's a little bit of a more measured ball there by david speedy could have put jochim with a real shout
he'd made a super little UNK across the line of forest defenders
phillips straight to hill and that's a long ball aimed at ormanroyd cooper across to cover and you just saw him UNK a little bit again there as he charged in on ormanroyd
that shoulder obviously still him a problem he seems to be holding it a little bit UNK as it comes in to speedy now
chettle gets it away
that would be a little bit of a problem for frank clarke if er cooper has got a problem with his shoulder you know if it's if it's serious because looking at his people on his bench you know neil webb and crosby and looking at the make up of his team he hasn't really got anybody he could slot back in there unless he put er rozario in there
yes that's true it's a good point
so it'll be er very important that the injury doesn't affect cooper for too long here
having said that he's been out that long you know alan and cooper he'll not want to miss any more football surely
leicester city get the throw in
jochim won it greyson not a very good ball gemmell wins it back for forest now black forward UNK offside and that looked a very close decision
ooh i'd like to look at that one again alan
i mean that's bang in front of us and that's the sort of area they'll be looking to play the ball down the sides for UNK pace and i wouldn't wonder on it
i would wonder i made him well it doesn't clearly show it there i made him UNK from our position
meanwhile agnew UNK it in and there is another offside decision and this time it's gone in UNK favour
speedy was offside
i think stan UNK just said to the UNK to the UNK on this side you know i started my run from m my half of the field but that would be a dangerous game to play against somebody with his pace is to give him too much space at the back of him
oh that's a lovely header on as well it almost reached rozario greyson gets it clear
chettle back into the leicester half now thomson and agnew combining well and the first time ball UNK out towards ormanroyd
needs some help and gets it from thomson who started this move off and lifted in towards agnew cooper UNK it still hasn't gone out and er phillips just prevented it i think going for a corner yes it's a throw
thomson again for leicester city looking very influential early on here
this is lewis only nineteen this lad and very UNK and wins the corner
yes you're spot there alan erm UNK thomson is pulling all the UNK for leicester
i'm a little bit surprised stone hasn't tried to get a bit closer to him although i think he's been given the job of tracking agnew who's more of an attacking midfield player
thomson takes the corner as well
whitlow coming in on that near post the goalkeeper was very UNK then and er has benefited by getting the free kick tommy UNK
yeah that might be of those situations with the referee being over protective towards the goalkeeper
i don't really think he had a claim on that ball the UNK
i mean he's come out over the top of his own defenders and i over big ormanroyd and he can do little else but push it back down into the pack
couldn't really see how there was a foul there
another free kick has been given this time against big mike whitlow lively start to the game and a lively start for the referee
eleven free kicks for UNK already
gemmell UNK the latest free kick into the box pearce did well to win that one
hill only half clear and that's a goal kick
but i think we're seeing something in the forest side we haven't see for what twelve fourteen years are we
they just they th they UNK you know they lift balls into the box now
i mean we've always associated forest with playing their way into the penalty area now with rozario er with collimore they've got the licence or the facility just to knock long balls through the air at them
this is UNK black and again he looks to use UNK pace and he moved into a great position there collimore
whitlow across to block he still gets the cross in that was dangerous
agnew and hill combining to get is clear but it's a corner and that cross caused real problems to leicester
there's no danger if leicester don't seal off this space
here's that ball again up alongside
defenders gone deep and kept collimore on side and this is where you expect stan to do his trick
actually he's tried to play it in early there
collimore will remain a threat from the corner he has just won
rozario on the near post chettle also has come forward for this kick and it goes in towards that near post area where oldfield takes no chances
second UNK corner then for forest and again it's aimed at rozario who wins it this time that's dangerous
UNK away by hill to jochim
lovely little turn he's UNK cooper he's got the pace to go all the way here jochim
how does the referee interpret that foul
UNK the guilty player jochim had got away from him and unless the referee decides that there was another defender coming round on the cover there UNK could be in big trouble
i think you'll find cooper was just a touch deeper than him albeit very wide
i think colin cooper just got round the side of this a brilliant run from young good turn and he's a he's attacked the heart of the defence and look at UNK position now i think he's just slightly nearer to the keeper than laws
the yellow card for a foul on jochim and but laws will be relieved he certainly could have gone for that
some UNK might have interpreted that as a sending off offence
whitlow driving the free kick into the wall and then lays it off to lewis UNK in and away by collimore
whitlow again finding thomson now agnew pearce up well and agnew on to it again lewis oldfield comes into the game thomson
good football this by leicester jochim across by greyson ormanroyd coming in on the back post
pearce gets it away to oldfield well he's scored some really spectacular goals in his career david oldfield and he wasn't far off with that shot
i must confess when this one dropped down at him and he UNK it out it's a lovely little bit of link up play by jochim again
good early ball in partial clearance i thought ormanroyd might have got on that
partial clearance here from stewart pearce
now this is and i must admit when he pulled the trigger then i thought that was going to go right in the back of the net
but a good piece of attacking play from UNK
all credit to them they know they haven't got a big guy apart from ormanroyd as an UNK player so they're prepared to be patient and build up and pass the ball al pass their way through
leicester city in the middle of a good spell of form here
seventh in the table of the start of play nineteen points from their ten games six wins a draw and three UNK
and UNK here at UNK street in six matches in league and cup
matches in hand on the sides all around them in the table and of course the team that has gone very close to promotion the last two seasons UNK losing in the UNK final
looking in the mood and the form to be up there again
greyson gemmell comes in to win it back for forest
black was weak in possession and this is thomson now oldfield lewis moving down the left and here he is eventually in possession
but he's lost it again forest throw
stone no problem for whitlow although that almost dropped in a bit short for UNK ward
we do see the problems we've seen it at both ends the UNK have when people chase a lost cause like UNK just done there
you know rea no real no real problems at first but then they chase put the keeper under pressure and the keepers tend to panic
UNK through the first half here at UNK street still leicester city nil nottingham forest nil but a good game
good kick there by ward chettle wins it thomson finding agnew there's leicester build now with greyson thomson lewis making a run down the left agnew wins it back again for leicester he's playing well
thomson jochim and gemmell accepts the gift and then gives it back to oldfield
and a little UNK period of play but here's lewis to ormanroyd speedy sets it up for greyson and in it goes again towards agnew the captain and did that cross the line yes it's a corner
well some of the football leicester have played in this opening twenty o twenty minutes has been some of the best i've seen them
i i've probably seen them about four or five times in the last six months and they do tend to go a bit route one when UNK is playing but today their link up play has been excellent
thomson with the corner he's looking for whitlow but it was headed by rozario thomson can try again
and that UNK off the defender and UNK kindly with tommy UNK
but apart from this er for leicester this alan now they're starting to s squeeze a little bit and they've got to be a little bit careful they don't leave collimore too much space to run into
but at the moment they're starting to dominate the game
good header by rozario collimore couldn't control it and that's the sort of link up frank UNK be looking for
ball onto rozario a little touch through and then the UNK pace of er collimore
rozario wearing a UNK i notice there ron he wouldn't get into your team wearing a UNK would he
jochim turns it through to speedy who couldn't repeat the dose
here's thomson and now lewis turned back again by ormanroyd and leicester playing some good football in UNK half
i think leicester public are gonna have to be a little bit patient with their team
i mean forest are pulling everybody behind the ball and you know they can't just sling the ball through
they're working is through and they they're playing some super little link up stuff
he's offside here it won't count
long before er it got to oldfield speedy was offside
i mean we haven't seen an awful lot of er UNK jochim yet but th the two occasions when the UNK been fed into him he's shown a brilliant ability to turn with the ball and get at the defenders
and i think if people like thomson can sort of give him that sort of service he's going to make life awfully difficult for the forest de central defence
and his partner there of course speedy he knows h you know he knows what's what in the game doesn't he
he's seen it all he's been there
yes this is his eleventh league club leicester city
i was reading somewhere this morning where he'd been with eight clubs in one season
good quiz question that one
agnew turning it on towards ormanroyd and the header by laws was excellent
back in the side now played six in a row
des little the signing from UNK has been UNK because er frank clarke felt he'd lost a little bit of confidence in UNK poor start to the season
ormanroyd wins the header speedy UNK it on again and chettle er chettle rather got it away as jochim came in on him
collimore doing well there he really turned greyson and he's got black UNK down the left and rozario to the right
good running by oldfield to get back
i have to say i think big stan took the wrong option then you know
it's still chances here for forest phillips playing it in again towards collimore good one handed catch by ward
i thought collimore had good break three against two and i thought the ball he should have played he should have measured a ball into er UNK
it would have given a similar sort of chance to the one he missed in the first minute
ormanroyd winning another header inevitably
jochim to speedy UNK lay off a good one for lewis gets it in quickly on the left foot ormanroyd and then speedy UNK with pearce as he went in to try and turn the ball UNK and it's all ended up a goal kick
another very dangerous UNK
i thought ormanroyd g got more on that actually when he headed it
i thought he'd actually caught a defender as he headed it but er he hasn't really got a good contact on the ball
i think as you said earlier the wind is playing a big part in the game and i would i would imagine er the forest the forest UNK be very happy to get to half time no score
i think they would fancy their chances going er with the wind behind them
it's a cold wind too i can tell you a real UNK afternoon here
on the day we lost the hour on the clock it looks as though UNK started in UNK
i think winter started in august
i don't know about in UNK
well you should never worry you always manage to find the sunshine somewhere don't you
i could do with a little bit up here UNK
here's collimore
oh it's a great effort by collimore
splendid work there ron by the big man
yes he did well
it it's not his best side er his right foot but you know he can weigh in on that side but er he does have a UNK for goals
which is understandable considering the vein he's in at the moment
that's er eight in seven games for him the last seven
there goes oldfield lewis it's exciting this young man when he goes forward like this
oh it's a tremendous run and it took a very fine tackle by chettle to stop him
oh that was brilliant wasn't it
picked up the pace picked up the square ball here and attacked he went like a bomb
that's UNK no defender in the world whatever level they are likes being attacked with by a pace player running at them
he really forced the issue there didn't he lewis and caused the corner
that's a tricky corner too turns it back in an UNK header and speedy has turned it in
half an hour gone the captain has an injury but his side have taken the lead
david UNK goal
yes and thoroughly deserved
i mean we could sense a goal was coming
good ball in they they've ch changed the UNK a little bit on this one
thomson he's hit a deeper corner
yep they've get in each other 's way but there's speedy a UNK yard off the keeper
that's a good area to be on corner kicks when the UNK about
just in front of the keeper because it's amazing how many things fall down just in front of the keeper
david UNK eighth goal of the season he's top UNK here he got a couple in the last home game against notts county and that was as ron perfectly described it a real UNK in action there
well i think it's reasonable to say as well it was one that was deserved wasn't it
they've been threatening that for the last fifteen minutes or so
had a er not the best of starts but they've taken control of the game for my money o over the last period
agnew has just er received treatment from alan smith
he got kicked in the head by his own player mike whitlow there but i don't think he'll mind because er it all contributed to the goal
fourteen minutes of the first half remaining and leicester city UNK in front
here goes collimore and black good ball for rozario stone black again
needs the cross now and he supplies it towards collimore touched away and a shot by phillips took a UNK off lewis for a corner
and you wouldn't have bet against that fellow UNK one in would you phillips
i mean that's one of his stock in trades he's a superb UNK of the ball and it was there for a second with a chance was there for a second
very good signing phillips has been already he's er played both sides of midfield filled in at centre back as well in recent matches
he's only been with the club a few weeks
black UNK the corner into the near post and that UNK everyone
jochim took that beautifully agnew to speedy good ball
oldfield nice form out from leicester
my word they're UNK it around beautifully
lewis great running by oldfield just played it in too long for him but he's gonna get it anyway
and a good ball to lewis thomson agnew splendid football from leicester city
UNK cross into the near post speedy just missed it almost sat up perfectly for him
forest on the record a little bit here but they suddenly break themselves and that's great defending again by whitlow
but at the moment they're on fire leicester are on fire at the moment
as i say this fellow the last twenty minutes are the best i've seen leicester city play for a long time
and it's been bought upon by necessity really they've had to play their way through and they certainly should be capable of doing that
and some of the UNK play has been tremendous in this period of time
here was that previous attack ron
yeah it's a good early ball in from greyson as well
a combination of i would think of about twelve passes but tha they switched the play from side to side
whitlow judging a difficult UNK well
he looks the part at centre back as well
but here's rozario gemmell black pearce is up in support but he goes for the long ball in and hill met it first
and that came off simon greyson
oh no it didn't the UNK changed his mind
i think it was very important as well for leicester to get a goal while they're having a good spell because er there's no there's no doubt i would expect forest to put a far more sustained pressure on the second half with the wind in their backs
i could see them able to hit their front players a lot easier
what lovely skill that was by thomson in a very tight situation although in the end he's given it away
for me he's been the best player on the field this first half
yes
UNK lay off well read by whitlow agnew ormanroyd and now oldfield
good work though gemmell came back to rob him
UNK black on the counter attack rozario slipped i think fortunate to get it back and finds black in a good position
and leicester worked hard to win that back
chettle wins back the header but it's gone straight to whitlow thomson takes over and why not the way he's played
always one to get and usually using it well and he's got a throw in
yeah i think the biggest single difference in the two sides at the moment let's see what happens here first
turned back to ormanroyd who couldn't control it first time and that was enough for forest to win it back
rozario did well then
black seeing quite a bit of the ball on this side of the field
pearce look for phillips on the right lewis got there first but it dropped to stone
rozario stone again that was a clever effort really was
it was clever
i don't think the keeper was entitled to do that was he
i think UNK ward might have got er got a catch on that
but i was just saying here let's have a little look at this as he pops it off now
stone stood it in there just stood it in there but it's a bit UNK really
i suppose safety first is the order of the day
it has produced a corner though
black will take it swinging it in UNK on by rozario and the goalkeeper made up for er what might have been an error a moment or two ago by coming UNK in with pearce right in front of him and rozario i mean on the flick
i was saying the single biggest difference for me between the two sides has a been the passing but also the movement
there's been some tremendous movement from the leicester city if you like the front six the midfield players and the er front three
you know i've talked about UNK passing from midfield but you've always got to be have targets to hit you see if you're a passing player and certainly the leicester players have given him that
and phillips found collimore a willing target then but hill came back to deny it
yes at the moment he's sort of he he's the lone UNK isn't he collimore
always a threat
oh no what's he UNK ward has picked up a back pass
and they've taken the free kick quickly and tried to take full advantage of the situation and the referee has said you can't do that
i think they can alan i think they can
be interesting that one isn't it
the UNK he's committed the UNK error by picking up the er the back pass oh he's given a free kick the other way
well that's UNK me
that's why it happened
could you call that a deliberate back pass it almost came off UNK er foot by mistake
well i can't see what else he's given this decision for now
well that was a mystery a little bit initially
why the second free kick was given in UNK favour must remain an even greater one
we need UNK to sort that one out
well gary UNK somebody's got to UNK the mystery
i mean for me they for me they should be drawing one each actually now
what UNK and gary UNK you mean or the teams right fair enough
thomson good ball out to lewis
that's a fine ball into speedy and a lovely little lay off to jochim
yes that was a very interesting talking point and er no doubt UNK have a view on that at half time
there's black gemmell pearce bit long to rozario good ball that oh he almost UNK it down into the path of stone
now don't pick this one up UNK no he knew about that
good spell this for nottingham forest
law's in possession looks for colin UNK in the middle hand ball
well that was totally unnecessary from pete
the UNK he let the ball drop behind him but er he still had a chance to get back on this
i mean simon greyson is not picking up here neither is colin hill and really it's come on a little bit sudden but that was totally unnecessary as well
that well we've seen some UNK cuts things going in the last five minutes or so haven't we
but i must admit i've got to know what happened with that goal or free kick in
yes another assignment for the UNK i think he'll have to speak to the referee about that
gemmell straight on to the head of hill and thomson UNK by gemmell
pearce UNK it in UNK and no risks taken by big mike whitlow
corner
actually they've picked up the pace forest since the goal erm don't this leicester are playing anywhere near as well as they were at the time they scored
corner goes in deep pearce getting up well and ward got up better than anyone and good safe hands as well by the keeper
can smile now
were we right did he give a free kick
in my book he gave a free kick for forest
certainly looks as if he did i mean he didn't give any other indication
well i can't think why a free kick would have been given for anything else
er certainly forest believed it was and ward believed it was a free kick you could tell by the expression on his face
it's one to leave to half time when we've got a bit more time to er examine the incident perhaps
here we've only got er what four minutes less than that remaining leicester leading
remaining
leicester leading one nil against nottingham forest
fortunately no dispute about the goal
agnew speedy thomson not long for jochim and it's a good ball
oh well played colin cooper
oh that was almost a classic build up wasn't it
little ball up to speedy drops it off to thomson a good through ball to a running forward jochim
ormanroyd phillips denying the room and lewis with the cross speedy getting up well with pearce and it breaks to black
against the wind he can't get any er meat behind the clearance
greyson thomson back to the UNK again and he wins it back off chettle but UNK there and that was a foul by whitlow in the back of rozario
play on says the referee forest in possession
a bit of a luck break there off oldfield takes it to collimore
typical stan collimore and now black
phillips on the far post well he is a great UNK of the ball as ron mentioned before
he's not the greatest header of the ball although he has won a corner
yeah but you see that was a good chance you know
i mean s UNK black has stood it in here to the second post now if he doesn't feel he can get enough on it to go for goal he should keep it in the danger area just turn it back across the face of the goal and let one of the other lads have a go at it collimore or rozario
corner kick
black headed away by oldfield
and did that cross the line it hasn't yet and ormanroyd comes out with the ball
i think they're actually appealing for hand ball you know the forest players
here's phillips for forest still one down black onto UNK head
good clearance speedy
oldfield lewis making a great break again down the left
he really is quick and he's got the chance of a cross here
knocks it in towards speedy and got the final ball wrong but a shame he'd done so well
great sort of break from the kid there
think ed took out one club too many there didn't he
little sand wedge would have found er speedy on the on the back
yes
post
and hill finds speedy
he's playing well as well speedy leading the line very well
here's jochim
cooper gets it clear
phillips for nottingham forest
only about half a minute of the first half remaining and er certainly whitlow has hardly put a foot wrong at the back for leicester so far
played at left back and centre back this season mike whitlow
here's jochim he needs a bit of help here cooper breathing down his neck
did well
agnew turned in towards speedy pearce gets it clear
good defending in the nick of time but still leicester press greyson and again greyson headed away by laws to ormanroyd
that was a chance
well that was a glorious opportunity wasn't it
coming off the back of some more good build up play from er leicester
good little stand in ball there you see laws can't quite get it up on it
no he big sticks there falling on his left foot
it maybe came down a little bit too slow for him
i think that's about er the saving grace on that one
he's there to win it back and find jochim nice turn by him
taken off him though by stone
good work from rozario now black down the left hand side for him
five men forward here nottingham forest
UNK back in towards rozario
collimore good tackle by hill a really effective challenge and collimore and hill having a real scrap as the ball comes over and the referee steps in and UNK action might be required here by referee UNK
the UNK got a real problem here
it's bad enough with er collimore and hill UNK on the floor but without the goalkeeper coming and getting involved
now he was UNK earlier on in the half the official when he might have shown a red card to laws
is he going to be similarly UNK again with the two players here
came on the back of a very good move as always
and you see the two players UNK on the ground here
i think i don't think big stan will be very happy with what he's done there
no he was certainly the UNK more so that hill
what's it to be
yellow
well fair enough we criticize UNK often enough for perhaps UNK sending players off i suppose we should compliment mr UNK for not showing the red card there
though i'll say as i said earlier in the half there's some play some UNK might have seen that as a sending off offence
what d'you think ron
well i saw a sending off yesterday on television that er i thought was nowhere near as severe as that and i must say that he's a very luck man stan
so the first half ends in real drama
and a lot of talking points for jimmy UNK and tony back in the studio at half time to discuss when they UNK us after the break with the score here at UNK street leicester city one nottingham forest nil
welcome back
well not the least interesting moment in that first half was that peculiar back pass and the free UNK kick which followed it and we'll come to that in a moment
mm
but i think leicester as ron was saying look a lot better side without steve UNK funny to say
well what they're doing actually it's quite right because they're they tended to play the long ball to steve UNK so that he could head it down and what they're doing actually they've got two four foot eight forwards in jochim and speedy and a nine foot seven UNK ormanroyd
but because
exactly but because of that they're playing the ball through the forest er midfield and they are looking a lot better side
this is the best i've seen them play for a long time leicester
they're playing forest type football
they're playing very well
very well indeed
although forest should have gone ahead within a minute
forest should have gone ahead first forty seconds of the game
i mean black who is consistently doing this along with and crosby and co
i'd if i if i was poor old frank clarke i'd be UNK me heart out
that look at that
that's a terrible effort from there
and they could have easily been one up at that particular time which was a minute
then there's a whole different ball game isn't there after that but er
and then leicester got the bit between the teeth and scored what was a very goal really by your standards wasn't it
it was a good goal erm they played well it was a good move it we saw a great run by lewis to get this corner which was a smashing bit of football
then agnew who doesn't out there at all heads it back in and speedy in the ideal spot in the six yard box a nice little flick on
er a lot of courage here by agnew because he can see his own UNK gonna go to kick the ball but he doesn't UNK out of it knows exactly what he's gonna do
UNK made for speedy that isn't it
cos there's always defenders
good goal
on the line you can't
yeah
be offside
no it's a well taken goal and that's what he was looking for just a little touch on
now let's try to clarify this peculiar moment about the back pass
right mm yes it was peculiar wasn't it
well as far as we can work out what actually happened is the referee does give a free kick for this back pass there
now it wasn't really a back pass although it did actually come off of greyson
keeper picks it up now rozario you can see is UNK
now the UNK given it and what we reckon here is UNK taken the free kick to gemmell but gemmell is now offside
which is fair enough
and that's how we look at it
now i don't know whether that is the fact that's the sort of assessment we've made
er that as far as we know is the UNK confirmed that it was offside and actually if you look at that it was offside
i don't think there's much doubt about it is there
but justice was done really cos it wasn't really a back pass in the first place
no
er it's just one of those marginal things
quick thinking by forest
UNK there bit unfortunate but justice was done
yes and forest have got to find a better route to goal than that and we'll find out whether they can in a few moments
hello again
one nil to leicester city good game so far
let's just have a look at some of the statistics from that UNK first half and er an eye catching one at the bottom there look UNK twelve to leicester four to nottingham forest
one that forest got away with jim
somewhat surprising that actually isn't it you wouldn't have thought there
by laws
would have been that er discrepancy
the laws for i don't know i mean i get a bit fed up
i keep UNK on it and i don't want to be labelled as the man who constantly UNK about forwards UNK
but i don't know there was no attempt really to he went down after laws had tackled him
i'm sorry i okay you book the player but it appears to me that forwards just don't want to stay on their feet or even try to stay on their feet
and if i was the referee
and since it was such a long way from goal there was no advantage in going down was there
oh there was no question of him being no not really
and there was not question of laws being er sent off for that
professional foul and
but if i was a referee now unless i saw the forward actually trying to stay on his feet i would view all of those UNK very UNK
right forest are gonna have the wind behind them
yes
in the second half so we can expect to see collimore racing on to all sorts of long balls now
well it's up to stan to yeah to have a go he's got the pace he's the quickest man on the field probably
apart from lewis who looks a bit lively
yes
the leicester full back
erm and you would expect stan to with his with him facing goal to have a go
but it doesn't always necessarily apply ton
sometimes i we always felt that you'd like to play against the wind it gives you just that
cos it holds the ball up
little bit more control
and er and with the wind sometimes the UNK al that UNK always running away from you and the way UNK play now they tend to come out very quickly and more times than enough they get there first
all right we can grab a quick word with frank clarke the forest manager who's talking to UNK
frank what about this argument that's going on about the free kick that was disallowed
well i mean i'm not interested in that really till after the game
erm the referee said it was for offside i mean i'm not i'm not arguing about we'll think about that after the game
leicester were quite a handful in the first half
yes yeah they played quite well but i thought we got our game together after the goal and created a few chances ourselves and er if we keep that going we're get something from this
and finally UNK obviously very bad you've had it taken
yeah er doctor thinks it's best if he comes off
so er we've had to take him off
thank you
and as a result of that david phillips who as i was saying in the first half has proved himself to be a very valuable all UNK already to forest has UNK back in at centre back again and that UNK crosby has come on as substitute and taken up his usual position and UNK first half position on the right wing
so that's going to be a problem for nottingham forest who threatened towards the end of that first half to get back into this game one down remember
david UNK goal for leicester in the first half and with the wind behind nottingham forest now ironically is often happens in these cases it seems to have just UNK a little
but with the wind behind forest i would think leicester would be expecting a lot of pressure
whitlow and his colleagues have looked good under any kind of pressure that forest have managed to UNK so far
it won't be a problem for phillips UNK in there a very good UNK
rozario finding collimore that's a great turn by collimore my word the shot has actually gone into the second tier of the stand behind the goal
and having done so beautifully in the UNK how did he get it so wrong with the shot
i think we'll see a lot of this the second half
rozario looking for the first flick on as you say
he's leaning well back there
there was a suggestion he might just have got you know as he went past the defender here collimore
i mean his first touch is decent he's gone past there's a suggestion i think that he could have gone down
there may have been free kick there
but he looks as if he was still left with a shooting chance
could even you know have possibly have driven it another yard taken it a yard further and killed the keeper off
i think we'll see a lot of that this half now the ball up and rozario winning his share of flick on UNK
and that fellow trying to UNK and everything
colin hill injured
still has that remarkable record of not having missed a single game since he signed for leicester from sheffield united
he was the only player who played in every single match last season
leicester fans taking every single UNK point they can around the ground
and of course they have a marvellous view of the beautiful new stand that we're sitting in
hill fit to continue here for leicester
greyson forward won back by chettle responsibility on chettle now in the second half having lost his er partner defence cooper
how UNK for poor old cooper finally getting back into the side and then not lasting more than forty five minutes cos of that shoulder injury
thomson UNK it forward to jochim taken off him by phillips
gemmell gary crosby gets his first touch taken off him by lewis
thomson UNK ormanroyd to move forward and he drives it on and as he did so presume the referee has UNK for a free kick for the challenge by gemmell yes he has
forest think they got an offside decision out of that but the whistle had er gone before that
and the impressive neil lewis will take the kick
ormanroyd the target and he wins it
chettle gets it away to rozario
he's done well here rozario he's done really well
UNK black to move forward and that was good defending from greyson
chettle wins it back and straight away gives possession back to leicester
good work by chettle
lewis agnew and he's UNK by gemmell but whitlow to UNK rescue
er late challenge there by thomson caught stone free kick to forest
taken by phillips looks for pearce left oldfield wins it back for leicester though
well you wouldn't have UNK that as a goalkeeper would you pearce suddenly came flying in on ward
and a foul by whitlow on rozario and pain written all over robert UNK face and we saw that the last time we had a nottingham forest live game when he UNK with a post up at bolton UNK and had to go off with a UNK and facial injuries
booking there for whitlow
incidentally the crowd here today just over seventeen thousand
i think that makes it the best of the season at UNK street
and that's the fourth caution of the game
still one nil to leicester david speedy the UNK
ron
yeah i was just looking at erm i thought that was quite a bit of UNK defending there from er whitlow
erm i'm not too sure whether rozario may not have just caught his UNK in the ground and UNK a knee something like that
i don't think the actual impact of the tackle has caused that problem
well it's if there's anything wrong with rozario they are in trouble forest
they've already lost the centre half the last thing they want to happen is to lose a centre forward
neil webb is the remaining substitute as well as substitute goalkeeper mark UNK and frank clarke must be thinking how many more injuries am i gonna get this season
rozario UNK on but he doesn't look too comfortable
free kick taken by phillips and wasted by him
and rozario looks in trouble at the moment he is just er UNK around he's sunk back to his er hands on his knees again and well look at that he you don't really need words to describe how he must be feeling at the moment
laws UNK it in UNK away gemmell gets it back and now pearce black outside him and it goes in long towards collimore
good work by UNK ward
most significant thing about that cross that UNK black was er like you say was rozario was twenty yards outside the penalty box and that should be his territory big hanging c crosses like that
i would think frank clarke would probably give him another minute or so to see if he can run it off
if not he'll whip er UNK on and put probably put crosby up front
just put UNK on the right hand side of midfield and put little gary crosby up the middle where he's played a few times for forest
or more than a few times actually
so only neil webb left if you discount the goalkeeper and i remember the last time we did that forest live game up at bolton forest had to use their both their UNK in that game as well quite early on
hope they don't think we're an UNK for them
and that's a foul by greyson on stone free kick to nottingham forest and rozario has gone not gone down but he's holding his leg again inside the penalty area and er he's not a happy
i think he might have to come off soon
and stones free kick wasted but they can try again
black UNK just UNK now he's virtually a passenger and er i would think forest have got a difficult decision to make a moment or two
they couldn't half do with a goal now
collimore got round ormanroyd and into the box and a great effort
my word that would have been a spectacular goal
oh the big man's desperately UNK there isn't he
as you say he he's gets ormanroyd just UNK it past him and then he does er agnew coming in he just him
a little a little flip above the keeper UNK off the UNK
that would have been a super piece of front play
but it's a UNK got to come off now at the moment he's just er a big sums it up there
that's his UNK when you're having problems but er it looks as though he's got to come off rozario
yes he c he can barely walk at the moment rozario never mind run
so you can imagine frank clarke thinking well we've got the wind behind us we've gotta put a lot of high balls into the box and he is very important to us but at the moment he's not making the box
i mean the big fellows here they've got to try and run it off or give it a tug and come off come off and get the er the sub on
important period for forest to keep pressing on if they're gonna have to make another change
black gets it into the box rozario got a header in but even as he headed the ball he UNK away again and if he'd have been properly fit then he would have really UNK that one in
