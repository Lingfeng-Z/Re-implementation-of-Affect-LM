but at some times your dilemma as a manager you say think well can he just stay on and nick us a goal knowing full well that if he has he comes off it makes them fairly UNK
one nil to leicester city eleven minutes gone in the second half
it's certainly been an UNK match this one way and another
and an enjoyable match frankly there's always er something happening it's lively
pearce finds rozario he's still UNK away whenever he er comes into play like that
lewis finding greyson
jochim almost UNK in there between chettle and tommy UNK
good atmosphere here two of the midlands biggest clubs in the first division
good header on by ormanroyd it's gone over UNK head cleared by david phillips but only to lewis
agnew oldfield good ball
ormanroyd onto speedy again phillips takes it off him and forest get the throw in
and it looks now down on the bench which is er just down beneath our commentary position here as though neil webb is taking off his er track suit and will come on shortly
they've UNK to the referee now UNK try and run it off or
yes they push er crosby has gone up front erm with collimore and UNK come out on the right hand side
good break by black but the final shot wasn't too clever
UNK taken more of his er custom central midfield ron
i mean the one thing that neil webb can do as you say he he's missed a lot of football he played against our reserves thursday night but the one thing he can do if he get an opportunity he can produce a telling ball
i mean in the UNK game against us he had very little play and then he produced one ball that got them an UNK and i suppose that's what frank would look for now
well played whitlow a lot of ball back to lewis as er a bit half and half
it's come back to him again
chance down by stone
leicester UNK throw in
certainly one thing is UNK leicester haven't er quite dropped back into the gear they were in the first half ron have they
no i think er the that forest have put a bit of a press on them
i think the wind is definitely playing a part
you know it's sometimes it's hard as they get the ball so far forward
erm i did feel that leicester i think if they can s if they can UNK this little bit of pressure now they'll get a si a situation where they can start rolling the ball again and get their play going
but it is important from their point of view they sort of hold this pressure at bay
here's pearce webb knocked back towards pearce who wins the header cleared by hill
well that was a typical forest move of old wasn't it
pearce a little square ball UNK plays the one two and pearce doesn't stop his running keeps his run going
that was forest in their UNK
considering the UNK forest have had to er UNK here they're getting back into this game UNK at the moment
but they're still a goal down
collimore stone won it back brilliantly off lewis but it came to nothing
thomson this is hill and that's a disappointing ball straight on to UNK head
you see the difference there was thomson pulled for a short ball there and he was ignored
whereas in the first half they virtually tried to play through thomson on everything
nottingham forest have only won three of their eleven league games this season four drawn four UNK and only one away win
two one at luton
there's only about er what is it four teams below them in the table at the moment and a defeat today would be a serious blow for them
but crosby almost released stone then into a good position and you have to say forest have certainly had the best of this second half
now then UNK got the legs to bring leicester clear on the break here and that excellent play by oldfield
ormanroyd he's still going and still the shot blocked agnew has his shot blocked as well
leicester have their best little spell of the half now
oldfield and he wins the corner off brian laws
well that's what leicester needed really to relieve the pressure
yeah he did exceptionally well in the early part of the move
he pick a ball up oldfield carried it along way with pace and power and then just kept his retained the ball for his side
in draws ormanroyd near post and he's UNK it straight across the danger area
gemmell just kept in by crosby and it comes again to gemmell
it's a poor ball though by UNK gemmell giving possession by to greyson and now jochim
thomson lewis he's so direct this lad you have to check though as gemmell action UNK for UNK
now ormanroyd in towards speedy far post to speedy
black brings it clear for nottingham forest
UNK out to the left
this is whitlow play getting UNK into the middle third of the field at the moment
ormanroyd familiar UNK run of his turns it back to lewis speedy let it run on to jochim
superb play by jochim and he couldn't finish it off
that's some brilliant understanding between the two front players there
lined up each other off th off the ball and then a little dummy by er speedy
look at this they're dead in line they know what they're doing he's UNK the ball there UNK rolled his marker very well
got it back across the other fella really couldn't quite get enough power on the shot
but great link up play from front players that
offside collimore
and incidentally going back to that shot by jochim in the end the referee gave a free kick against him for er presumably UNK the defender which seemed a harsh decision
well that's very harsh particularly in view of the stick the forwards have to take
i think he rolled the defender UNK there
ormanroyd towers above everyone knocks it down to thomson pearce UNK it away
stone whitlow to lewis and now agnew
twenty five minute remaining at UNK street
leicester who may move into third position depends on that UNK er middlesbrough game but could move high in the table if they win here today are still leading one nil
thomson greyson and on it goes to agnew speedy in the middle ormanroyd arriving but a cross never came
yeah but the signs are encouraging again for leicester aren't they
the spell that er forest had straight after the interval looks to have been UNK
i mean that's not to say they're not still a threat but at the moment er leicester are starting to boss the game again and that's the important to them
neil webb a little lay off to gemmell and on it goes to black and further still to crosby
collimore in the middle don't forget to take the ball and finally UNK it in towards collimore and lewis heads it back in that direction and ormanroyd with an awkward clearance
thomson gets it away and forest UNK pressure again
pearce intelligent ball for phillips back in it goes to collimore and a header down drops to crosby thomson arrives to UNK him and knocks it first time for jochim
good work by chettle
over the roof of the stand and into the street outside
they can't score from there
so a new ball lewis this his third chance stone has found him in the end
has a very calm nature and er UNK turn of pace and all round looks very UNK this nineteen year old who's made only about half a dozen UNK in the first team
played in three of the last four games in fact
UNK free kick pearce gets it clear and then won back by hill but has only gone back to the forest UNK
UNK been very good at the heart of UNK defence today and that was an important header he won then
and again shout of hand ball and that's how the referee read it
gemmell the UNK
been a lot of crucial areas this afternoon alan but i for me i think by and large leicester have always had the edge in midfield
erm if you like th the four including ormanroyd have always been have always been more dominant that the forest er midfield quarter
still plenty of time for this game to go either way though
one nil leicester twenty four minutes completed in the second half
and leicester UNK though not legally taking their time there
it's good play from whitlow and fine ball for lewis thomson now ormanroyd laws blocks the er ball and that's a throw in to leicester
yes they've done that very intelligent leicester
when they're under pressure they've always changed it normally change the play normally out with his left hand side
but this young boy's got a lot of space
hasn't done particularly well with that one possession
but he's had a lot of space and he's by and large used it very well
game just having one of those little quiet periods but i'm sure it's only seconds away from UNK again here
phillips what a wonderful ball that almost turned out be there because er crosby had it not been a better defender would have been in behind whitlow
here's thomson ormanroyd phillips again to laws
good brave header by lewis and he was caught by stone
free kick to leicester city
as you say sho showed great courage there the kid didn't he
thought the referee was a bit UNK pulling player back cos leicester had got good possession
lewis takes the free kick himself it wasn't a good one dropped in short and was headed away by gemmell to black who releases it first time trying to set collimore free
two defenders and he's still got the ball and almost got a corner out of it
a little disagreement between him and simon greyson words spoken no problem
pearce cleared by lewis good ball by phillips UNK gemmell
easy one for ormanroyd but he's headed it straight to forest black pearce continues his run into the box and a headed came in from crosby
well i think gary crosby if he looks at that'll think he possibly should have scored then
i mean that's some good build up play nice little touch out there a good UNK ball in from black and that's a decent chance
not an easy one by any stretch of the imagination but it's one if you're looking desperately for an UNK you'd be hoping to score from
nice little touch on by speedy pearce wins it back and there's speedy again trying to release jochim
phillips across and made a very important little touch to get it er out of play
awkward one there thomson and whitlow not whitlow er greyson i should say
now hill ward UNK at it but he er made a good contact
ormanroyd under pressure from stone UNK comes in and free kick has gone UNK way and er poor old frank clarke has found a mountain of problems at nottingham forest as he took over in the summer
a lot of them off the field which have got nothing of course to do with him
things that have happened long before he got involved with the club and then all the problems on the field with performances results and injuries
i think most people in the game will feel a great deal of sympathy for frank who's one of er the games gentlemen certainly
webb trying to release collimore now whitlow who er has had a wonderful game for by money wins it back
no offside given there surprisingly as black turns it in and UNK there to win it again
but now the shot by gemmell and the rest of the players of and the bench are curious they thought they should have had an off should have had an offside in that er UNK
lewis er jochim rather laws wins it back now webb crosby making a good run and he releases it but it was well read by greyson
now oldfield for leicester
he's brilliant when he gets going like this
ormanroyd and he's got round laws and pulls it back into the danger area but the cross UNK well
UNK collimore good ball
still one nil to leicester fifteen minutes to go
black in possession for forest now pearce gemmell webb shot block by jochim
this is stone and he's got round lewis and done well here stone and the goalkeeper makes a good UNK in the near post
well to be fair that's a little bit of bright er attacking there from stone
i don't think lewis er thought stone was capable of doing this you know and he's got into a great situation there
really it's hard there was there wasn't too much space for him to squeeze the ball back but he's got to be looking to put the ball back from there
oldfield find agnew
he's gone well here agnew tried to UNK a shot in it was blocked back to ormanroyd now lewis
poor cross and a very good clearance laws finding collimore
oh it was a bit ambitious
i think the defenders have done well there you know
they forced him across the pitch they forced him onto his right hand side collimore which isn't his best side and they've managed t they've managed to UNK him at his shooting at a distance
i think stan if he'd looked at that situation again would probably have wanted to go at the first defender an and gone and gone up the left side
and you still get the impression this game is far from won yet by leicester
free kick has been given for a foul on oldfield
frank clarke is on his feet in UNK at that decision
thomson knocks it in quickly headed away by phillips
now webb for forest
good ball good tackle again by whitlow and how often have i said that today and it's not long for collimore
chance here for forest perhaps collimore pulls it back but then couldn't either get a shot or a pass it effectively
once again i don't really think stan collimore had the had reason to pull that back you know
i mean he saw he sh great pace was shown then it was a UNK ball that he made into a good situation
i really think he should have been going to try on a left UNK shot from there
jochim to speedy on to ormanroyd thomson and again greyson gets it back from oldfield
this is neat football by leicester agnew and they've gotta throw it
er twelve minutes to go a little over
leicester city one nottingham forest nil
thomson for leicester lewis who's lost out there
webb takes over three against three at the moment though leicester getting men back quickly
collimore he's turned and found some room for himself
knocks it in and er once again i have to say whitlow did well
yes i think that's the sort of thing when you're a defender the goalkeeper s the UNK almost on it but if you're not sure you get rid of the thing and then say turn round to the keeper sorry UNK but i'm playing safe
because that fellow stone wasn't far short of the ball from collimore
i notice leicester have got er gary mills ready on the touch line UNK about to come on though not yet
here's hill
central defenders have done a good job today for leicester of course i've put the UNK on him saying that he knocks it straight out of play but er gary mills who's missed half a dozen games through injury is going to come on now and he's going to take the place of neil lewis
he's done really well lewis one or two exciting moments
maybe they felt his concentration had just UNK a little bit late on but he's er he's had a good game he should be very pleased with his contribution
it's a smashing game
in fact i didn't think he'd done anything wrong you know
he didn't look to be under any pressure at all
i know the extra experience of er gary mills
the only thing about mills he's not natural left sided player
whether that will upset the balance at all because lewis was a very important for them he kept stepping in when they wanted to change play
yes certainly mills has er operated most of his life down the right hand side
either right back or right midfield for leicester
well he's not exactly er too disappointed and he shouldn't be either the way he's played
here's thomson and mills gets his first touch wasn't bad one cos agnew ran into that space well
UNK clearance whitlow down to ormanroyd collimore did well to win it back and ormanroyd just got a foot in again
time running out here for forest we've got about nine minutes to play
they're one behind collimore has the ball
he looks so good when he's going forward like this lays it off for crosby and clearance is UNK away by simon greyson
and the wind gets up again and the er UNK factor i think is what they call it is considerable
maybe i need a UNK now never mind some of the players
into collimore quickly once again by whitlow he came UNK to meet that
phillips too deep but hills hasn't got an easy ride here and in fact he's given away a corner it's good pressure
stewart pearce the UNK come forward for the kick taken by black
goes in high towards collimore who turns to the referee and claims that he was pushed as the corner came over
i really don't think he's got much of a claim there
you expect a little bit of UNK don't you when there's a crowd seen in the penalty box
pearce crosby and still disappointing end to a UNK move
it's not a disappointing end to the game though is it alan
i think you know it's hard you g got to go with leicester at the moment because they're in the pole position and i have for my money been the better side but er forest do look capable of UNK an UNK
they only have seven minutes in which to do so
ormanroyd that's a great header to win
oldfield UNK it on UNK beats speedy to it and chettle gets it forward first time
well played mills and well played phillips at the other end
but thomson wins the throw in
well if there are many days like this at UNK street i think a few er underground UNK in the new stand would be suitable
knocked forward by gemmell to collimore six minutes to go
forest still a goal behind stan collimore in possession
heads it towards stone but he couldn't control that
agnew gets it clear to ormanroyd
and phillips has done well
what a good professional he is he's er UNK straight into this centre back roll as though he's been there all his life
oldfield off he goes again on another march forward thomson no free kick given pearce in possession he UNK with agnew and oldfield brings the ball down
i think the leicester have got a point there
i think UNK gemmell virtually picked the ball up
leicester are forced another throw in then
five minutes to go leicester city one nottingham forest nil
and leicester to get the win that will keep them right up amongst the leading clubs
can forest UNK a draw
or better
again UNK wins it again whitlow UNK
thomson then knocking it long and speedy couldn't get there ahead of chettle
spot on about whitlow he hasn't missed much at all has he
stuck at his task very UNK
here's pearce crosby and now collimore taken off him by agnew
that was a good tackle but he's given it straight to pearce
in it goes towards webb bit of a flying swan act by webb inside the penalty area but forest keep the er period of pressure going here
in a desperate hurry to get the ball and the er ball boy's not in a desperate hurry to give it them back
phillips knocking it into collimore
UNK done well webb
that might have been the moment forest drew level
i must confess the moment er stan collimore set it up for webb i mean it's a nice ball he does brilliant here colin checks the and shapes a nice little ball into UNK path and the one thing UNK still got he's got good feet
i UNK to score there i must confess
here's thomson speedy wants it played into the area and get it
couldn't quite control it
webb again good ball out to pearce black outside him oldfield makes sure he doesn't have too much room
now chettle pearce collimore good running by collimore and a UNK on the edge of the penalty area
finally it comes to stone ormanroyd did UNK well there
stone and ormanroyd again and he prevents it a corner
it's a throw in
jimmy UNK man of the match
man of the match david oldfield al i think he's had a good game UNK played well lewis
been one or two good players today but er over ninety minutes this man very impressive
fair enough i must say i'd have given it to whitlow myself but it doesn't really matter as far a leicester fans are concerned as long as they can hold on here for another two minutes now
not a very good free kick by mills
it's hand ball by stone surely
thought he placed his hand on the ball anyway he's got away with it and phillips at the other end is under pressure from speedy and that's a corner off chettle
that might be enough for leicester might just give them the time
breath in concentrate again keep the ball in the forest half and edge a few seconds closer to victory
thomson UNK it in straight into the hands of tommy UNK who hits it first time quite sensibly but a bit too strongly straight back to his opposite number
minute to go
mills in possession for leicester
hill and whitlow taking a few chances in their own half and finally UNK and it comes to collimore
and still collimore and then hill has to concede the corner
and leicester were their own worst UNK then because hill and er whitlow just got in a mess
the UNK been quickly taken and knocked in long but cleared again by leicester
and black goes down UNK on the edge of the box and nothing has been given and gemmell took a chance then he er UNK his protest to the referee
wall comes in again ormanroyd gets it clear and then it's blast away by greyson as we move into UNK time
mills gets it clear chettle chasing hard UNK the throw
i actually i'd like to see that again
i actually think black was UNK but as you say he makes a bit of a song and dance about it
no but i don't know i've seen them given
yeah delayed reaction and i'll tell you gemmell was lucky then because he er he made contact with the referee in making his protest and they normally stamp down on that one but mr UNK has been er a UNK official today
tremendous noise now around UNK street as UNK seventeen thousand crowd here believe they're on their way to a very important victory over nottingham forest
we've had almost a minute of UNK time and leicester lead by that single david speedy goal from what seems a long time ago now in the first half
still not over
UNK given it away to oldfield though
speedy with a lay off and thomson does well and gets it back to speedy jochim in the middle agnew arriving he'll keep it er near the corner flag i think
yes
black comes to take it off him
they're running out of time here but he finds collimore with an excellent ball
leicester have got so many men back in their own half he'll do well to make anything of this collimore
and he has done well but then runs into trouble in the considerable shape of ormanroyd who knocks it long
mills making the run chettle gets there first
we've had not almost two minutes of UNK time
still one nil leicester
stone for forest webb keeps it in play and turns it back to phillips and then hill with a lovely little header back to make sure leicester keep possession
calm it down says UNK ward
quite right
speedy could his goal now prove to be the winner
certainly looking that way by forest are not giving up until that final whistle
oldfield did well to ride that challenge from pearce
and that's the final whistle it's all over and leicester city have gained a very hard won victory here over nottingham forest by one goal to nil
david UNK goal enough to get all three points for leicester and i think on the balance of play they just about UNK it but forest put up a marvellous performance in the second half especially when they had to make er changes and things didn't go well for them
forest are not happy with the referee at all about certain things there
but let's hear the views of UNK brian little
brian obviously a very important win for you but there were some close UNK for you in the second half
yes a tough game
i mean you know colin UNK such a handful really i mean we're always worried every time he got the ball
i think the problems we have defence in the last couple of weeks i'm just pleased to have kept a clean sheet against them i think
you know young neil lewis coming in for a game like this is tremendous performance and michael whitlow and colin hill have been up against it but they've worked hard and i think it's been a great game and er one nil probably doesn't er justify both sides
i think that two might just have been fair but whatever as i said before the game if we win we'll be delighted however it happens
well you got the win well done
thank you
well more misery for forest another defeat more injuries less to go from strength to strength and we'll be right back
hello again
well we've heard brian UNK point of view
he thought two would have been a UNK reflection of the play
let's hear from frank clarke now with gary UNK
frank it's just not going for you
you must consider yourself very UNK with that result
yes i thought we were er at the end of the game
erm unfortunately we didn't really start to play until leicester scored but from then on i thought we dictated the game
and er we played at a high UNK and we passed it and really dominated the rest of the game but our finishing could have been better
we didn't make enough of the opportunity that we had er in the attacking third
you know and if you don't score a goal then you don't win games
how frustrating is it getting for you
you seem to be going through everything this season it seems to be a nightmare for you at times
er i'm frustrated obviously but you know we all managers go through this at some stage
er either sooner or later we've just got to keep going as i say
erm if they can keep putting that kind of performance on and showing that sort of commitment then we'd be all right
has all the nonsense off the field UNK you at all made your h job harder
no not at all
that's er had no affect on me doing the job in any way
and how difficult is it all these midland local midland matches because the midlands teams are finding it hard to get near the top
oh that's difficult for us all
er you know we have a lot of derby games
but i mean that's the sort of thing we've just got to deal with you know we can't do anything about that
we can't say er we can't ask to be in a different division to notts county and derby and leicester
we're in the division there with them and we've got to try and win enough of them to get ourselves into a charging position
well they couldn't score in the UNK league last season which is why they came down they still can't score
we it's simple
i mean what frank said there is true but they've g not got any UNK apart from stan collimore
you wouldn't back any well you made the score against any of them and i'm sat in the studio here
but they apart from stan don't look like scoring and er this here is an example of really superb play
and a player who was desperately UNK on the day not to get the UNK because he's taken two players on he knows what he's doing there he deliberately did that and was very unfortunately
er but you get the feeling that if he doesn't score then as i said nobody else can
we know gary UNK out i don't know how long for but i think frank will seriously have to look to give this lad some support because he he's doing great up there on his own there's no doubt about that
that's real good skill that
that's a wonderful piece of football and it deserved a goal
but unfortunately it wasn't it wasn't to be
he also he also did create chances for other players around him but i don't mind what you
well this is why
say if you leave one player up front on his own he can't UNK
well this is what i'm saying ton you and i have been saying it during the game that the other players can't score goals it's as simple as that
if collimore don't score it doesn't really look as though anybody else is going to
okay but we have plenty more goals around the first division yesterday and you'll be able to see those in a couple of moments
right too many of our teams are in the lower reaches of the first division
only leicester and derby in challenging positions
here's the full story now beginning at the UNK ground
you could have been UNK for believing that UNK had made a come back
tommy UNK needed the hand of god to UNK nigel martin in goal
he looked UNK as herts scored martin was anything but as the goal stood
that apart derby are UNK at home and it must be some UNK to arthur UNK that the twelve million pound team he UNK at last looks the part
there's never been much doubt about UNK
crystal palace are UNK on paper at least although the heavier grounds may already be finding them out
not that UNK appeared to be unduly UNK
he did well to hook in his tenth of the season
as we've often said derby can look UNK with the two goal lead
once it UNK and darren UNK was eventually dismissed for a crime which bore no UNK to the UNK of the sentence well palace must have UNK their chances
if they did UNK that UNK little notion
they're the only hundred UNK at home in the division
we detected a buzz about wolves last week which had a lot to do with the UNK youth of UNK
what is he on
UNK to give kelly his chance
so jack UNK tribute to graham UNK and the club programme looked fully justified but began to wear thin
paul UNK lovely ball to andy thomson a penalty by the UNK who can only command a weekly contract did his and UNK cause no good at all
within a minute the same paul cook was UNK another defence splitting ball unfortunately it was his own defence and mike could only beat out martin UNK shot into the path of mark UNK as we know
that can seriously damage your health
county's home form is one of the best in the country so portsmouth were grateful for this UNK which disturbed steve UNK equilibrium
only two minutes left when richard walker UNK up on the UNK back stick sounds painful doesn't it and it was for portsmouth
UNK another canadian from the same UNK as was playing his first full game for birmingham
but oh dear what a gift
kirk wasn't about to look a gift horse not with peterborough so desperate for points
even when dave UNK was sent off for a second UNK offence the blues were incapable of taking the advantage
UNK thought ted UNK had made a quarter UNK of it
ted didn't agree
UNK in the air at oxford
we know they can play this game but the defence is shocking
it's not everyone who UNK to lose at home to luton
UNK home record is excellent and UNK came as close as anyone to frustrating them
not close enough though and they're now in the bottom three
in the non midlands games there was a UNK finish at UNK road where UNK team were three goals up at one stage
two of them came in the first half as bolton UNK to UNK
UNK with the first and the second was entirely down to lee who UNK the UNK self confidence
why bolton weren't playing in white is an interesting UNK question
don't have the answer i'm afraid and neither did poor old shepherd when they came UNK again early in the second half
season before halloween what's it coming to
it all changed dramatically with twenty minutes to go
the moral don't wait for the UNK whistle
he played the advantage and UNK began the only hat trick of his career in his benefit season with UNK
bolton were never the same after that
normally a very difficult side to beat but not yesterday
UNK says he likes having a pop at goal but yesterday they all went in
the UNK was cutting things a bit fine
only eight minutes to go when ken ex peterborough of course was awarded the freedom of the UNK half
and we were down to sixty seconds when the referee did UNK another favour spotting an elbow in the face and sticking to his guns
UNK has played over three hundred games for his club but there is no UNK moment that this
here comes one of the most exciting games in the division which is remarkable considering they nearly dropped out of sight last season and sold stan collimore this
UNK opener was a UNK to the ricky UNK show
he can't offer him a challenge like that
and i get the impression he almost meant it
well he certainly meant this a lethal UNK but fortunately for southend nobody seems to have caught on yet
they will
and just for your information there was another penalty to end on
do you want to see it
oh here it is then
nothing much to add except that UNK scored but it didn't really matter
a fine win at grimsby for the chart UNK from south london
the goal itself was nothing to write home about had a slow motion feel to it but UNK are the most consistent side in the UNK league
and that's why they're top
well we complete our look at the UNK first division action with brief highlights of this UNK versus middlesbrough game
middlesbrough starting the day in the top three
the UNK john UNK and UNK
UNK out to UNK three men up around the edge of the area
UNK it in towards kennedy the chance must be here for ray it's there and it's kennedy
alex ray into the middle but i'm sure kennedy got the final touch
er it's gonna be a great moment
let's just have a look at this one again
UNK have the lead that's the important thing here it came over at the far side of the penalty area had got up for it ray and the kennedy there was also a middlesbrough foot in there
UNK just caught sleeping for a moment can get a good ball in for here and UNK it's an own goal
could well go down as a second own goal of the match
it was john UNK who got the shot in on goal but the ball flew into UNK net off phil UNK
no doubt about that one
no come off the throw in as you rightly said john
very simple throw in and er i thought UNK just weren't geared up on that one at all
and er i fancy middlesbrough will be the happier of the two with a point if that's the way it does turn out
he's UNK here this might be the moment for kennedy he's UNK out of it by white
UNK in real trouble now surely this is er a sending off offence
kennedy was through white UNK him without question a yard outside the area and derek white who was booked only moments ago i'm sure could be on his way to the dressing room early
he is
he takes off
john
the arm band l and derek white is sent off
definite foul no hesitation whatsoever
well it would be a dramatic finish here at UNK if they could UNK it now
the chip is just a fraction too high
that sending off the referee obviously wasn't mr UNK
anyway that's the top of division one
middlesbrough stay third leicester move up to fourth good news for them games in hand
but the bottom doesn't look so UNK does it jim
look west UNK
no it don't does it
peterborough oxford at the bottom
there's only UNK
not of our UNK
never mind never mind
yes frightening no we'll have to put that right
plenty of time to go
right there was a mixed er bag of results for english clubs in the european competitions this week as i'm sure you noticed
among the more satisfied will be aston villa whose one draw with currently UNK club er certainly sets them up nicely for a place in the third round of the UNK cup
and the game in has surely marked the emergence of a new villa star
phil UNK reports
this was a save that could well have shaped the whole of UNK season
UNK what a save
a fabulous stop from UNK
he's struck it well enough UNK and then his european UNK a terrific stop
and that's going to lift UNK and villa no end
the performance of mark UNK in spain on tuesday was the highlight of a supreme team display
but UNK has been UNK now as an overnight success
it's overnight success though that has taken years of dedication to achieve
i've made some well some very big UNK especially early on in my career when nobody would have known that i was probably even in the country
and this is nice to know that there is sometimes if you put your head down and work hard at something there is something at the end of the UNK
what sort of UNK did you have to make when you were quotes an unknown then
erm well just the obvious ones
first of all leaving such a beautiful country and leaving all my family coming over here to a foreign environment to a different world
the football world is a completely different world even it's different to what people would be used to you know here
and er coming through all the problems with the work permit and er again things that weren't in my hands
and er you know the cold there was a lot of things
there was a whole lot of things
there were so many times i felt like just packing it in and going home
UNK rise to UNK was one of those cruel UNK of fate on which careers can be UNK or UNK
a month ago nigel UNK was UNK first choice but at birmingham at the coca cola cup UNK was injured and UNK took over UNK some UNK words
well UNK did well to win the place from the young australian this season with UNK having been the man in possession of the UNK gloves most of last season
so he'll be anxious to make the most of this unexpected opportunity
he did just six minutes later
it's been saved by the stand in goalkeeper
UNK the hero
the one thing we're always reluctant to talk about is young UNK
i mean i normally in the past i've always gone for experienced keepers because you know i mean they don't come to their prime until i don't think UNK over twenty six twenty seven onwards
er but he is an exceptional young keeper and er i mean his nerve and his experience and his maturity sometimes is UNK
i think he impressed the inter UNK coach as well when they played didn't he
no a c he played
oh a c
a c UNK and UNK the er UNK manager has gone on record as saying he's as good as anything he's ever seen
in many ways UNK has become the recent victim of his own success
he's to play for australia next week in a world cup UNK
he was desperate to play but reluctant to leave villa
it was a decision which UNK him but was faced purely and simply because mark UNK is now regarded as one of the best around
i'll still come back say two or three afternoons here and practice things that i'm weak on just and er tho those UNK where i stop until i erm sort of fuel all the ambitions i've got in the game
do you feel at this point in time that it's all been worth it
at er well this week you sort of look back and say yeah but erm in about ten years time if you come and ask me the same question i would be able be in a better position to give you an answer
i bet he watches home and away
how good is he
well he's obviously a very good keeper
we saw him come on against birmingham about a month or so ago and save that penalty and it's UNK that that's how nigel UNK started at villa wasn't it when he came on for jimmy UNK and if UNK does the same job as what UNK done over the past ten years then no one 's going to argue
but he does look a very good goalkeeper
well let's have a look at him again
yeah
erm
and try and work out what it is about
well again ironically a penalty save that obviously always makes a UNK name it was a super save
this actually was the game against birmingham and here he comes out UNK himself beautifully and UNK of a goal there
er he's this type of goalkeeper
you would obviously say yes he's got a big future and that save in UNK was a was a UNK for villa
could be the UNK
well if mark UNK was the man of the moment in UNK the name on everyone's UNK during the week during sorry during the last twenty four hours has been bobby UNK
UNK resigned as coventry UNK manager within minutes of their five one UNK at UNK park UNK yesterday
he asked his chairman for a private chat they retired to the gents and UNK who had no contract said he was finished
this afternoon UNK insisted that he wouldn't be changing his mind
now he is a bit of an off the wall manager isn't he jimmy
i wonder if he really is serious and what's behind it
it's odd because i was watching him on football focus yesterday him and bob wilson and i was trying to stay awake
you don't watch that do you
and i actually succeeded
and he looked in quite good form did bob and he didn't look as though he had too many worries and then this happens and you wonder just whether it wasn't UNK rather than in UNK
and i would tend to think personally that he won't be back
so we'll see
well maybe he's er got a contract to appear on the media
we'll have to see
possibly with you ton
who knows
anyway there's more football coming your way on central in UNK
on tuesday at eleven forty exclusive highlights from the third round of the coca cola cup UNK aston villa at UNK
and then on wednesday at ten forty five more coca cola cup action this time with derby against UNK and manchester united against leicester
they top the bill
and then again next sunday at two fifty the central match live moves onto st andrews for birmingham city against UNK
i hope it's as good a game as today's was
well done to david speedy well done to leicester city
see you next week bye
erm
it's culture beat and cherry UNK which is our out UNK music
erm
but unfortunately something's wrong with the equipment or something
oh i see
so it jumped to this different track with different timing and it came up i like you so i thought oh let it roll
is that an early christmas present that UNK
do you know how old this UNK is
no
what do you think what do you think
pam UNK here the UNK wonder has taken himself off for the weekend
yes er
i thought you were calling me the UNK wonder then
UNK changed dramatically
i know i know
UNK you do look strange since
yes i know
and this is
the UNK looking edition of UNK i've ever seen
a much better UNK you've improved dramatically
thank you very much
yes
this is you're not gonna believe this
no go on tell me
right like it is about fourteen years old
is it really
it looks it looks as good as
is it nice
yes christmas red you see
and still fits you haven't put a UNK you haven't put any weight on at all
anyway
it's running up the stairs that does it
UNK rather UNK to get on
is she
oh why
yes she absolutely is so we'll have to erm find out from you what they've been talking about
well we had our friday debate
mhm
and the friday debate was christmas has lost its meaning because of UNK it was er the old UNK you know
well ninety percent nine o percent agreed
erm
ten percent UNK and i was not surprised
it starts a lot earlier doesn't it ever earlier
it does end of november we've got another two weeks to go oh it's christmas should be christmas shouldn't it
you know one of the effects are a little bit UNK but anyway the other thing which erm everyone really enjoyed er cos i know you would remember this er dougie is your first kiss
oh i don't think i can it's so long ago
oh come on douglas come on
no it's so long ago no
can i ask you when was your first kiss pam
it was erm i shouldn't think i shouldn't say this on the air it was f on a cellar steps at a teenage party
disgraceful that
i had to go and look at somebody's UNK that was hanging in the cellar
really
erm
oh dear UNK getting a bit i see UNK getting a bit er yeah erm
a bit hot under the collar
anyway one lady said
go on
one lady said she was put off for life after her first kiss and never UNK another man
she's now in her seventies
yes it's the effect you have on women
someone had a kiss in a UNK cupboard
i don't know what that was like
a UNK cupboard
lovely
a kiss after UNK knock
yes
and one lady was told by someone who UNK her first kiss said to her she was just a natural
right
i thought so i'll leave it at that
as the song says a kiss on the hand is quite continental UNK are a girl's best friend
right and on that happy note we'll start with the news dave thank you very much indeed
well er there's some happy news
three british hostages are on their way home from iraq after being freed from a jail in UNK
the release of paul michael and simon follows a mercy mission by former prime minister sir edward heath
iraq is denying that the move is a bid to have sanctions lifted
well it's one of the talking points this morning if you'd like to give me a call
has a deal been struck do you think what's in it for saddam what's in it for britain
i'll be talking to our UNK david UNK later in the programme
in fact after the seven o'clock news but if you'd like to get ahead with er one of your comments then it's
labour has broken off parliamentary relations with the government the move which will end the system of UNK for UNK votes is in protest of plans to rush controversial legislation through the commons
and health and safety UNK say they're not convinced the channel tunnel has sufficient safety measures in place to protect passengers
the tunnel is due to open next may but the health and safety executive say procedures still haven't been tested
on that talking point perhaps would you go through the channel tunnel knowing what you know about it at the moment
anyway pam UNK has sat very UNK through all this UNK with UNK now here's the sport
and michael and stefan UNK meet in the semi UNK of the grand UNK cup in UNK
the winner is set to be some half a million pounds better off
and you might be better off if you put a UNK on the old racing today
it's at UNK and cheltenham
well derek had another winner he's had a very good week pam by his standards
he's had three winners in four days and he had at UNK yesterday at fifteen to eight so not too bad a day for again yesterday
fingers crossed
right see you in the six o'clock news er spot
okay
okay right time to check on the first travel report of the morning
rob morning twenty one minutes to six the time if you'd like to give me an early ring then it's
well quite a few talking points this morning
first of all the main story in our news at five thirty and i think unless anything more dramatic happens it will be the main story right through the news UNK of this programme
three british hostages on their way home from iraq after being freed from jail in UNK paul michael and simon
they're released and all this follows a mercy mission by sir edward heath
well i wonder if you feel that er there's something more to this than meets the eye
saddam has never been known for doing something for the benefit of others
it's obviously for the benefit of saddam and i wonder what you think that benefit might be
do you think some deal has been struck
saddam certainly has done his best to milk the whole occasion
i think it was er fairly evident that he had given permission for the three british hostages to be released after sir edward UNK meeting with UNK
but er no sir edward had to go through the full UNK of a meeting with the great man i put that in inverted commas but er i suppose he thinks he is the great man himself saddam UNK
so i wonder if you feel there is a deal
i wonder if you feel that even if there was a deal the british government the foreign office represented as they were so UNK really by sir edward heath he seems to have done a very good job i wonder if he had to work very hard or do you think perhaps anybody could carry that out
sir edward of course has had experience in getting hostages freed before
so er perhaps he was the man for the job
there's a lot to discuss here and er i just wonder if you'd like to throw in your two UNK before i talk to our UNK david UNK on this subject after the seven o'clock news
is the number to ring
now another story that is er an interesting one this morning and i'd like to hear your view on families with two television sets could soon be paying twenty pounds extra for their licence to UNK the burden on hard up UNK
well a lot of people might think that is very fair the new charge would mainly hit households where the children are allowed their own sets
but of course a lot of er family homes now have er more than one set perhaps more than two
there's generally one in the main parents' bedroom perhaps there's one in one in er one of the UNK bedrooms there could even be one in the kitchen these days
so er i just wonder if you feel it is fair that er you should pay twenty pounds extra for another set
i wonder if you should pay twenty pounds more again if you have a third set and again if you have a fourth set
give me your views on this
other changes this is the UNK heritage committee of mps who er were sitting yesterday under their er leader gerald UNK the former labour politician well he still is a labour politician but er he's not so high profile now in politics but he seems to be creating a bit of a UNK here
other changes include high higher charges for hotels a new fee for car UNK and an increase in specialist programmes funded by subscription
but i think the twenty pounds extra for another telly is the one that er you might like to comment on this morning
health and safety UNK say they're not convinced the channel tunnel has sufficient safety measures in place to protect passengers and after that incident a few weeks ago which was er certainly played down by the authorities i wonder just how safe the tunnel is
well it doesn't open till may but the health and safety executive say that safety procedures still haven't been tested and even if they had would you go through the tunnel
i was at a dinner other night er where er french railways were the UNK and of course they were doing their best to er tell everybody to travel through the tunnel naturally enough because that's what their trains will be doing come may and er one or two people it must be said were just a touch sceptical
i wonder if you'd been at that dinner would you have joined them in their UNK
now at around twenty five minutes to seven i'll be talking about a fascinating report in she magazine and it's entitled how to survive house guests from hell and it's a seasonal item and of course we all know that er we a lot of people er go to stay with friends and relatives over the christmas period
frequently they stay for some days
and it will be some days this time because christmas day is on saturday so it's a very long weekend and holiday period
so if you have house guests for the UNK period it could be that they might be staying four or five days
i wonder if you're looking forward to it perhaps many of you are
i wonder how many of you are UNK it it's the duty visits it's the duty receiving isn't it really
there's a danish UNK you know that states that fish and guests smell after three days and er we all know the visits which have begun so successfully from friends and relatives it needn't be christmas it could be at any time of the year which are often ruined by people UNK on well past their sell by date
so we'll be looking at er some of the categories of people who come to stay
and we'll be looking more importantly at how you can perhaps get rid of them when you want or even better er put them off altogether
that's er a little bit of fun in that but er we might have a little bit of advice for you if you are preparing to receive guests you'd rather not see over christmas
if er you've had dreadful experiences with er guests staying at your place give me a ring on and share your UNK experiences with me
and of course the tragic death far too early really for danny blanchflower cut down by disease and er one of the greatest footballers i suppose not only of his generation but of anyone's generation and er how sad it is that we should lose two of our greatest footballers in this one year
both the old style wing halves i suppose they'd call them mid field players now bobby UNK and now danny blanchflower
danny UNK the UNK team of course er completed the double with them when he was captain and i know a lot of UNK supporters will remember those days
perhaps you'd like to UNK and say was he one of the greatest players ever to put on a UNK jersey
i suspect he was or come to that a northern ireland jersey
it's fourteen minutes to six
a quick reminder many people will know but a quick reminder and er if you've perhaps just come back from holiday yourself or you're one of our new listeners you may not know so i'll tell you douglas UNK breakfast call this very programme will be breaking new ground at the end of next month
we'll be travelling down under to australia and coming live to you for a whole week from sydney
and this is the exciting bit as far as you're concerned
you could be travelling with me
we're looking for two couples to make the trip with the programme
it'll be a working holiday but my goodness it'll be the experience of a lifetime and to find out how you can join us stay UNK for the dougie down under competition thanks to quantas australia's national airline
eleven minutes to six is the time and if you'd like to give me a ring on any of the subjects i've mentioned then it's
people are joining us all the time so i'm very briefly er just in a word or two going to go over the subjects and then if you want to give me a ring please do so
the main story of the morning as far as our news UNK are concerned
the three british hostages released from jail in UNK now on their way home from iraq
sir edward heath has done an UNK job do you think that the die was cast anyway
that er any er public figure worth his salt could have achieved what sir edward has done or do you think he's brought something special to the negotiations and why has saddam done it
not for the benefit of others he never does anything for the benefit of others one can only feel that he sees some advantage in UNK these british people
what is it
has a deal been struck and if a deal has been struck what do you feel it might be and do you really mind as long as these people have been released
and let's not forget there are one or two more in there as well
they may not be british but er there are more hostages in there because hostages really are what they are
twenty pounds more for any extra television set that you may have in your house
do you feel that's fair
another twenty quid if you have a second television set on your licence i wonder
and how to survive house guests over christmas
if you've had a UNK experience with some visitors that you've invited then let me know
nine minutes to six the time
UNK has joined me from UNK
good morning
good morning
i would just going to talk about the television licences
please do
erm well if we have to pay twenty pounds extra for erm an extra television what about the shops that sell them
mhm
will they have to pay twenty pounds for each television that they have
because i assume they pay er just for one licence now
do you feel it's a good idea
no i don't
i mean some people erm are elderly and they're confined to their homes they may have one downstairs and one in their bedrooms
mhm
i mean i only have one er i would like two but my husband doesn't want another one but
is that because you can't afford it
oh no well erm i assume we could afford it he just doesn't like one in the bedroom so we have one downstairs
fair enough
mhm
but other people erm i think it's a lot of money
it's enough that you have to pay for the licence which is erm what is it eighty pounds
er over eighty quid isn't it
yes that's right
eighty three pounds i think
well it's erm every other station on erm has erm advertising why can't the b c now have advertising
ah well now that's a different erm barrel of UNK isn't it really
well if that's going to help them with the money then they won't charge for extra UNK
right so you reckon that er they shouldn't charge twenty quid more for another television set they should take some advertising
that's right
what on b c one
on all of them why not i mean erm on b c one and b c two
every other station has you even have advertising on radio why can't you have it now on b c one and two and cut down the eighty pounds
well yes you don't have advertising on b c radio of course do you
i mean the b c er television and radio is er still what we call er state controlled isn't it really
not a commercial sector at all
yes but if erm they want to put their licences er they're the only ones that have the revenue from the television anyway
mm
why can't they now decrease that and er start doing advertising
okay UNK well er we'll get some comment on that after the six o'clock news i'll be bound
never mind paying twenty pounds extra for a second television set and another twenty pounds if you have a third set in your house
why don't the b c both radio and television take advertising and then we not only would not need to pay an extra twenty quid we probably wouldn't need to pay the eighty odd pounds that we're paying already for a colour television licence
and now throw something else in
how about a special purchase tax on UNK what do you feel about that
ring me and we'll take your calls after the six o'clock news
the number as ever
it's six and a half minutes to six
judy flowers here to have a look at our stars
good morning
good morning doug
well it's a bit of a sandwich this weekend isn't it really
it is
we t we sometimes talk about sandwich days don't we sort of you know the morning the evening and the middle of the day
yes we do we do
well this is very much a sandwich three days because we've got today and sunday looking quite good but a rather difficult and tense saturday sort of UNK in between
b er both today and sunday look very good for UNK and generally enjoying life but on saturday i think it's going to be very important to keep things in perspective
why is that why has saturday got in there
among the bad ones
well we've got er we've got a difficult aspect a rather tense aspect
it's got nice flowing aspects today and sunday and these rather tense ones coming up on saturday so that's why it is
mm
and this is particularly so this er keeping things in perspective for you UNK tomorrow
well i'll tell you one thing UNK not gonna be wonderful for me i've got to go into hospital for a little operation er b but seriously i'll be out on tuesday but i'll be away for the week er because the doc said don't come back to work till a week on monday so i'll try and listen if i can but what have you got for us
the aspects on monday are very good douglas so don't worry
are they
good
yes there's a new moon and a lovely aspect between mars and UNK which is all about UNK and constructive action
have a very good weekend everyone douglas have a like i said a good week get well soon come back and see us soon
i'll be back with jeff UNK on monday
yes indeed jeff here on monday
i'll be back er hopefully a week on monday
hope so anyway
right erm the travel before the six o'clock news
thought we'd play a little er different version this morning just to er change things round a bit but the message is the same
at the end of january douglas UNK breakfast call will be broadcasting live from sydney and in the next few minutes i'll be telling you how you can win the chance to travel with me all expenses paid
stay UNK for the dougie down under competition thanks to quantas australia's national airline
nine minutes past six and it's the morning of friday december the tenth if you've just joined us as many people do after the six o'clock news or even before the six o'clock news welcome along to the programme
now some of the main talking points this morning certainly the big story as far as the UNK is concerned this morning or one of them anyway one of the top two
the three british hostages who are on their way home from iraq after being freed from jail in UNK
the release of paul michael and simon follows a mercy mission by sir edward heath
iraq is denying the move in a bid to have the sanctions lifted but er i just wonder
er we heard yesterday from some of your phone calls and indeed we heard and some of us may have seen on the television news on wednesday evening the desperate plight that many UNK civilians are now in
the sanctions really are beginning to bite and i wonder if saddam feels that er he may be able to ask a favour or two from the west in return for the release of these three british men
he never does things er for the good of er the people concerned
it's generally for the good of himself and i wonder what's at the back of his mind with the release of paul michael and simon
do you feel some deal has been struck with the british government
if it has do you worry about what deal it is as long as these three men are released or do you say we shouldn't do deals with people like saddam
did it send a feeling of UNK down you er when you saw sir edward heath shaking hands with saddam UNK yesterday
or did you feel well he's done an UNK job
do you feel that anybody could have done that job
or did it have to be somebody like sir edward
a lot of things to answer and er i'd like your replies please on that particular story
now already we've had calls on the next story
families with two television sets
how do you fancy paying twenty pounds extra for the second set
well i know you don't fancy it but do you think it's fair
well this has been suggested by mps on the UNK heritage committee and this is part of their proposals to spread the burden of the b c's one point six billion pound costs
it would they say UNK the burden on hard up UNK who can't afford the eighty odd pounds i think it's eighty three pounds isn't it for a television li a colour television licence now
anyway let's call it that it's around that
eighty three pounds
it would er reduce the burden on those who can't pay
so i wonder what you feel
and i wonder if you feel that er if you have three television sets then you should pay twenty pounds for the second and another twenty pounds for the third
now er some people are ringing up this morning saying well why the devil should we pay
why if the b c want to make more money first of all can't they get after the licence UNK
well i think they are making great UNK now into catching a lot of people who er simply refuse to pay er their television licence but of course there are a lot more who er are still UNK the net
but er if they got a few more of those it might help
but the main thrust of your argument this morning is that the b c both television and radio should take advertising
well i wonder if you feel that's a good idea
i know people who will say it's not a good idea and that's the people in commercial television and commercial radio who if the b c started to take advertising would see their slice of the cake get just a touch less
so er we here may not think that the b c should take advertising but er let's hear your views on
the channel tunnel in the news again this morning
health and safety UNK say they're not convinced that it has sufficient safety measures in place to protect passengers
the tunnel is due to open next may not very long really you know but the health and safety executive say safety procedures still haven't been tested
well we had that incident didn't we several weeks ago in the tunnel which the authorities er tried their best to play down
i wonder bearing in mind that incident however serious or minor it was would you be one of the first to go through the channel tunnel
er would you be perhaps er willing to see how it went and then maybe go through it next summer or next winter or would you never ever go through it ever
at twenty five to seven just after the six thirty news sequence we're gonna be talking about a report in the latest issue of she magazine
everyone i think is vulnerable to the guest or guests that UNK upon you from time to time
generally relatives from scotland in my case and decide to stay having invited themselves and you can't really turn them away er decide to stay for two or three days
well some of them you UNK with more affection than others it must be said
and er a lot of people of course will be looking forward or perhaps UNK christmas and the guests that are coming to stay at their house
if er you've got guests coming are you looking forward to it or are you not and er i'd love to hear some horror stories of er past UNK when you've had er perhaps UNK guests or guests who've UNK their welcome
well we may have a few helpful UNK
i'll be talking er to the writer of the article in she magazine in about twenty UNK time and er we'll discuss with her how you make the best of these UNK guests
they fall into some categories don't they like the lazy UNK who never does anything never UNK a dish or ne never helps at all around the house so even though they stay there for about a week
so er i'm sure we all know them how to stop them coming or get rid of them as soon as possible
that's what we'll be attempting to find out in twenty UNK time
and UNK fans especially but football fans in general i'd like to hear your tribute please to danny blanchflower who died so UNK at the age of sixty seven yesterday from UNK disease
i suppose er he must be in the top ten of all time great british footballers wouldn't you say
one of the greatest players ever to put on a UNK jersey i would think
a man who led UNK to the league and cup double some thirty or so years ago
you must have some memories of danny blanchflower playing for UNK and northern ireland if you'd like to share them with me it's
it's sixteen minutes past six
seventeen minutes past six is the time and we still have some trouble on the travel front because we've got delays on the northern line of the underground
when i say we've got some trouble we do but it's not like the trouble we had half an hour ago when in fact there were three lines sections of which there were no trains on at all
but er that's been resolved fortunately we've still got some delays on the northern line and er obviously do allow yourself a little extra time if you're a northern line UNK
if you're one of that unhappy breed
maybe i'm doing them a dis service but i don't think so
right the UNK on british rail
right we'll take some calls after this starting with UNK from UNK david from UNK and bob from UNK
and that by now familiar music to many of you means that in five minutes it will be the dougie down under competition thanks to quantas australia's national airline
as many of you will know we are going at the end of january with the programme to australia to be broadcasting live from sydney for a whole week to mark australia day
and we're looking for two couples er it needn't be husband and wife particularly although it'll be er very nice if it is but it can be mother and daughter father and son any combination you like really
two couples to come to australia with us and to act as UNK travelling round the country reporting on what they see to me on the telephone live on the programme all expenses paid thought i'd just er let you know that er very important fact
and of course the fact that you are going to be UNK will mean that you will have to if you become a UNK be able to do an UNK live on air
you must of course have a valid UNK and you must be free to travel in the last two weeks of january
so in five minutes i'll be asking you the fifth and final question which could result in you're going out next month with dougie down under thanks to quantas australia's national airline
twenty and a half minutes past six is the time
UNK has rung me from UNK
good morning
good morning douglas
erm i want to talk to you about erm em UNK over christmas
right
erm to as this part of it part of each other th thursday one UNK er erm guest that my mother had in our house down in UNK erm she has a lot of clients er erm she's an artist erm this woman erm er w er went up to her bedroom and erm and was standing b by the electric fire and fire and erm very nearly UNK her UNK
in er incredible and erm she asked to come away and erm she my mother was up half the night with it
what
oh that's all you need isn't it really
yes
yes absolutely set the house on fire
oh my goodness me UNK that's a UNK experience
yes
and i wonder if anybody can match that i don't mean match that when she nearly set off her UNK on fire
quite but i no
it's a freudian slip isn't it really
but er what a UNK experience
of course these things can happen really er especially if er one of two of the guests i'm not suggesting your mother's guests er over UNK but one or two of the guests do have a few UNK over christmas and they get up to all sorts of things in the house don't they
douglas i've got two very quick very funny stories
yes
erm f from the erm former bishop of UNK erm what is erm and what is your erm UNK definition of UNK
what is my definition of UNK
i don't know UNK what is your definition of UNK
making people feel at home when you really wish they were
and another one
yes
erm what is your definition of happiness
definition of happiness what is it
eating with nice people drinking with nice people and sleeping with a clear conscience
UNK thank you for that
twenty two minutes past six is the time
david has rung me from UNK
david good morning
er good morning douglas
i'd like to well number one i'm an UNK fan but i'd like to speak up on er on the tragic loss yesterday
of danny blanchflower
because to me danny blanchflower we lost UNK number one now we've lost UNK number one and it looks like we could even lose john before long of a similar type of er illness
yes i was actually just saying to my wife last night erm who would have ever thought that in the same year we could have lost two of the greatest wing halves as they were in those days but i suppose mid field players they'd be known as today who'd
yes
have ever thought in the same year we'd have lost two of the greatest players that this country has ever seen
yes but er the other thing douglas the sad thing about it was danny blanchflower was great er on and off the field and it was the old heavy ball and the longer you played with it the heavier it got and then you had that lace in the centre difficult to er head a ball then you had the UNK well as you know yourself it's nails
half of them were badly worn everybody was open to erm serious leg injuries
yes
and erm that finished er derek er of sheffield wednesday
derek
derek sorry
derek
that's right yes
but er finally about er our great er tottenham er player
i don't think the guy was ever booked
no i shouldn't think he probably was david thank you very much indeed
anyhow i hope all goes well for you next week
don't worry it's not too bad douglas
bye
oh you've had one have you
yes they're referring to the fact i'm just going for a it's a hernia operation actually so er everybody says oh you no problem at all
hope they're all right
bob from UNK
good morning bob
good morning
i haven't recovered from UNK yet
erm
he's a card isn't he
erm right julie erm
i'm glad her husband and all the others are coming home
yes
but i'm very annoyed with er the UNK about the john major government
does she really think that edward heath would have got the UNK of the foreign office or the government without it being sorted out beforehand
all it needed was for the envelope to be stuck down
you don't think then that sir edward heath did anything special to get the release of these men
not really and to use your words was there anything about any UNK of watching them shake hands with sa that animal saddam UNK
well i wonder
you see
i just wonder how many people would say oh that's awful
i never thought i'd see the day when a british politician UNK hands with saddam UNK
w what was your own particular feeling bob on that
well i don't i'll be fair
i don't like edward heath at any time so i'm slightly UNK
he went there he UNK hands he'd shake hands with a UNK if he thought he could get him up the UNK but that's neither here something was done
a deal was done
i don't think there was a promise you will get
the promise was probably vague we'll see it we may use our good offices to the united nations to some sort of UNK or that's all ca they're likely to be promised because we're not in a position to promise anything
okay bob well bob thinks that a deal was perhaps done
we'll be talking about this to our UNK david UNK after the seven o'clock news
it's now six twenty six
right time for the dougie down under competition thanks to quantas australia's national airline
two couples must win an all expenses paid trip to australia with me when the breakfast call comes live from sydney at the end of january

we want to get really UNK about this so answers on a christmas card only please to the following address
answers the five of them on a christmas card to and your cards to be in please by first post next friday the seventeenth
six twenty seven
right after the six thirty news sequence which is coming up directly we'll be talking about a fascinating report in the january edition of she magazine about house guests who may well be coming to you for christmas and who may well UNK their welcome
we've all had them haven't we
in the january edition of she magazine but although it's the january edition it er does UNK to christmas because it's all about the guests you invite to your home over the UNK period some of whom you could well do without
well christmas coming on UNK it's twenty two minutes to seven by the way and it's coming far too fast for er many people i know
it's er gonna be with us a fortnight tomorrow isn't it really and i wonder if you've got people coming to stay over the UNK season and i wonder if you're looking forward to it
undoubtedly some of you will be but there must be one or two people who are actually UNK christmas er bearing in mind that they've had to ask somebody whom they don't really want in their house or perhaps that person or people have asked themselves and it's very difficult to know how to refuse isn't it really
especially when they come from a long way away
well how to deal with such guests and er what sort of categories do they fall into
there's a fascinating article in the january edition of she magazine it was written by UNK and she's on the line to me now
UNK a very good morning to you
good morning to you
right the problem is of course that a lot of these visits start off quite well but they wear a bit thin after the er third or fourth day don't they
yes there's a er favourite UNK of mine a danish UNK that says er fish and guests smell after three days and i think
i think that's probably quite true
i think after three days they've er worn out their welcome
they they've seen all the UNK and they've eaten the best of the food and er erm it's time to go really before you know they get they UNK their welcome and go past their sell by date
nice way of putting it
some people never quite know when to go don't they
oh some people just you know i've a friend who's erm who was with someone at college and he er said he was gonna stay for a week and you know months later he was still there
i mean so that guest that is absolute UNK
yes an and one never likes er the minute they're in the door to say when are you actually going
it sounds so UNK
but of course er three or four days later you're very sorry you didn't pose that question the minute they er put their foot on er
yes
your hall carpet
erm there must several categories
in fact i know there are because i've had a look at your most amusing and relevant article
there are certain categories that these guests fall into aren't there
yes erm the most UNK one is the UNK of course who turns up with a UNK box of UNK and an UNK smile and proceeds to eat you out of house and home and then when you're at the supermarket UNK at the UNK and returns when you've paid with a UNK bag a UNK that he keeps in his bedroom when in case he gets UNK at night
you know he may take you for a meal after he's stayed a fortnight and it'll he might lose his wallet or take you to the sausage and chips place round the corner so he he's a nightmare
and then there's the over UNK couple who er
it's always nice to know your friends are in love but erm
yes
it's a little bit UNK when they forget you're there and erm
especially if you've got thin walls
yes so you have to if you know with your weekends where you know there's a lot of UNK of UNK chat to cover up what is so UNK going on upstairs
i can well remember i can well remember when our children when our children were quite young and er we had such a couple staying with us
and er without putting too fine a point on it er there were quite a few UNK coming from the bedroom from the lady and er my son said er i don't think she's very well UNK
i think she's ill don't you think you should go in and see what's happening i said no i don't think so i think i think her husband will take care of that
anyway the over UNK couple yes they're a bit of an embarrassment aren't they
anybody else
well erm children people with children who don't know how to behave or at least use your house as a sort of running ground erm not living in london er i have lots of guests that come from london sort of using it as much as one would exercise dogs and let their children r run like round the house and then er i'm sort of saying things like oh you're very sensible not to have UNK until after your son's older
you know so that that's a bit of a nightmare and they erm sort of never tell their children off so you know you're s some UNK little child can be floating your UNK in the bath
yes
or UNK on your tiles
we're all laughing but i mean it it's absolutely er UNK isn't it
if it happens to you yeah
oh absolutely
and the c couple that never stop arguing
they probably come in a foul mood and er they keep up that er UNK over the whole of their stay
that's right they've probably had a row half way there or something and it just carries on you know
yes
and then they try and UNK your support
they get you in individually and sort of reveal embarrassing personal stories and there's i mean it just becomes a UNK your house for the weekend
UNK is there anything that can be done
i think you have to sort of lay your ground rules i mean state your case quite early on and it i mean you know if you're not good first thing in the morning you know you could tell someone you need three cups of coffee before you're safe to approach or if erm there's a lazy UNK who sort of lies on the UNK all day you could throw the UNK at him or erm and also i mean if it if there are sort of badly behaved pets and children erm you know just don't invite them and if that means your guest list is somewhat shorter then all to the good
i mean you could always go away on holiday if you'd like
i mean that's at this time of year when it's coming to the time when people coming round with bargain barrels of biscuits
it is difficult isn't it not only at christmas and we suffer from this probably you do as well friends from london
er we originally my wife and i come from scotland and when you get people ringing up from er scotland saying well we're just passing through en route to paris or amsterdam or somewhere can we stay with you for a couple of days it's very difficult not to say er well i'm busy isn't it really and you you've got to accept them really
yes
you have to because how can you be busy for that entire period of time
it's too hard to think on you know on the hop you know it's not a it's impossible
they have to they have to come
yes yeah
well UNK thank you very much indeed
there's a lot in this er article
thanks
it's very amusing and you've explained it UNK to us but er there's a lot of truth i think in er what you say and er how can we er make the best of these UNK guests who insist on turning up at the most UNK times when we're trying to enjoy ourselves
anyway i'm sure you'll have horror stories of guests who've invited themselves
guests whom you've had to invite although you really dread it
er perhaps er something like that is gonna happen to you in a UNK time this christmas
i'm sure that over the years you'll have er gone through some of the experiences that UNK and i have been talking about over the last five minutes
i'd love to hear your horror stories please with guests in your home
not necessarily at christmas any time really
is the number
five no it's not quarter to seven is the time
and er after the break it'll be anne from UNK green getting us off on our section of phone calls
most people i think know by now certainly regular listeners will know that at the end of next month the end of january this programme douglas UNK breakfast call will be coming to you live from sydney australia to mark australia day
and we're looking for two couples four people two couples to travel with us and to find out er how you will be able to travel and what you have to do when you get there stay UNK for the dougie down under competition thanks to quantas australia's national airline
i can tell you it's all expenses paid it's a fabulous trip and er we'll tell you how perhaps you can be on that plane to sydney with us later in the programme
anne from UNK green
good morning anne
good morning douglas nice to speak to you again
thank you
erm you brought back memories you know when you were talking about unwanted christmas guests
yes
when we were children about two days before christmas my mother used to face us all UNK and say your UNK coming for christmas and we all used to scream no not UNK may please
yes she has nowhere to go she was like a damp UNK
yes
she used to enter the house UNK misery behind her
oh dear
face us all and the whole christmas used to be we used to UNK my brother cos he was the young one you know and she'd say no don't UNK the little oh no don't say that and the whole of christmas was UNK may sitting on a UNK being fed brown ale in never ending glasses not adding one single thing to the whole of christmas at all
was not a word she knew
did she come and stay with your family every christmas
yes and every week she'd appear just like the weather
oh she was she was fairly local was she
yes and in the end it taught me UNK and love because i really learned to love her
i loved her even though she was miserable because she was kind
yes
underneath that UNK and it made me realize that you know you don't have to like your relatives i'm afraid you have to put up with them and love them
that's right you can pick your friends but you can never pick your relatives unfortunately
anne what a lovely story although it wasn't very lovely was it when UNK may came round for christmas and UNK herself upon the whole family with her own particular brand of misery
but er i wonder how many UNK there are coming to your house this christmas
peggy of UNK good morning
morning douglas
i've got a very funny story
erm a few a very few years ago i met a daughter of a friend on a bus er going into london
i hadn't seen this i call a child which she was excuse me for about erm twenty five years
anyhow she's living on her own in london she's not married so my husband said oh ask her over perhaps she'd like to come for christmas
so we go up and pick her up in UNK bring her back she UNK her bag and UNK herself down she eats everything that's put in front of her and second UNK
you can laugh she never lifted a UNK or a plate off the table
no
we waited on her hand and foot
yes
and do you know she had the most enormous christmas er lunch about six o'clock she said could i have a bowl of soup
oh no
yes and boxing night she came up with the er the same e enormous breakfast enormous lunch do you think i might have two lightly boiled eggs wi with er soldiers
oh lovely
yes forty five years of age
we packed her off the following day
how did you manage it
well my husband just said that we were going out we got to go out and we couldn't that was it
oh
so he took her back to make certain she kn she was there
yes
but er it never st we waited on hand she never even made her bed
yes well this is this is one of the er categories that we've been talking about
i think she would fall into the lazy UNK category peggy
i called her a UNK
well yes er
bit more vicious because i think it's dreadful
we waited on her
some people are like that peggy some people are like that
they expect to be waited on hand and foot they've got no consideration for others
oh yes there's a lot of them about you know
terry from UNK good morning terry
morning douglas
er you know ken kenneth clarke is absolutely right to er protest about the hundred billion for a job creation scheme in europe
he knows that most of that money will come from just three member states britain france and germany
all the others will get a handout from any funds set up for whatever reason douglas
mhm
each british tax payer at the moment is paying about eight pounds a week for the e c and most of those UNK tax payers were dragged by the hair screaming into europe erm i don't think there's any doubt about that
this government is actually cutting back on everything here just so that the french farmers and the UNK can live in the manner to which they've become UNK douglas
terry thank you very much indeed
er we're getting quite a few calls on that subject now john from UNK good morning to you john
morning douglas i think that's totally UNK myself yes i think
you do
aha right what is your view of things
well erm we were worrying about erm the government being weak in representation in europe over the two pin plugs
yes we were
well you can guarantee they're gonna fight tooth and nail over this job creation scheme to stop it
mhm
why do they do it douglas
when it's really important biggest evil in this country is the unemployment
about five million unemployed when you take the true figures into account
well do you think it's as high as that
i do yeah personally yeah well you know it's a lot higher than it actually is with the erm UNK
yes
that are em accidentally cut off the erm figures
yes
by this government but er this is so important to them it's gonna actually cost them some money this government er they don't invest in anything that's important it's the biggest drain on us erm budget deficit
or it's the biggest cause of the budget deficit erm in this country is unemployment and social security etcetera and we get a brilliant plan for erm job creation and what do they do
black it
well indeed that is what they're gonna do
john thank you very much indeed two UNK views there
and indeed at the summit today in brussels john major is going to fight plans by the european commission for a one hundred billion pound job creation programme across the community
as i say UNK views on that story and er if you'd like to give me a ring with your view then it's very welcome
we'll take calls on that and indeed any other subject in the news after the seven o'clock news
it's now six minutes to seven
the time now on the breakfast call with me douglas UNK is three minutes to seven
let's move on to the UNK and the UNK
we'll do today tomorrow and sunday
those are the UNK and UNK
if you'd a dedication mentioned on the day and it's er very important isn't it really
if you er send one in to get it mentioned on the day well we certainly do our best er sometimes er the er UNK and the UNK not very often are UNK out by er any news stories that we may have to bring you became first and foremost this is a news programme er reflecting the stories of the day but generally speaking we manage to get a full list of your UNK in
can you let us have a birthday or an anniversary message in writing please a week before the actual date don't forget to tell us who it's for who it's from and the date
UNK you may think but it's amazing how many people leave out one or more of those essential details
so we'll do our best to get your dedication in on the day if you will do the rest
the seven o'clock news coming now right here
well that by now familiar music will tell you that at the end of january douglas UNK breakfast call will be broadcasting live from sydney and in the next few minutes i'll be telling you how you can join us down under for the dougie down under competition stay UNK for that thanks to quantas australia's national airline
the time now is nine and a half minutes past seven
i want to concentrate er for the next five minutes or so on one of the main stories of the morning
as you may have heard in the seven o'clock news three british hostages are now on their way home from iraq after being freed from jail in UNK
the release of paul michael and simon follows the mercy mission by former prime minister sir edward heath
on the line to me now is our UNK david UNK
david a very good morning to you
good morning douglas
why at this point in time has saddam UNK decided to release these three men
let's say first of all that ted has done jolly well in getting them out and everyone deserves er you know he deserves a tremendous vote of thanks from everyone
but UNK motives are not at all UNK as er everyone can guess
it's simply that he wants to create a better atmosphere and show that after all he's a reasonable man and we shouldn't be too hard on him in these days
and he gets a lot of publicity out of this by er being photographed with ted heath by UNK that he's showing UNK to people who are convicted by the UNK courts and that really people shouldn't hold too much against him
well he's certainly made a lot of it didn't he
UNK the occasion for all it was worth
i would have thought that after sir UNK meeting or ted i kno i don't like to call him ted i know you know him UNK david so you can call him ted i'll call him sir edward but after sir UNK meeting with UNK surely that was enough wasn't it
but saddam had to just play the whole game and er he must have got a lot of propaganda out of this mustn't he
the old UNK with er sir edward
well he does and he doesn't douglas
i mean if we take this as a game as you rightly describe it he only takes these people from th in the first place to have hostages that he can use as bargaining chips later
i mean these three men may or may not have UNK across the border but they certainly did nothing wrong
erm
and they're just UNK for long periods of time because he wants to UNK saddam wants to UNK er his authority and show how erm tough he is
but really these people and there're about thirty other UNK by the way being held he just wants to show how tough he is and it's useful in the future as now when he wants to make a gesture
the publicity is fairly short lived of course it has tremendous effect on the british media and we're all very happy for the families of these people
yes
but it doesn't actually change british policy or alter the fact that sanctions are going to be maintained against saddam
but for his part er it looks good er he gets lots of promotion in the erm UNK press which he controls anyway and UNK television and he comes across as a kind of er father of the people who can on one hand show great UNK with UNK and so forth on the other hand UNK er justice and human feelings and show that he really loves people in general
but david he's not proving a very good father is he because er i'm sure many people will have seen pictures on television on wednesday night of how these sanctions are really UNK the UNK people
the ordinary people in the street
yes and that is UNK dilemma i mean yo the point about him is this one mustn't think of him as being a rational er politician who does sensible things for sensible reasons
that is the wrong way to look at saddam
he's a very emotional UNK who's just been determined somehow to exploit his position geographically in the middle east to try and emerge as a sort of mini UNK and to that end he's done a lot of terrible things of which the invasion of UNK was really only one
but in the course of that he's so UNK the international community that sanctions as we know economic sanctions have been UNK against iraq and they have bit and they have hurt the UNK people but in general saddam is not responsive to that kind of pressure
after all even if his people as a whole are suffering UNK and losses and can't buy all the things they want it doesn't affect him and his ruling UNK
he has the perfectly healthy happy life
have you seen pictures of him
yes
see how UNK he looks and how dark and well and such yes he does he does
he looks very healthy doesn't he very fit
erm
er but there is a point at which you know he's always trying to UNK sanctions and usually and it's a genuine case he asks that er essential supplies like UNK and such should be allowed through and er in the general the united nations have responded by saying okay we'll give you that but you've still got to observe the rules of the international law which i'm afraid again and again he UNK
so there's no real sign on his part of a change of heart
no i mean there's nothing to stop him UNK more british people or er any UNK come to that and saying well they did stray into our territory i'm sorry about this but er we can't have that sort of thing you'll have to er come and see if i want to release them in a few months
nothing to stop him er doing the whole all over again is there
well he's doing it now as i say there're about thirty other UNK held in UNK prisons
but this isn't the worst of saddam i mean this is er a human tragedy for all the families involved and it concerns individual lives and for that we're always very upset
but er he does much worse things to his own people and in particular the people in the south called the UNK or the UNK
he's continually er UNK them and there's many indications that he uses er UNK gas or chemical weapons and er lays waste their whole villages and he's seeking to do this because he wants to dominate his own country and not allow any UNK a chance to look after themselves and the same applies of course to the UNK in the north whom we have a direct responsibility the international community to protect
now this action against whole groups of people is so awful douglas
erm
that i fear that sooner or later we'll probably have to go to war with saddam again
you do you really feel that
i do feel it
i'll tell you why
i mean there are many cases of injustice around the world and the west the british government can't be responsible for all of them but there's one particular case of iraq where we've already gone to war to in the cause of democracy and freedom and i don't believe that when saddam UNK again as he does day by day we can turn a blind eye
we can turn a blind eye to some of it but the point is always reached when he goes too far and intervention is required usually only in the form of american attacks by aircraft on his offences in the em areas where he's not supposed to UNK
yes would it be a possibility perhaps that sir edward heath might try to get the other european hostages out
his success rate with er british hostages is outstanding isn't it
well ted is a very er experienced operator
he's always had his heart in UNK and he's got the kind of authority you need for this
that is he's an ex prime minister who can face er saddam across the table you know on equal terms
at the same time he has no political authority er representing as it were the british government he's just an individual of UNK and he's got the time and the energy to do it
i don't think that he could look after other countries although the same sort of precedent could no doubt apply for example the former french prime minister there's probably quite a few of them around could be found to go to
yes
iraq and do the same kind of negotiation
the danger is that er saddam UNK this er more and more and seeks to try and get sanctions UNK
well that won't happen
but i think that from er sir UNK point of view he has done jolly well and er the families have already expressed their great UNK to him
well if i may er coin one of your phrases well done ted
thank you david very much indeed
david UNK our UNK giving us an UNK eye view of the UNK and UNK of the release of the three british hostages who happily will be home very shortly
seventeen minutes past seven
i thought for a minute he said down to mr UNK didn't you
well he keeps calling me mr UNK because for some reason he thinks i UNK this silly character
yes i can't understand why
you are you are perhaps you are you you're a little two or three pounds over your fighting weight for a man of your height but still
i know i should be eight foot six but i'm working on it
we had enough of UNK yesterday without any mention of him on the programme again
right it's twenty minutes past seven
we can't afford modern technology now we've got one of these old wind up UNK
right nevertheless not UNK etcetera
in five minutes it'll be the dougie down under competition thanks to quantas australia's national airline
i'm sure most people know by know that er this show will be coming to you live from sydney australia for a whole week to mark australia day at the end of january and er the interesting thing from your point of view is that we are looking for two couples can be a husband and wife er mother and daughter father and son any combination really just a couple of friends
we're looking for two couples to come to australia with us and to act as UNK
what you do is er travel around the country to selected spots phone into me on the programme live and tell me what you've been doing what you've been seeing
all expenses paid i need hardly add and of course this will mean that should you er get through to the final you will need to do an UNK live on air in the day or two before christmas
more of that later you must also have a valid UNK and you must be free to travel in the last two weeks of january
okay
so in five minutes i'll ask you a question and that could result in you're going next month with dougie down under thanks to quantas australia's national airline
seven twenty two
leslie of UNK
good morning leslie
er good morning douglas
em much earlier you was on about this erm television licences er be it an another extra twenty pound being added to any another set over the top of what you've got
yes i just want to explain very quickly for people who don't know what we're talking about leslie because a lot of people join us by the minute er mps on the UNK heritage committee have said they think it's a very good idea that if you have more than one telly you should pay twenty pounds for the second one and who knows twenty pounds for the third and twenty pounds extra for the fourth
what do you feel
well this is what i'm what i'm on about this proposal
i assume it's just a proposal at the moment
but i is it
yes it is
gonna a be across the board
or er just affecting households or is there a special UNK for hotels hospitals UNK er commercial establishments crown property UNK palace and any of the royal homes go right through you can go right through the card
well i think the idea is that certainly large hotels could afford to pay a bigger collective bill than they're paying at the moment
and er a lot of people i think would agree with that
wouldn't you
well they appear to have er i mean they have UNK in every room and they and they and they put their prices up accordingly er en suite and all this business but er with the television
erm
i mean they're actually they're UNK it off at the moment
yeah i mean have you got more than one telly
sorry
have you got more than one
no i live on my own i got i've got one little television in my own sort of UNK
so er would you think it's a good idea maybe to er to charge people twenty pounds extra for each telly
well er it's all according to whether they can afford it in the first instance secondly is it gonna be across the board
yes
i mean you can't just hammer households and leave them i mean even like er ju the UNK the courts they've all got UNK in their pl i mean surely and that's crown property by the way
i understand that they don't pay any television licences at all
okay leslie thank you a lot of calls coming through on this one
UNK from UNK
good morning UNK
morning dougie
er first of all good luck for next week
oh thank you
and er do you know i've got so many things to say erm first of all to do with er erm guests at christmas
you know one must remember there are so many lonely people and christmas is the worst time of the year
yes
the other thing is television licence
now i must say that i see there is a point of charging for every television set erm i don't have any er objection to that but one rider that senior citizens should be helped
yes i think this is probably the idea behind the thinking really
that those who are not really able to pay who are genuinely hit very hard by the current eighty three pounds isn't it for a colour television licence i think
er they would be helped i think by this and er i think if that were to be the case then i'd be UNK behind it
yes i think that i think that would be fair but er for instance hotels establishments they should of course pay much more
UNK thank you very much indeed
a lot of calls coming through on this
we'll take as many as we can er during the programme
it's now seven twenty six
well here go with the dougie down under competition thanks to quantas australia's national airline
two couples must win the all expenses paid trip to australia with me when the breakfast call comes live from sydney at the end of january
now we've had four questions already this week if you missed any of them we will be repeating them next week so you won't miss out
but now here's the final question
i want you to think about it during the in cos it does help if you think about this before
so some time you know during the interval or at the end if you could er give them to heather and then she'll hand them on to me afterwards
erm the social i've got tickets for the social
so if you see erm
right
during the interval
the dinner
er if anybody hasn't booked would they please see elaine either this week or next
erm i think that brings us to the end of the announcements
which brings us to tonight's big competition number two
and i have pleasure in introducing our judge mark from chelmsford
would you please welcome mark
good evening
i've been to your lovely new really smashing
really nice
erm you know i mean er all the other places are alright but this is er i don't know
the only one i know of that's with
well
with a carpet on the floor
can we have can we have some light on
if someone could UNK under the
no th
underneath
fo underneath the you've gotta UNK underneath the cupboard
oh
you found it
right
thank you
okay
the
right
this one
this one is called ancient greek
ancient greek
ancient greek
yeah well there's no doubt about that is there
certainly er the er in fact some of them have got titles at the front so
yeah
you know
anyway ancient greek
it's a sort of a UNK portrait i suppose
and the reason i call it a UNK portrait is because i don't think that the he may have seen somebody there with a camera but he certainly wasn't UNK for the camera
he's appears to be erm not looking at the UNK photographer
so maybe he didn't know he was going to be photographed
but certainly his er location is correct for the costume
he's got this er i guess he's could he be a priest
i don't know i'm not familiar with that
but it looks as if he could be an UNK er jewish UNK priest
with the long UNK and the sort of box hat
erm the as i sa already said the location is correct
got nice sort of archway here to give a sort of a bit of interest to the erm the UNK the UNK behind him
erm doorway there always a UNK always add interest to a picture
erm they're sort of a little bit UNK you wonder what's going on there what sort of place it is and so on
and there's nobody else in the picture so we're totally concentrating on him
it does lack a little bit of UNK this one
yes
it's not quite as UNK as it ought to be
it's er but the actual UNK in it are ideal
beautiful
nothing wrong with that at all
you've got er all the UNK it should have but the overall UNK i'm afraid is lost
but i'm not quite sure why
it doesn't look like camera shake
it just appears to be just a fraction out of focus maybe i don't know
maybe er could be a camera shake
i it i it does lack that UNK we feel ought to have there
have marks out of ten so erm
i like the subject and i like the composition and so on but it just loses a bit because of the lack of UNK so a five for that
this
steps
step
yeah right
slowly got that
certainly a very simple picture and i believe often that simple pictures are successful pictures
erm not always but i think a lot of pictures or photographs erm suffer because people have got too much in them
you know and i prefer something to be kept as simple as possible and not to try and erm make it too busy
certainly the quality of the printing in this one is excellent
lovely light on the wall here
the UNK right everywhere through that photograph it's got nice texture
cos even in the shadow area you see there's still nice UNK shown on the UNK of the steps here and on this wall here which is in shadow it's still got th the texture showing through
and the way those steps go round the corner up behind the er erm the wall here i think again it has a sort of an UNK effect you wonder erm where they're leading to and so on
and they're very steep steps
i mean er you know er a little bit dodgy
i would think som someone a little UNK coming down those steps they could be a bit dodgy
but certainly i like the shapes i like the diamond shape of this wall here the and i like the tree at the back
yes i like that one
i think that's an excellent simple study
it's the sort of picture which people who are not interested in photography wouldn't even bother with probably but see what they're missing
so they've done it i think someone er who's walking along the road see you standing there taking that picture and say what on earth are they taking a picture of that for
but i you know the end result erm is worth it
erm i've had a quick look through so i'm trying to remember er what we've got coming
mm
i'm gonna give that one a ten cos i like it
that was elaine
UNK loch UNK
i like this one too
i know erm it's got loads of punch
it's got er impact it's it appeared relatively small so you know to erm it's a fact of life that small prints have a lot more to do to keep up with big ones they have to more impact
i mean they can er be lost a bit if they're a bit small
but i i'm not you know because thi but compared with the one that we've just looked at this is small but it's still got plenty of impact
now yo you can imagine what this would be like if it was twenty by sixteen
just a to just trying to illustrate the point that size does matter sometimes
i like the erm lighting throughout this although it's fairly dark there's nowhere excuse me on the on the land which is in bright light although the sun is still fairly high so it could be artificially dark but nevertheless you can see detail everywhere
on the water the UNK on the water are throughout the picture and even on this sort of UNK here something like that there's even some detail there
so even though the whole thing is in fairly dark UNK there's still plenty of detail
and lovely light on clouds and the water
so i'm gonna give that one an eight
eight
heather
next one is UNK
UNK of watching somebody doing something which you're not familiar with
probably that's it
er that's where the title comes in
now with people who are at work who are erm working with their hobby or a job it's always important that it's clear what's going on
i've seen lots of pictures where people are obviously doing something that you just don't know what's going on and that is a pity because er the idea of a photograph is to illustrate what's happening
now i think er it's clear what's going on here there's er weaving going on i'm not quite sure what the material is er but there's certainly a UNK with some kind of er weaving being demonstrated
and it er cos i say demonstrated because we've got these two people here er this man and the little girl there who are obviously erm on a visit to this mill watching what's going on
so i it's a it's a straightforward demonstration
and er i think that's er the actual composition with the three people in it is quite good
it is a little bit weak and it lacks a bit of punch
you know it's a bit sort of er washed out
i think a bit more contrast added to it would help it does lack a little bit of contrast
erm i just wonder whether it might not have been better to move round a little bit to the left so we could have seen the lady's hand and sa as well er and as well as her face you know we've gotta get we can see what she's doing know what she's doing but it'd been nice if you could have included her hands
and er yes i also i would think it's a little unfortunate this chap happened to have his hand up on that er post there yo you know it's a little bit er UNK it's not sort of a very UNK sort of po i'm not su suggesting he should pose for you but i think maybe had you waited until perhaps he moved his hand out of the way it might have been a better erm composition
erm a five for that
and so
UNK sorry
sorry
UNK
as opposed to the UNK portrait we've now got a formal portrait obviously taken er in a studio or erm with light well i don't know
about UNK studio but certainly lights and a background erm of some nature being used to produce this photograph
now with photographs of young ladies you need a soft light cast UNK
i'm sure a lot of UNK you hear UNK from judges er but you know some facts erm are bound to be repeated with na and with being a photographer you yo normal female photography you do need er soft lighting you don't want harsh lights and UNK
the they there are always exceptions to the rule
this one's certainly got very soft lighting
erm no harsh UNK anywhere on her face
nice UNK of the er the erm the face her UNK there
nice lighting on the hair
and i like the inclusion too of just a little bit of jewellery not too much
this UNK here this pendant UNK just UNK that area up just a little bit not too much not too UNK but just enough for sort of a highlight catching the pendant UNK just to lift it up a little
and particularly i like the background too
i think the erm breaking up of the background with his sort of UNK or whatever it is whether it's the background you know th the background paper or lights there's lots of ways you can achieve that
and it is important that the background has got some interest but no so much interest that you've forgotten about the subject
that's a nine for that one
howard
western isles scotland
erm the use of the letter box format here this long narrow format is ideal for this type of landscape
well for most UNK to be honest
er i think fit into the horizontal format le within the vertical but when you've got long sort of gentle UNK like this and UNK of water i think if you can narrow it down as you've done here that helps too
so i like the narrow er UNK format
the other good thing about this is the recession through it
the way the hills get lighter as you go through until we get right to the back and you finish up with a little bit of erm very light cloud beyond the hills in the distance
it's not a great exciting er picture
it's not the light over the water is perhaps a little bit disappointing
erm i it doesn't it's got plenty of UNK on it
i'm surprised that we're not picking up a bit more a few more highlights it's a bit
it hasn't got any UNK to it
but i think it looks a bit like a UNK field you know but when you it's obviously water but it doesn't look wet like water should do
now the boat there with the wash yeah that's fine
but the light i think is perhaps the thing which lets it down just a little
it's a pity really because the hills and so on beyond are i think fine cos the i like the way it's presented and very nicely mounted
just lacks a little bit of er quality lighting
so a seven for that one
sunshine and sunshine and shadow
sunshine and shadow
yeah well certainly er it's got the title which explains erm what the photographer was trying to UNK
these er on when they look to be the UNK of a cathedral although when you look through they seem to open out into street so i'm not quite sure exactly what sort of building it is
it seems to turn into a street when you get beyond you know those UNK
erm again it's not quite as sharp as i would like to see it it's a little bit er UNK
erm another thing too it's a just a pity that chap there well both of them actually are standing whe pity they couldn't be persuaded to move over a little bit because they are you see this chap in a dark suit he's right against that very dark archway there
the only real reason you get to know that there's somebody there because you can see the legs and the sort of sort of head but yo it does tend to get a bit lost against the background
so you're not standing in quite the right place
i like the idea of the sort of UNK looking out to the right letting light sort of fall in and it and make a nice pool of light ideal for somebody who's standing but he's not standing in quite the right place
he's not picking up the light
which is a shame
nice UNK there
very interesting shapes in the roof
but it does lack a bit of erm quality
a five for that
the closed door
another door
another very simple you can er another simple picture
very similar to the steps that we saw
mm
erm earlier on
this one i think is nice
i don't think it's quite as nice as the previous one
it's er erm a little bit more straightforward a we're looking straight onto this wall looking straight onto the steps and we're looking straight onto the door so everything is looking sort of erm full faced as it were and i think that makes for a less interesting composition than the previous one
being sort of at an angle to it and but i it first of all it allows you to see UNK in the wall and things rather better erm and it makes for generally speaking a more interesting composition
you see these steps here tend to look as if it's a pile of UNK or something with a door standing on top but you quite clearly see those steps but you don't get the depth of the steps so everything is a bit flat
the whole thing tends to get flat
certainly it's a very interesting door and it's got nice er UNK of the of the er and so on
and i'm sure that there is a the thing is it's quite a nice photograph but i'm not too happy with the actual view
i think it would be better in my own experience move over to that er the left a little bit just to go for a slightly more interesting composition
a seven for that one
UNK
that's er
mm
the name of the place is it
it's a co is that the one with the castle
it's a castle
yeah
yeah
that's is UNK then
oh
right
oh sorry i've got i've got written here
no
i'm sorry
print number eight
it's got
oh yes
yes
yeah
mm
yes it is
erm now this a castle which i'm sure has been photographed thousands and thousands of times
erm i can never remember the name of it and i and i forget it by the time i get home but the name of the castle that is
but it's erm often photographed a i've don't recall seeing it photographed from this actual point
er it i think the whole place is sort of over the other side there's a sort of a bridge there and possibly i mean i'm sure that i've seen a photograph from the other side
erm with this sort of landscape i always credit the type of lens which is being used and i think a wide angle lens has been used here because we could see there's been a lot of interest created in the UNK and this is what a wide angle lens will do for you in a landscape
it will create interest in the UNK which i think is important and often especially looking across water an UNK of water if you haven't got any interesting detail in the UNK yo you have to go a long way into the picture before it begins to get interesting
so don't forget the UNK and the best way to emphasize the UNK is with a wi wide angle lens
something wider than a standard lens
a thirty five UNK or something that'll be quite erm yeah i think the er cloud and sky is nice and the UNK is nice
it's just a pity that the castle itself is a little bit UNK i mean when you stand away from it you can't er you can hardly see the castle there and er it is an attractive castle photographed many times but i would just like to see that shown up a little more in the picture
and i think possibly you could er with a little bit of erm er slightly more UNK in the back maybe
er and i think perhaps that castle could be persuaded to show up just a little more than it does
it does tend to get lost in the boundaries
erm another seven for that one there
fingers crossed
yeah
fingers crossed for luck
yeah it's a i would guess that this er we you know when they come down and the strips and they go back up again it looks as if perhaps that's what's happened here because the rope has sort of got this twist in it and one UNK that when they jump down it's not quite er right and so perhaps he's on his way back up again
but er nevertheless i think er it's a obviously a UNK a spectacular thing to watch
to stand down here and see this UNK who's gonna leap off
there
erm er it's quite a spectacular thing to watch i imagine if you're there
as a UNK subject but yeah i it's simple and it's a bit sort of small the actual i don't know how you could make it any bigger but i do don't know what you could do
really the real point of interest is the chap who's doing the person rather who's the doing the jump
erm i suppose having this great UNK extended crane there does give a good impression of height but the action is here and i it's a little small in the frame and but although i'm sure you know there's quite a fe i imagine there's a lot of people standing around watching and so on but as a photograph at the end of the day i'm not sure it has quite enough impact to be erm terribly interesting
it's a an interesting thing to do i'm sure er but erm maybe you should have the jump taken the photograph on the way down
but er yeah it's i find it loses er a little bit of interest fairly quickly erm because it's the main subject the chap jumping down i think the road was nicely shown but perhaps if you could have just had a longer lens just to make it a bit more important in the picture
er five for that one
UNK three c manufactured nineteen forty nine to nineteen fifty
well
well this to photograph anything this just happens to be a camera and i suppose that would appeal to a lot of camera collectors to people that i er who i work with people i know friends and that they know i'm interested in photography and they always ask me about cameras
and i hate it
i
and i say well you know i'm not really interested in cameras
oh
alright
no i'm interested in photographs but not so much in cameras
i i'm interested in the cameras which i use and that's it
so i really know nothing about UNK cameras i've never used one i don't particularly know anything about them
cos this happens to be a camera but it could just as well be er an electric UNK or any UNK object taken er in this fashion and the thing you've got to do if you take a photograph of an UNK object er like this is to light it correctly er it's got to show all the erm detail UNK and it's got to have good quality in the printing
and i think this one does
i think the lighting on it is excellent
when you look at the erm the all the UNK around the various controls and the UNK on the UNK here all very nicely lit
and even although you can't read it all it's very hard because it's sort of at a an UNK angle
even the UNK and writing on the top on the top of the UNK here is nicely lit you can see that it's er the light is catching all the various edges of the UNK on the top
so very nicely lit
erm where it has lost a little bit of the quality of the lighting is round the base
you see especially here that sort of erm white metal bit the er UNK sort of finish on that tends to get a little bit lost in this white background
it doesn't here that's fine it's great here but at the bottom because it it's not being lit quite so well as the top you're tending to lose a little bit of quality especially there
not so much there little bit better there but that bit so okay it's er you've set yourself a task to do a sort of a lighting exercise to photograph this camera er so yo you know you must really control the lights and the do the best you can
but i think you've done very well with just one little weak area round that but it's not easy to do you've got a very light background and you've got a very UNK presumably black body of the camera
so you you've got a very UNK to start with
so to get the exposure right and get the whole thing right throughout is not an easy task to do
and this has almost worked just a slight there
so a seven for that one
seven
yes
sarah
very nice er nicely presented er print
lovely mounting and very clean and UNK
and i often say that young ladies who are looking over their shoulder like this you've gotta be careful of the neck because when they turn round and look over their shoulder you get UNK in the neck and there is a slight UNK in the neck there but most of it has been UNK by covering it with her hair so look out for that when you have a young lady or anybody looking over their shoulder particularly with young ladies when they look over their shoulder like that it does cause UNK in the side of the neck which can be UNK
erm i think you've been conscious of that and have made sure the hair has covered the UNK up
erm the light on her hair is excellent
very nice lighting on her hair
again that sort of UNK background i don't know whether it's the same background but it's very similar to the one
we had earlier
this time we've er included her hand and because she's got nail UNK on er you've got the sort of highlights coming from the nails which tend to UNK her fingers
however they're not too UNK they do sort of when you're looking at her shoulder here and her hand wasn't there i could well imagine that you'd get a bright highlight off her shoulder so maybe putting hands there it has helped in er to eliminate that
so yeah i quite er like the use of the hand in that one
sometimes hands can be a bit of a problem but i don't think it is there
erm i think it's just a little too much looking over their shoulder because sh to in order to look at the camera she's having to keep her eyes over really yo you know really over to her er right and erm it tends to be a little bit erm uncomfortable
i think perhaps not quite so much you know UNK of the head might have been slightly more comfortable
nevertheless i think that's good
eight for that one
gordon
green bottles
green bottles ha
i'll take your word for that
hanging on the wall
yes they look like erm yeah i thought they were UNK when i first saw them
i thought they're good UNK
good UNK
and by gordon
yeah
yeah they are UNK
are they
anyway yeah there's three of them which is good er number to have
any subject er three seems to suit all odd numbers funny enough seem to better than o even numbers i dunno why but erm maybe i've been told that by so many judges i begin to believe it
erm but yeah i think three is a good number
the third one up here the small one is a little bit sort of lost because it's against er this sort of UNK light here so that one tends to get a little bit lost
these two are quite erm clear
erm the actual shape of them is er quite interesting and fairly unusual shapes so that's er an interesting feature
i don't find the overall thing terribly interesting
i don't think it's a er maybe it's because the background i think i'm just trying to make up my mind why it loses a bit of interest and i think what happens is that the background being having all this UNK which is lots of light pouring on er all this sort of UNK round here is er picking up lots of highlights and that tends to UNK from the fairly plain shapes and smooth UNK of the UNK
so i think the background i think as i said earlier on that keep the photograph simple and i think this one perhaps has got too much background
it's one of those where the background tends to UNK the subject
certainly that one is totally UNK by the background and these ones are tending to be just a little bit
i think it would have been perhaps better if you somehow er maybe er i dunno you could erm nothing to do with you so you ri you're not in a position to be able to move them erm but if it was possible to put them in a different situation i think would have made a more interesting picture
er six for that one
the porch way
this is a you know this is the third one which is er was similar to others we've had the steps and we had the other door and a few steps down and then this is all similar types of photographs and all taken from different sort of angles
erm one the first one nice angle to the stairs and the other one looking straight on and this sort of half and ha half
it falls between the two
i think the composition again is simple which is nice light the UNK of it
er i particularly like the land that it's on there that adds a bit of interest to it it's another view another sort of point to attract your eye
but i think perhaps that in a way that becomes the main point is that although it's called the porch way i mean you know that's fair enough because you can see it is a porch it's not clearly defined we we've got this sort of two pillars here and a little bit of green so they're losing a bit of shape of the porch er and this becomes the sort of erm main er point of the picture
i it it's i think the porch itself again is we're not showing the shape of the porch and the details of the porch in sufficient detail and it's a pity really because i think that there is a nice photograph to be had there
er again it's all down to where you're going to stand to take the photograph and i'm not so sure that you i think you've gone a little no you know i criticized the other one a bit from the same person i think it possibly is because it's the same style the same sort of mounting
erm but i think it's gone a bit too far the other way this time unfortunately
but it's nice quality very good printing erm another seven for that
ha
ne next one is no title
well you couldn't really get much more simple than that
just this post on a UNK beach somewhere er with some very nice clouds in the in the sky
and i think er the quality of the printing is again very good
the clouds are nicely shown the UNK are nicely shown
and as this post here with whatever it is it looks as if it's got some UNK on the ground maybe a boat sometimes gets UNK up to it and that's just to stop the boat er UNK up UNK maybe the tide comes in that far i don't know
erm the actual post i liked i'm glad it's standing up above the horizon because at least that way you know i it does it's given some dominance in the picture
but once you get down below the horizon you get to look round this area here where there's some rope UNK round some kind of UNK it does tend to get a little bit lost amongst all the UNK
so maybe it would have been better if you could have even got down a bit lower and to get more of it from the horizon
i think the idea of using this in the UNK er as i was saying with UNK and the same thing applies to UNK as well it's nice to have a bit of detail lower down but i don't think that the background the sort of main part of the photograph is terribly strong
i think it really needs to be the whole photograph needs to be given more strength on making more of this post here
i think the bit that stands up above the horizon is fine i mean i think that gives you a good idea of what it would have been like had you been able to get the whole or not perhaps the whole of it but a lot more of the post up above the horizon simply by getting down lower
so six and a half for that one
six and a half
yes
thank you
next one is the UNK
i think this is a chap
yep
UNK out there with a UNK net
erm well perhaps
and again we've got three boats
er three a nice number to have of any subject
and they're nicely separated
but often boats UNK up on the river tend to UNK into one another but these three boats are completely separate separated they don't overlap each other at all
erm although we can if you look closely you can see that this chap has got a UNK net in his hand er so you get a fair idea of what's going on
there's a someone here with a couple of dogs
erm but he's a bit sort of lost in it he's he doesn't have any dominance really
i think he's UNK by the three white UNK of the boats
it tends to it tends to be a bit lost in the UNK of the mud and the water
er you can see that this is a i don't know whether it appears to be UNK at the centre than it is round the edges i don't know whether you tried to burn it in just a little bit in the middle holding back the edges but it's got sort of a UNK patch i in the centre
erm yeah i it's the UNK there but i think it does lack a little bit of impact
th the boats are fine but the main human interest in it does tend to be in fact the personally the two dogs has more UNK in the picture than this chap which is a pity
i think possibly a long lens just the having sort of the two boats again that might have been better
and a five for that one
UNK on UNK
yeah
nice lighting on the hills beyond
this is a very good example of er putting interesting detail in the UNK in the way that tall bit of wood there is really making quite a an interesting subject in itself in the UNK
also the fence which runs out into the lake er just breaks up the distance between the piece of wood and the bank
because the water in itself er i'm sure that when you're there it's erm it's a beautiful place to be but the water in itself in this photograph has not got the best of light on it
you don't get the good really good light until you get across the water and out onto these hills and that's where the good light is in that erm top i third of the picture i think is where the real quality is
erm the bottom of the picture perhaps not quite such good quality but certainly it's got er interesting detail
lovely clouds
that sort of it's got the it's one of those sort of days i think when you've got lots of cloud about broken clouds so every now and again the sun will come through and light up different areas of the picture
er and that's the sort of light you do need for UNK and that's happening over here
just not quite such UNK light on that er UNK but certainly interesting detail there
an eight for that one
mm
no title for the last one
you see this post standing up here now we've got down a lot lower this time in fact i think it's the same post
yeah
the erm much given much more dominance in the picture by making it stand right up above the horizon
and i think this one is better for several reasons i think you can quite clearly see now once you've had a chance to look at this the other one we saw we eliminated this boat we eliminate that post and this boat or rather we just have this post and the sea beyond
now same sky
it's the same
but i think now you've included this little UNK it really brings the whole picture to life
and a very good example if you put these two together just to see what you can do by moving round to a different viewpoint
er don't always take the first one and that you take loads of picture around if you see an interesting subject make sure you move around and take loads of pictures and then select the one for printing
and i think this is a very good erm er illustration of that fact
all you had to do here was to move back a few steps and you've made it much more interesting in the UNK
so a much more satisfying picture erm yeah i think that one works much better
so and eight and a half for that one
gordon
okay so we start judging
well yo yes you can do mark
let's get three of copies and if you do three of the colour you'll be half way
yeah
we should be
alright
right
okay er
that's called it's my teddy
yeah and i think the way she's UNK the teddy bear and that expression on her face seems to suit the title
and also the use of the yellow background i don't know erm whether it was deliberately chosen or whether she just happened to be standing there but the yellow background makes it stand out
erm you know it's the sort of picture which UNK your eye and this is one thing you should try and do with your photography is to UNK the UNK eye or eye and having the yellow background it does
i like the er you know the nice little UNK on her face and the way she's UNK the teddy erm teddy that happens to be a rabbit it leaves us
the teddy is a rabbit you could say
mm
er yeah i think that one's quite a nice family album er portrait
it's not a great competition winning portrait but er certainly it's fine sort of family album stuff and the sort of thing UNK be in the family for many years to come
when she's sort of twenty five or thirty someone will drag this out and say oh no
not that again
but er nevertheless it would be kept er for many years and quite UNK so
erm a seven for that
seven
now
UNK at UNK mill
i think the er one of the things which helps this one is the way it's been mounted
i think this large mount tends somehow tends to UNK the er the UNK certainly the colour the sort of UNK colour of the mount and the UNK colour of the UNK go nicely together as do the sort of more subtle colours in the sky
and er it's difficult to know quite how to photograph UNK
er you know do you include all the four UNK
or do you move around and just erm concentrate on one or more of them
do you have them going right to the edge
you've gotta make up your mind how you're going to photograph them
and i think this one is reasonably successful
i often think that perhaps putting the UNK of the UNK in more or less in the centre of the picture perhaps not the best place but i think because in this case we've got a lot of trees down to the bottom here
although the UNK of the UNK is more or less in the centre of this photograph it's not in sent not in the sense of the area of vision because you've got a lot of dark area here so that tends to move the centre of vision so it becomes this bit if you like and so that's not in the centre there
so it doesn't really matter so much in this particular case
a seven for that picture
this one is called UNK
UNK
UNK
erm the idea of sort of close UNK as you've done here and you know that's quite a an acceptable and well known method of showing facial UNK
and i think it does work nicely because it th most of the frame is filled with the girl's hair and she's got nice UNK hair nicely lit that erm is a good way of showing off her head
the light on the hair is fine
where it's not quite so good i feel is on her face
you got this sort of shiny nose and quite vast shadow there and then quite bright highlight on her bottom lip
so the light on her face is just a little bit too harsh
i don't know whether a reflector or a an umbrella was used but it does need something er some form of lighting which is a little less harsh
i find that there's you know a lot of shade on her face er which is a shame
i like the use of the pe the UNK have made i think that's good
and the UNK does a very nice job there
tt
just a i find that she almost looks as if she's been out in the sun and that it sort of looks like very strong UNK on her face which is a shame really
needs to be UNK needs to be UNK and that can be done by using a UNK over the light using an umbrella any way that you can UNK like using a reflector all kinds of things to do
erm yeah it's a pity really
er a seven er for that one
next one two's a pair
and although these are obviously er at some kind of show because if you look beyond the horses you can see there are UNK and so on in the background
so it's presumably er a competition or a or er demonstrating the old fashioned agricultural machinery
it's obviously a show and i mean you could well imagine that in the old days you need horses were really used to do a full day's work they didn't have quite such er nice clean tack a as these ones
certainly they are magnificent animals
and they are and they're UNK photographed
the two erm UNK here i don't know whether there's one who's handling and the other one's just sort of having a chat with him about but you know they they're important in the picture but they're not er you know the horses completely dominate the two people in the picture
and it's nice i think to include this plough if that's what it is
no it's yeah it is a plough
er this is a UNK plough
er so it's a nice to include that lovely bit of old machinery as well
very UNK pair of horses nicely photographed
it's not got the creative thing which i mean competition to get a ten or a nine you've gotta really have some creative element in it this hasn't quite got that but it is a very strong picture and very nicely photographed so i'll give this one eight
eight
nigel
i don't know if i saw or that one
yeah
if you'd like to do this one mark then you can have a break
yeah
and tha you're
okay
just over half way
alright
erm well he's certainly you know he would go ideally with the horses i don't know whether this one is
at the same show er
ha
show or whatever i
mm
i could well could well be the same event as that because he certainly looks to be the right sort of character
got a lovely erm weather beaten face and the way he's wearing his hat
i dunno i dunno whether he's erm he really could be i mean he could be the thing is he could be compared to a UNK
but erm certainly with this style of hat was commonly worn i suppose to his and by the people who work on the land certainly in this part of the world
but he has got the continental grammar sort of italians you know what they're like
erm but certainly erm but er he's certainly got an interesting face
and it's nicely lit
er we this time we don't mind that we've got fairly harsh lighting because he's a someone who's used to being out in the erm all UNK whether it's cold or sunny i have a feeling mostly sunny
erm so that's fine to have a UNK lighting on his face is fine cos it does tend to show up the er the UNK in his UNK under his eyes and his UNK which is fine because when erm my old UNK of this nature that's the sort of thing you're trying to emphasize
and i like i like the way he's got his hat on
erm if he was local if he was from chelmsford we would say he was wearing his hat in the UNK fashion i don't know whether
whether that means anything to people who live in bishop's stortford but i've always lived in chelmsford and people who wore their hat sort of at a UNK angle on the back of their heads were always seem to wearing their hats in the UNK fashion
erm
but er then i suppose it doesn't matter where they come from because it's er yeah very nice
i like that
right a nine for that one
gerald
right
okay
yes
but er this is a sort of a you know UNK chocolate box that type of thing
erm nothing UNK meant er by that because the reason photographs are used for chocolate boxes and biscuits and things and UNK is cos they're good photographs and they they're subjects which people like
this is a very nicely lit cottage
you can see that the er erm the texture in the UNK certainly on the front here is nicely shown
and er i like the fact that we've got similar cottages down here we've got this one here but similar ones there so there's nothing in the picture which sort of erm UNK from that er very pretty that little cottage
nice sky
and just a hint of sea in the background
now we the title tells us that's in cornwall it doesn't really matter where it is but erm just a hint of the sea a super place to live i should think there
erm you know there's a very nice cottage and just a short walk down the road you're at the se at the sea
and also i think it's very fortunate that er the two cars that are in the picture have been very nicely UNK by the sort of containers these brick erm this appears to be sort of a stone or a brick wall there with sort of flowers growing in them which has very nicely dis UNK those two cars that are parked there
so that's good
there's nothing in the picture i don't there's not even a television aerial or
mm
anything there's nothing in there which does just a few er telephone lines er going across the UNK there but they're very faint you can hardly see them you've gotta look very closely to see them
yeah i UNK like that one
it sort of grows on you and it it's er very good quality er nice colours
a nine for that one
gordon
breaking waves
yeah
i thought he said er breaking
now
waves
remember i said earlier on in one of the black and white ones that we haven't we've got some water there which hasn't got nice lines on well this water certainly has
look at the way those tha beyond the waves there that piece of water a lovely light on it
all the UNK in the waves nicely shown
a very simple picture again it's er you couldn't have anything much more simple than this just two waves coming in onto the UNK beach and er you can almost hear the waves rushing u running across the UNK
erm i think the thing about it which i th the good points about it th are the light on it the light on the water here the light on the waves here and even on this one and also i think the choice of mount is very good that you know to choose the blue it may be a bit obvious but i mean i you'd be surprised what some people do with their UNK
erm you can something like this on a red mount or something you can imagine it would be absolutely hopeless
but to make it all a very nice gentle sort of colours throughout including the mount is the right sort of thing to do
i think possibly it needs something just to break up this sort of the lines you just got those bands of waves going across there
er would have been nice if there'd been a rock or something for one of them to break over
it's just a little bit sort of er the waves themselves are nice but i think they do need something else in it just to erm break up the UNK of the er of the composition
a seven and a half
tied up
i think
yes
yep
well i'll be nice little er a very small boat there but because it's of the colour it has a lot of impact
it's only a tiny little UNK two people in there is about as much as you could manage
erm but it's got impact because of the colour even the trolley that it's standing on erm has got er red wheels and this yellow sort of er UNK bar there
no beg your pardon
it's not a UNK bar it's another boat
i thought it was a UNK bar for that but it's another boat sort of down in the in the se harbour
and that's the colour of the boat
erm so it's got a erm a little bit of impact because of the colouring to start with
erm yeah it's reasonable quality
it's er good colours on the this stone UNK here
quite nice colours the UNK and what have you that's growing on there
erm maybe the composition having the boat sort of the bow of the boat just hidden behind there is perhaps er not be better
yeah i know if you'd have moved round to the other side that would have been in the shadow so you wouldn't have got those nice bright colours
er bit of a problem with the contrast too i think the fact that the boat is white on the inside and the rest of it er fairly dark i mean
this is obviously where the UNK area is and that is becoming a bit burned out because erm if it was an automatic camera that was used it's exposed for this consequently over UNK on the inside of the boat
especially painted white and it is reflecting an awful lot of light
a seven for that one
in UNK green
mm
couple of very nice horses
it's er good composition having the two separated like that
you know often horses do stand close together and they sometimes you get them UNK and that is not the best thing to do it's nice to have them separated if you possibly can
so when you see a pair of horses move round and so that you do get them separated as they are or any animal not just horses any animals really get them separated er or any object really it's better to have a little bit of separation
erm
yeah i think it's a very pleasant picture
it's not it doesn't it's not got a lot of er excitement about it it's very pleasant you can't criticize it for erm exposure colours are good
so i'm very it's not a picture which unless you are sort of mad keen on horses that i it's perhaps not a picture which erm will hold your interest for too long
you know nothing a very pleasant picture er o of a couple of horses very attractive horses but if you're not a horse UNK perhaps it hasn't got quite the same impact er as it otherwise would have
the er pleasant background nice light on the horses but i find the subject matter you know okay it's okay but it's not a great competition winning er picture
a six for that one
here's somebody having a go at something a little creative
altered states
altered state
yeah certainly is an altered state
erm er you know i don't i wouldn't even begin to suggest how this particular effect was achieved
i mean it er portrait really is the right sort of subject to try out this kind of technique because er it doesn't have impact and here because the green and the erm er this th for want of a better colour it's really red it's a sort of UNK colour they're very dark and th the actual head doesn't really stand out very much from the from the background i think the background
colour and th they're too much they're too dark and er they need to be have more contrast
and i'm not so sure that portrait is the best possible erm medium to use or the best possible photograph to use for this type of er trick
i think that erm modern structure and that sort of thing this type of treatment
tends to work better i'm not so sure portrait is the right thing to do
erm er a it's almost an abstract it's a you know if one would accept that as an abstract and forget that it's a portrait then it's perhaps works a little better
the two colours don't go too badly together but er i'm not so sure that i would really want that hanging on the wall i it doesn't really appeal to me very much
sorry about that
but another judge will come along and give it a fine mark but
i'm gonna give it a five
the UNK
the UNK
mhm
yeah i guessed it was certainly UNK i'm you know quick like that you know
erm yes well the high viewpoint obviously is er a thing which i think makes the picture
it now whether you're taking a portrait or anything at all it's always more interesting i think if you can take a slightly different viewpoint a di whether it's up high or down below or whatever er i that always adds interest to it
we're looking down here obviously standing on a hill because here we've got some plants which are on the UNK and there's a river here so we're on sort of a fairly steep slope i would imagine down to the river looking over across these UNK
erm nice lighting very good sort of er gentle lighting across the countryside there nothing very dramatic
erm not much drama in the sky
it's a very pleasant picture
not a great competition winning shot but er at the same time it's a it's a nice enough shot of this particular area
a very beautiful part of france
erm being that i one of the bits which i think catches your eye is this little house here although there's lots of them about because this one tends to be in a slightly UNK area and for some reason that the light on there is sort of picking that one out rather more than all the others and i think that's quite a nice little feature
a seven for that one
that
le tower UNK
ooh
yeah
oh
dear oh dear
i like your french accent
he didn't know he's
yes
well yeah as i say very UNK subject isn't it
i
mhm
i
i haven't been to paris since er ooh a long time a whe last time i went there i was on UNK so that's a few years ago
erm
did you see the UNK tower
and er so there's a UNK now i don't think tha that was there when i was there
my wife's been a couple of times si since then but not me
erm yeah it's a again a very straightforward shot of a very well internationally known UNK erm but i think to stand sort of at an angle to this bridge sort of so you're the bridge leads you up to the archway underneath the tower is a nice viewpoint
so you obviously thought about where you were going to stand
it might you might be tempted to walk along the UNK a little further and look along the bridge and er sort of straight at the tower
and i don't think that would be anywhere nearly so effective
much more effective to get the very attractive bridge in as well
and the boat going underneath just er at the right sort of time
yeah i think that's good
it's not a erm you know it's not a sort of print which is going to be UNK on exhibition walls er to that extent but it's a very pleasant erm shot
it's a very competent shot
not a pity there's not a one or two clouds in the sky
an eight for that one
nigel
UNK peasant turkey
i do wondered how you were gonna say that george that you know that
yeah i like this one
i think it's a super erm
portrait and erm you can see that she's knitting
er lovely light on her hands and on her face and er this lovely quality nice colours and i think that is a super portrait
erm the background can't having the tree in the background just to fill up the erm the bare sky is ideal
she almost has a three d effect i er you know her face really stands out from that background
i get a very strong three d impression from her head
she's stan really sa of stands out from the background
i like that one
erm be careful with your titles cos it's not easy to title them
that title is perhaps a not quite as straight as it might be it's got a little bit of a UNK in it
though using UNK to title them is not easy to do you know it's very difficult to keep them on a straight line
mm
erm but nevertheless i do think that is a super portrait
i can't really criticize it all really
i'm gonna give that one a ten
gerald
over the UNK
i think the strong point of this is the light
i mean the lovely golden light on the grass very late afternoon light i would suggest and it's got this lovely warm colour on the grass
and on this UNK over here
and having someone just climbing over the UNK is a good idea with the UNK pointing
it doesn't really matter which way it's going
and er yo you get the impression that it's late in the day the UNK a bit UNK and maybe it's time to be thinking about er getting home and er i get the impression that person climbing over the UNK is sort of on his way home after having a super day out walking in the yorkshire UNK or somewhere like that
and er the pubs are open
yeah well it could be
yeah that's very nice
lovely colours and er a very nice light in the in the sky and on the grass here
perhaps again it lacks just a little bit of UNK which you've lost
the colours the quality and the colours are fine
the actual quality in the in the er print the UNK er that sort of thing is perhaps not quite as good as it should be but i still an eight for that one
eight
gordon
UNK
UNK
UNK
UNK
UNK
yes it's a typical sort of UNK er lighting or UNK i suppose is it
erm if you wanna be really accurate
er it's got a very lo strong clear UNK which er is quite attractive for the type of scene
not attractive for every subject but for the where you get these old erm broken walls or summat like that it's ideal for showing up er UNK and so on this type of lighting
this is often why it works i think in er in the UNK er and places in that area
er just a little bit of cloud in the sky which is good
i suppose
you've got to have the tourist there it's a i find tourists they always wear the wrong sort of clothes
i feel a little guilty but they've always got UNK and t shirts which really often to my mind
spoil photographs of places such as this
erm
you know we would li i don't mind people being in it but i'd rather you know can you imagine that er the greek priest we had in the very first print
i mean he would fit into this er in a in a superb way
erm so we just have to accept that tourists don't dress in those sort of clothes
yeah i think that's a got nice lighting nice quality in it
er
a seven and a half for that
UNK
yeah i think the drama in the sky is the thing which makes this and the little lighthouse right on the edge of the cliff there showing up quite nicely
you can imagine that er on some occasions with a li just a little more UNK that er lighthouse would really stand out
yeah it stands out reasonably well in this one but i can imagine it standing out even more under other conditions
erm the UNK of the edges i suppose that's been done to create a little more atmosphere in the picture and i think it possibly does
and there are some people actually on the beach as well which i think is important because we've got a lot of empty area here fairly UNK area but it's nice to have these two or three people er dotted around on the beach
very nice light on these UNK over here
yeah i think that one works quite well
an eight for that one
heather
another studio portrait
UNK
UNK
UNK
she really looks like sandy UNK
but er
she's got her shoes on there
shows your age if you can remember
some of you might do as well
erm i suppose to most of us here sandy UNK was
yeah it's
ha
erm the thing about this title portrait which i always er like to emphasize and is that when you're using UNK like these UNK or any other UNK at all in this sort of UNK photography then they must be in absolutely UNK condition and they are here
i just mentioned that so that when you if you do this type of photography always remember that your UNK whatever they might be must be absolutely in UNK condition
we don't want any UNK paint or UNK legs on the UNK or anything like that
they've gotta be really good er good things
otherwise it tends to make the whole picture like i went to er one club once and there was a very nice portrait not unlike this there was a girl sitting on a stool rather less clothes on than this girl has got and it was very nicely done except she was sitting on a painted stool and all the paint was UNK and that to me looked really UNK
and i thought ah you know
they're went to all that trouble to produce a good photograph and absolutely ruined it with the stool
so make sure that everything is in good nick
yes
erm yeah i think the pose is quite nice
i think possibly erm having the two different UNK is a little bit er unfortunate
erm i don't know i don't yo i think possibly having that foot up on the stool was perhaps a mistake
mm
i think perhaps if you could have arranged her so that er this foot somehow was resting down here well it might have been better
it looks a little uncomfortable er like that
and it looks a little bit sort of set up having that totally different stool brought into the picture
erm
i just wonder whether erm i think that stool there might have been better to have her sitting on that one not quite so high up and she could have adopted a more comfortable pose and she wouldn't have needed another prop for her foot
so i think perhaps that's where the picture is not quite right in the composition and also the fact that this stool is sort of
being er chopped off along the side as well as the leg
so i think possibly a little more thought in the actual i think the actual shape of the girl there the way she's actually sitting is fine but er it looks as if she's been UNK up with you know you better put this stool under your foot to hold that up and put this UNK under your arm to hold that up and
and so on
it looks as if she's had these things put there to support her rather than actually UNK sitting on them
but certainly the UNK quite nice and i think very pretty girl and could be better with the better composition
erm six and a half for that one
feeding quietly
feeding
feeding
ya
eating
feeding
it would be yeah
well it
quite
i think erm often when judges i don't know whether george or any other judges that might be here tonight one of the things which i as a judge often dread is photographs of babies coming up in competition
not that i've got anything against babies
but it's often difficult because quite often they come up and to be absolutely honest they're not that good
so you start to criticize them and you think oh my god
this is someone's baby in the audience that we're having a go at
but that's not the problem here because i think this one is excellent
i think the light on er the baby's face i dunno whether it's a little boy or a little girl but it doesn't matter the light on the baby's face
is super
and i certainly love the way that both eyes are catching those lovely highlights
great big brown eyes
very appealing
nice light on that sort of the UNK over the UNK
so we've got lovely soft lighting throughout
erm UNK on the side which is UNK away from us and the fact that he's er he or she is eating a you know a piece of fruit or something is quite appealing
i like that one
not quite a ten because i think it's er you know this hand here perhaps a little bit er UNK but certainly i think that one's worth a nine
elaine
restored to former glory
yeah i can remember when i was about er seven or eight years old i had a UNK train which is almost identical except it was red i go i think some other people had one as well
UNK we had those things you used to pull out of the UNK and they could go
forwards and backwards
oh lovely
erm and it was almost identical to that
very nice quality print
er lovely i mean re restored in absolute UNK condition
UNK restored UNK
and it's standing in the right sort of location in this old station
erm a little bit of steam around so you do get an impression that it's erm you know it's alive and working obviously not doing a day's work but certainly being restored back to working condition
and for anybody who's a rail UNK would be er very pleased with this shot
and i think possibly that maybe the little bit of a problem with it it's a little bit too specialized
it's very good quality erm yeah i think it's the quality of it is good enough to put it up for i in the sort of higher UNK of marks
so i shall er i give that one an eight for the quality
peter
UNK
what
away
ah
that's an UNK title
UNK the gun away UNK away
yeah
a little bit of
er thought given to the title of that
i was quite surprised er during the summer i went to my UNK school UNK and they had a hot air balloon demonstration there and this er this car turned up with a trailer on the back with i dunno probably some name hot air balloon name on the trailer i thought oh yes he's gonna show us how to UNK it and i was quite amazed from the time he UNK the balloon to the time it actually took off was only ten minutes
i was really quite impressed
i didn't realize that they could be got ready in such a short space of time
but anyway very dramatic shot looking up into the mouth of the balloon with this huge flame going up
i guess th that you must have be actually been in the basket
we don't get the impression erm of whether you were UNK at that stage
i would think if you weren't you must have been very nearly
perhaps yeah i think you must have been UNK at that stage to be er had such a enormous flame going up into the balloon
very sort of eye catching because of the nature of it
and i think it's quite nicely exposed er to show the detail in the erm the UNK
you can see the gas UNK here th quite a lot of detail a hand rail or something around it there and all the details in that UNK are quite nicely shown
but most of all obviously the great UNK y you know the tremendous noise that they make
or i believe they have got some UNK ones now
erm a seven for that one
seven
UNK de UNK
that's nice
looks like a mini UNK power station
i dunno
erm
yeah i think those three UNK there are from a i dunno is it looks as if it could be a UNK or something you know
er it could be a pottery i don't know
it they certainly look as if they are sort of intended er to heat things up
that's obviously a furnace
UNK
at the bottom of each one of those
but nice light on the UNK and on the sky and throughout the picture really
i think that's quite UNK find a nice composition
and the thing which really makes it are the three UNK without those i think the rest of it would be okay but not terribly exciting
i think the three UNK are vital to the er the strength of the picture
quite nice natural colours
yeah i think that is er it's not a great competition winning shot but i still think a seven and a half for that one
seven and a half
the next one is no title
well it doesn't really need a title it's a er it could be anywhere it's it sort of got that hint of west country but it doesn't really matter it's we're not interested in where it is we're interested in the final image
and er i think the that's quite good
although there's some but these sort of pictures they always look UNK than they actually are because you can see the sun is still pretty high up so i imagine that the surrounding scene was still in quite UNK but looking straight into the sun as we are here albeit behind the clouds
it does have the effect of UNK everything down
th the strong highlight on the reflection on the water obviously is a thing which makes the picture as and also the sort of rays of sun coming down through the cloud
just enough light around to make out the that tree there and a little bit of detail in the in the UNK and obviously the UNK
but erm yeah it's er good for what it is but i think this has been done many times before and er i sh would think that everybody's seen some just slightly better than this but it's quite a nice er UNK
a nice reflection on the water
er a six for that one
UNK trees
ah
a pity there i was gonna sort of le air my knowledge and say a and say look at these UNK trees
yes well obviously i think you know they quite obvious what they are
erm
i think again the choice of the mount is good bu you know we tend to associate UNK trees growing in hot erm fairly dry areas and i think the choice of the mount colour UNK that
erm i think possibly just the trees themselves are we you know th okay they're UNK trees so they're a little bit unusual we don't get too many UNK trees growing in this country but i'm not so sure that they're as er that attractive to make a photograph solely out of the UNK trees
i think er you know they're just a you know if they were erm elm trees or something like that or you know UNK trees here and you'd taken them in this country you'd say oh there's a couple of UNK trees
and here we've got a couple that happen to be UNK trees and i i'm not so sure that just the fact that they're UNK trees really is that important
and i think perhaps it's it lacks a bit of importance you know it hasn't got the strength erm to stand up on its own
it really needs something else
we need a donkey in it or something like that you know just to
erm be in keeping with the situation a donkey there would be would be nice
but the trees on their own it's like a scene waiting for something happen
it it's a bit empty
so a six for that one please
UNK
well
shore
the last one
well guess what
UNK shore
that's right
i think you said that
someone sent the boat over
you know the
you couldn't move around a lot
move around a bit more
a bit more
tip the boat over
the camera
and you've got a third photograph
yeah i think again this er deserves a good it's a good exercise to do this sort of thing taking colour and black and white because you can then decide whe whether one medium has got an advantage over the other or not
and you can you know you can argue about it it's a good talking point good discussion point and i think you will get different opinions er to whoever you speak to
but certainly the fact that this is being in colour you know that boat which is lying there becomes much more important
the red sort of er erm bit round the top of the boat
is er becomes important as does the colour in the sky
so it this has some things in the picture gain importance although i still the black and white ones
er now you've chosen this time to eliminate the other boat we know there's another boat around about here somewhere and we know there's another post here so erm but if this was shown in isolation we wouldn't have known that
and i think this one stands up quite nicely on its own
very nice quality
lovely sky
i particularly like the sky in that one
erm i think possibly again if you'd got down a bit lower this sort of little rise in the ground there that er that's a it's erm what do you call it
a UNK would have just risen up above the horizon and come become slightly more important
but still i still think that's quite good
i'll give that one an eight as well
heather
i must er
thank you mark
that was the last one
could we have the lights please
while george is er doing the marks i might call on gerald please to give the vote of thanks
evening everybody
can you hear me over there
yes
yes
thank you
yeah
once again mr has done us proud
i've heard hundreds of judges in the last few years and mr is one of the very few who in every picture UNK a very picture
he comes up with a little piece of advice on how to make that picture or the colouring or the mounting better
and you don't often see the every picture he tells something nice about it
and compared with mine as well you see
about this time last year i think it was the same week he came there were five judges that he picked every year for fifteen years
oh
and despite you know managed he somehow he'd get them through and get
but we've had a very good evening and we must thank mr for it
so in our usual way a vote of thanks
thanks very much mark you've given me the hardest part
anyway erm on the night UNK prints elaine and alf tied with twenty four
gordon had twenty three and a half
heather had twenty one and a half
and UNK had sixteen
so UNK then with number one we have gordon leading the way with fifty and a half
but alfie was second with forty nine and a half
oh
so there's not a lot in that
heather is forty six she's third
elaine is fourth with forty four
and UNK on the night er top of the shop tonight was gerald who gave the vote of thanks who got twenty six and a half
and but we have nigel gordon and heather
tt
all with twenty three
UNK has twenty two
bill and elaine have twenty one each
erm UNK again with number one gerald is leading the way with fifty two and a half
and then we have erm nigel with forty nine
and then gordon and heather both with forty six
elaine with forty five is fourth
and peter forty four and a half is fifth
thank you george
well done george
thanks
right well next week is the UNK
er we have got some one or two expensive items so bring your
money bags along
er if anybody's got any items that they haven't told me about tonight and they go before perhaps you'd be kind enough to give me a phone call
and if you could get here by half past seven those of you who have got items it'll be much appreciated cos it takes quite a time to set them out
er the coffee next week is going to made by jane and peter
er next week will be the last week for selling tickets for the social so if you'd like to come tickets next week
and if you haven't made arrangements about your dinner after christmas would you please do that now
i'll leave you to say UNK thank you for coming
british pits are the UNK in the world but in the future could that record be under threat
tonight on public eye evidence that vital monitoring equipment has been UNK by men who were under pressure to keep up productivity
in the fight to make our pits competitive is the cost of coal the safety of miners
UNK colliery scene of the worst pit accident in britain for more than a decade
three men were UNK to death under seven thousand tonnes of rock
david the under manager had died a hero trying to warn his colleagues
he left a pregnant wife and UNK family
she's so young she's twenty one she's got a UNK on the way eighth month they had everything to live for everything
just UNK away UNK away
i was always worried when he went to work but y you don't think your husband's going to go to work in the morning at five o'clock and never come home again
in all six men had been trapped by the fall
UNK worked through tonnes of rock for more than twelve hours to free the miners
the conditions were appalling
as you went in to the head end where the roof bolts were still UNK it was hard to imagine that approximately forty six metre fifty metre of gate had just come in one go
erm i've never seen anything like it in my life
i hope i never do again
if you can imagine your front room full of concrete erm one minute your sat there watching the telly the next minute your front UNK full of concrete that is just what it was like
the gate itself the UNK was totally UNK
there was nothing left
like two other pits in nottinghamshire this UNK was cut skin to skin or immediately next to old workings
roof bolts were the only support
a special exemption certificate was issued to allow them
the mines inspectorate later cleared them of the cause usually though they're used where there are thick coal walls or pillars
skin to skin can be more cost efficient because the pillars themselves are extracted
normally the roof UNK sections would rest on coal pillars sometimes fifty metres wide
but here the health and safety executive had granted the exemption to allow roof bolts right next to the old working
for over four hundred metres there was nothing UNK the new UNK from the UNK in section apart from some wooden UNK
there was a huge movement of rock above the old coal face when the roof came in
a lot of the men are very suspicious about the roof UNK system how easily the certificates have been given
erm now the th h s c is saying that erm it shouldn't have gone skin to skin and they've stopped skin to skin in other headings
maybe they should have had UNK and er this wouldn't have happened at UNK
but they've cleared roof bolts as a cause
well they've got to clear roof bolts
they are the way forward now for the british mining industry erm they've been coming in very UNK and now they are at virtually every pit in the country
erm it is the only way they've told us we can get our cost down to compete with the world market
the mines inspectorate have admitted to public eye the roof UNK method next to old workings underground made UNK a different case from normal but they stress the system was carefully examined before it was allowed
to some mining experts it's also a clear sign that UNK are being given too easily
one inspector now retired believes the UNK exemption should never have been granted
chris thinks roof bolts should only be allowed where the UNK are supported by thick coal pillars
the idea of a UNK supported on either side by a coal UNK and supported in the er in the beam of the roof er by er roof bolts making that beam stronger so that the sides will support the beam is a good one
and in the right circumstances er it need not be criticized but the circumstances have to be right for it
there has to be good coal UNK support on either side and there has to be a competent roof
those were not the circumstances at UNK but the mines inspectorate insist they were right to allow the roof UNK in the tunnel or narrow UNK that's despite the fact that on one side instead of a good coal UNK only wooden UNK supported the roof
narrow UNK doesn't necessarily mean then that there are coal pillars either side
narrow UNK means what it says a narrow UNK
does it mean that
it means it's not wide
does it mean that there would UNK be coal pillars either side
no it means that it isn't a wide UNK it means it's a narrow one
in most cases it would have pillars either side
coal pillars
yes
but not in this case at UNK
does that not return then to our point that UNK are being granted more freely
well they are not being granted more freely th when a an exemption is granted the inspector the inspector who grants the exemption has got to say that he is satisfied that the health and safety of the workforce will not be UNK
nobody i will suggest to you mr UNK nobody will say that unless he is convinced that er what he is doing is correct nobody
for miners today the productivity push has changed the face of the industry
if one pit had a bad patch another pit would cover it th them days have gone now it's er one pit against another
they want production now
the more production the better it is for them and better to sell the pits off
at the end of the day it's money
it's production and money
safety is coming second
british coal deny that
they decline to be interviewed but in a statement to us said this year productivity has increased while the accident rate has fallen
yet at UNK british UNK critics believe productivity pressure believe played a crucial part
but we can UNK another longer term threat to the health of miners which is also blamed on the push for productivity
it's a threat which puts miners at greater risk of contracting UNK lung diseases
after forty years underground UNK is a tragic result of old style mining in conditions thick with coal dust
i'm short of breath i ain't got no energy UNK i can't walk twenty UNK without a rest so
there's not much they can do there's no there's no new UNK in the hospital to give out nor an extension to life so all i can do is try and cope
for britain's three quarters of a million miners in the nineteen thirties and forties dust was a massive problem
but by the sixties after extensive research the deadly disease was finally brought under control
this was achieved by using er dust measuring apparatus that was safe down a mine didn't cause UNK
and er that er was placed in a certain particular position in relation to the coal face so that it was er a standard method of measuring the concentration of dust in the atmosphere where the men worked
so dust UNK have been UNK in bringing UNK under control
that's right and the understanding of what was necessary
these vital machines are used at coal faces and UNK
dust is drawn in through UNK and collected in UNK
the filter is analyzed by the pit and regular check samples are analyzed at independent UNK
if the samples are above certain limits the district underground can be shut down
but we have evidence that these UNK machines have been UNK in some of britain's pits so they give false low readings
the selby coal field is the UNK in the crown of british coal
coming on stream through the eighties they've achieved their target producing ten million tonnes of coal a year
there are five pits in the complex taking coal to a central depot
the UNK pit was one of the first three mines in britain to reach a production figure of one million tonnes per year
gary has been a pit deputy at UNK for four years
last summer on a routine check of his district he noticed something wrong with one dust UNK
i grabbed hold of the UNK to turn it round to look for the switch which is on other side
i noticed the UNK were UNK and it's like a UNK on the filter so i had a close inspection found that they were all actually UNK up with what appeared to be UNK
so what was going through your mind when you found this UNK with UNK up UNK
i couldn't believe it really i w who would do such a you know why
and er i were mad as well because somebody was somebody were UNK records and well my lungs and my life and the UNK life as well
other UNK were found here where readings for correct working conditions were impossible to gauge
it was discovered they too had been UNK
this time by the UNK of a thick filter inside the machine itself
we had to remove the UNK plate and in there was a piece of UNK that's the inside cloth cut to size so it fit in nice
it wasn't until you actually turned the machine and actually UNK in to the slots that you could see the UNK
so if nobody was looking for it or if they weren't used to the machines examining the machines they wouldn't know it was there
and what would be the effect of that UNK
that UNK would prevent i'd say ninety nine percent of any dust going through it
we've examined british UNK own figures for dust UNK in britain's mines
in UNK the routine samples taken by the pit are lower in every single case than the samples taken and checked by independent UNK used by british coal
in the case of the selby complex the independent statistics are more than two and a half times higher
british coal in response said they've led the world in dust monitoring and any UNK in samples are immediately investigated
we spoke to one miner who admitted UNK with UNK in another pit to UNK
we've protected his identity because he fears the sack for speaking out
any method is used that could stop dust getting in to them
using small bits of UNK or anything that would stop it getting in there
to my knowledge i know that it's happening in at least half a dozen mines
it's being done up and down the country as well as round our vicinity of mining
i've talked to other men who've UNK samples you have to go to course about laws rules regulations to do with dust and once lads got talking it comes out how it's happening
for experts who've spent a career bringing UNK under control these UNK are deeply disturbing
it's a clear UNK of regulations and UNK work done on health and safety underground
this of course is a very serious matter
er if your safety in your mines from the point of view of the miners health is dependent upon keeping below a certain limit of dust exposure
if your not measuring the dust exposure levels correctly then er you're likely to expose the men to dangerous conditions
miners know the pressure is on to increase the british UNK and save their jobs
but the sanctions imposed on a pit with high dust readings could be serious
the mine district could be shut down for three months
basically we were told to do it and if we didn't do it we'd got us money dropped
we had threats of being moved or we were sacked
if a UNK your main UNK is found to be above the legal limit after a series of checks in theory it should be shut until it's sorted out
but it never is
i've never yet known a coal face or a UNK closed because of too much dust
work is always just carried on with the dust samples UNK
it's all down to pressure to keep production going and also if you do everyone perfectly rightly you run the risk of closing the mine or putting six or seven hundred men on the dole
unless i know about it there's nothing i can do about it is there
well now you know about it mr what do you intend to do
well when you tell me where it is i'll do something about it
what might you do
well where is it
it's in yorkshire
it's in the selby group
right i shall take it up with the area director in n in ne yorkshire as we would normally do
in fact i think this has actually been dealt with if i'm er
it's been dealt with in UNK you know about that but also in another pit
well we i would be more surprised that er in fact i don't think i'm sure that it's not happening on a on a on a er wide basis
i think that's it's a liberty that shouldn't be taken that they're playing with miners health and their lives
and anything that's not on the up and up is well i think it's detrimental to a UNK life
not only to his health but is to his life and i mean er cutting his life time short my opinion
UNK 's mining area the UNK now has no pits when once it gave work to a hundred thousand men
throughout the industry now the cut throat competition is UNK than ever
with last weeks announcement that thirty one british pits are again facing closure
last year the government brought american mining consultants UNK in to areas like south wales where they met fierce local UNK
the UNK will have nobody working at all there'll be no one paying UNK no income tax so where is the money going to come for future pensions for people right through the country
where's the common sense of the government
and i do hope that they will change their mind and bring work to the UNK
i really can't answer your question mam
you can't answer me
crucial to the UNK plan was the introduction of more american mining techniques to boost production and bring down costs
in evidence to a common select committee the consultants stressed the importance of UNK cost efficient methods
UNK from safety laws to use them was encouraged
as far as roof UNK and er the er length of advance without supports current UNK very restrictive i think it has to be opened upwards demonstrated by scientific evidence to be successful
to allow you to take full cuts with the continuous mines
one of the key techniques that UNK wanted to encourage was deep cut or as it's known in the u s extended cut
deep cut means cutting further without any support at all making it a faster more cost effective way of mining
now in britain mine inspectors have started UNK for cutting up to six point six metres without support
but in america where the extended cut method of mining is taken further their underground accident record per man shift is four times ours
it's twelve thirty i'm with news
the strike at the coal mine in UNK county UNK on and on
two hundred four days today no end in sight
in UNK seven hundred miners are on strike
they want safer conditions below ground
deep or extended cut accounts for half of all deaths and roof UNK in american mines
for the company it means UNK profits but to these men it means more dangerous conditions
the main thing here concerning is extended cuts with the coal operators is er the buzz word of the coal industry UNK we have to have extended cuts in order to be competitive
and right now the term UNK is used to basically get by safety regulations and anything else concerning safety
at this mine two years ago a man was buried and later died after a massive roof fall in an extended cut section
when we got there one o one of the other boys was already there with him and he was covered from about his waist down with coal and er we UNK him and gave him as comfortable as we could get him until we got the UNK and everything mobilize him and get him out
the miner joe had always kept details about the underground conditions hidden from his family
he wouldn't tell me what was going on down there because he didn't want to worry me as far as the safety conditions at that particular mine
erm and when they did complain to somebody like a company man you know well that's all the farther it went
there was nothing done to correct it
the shock o of losing someone you've been married to for twenty one years we grew up together he was my best friend he wasn't just my husband he was my best friend
you lose all of that
you can't get it back no matter what else happens in your life that part is gone so a part of your life dies along with his
the UNK involving joe was an example of what we consider as one of the most dangerous aspects of extended cuts
that when you expose great UNK of the roof UNK then you increase the possibilities of a roof fall which comes back on through to the supported area of the roof and then UNK or kills someone
british mines operate at far greater depth than in america
extending their techniques in our conditions have prompted fears among some mining experts
if you use techniques which are in inappropriate to those conditions then you could compromise safety because of the stability of the mine working
and what about the american safety record is it very different to that over here
yes the american safety record is worse than ours
they tend to have far more accidents er in their mines than we do here in the united kingdom
but the americans are coming and it's causing great alarm in some circles
for union leaders such as peter of the pit UNK cost efficient techniques like deep cut threaten the safety of men working underground
they push very much the deep cut system in the u k deep cut system in america means that the machine goes forward a distance before any supports are set at all erm and then the supports do set roof falls
we did not object this without evidence of reasons for objection and we've been in disc discussion with the erm american miners
eighteen percent of their mines have this so called deep cut system but has more than fifty percent of all the fatal accidents in those eighteen percent of the mines
the same eighteen percent of mines which has deep cut has sixty three percent of all UNK
that's UNK of UNK gas
now for us that causes concern because we have gas in mines we don't UNK recognize the americans as having gas in mines
we do so that's the sort of concerns we have
and how do you know for a fact that they intend to bring these sorts of techniques in to britain
they're in
no they're in
we have mines working six point six metres now
one of those mines in north wales was UNK out for praise by american consultants UNK
yet within a few months of starting the technique here two men were badly injured in a roof fall
they'd cut slightly beyond what had been allowed but the report afterwards said the roof would still have come down
well i got trapped under er under one of the er rocks that f fell down and then managed to get that off me leg and went to give assistance to er the machine man the man on the machine which er trapped as well and er realized then that me leg had me leg was broken so took me down the end of the road and managed to get the stone off the lad and the machine and you got carried in to hospital
it worries me because these UNK as to there for example er where thirty nine square metres of roof was permitted to be without support of any kind
not a roof bolt not a prop not an arch UNK er led to a fall of roof
and i no surprise whatever absolutely no surprise
if you don't support the roof you can expect it to fall and two men were hurt
erm i'm not in favour of UNK for large area of UNK roof
it seems to me that your inviting a loss of roof control
now the mining industry faces a fresh set of safety laws
new guidelines are sweeping away some old regulations
in former mining areas like the UNK it's UNK
in a century and a half of mining hundreds of men have died
some of the lessons learnt from the accidents were UNK in safety laws which are now to be UNK
one of those accidents in eighteen fifty six is deep within local UNK and in the minds of people like former miner UNK
before the colliery explosion they'd been a fire in a certain district twenty yards long
it had been reported by the colliery official and er the colliery manager of the time thought it wasn't even important enough to actually stop men going in to that district to work
and they did go in there
the legislation that came out as a result of that then was absolutely sure you know that it was copper bottom UNK given that er legislation would prevent accidents of that nature again
the er deputy goes in to the district and he gives an insurance er by law that the district is safe
that district is safe for the men to go into
the explosion wiped out half of the UNK male voice choir
what survived was the crucial safety rule UNK work before the entire district is checked
now a suggested code of practice will kill off the old law
i better do a check for gas here
it's the first one of many
nought point four percent ah that's in order
only a few years a go the coal board was proud of the work of the pit deputy
one deputy in each district checked conditions were safe and could stop production if they weren't
now they're to allow maintenance work while the pre shift inspection is made and the pit UNK role will be divided up
suddenly nothing is too trivial to matter
everything is important
that's how standards are made and kept
in your years as a deputy have you stopped production because safety was at risk
e yes i have
machinery UNK to do i've stopped it for that
managers haven't been pleased but i've done it
they're never pleased when you stop er anything what concerns safety
they want you to carry on as normal but i will not do that at all
while ever i've got the power i will stop it and that's it
and how will that change
it will change dramatically
i won't have the power the power will be taken away from me
with these new UNK i have no power what's so ever to do with the safety
the deputy the new eyes on eighties
ah report by deputy in charge of the district
british coal say the new laws and guidelines will strengthen safety requirements underground
but the UNK believe they've been UNK out as a UNK to producing cheaper coal in britain's pits in the run up to privatization
you can have profitable mines if you want more UNK more accidents and more bad news like UNK
now if you want a coal industry you can have a good coal industry a profitable one
it's a question of who decides at this point in time with the government that's making the decision that the workers in this country have to accept lower standards in almost anything not just wages and terms of conditions now safety standards
let's look at the system let's look at the record
this inspectorate has been in being three hundred and fifty years
the accident level in this industry has come down consistently year by year by year every year
last year were the lowest on record
we have got to go to work with a lot of er tension and pressure on us
to get costs down to turn more coal to work more hours when at the end of the day we don't know if we're going to have a job in one or two years
erm it seems very UNK an and not fair to the people who are trying to work hard in this industry
to UNK out a living
UNK itself could now be a casualty of the closure program on the drive for a competitive mining industry
but the pace of change has seen the introduction of controversial new techniques and men prepared to UNK equipment underground
the future for britain's mines has never looked so black but some believe the future safety of miners is just as threatened
on kiss
on kiss
and they come in tubes and there's four in a tube of them
you can have loads of those
i'll give you ten for that
are you gonna come back tomorrow
am i allowed
well yes
oh alright then
yeah you can carry on till somebody knocks you off your UNK
yeah
and let's just hope it's soon
i'll talk to you tomorrow
oh thanks
tarrah
bye
bye UNK at lunchtime tomorrow then ten to one er quarter to UNK just after the action line UNK listen in then and we'll give you the qualifying question
sixteen minutes to two now this is erm UNK fair and it's early in the morning
no it's not
UNK fair and er it's early in the morning
it's er middle of the afternoon it's er radio nottingham thirteen minutes to two now
on the trains no problems east midlands airport say everything's running to time in the city centre no huge delays anywhere on the motorways they're all okay as well on the a one there's major work just started on the roundabout that's the er five lanes end roundabout affecting UNK traffic there are long delays there in peak times that's at er five lane ends the work there on the a one just started that's the roundabout UNK traffic is being affected there are long delays there
road in the a six double o five there's roadworks on the junction of lane causing some delays
newark town centre hill er area of the town part of is closed so UNK are signed there
on the a six o nine there's UNK on road between drive and drive and erm further up the m one junction eighteen it's down to one lane on the UNK carriageway that is causing delays and there is a UNK on the m one between UNK twenty one and twenty two in operation there in both directions
no problems there at the moment but if you're heading there later on watch it
UNK on the travel for you throughout the afternoon and a full service at teatime with john on radio nottingham from er half four till seven
f m one o three point eight and ninety five point five nottinghamshire's favourite station
and the weather forecast for this afternoon and this evening from john from off you go
yes er rain reaching most parts of the region th this afternoon tonight will be cloudy with further rain becoming UNK in the morning
the outlook for wednesday dry but isolated showers may occur or develop
yeah
thursday
early UNK and frost clearing leaving sunny spells less than twenty five per cent chance of rain
that's good isn't eh
twenty five per cent
yeah i dunno how they work that one out
well i don't know it's er big of string isn't it or something like
ah that's it string and a UNK bob
hold their finger up and see which way the UNK blowing
that's it
bye john
okay cheers geoff
tarrah
take care
let me just do this from er road police station
they want twelve volunteers for an i d parade
it's at seven o'clock tonight it's at road police station they're looking for white males aged about UNK five foot five to six foot approximately tall of slim build need to be clean UNK shoulder length dark brown hair
if you'll stand in the i d parade for them tonight at seven o'clock they'll give you ten pounds
can you call and ask for inspector he'll tell you more
that's they'll give you a UNK you need to be white male UNK five foot five to six foot slim build clean UNK
they'll give you ten pounds to call for an i d parade tonight
they need a dozen people ask for inspector when you ring
lee UNK and er wandering star
it's radio nottingham and it's eight minutes to two
we'll do kids' county these have been the clues for today's one
it's got loads of mud loads of mud
loads of loads of egg loads of eggs UNK
it's got a greenhouse next to it

it's got a lot of plants in it
people come and visit it and
now we know it not a chicken factory it's not the farm it's not farm it's not park or pond or the UNK or hill
elizabeth is on at work in town
hello
hello
where are you at work in town
at
what
where's that
it's on
on where
oh
yes
ah who was the erm who is it who makes th the curtains and blinds
and she has her picture on all the adverts
oh i don't

it says i am the lady i make them
oh yes well i don't know who that one i
don't you know who it is
no
it's always in the post
yes
it's always in there and er and i can remember walking around there and seeing the place where they make them and her UNK outside and underneath it says i am the lady i make them
me
it's not you is it
i don't think so
it's not you
no
are you busy today
yes we're always busy
are you
what d do you make them or sell them or what
yes we do make them and sell them
so have you got big machines there
yes
have you
yes
well d do you actually sort of make the lace fr from scratch or
yes that's right yes
do you
mhm
funny cos there aren't many places left that do that now are there
oh no we don't make it from scratch we just do the you know the m main UNK
oh i see you just run 'em up
yes that's right make
the curtain yes
i get it
look there's kids' county elizabeth where are we after
where did i say
i've forgotten now
i dunno know where you said
i'm sorry darling park
park
yes
no it's not
just gave me the hint you see
it's not but it's a lovely thought

well you can have one of those for being your first time on
hang on the line we'll sort you out with one of them alright
oh my god it's not my
tarrah
hello
bye
bye
hang on the line we'll sort you o she's getting all confused
er UNK on from hello jerry
hello
how are ya
oh er not too bad you know
it's turned out nasty i know that
it has hasn't it
turned out UNK again
it's a good job i took the dog out this morning cos it ain't fit to take a dog out
it's not now to get a UNK for your dog
get one of those ones that you strap on its back
er n kids' county where they talking about
er
no it's not
it's not never mind tarrah
tarrah
bye
who's on next
UNK from hello UNK

this report from jeremy
the family came to britain from UNK when their home was burnt down during UNK nine years ago
but after losing a UNK fight for asylum both parents were UNK
now their eldest daughter has been told to leave too but her supporters believe the decision is a clear breach of the children's UNK order
lawyers are expected to argue that michael howard and mr clarke are both in UNK of the UNK decision by pursuing her UNK
if found guilty they could be fined and ordered to pay court costs
it'd also allow miss 's lawyers to seek an UNK preventing the UNK which would set a legal precedent
her supporters believe it would force the government to UNK their UNK procedures

a quantity of clothing was also shown to the court
the UNK fell silent as the UNK were passed round
earlier there was evidence from a train driver who said he had seen human remains lying by the track at UNK
