well they want to move it they want to develop the area and er now they're talking as well about taking the trees out from around there too which is really getting up people's UNK it would seem
councillor david poole is on hello
hello
thanks for coming on david now you've hated this thing ever since it's gone up haven't you
yes er and the price it cost the er tax payers and rate payers of nottingham in the first place to put it there yes
tell us what's going to happen to the area then david
well it's going to be UNK as er as you probably know that part of the city is being slowly UNK er and this is one which is going to be done in about the middle of next year
er it's going to have er a circular area with benches and for shoppers can relax and everything but er unfortunately as you say there's going to be three mature trees in the centre of st UNK square will be removed as part of the opening up of the area
it seems that this is what's annoying people the most though
mm yes
lots of people really couldn't give a stuff about the statue there
we've had a few people coming on and saying they want it to stay there or they want to leave it there but it's the trees that's really annoying people
why have they got to go david
well that's the question i've been asking in committees er because i'm i brought this up when they did nicely when they took all the trees away from down er long row on the high street
there was a lovely tree outside old boots shop there they took all them away and put these little ones down the middle and i also brought it up when they did UNK cross they took the trees which had only been there a few years they took them all down and put some others up some little UNK things you know
er i did ask the question as well what what's going to happen to these trees or what happens to these trees when the city council UNK them and i've never got an answer yet and i'm going to keep asking somebody some day will give me an answer
i mean are the just destroyed or are they removed and UNK again we don't know
all right we've got er councillor stuart UNK in here as well stuart good afternoon
er hello geoff
hello erm so tell us what your stance on all of this is you're UNK about the trees aren't you
well i'm concerned geoff as a ward councillor i read about this in the paper that the environment committee which david is on er agreed to this scheme which is i'm all for having squares in the city centre and places for people to sit and enjoy and i'm UNK about the leaf stem
i understand it's been offered several homes so that would be nice
but i am concerned for the three trees that david has just mentioned being removed
i need to know that it's necessary to remove all those trees i've been told all sorts of things like they're in pots and they'll become pot bound they're growing UNK they might fall down they might UNK mains they block off the er view of the church well i think they're a nice asset in the city centre
this is a city without a lot of parks in its centre only the castle and er not a lot of trees not mature trees so er i need to know that it's necessary to move these trees
all right david do you still think it's necessary to move them
er stuart UNK on i also say that they are removing one tree outside the former horse and groom public house as well
i didn't know that
they are er stuart but they replace replacing by eleven new trees to be planted eight among the UNK area on albert street and three on erm the UNK outside the horse and groom
but are those trees those that the little er the little UNK ones what do they call them engineers trees don't they because they don't take much looking after
yes we were told they're going to be trees like that because they've had a lot of trouble with pigeons UNK in the erm the mature trees and it's impossible for people to sit on the benches underneath cos of er pigeon mess
well if
coming on
yeah do stuart
pigeons
the pigeons are of cause er a cause of debate in the city centre some people like pigeons some don't some say there are far too many pigeons
and it's a bit of a nonsense to say that pigeons UNK in trees you may see an odd pigeon sort of settle in a tree but not for long
pigeons are derived from the rock UNK and which UNK and UNK in cliff side and buildings are the nearest thing so i the pigeons aren't really an argument and you do if you want proper birds in the city centre such as UNK and UNK and even UNK you need real trees to encourage them and the these trees are fairly mature and helpful
if you want to come in on any of this three four three four three four you can call now
mary's on from UNK hello mary
hello geoff
what have you got to say then you want to talk to david poole
yes i do well firstly i do believe the statue should go
why
erm i just don't like it i think it's horrible
mhm is that the same for everything else around the city that you don't like you're quite happy to just knock it down would you and take it away somewhere else
no just that one
just the statue okay what about the trees around there
the trees we should fight like mad to save them
mhm cos they've been there for ages haven't they mary don't you think
yeah and we need more green in the city not less
and do and do you think erm do you think it's justified to take the trees down because you're going to put up some new little ones in their place
no definitely not
and do you care if the pigeons sit in the trees
no
no all right
they don't sit in trees anyway
no tell me what er tell me what you want to say to councillor poole
the other thing is it's a question to councillor poole i mean why should the people of nottingham give any credibility to anything said by someone who is quoted in the daily sport of all newspapers as saying and i quote surely the county council could UNK something more in keeping with the UNK heritage like a little old lady in a UNK
now as far as i'm concerned and many people this remark is UNK and sexist and really what has it got to do with nottingham heritage
all right david is that what
i've no just a
okay carry on
albert ball or william UNK or if he really wants a statue of a lady why not maid UNK in a lace UNK
all right then david poole did you say that really
i said that we ought to er somebody asked me er from one of the national papers which ought to be put in place there and i did suggest that we ought to have a statue like just been mentioned to somebody from beeston they've got a nice man on a bench there
i suggested putting an old lady sitting on a bench with a lace UNK erm er UNK of so that it represents er nottingham lace and etcetera and i said it would look more attractive and catch people's eye than what's there at the present
so it was it was the lace that you wanted UNK rather than a
yes
little old lady on a bench
that's it
oh i see mary is that any better
er no
oh no okay
no certainly not it's not i mean a little old lady yes the lace has something to do with nottingham nottingham's heritage we all know that
a little old lady has not
maid UNK has in lace
so perhaps maid UNK with some lace on
certainly
i knew i knew you'd be happy
well mary we'll wait and see thanks for calling on
er UNK on from carlton hello dorothy
hello
hello
what have you got to say about it all dorothy
well firstly i don't like the tree the leaf and i honestly think that it should be place as a permanent position in the foyer of county hall as a permanent reminder to all councillors on the waste of public tax UNK money
wouldn't it be a greater waste of money though now having got the thing there though to shift it out the way completely dorothy
well it's better than going in the river like you suggested yesterday where it's hidden and forgotten permanent reminder
well i'll tell you tell you who suggested that yesterday now let me have a look it was one of the councillors wasn't it said UNK it in the bottom of the UNK lake it was er conservative councillor charles clarke who said the only suitable place for that daft leaf is in the middle of the UNK lake
but he says again that we shouldn't move the trees simply for something which is meant to fit in nature doesn't always fit in
what do you think dorothy should the trees go as well
i think life of trees is very precious and should remain precious
so we keep the trees there
we keep the trees erm they're on about the trees are mature well my suggestion is there's a lot of councillors that are very mature and really they could do far better getting eleven UNK new younger councillors to make these decisions on behalf of all the public tax payers in nottingham
so er you'd like to UNK the councillors as well would you
well i think the public ought to have more interests in these things that are happening in nottingham
mm well we're inviting people to call
really important
people to call now three four three four three four if you want to come in on this
erm mrs UNK from hucknall thinks that er that leaf stem thing ought to be off in a garden somewhere
er councillor poole it seems that nobody wants to shift the trees
that's correct yes and i don't blame them and er if stuart UNK thinks the same way we'll certainly er see what we can do about pressing for keeping these trees
i mean myself has mentioned it now in committee but er i was a lone voice you see that's the that's the trouble when you've got fifteen other members and they don't seem to be bothered about trees
what should people do if they want to protest about it further david
well they could address their letters to myself councillor david poole or councillor stuart UNK to the council house erm the suggestion you know er their the thoughts the thoughts on this what er they could er erm help us in our campaign and also about the leaf stem as well if they want to write to me at the council house suggesting and i mean proper places to where it should go because that's really up to county council but er at least if i had some suggestions we can pass them over to the county council where it could go
but stuart you'd welcome that as well would you people to write to you
yes certainly
a lady has just said one of your earlier callers has just said that council are out of touch well we shouldn't be out of touch and that is this exercise you have two councillors on here from different parties showing a concern for the trees
i'm not so bothered about the leaf stem
what does interest me about the leaf stem she suggested it should be put in the foyer of county hall well when nottingham becomes a unitary UNK unitary authority and county hall is made into an hotel perhaps it would be a bit unfortunate for the visitors to have the leaf stem er when they book in
that's going to be er in the future perhaps or not but er the problem now is er is those trees
let's get er a couple of more people's er opinions on peter's on from west UNK hello peter
yeah hello good morning geoff
you know we we've heard a lot about this leaf UNK structure and what to replace it with but since this is nottingham and this centre of lace why couldn't they put something there like a UNK or something UNK to look like a UNK
my second point is the trees
now i'm an ex gardener i'm a UNK it take roughly about forty years for trees to reach maturity it doesn't say much for our planners if they plan to put those trees there and then now are gonna have them up again it sounds much like change for changes sake and that it basically my comment
why can't they plan for a longer term for those trees
you know as a gardener then about these er these little trees that they'll be replaced with these little UNK ones
yes
can they grow as big can they grow to look as attractive as these old UNK trees that are there now
no er erm well er there is UNK that's a UNK i mean a cherry that grows up and various ones like that the only trouble is with these type of things they can be more of a nuisance than the trees that you do have now because those trees growing up those UNK ones as you put it erm some UNK call them or whatever name they use i but the trouble is bits die in the centre of those and they tend to drop down and they can be in time more far more of a nuisance than the trees they've got now which seems to me quite suitable
mm well thanks for your thoughts peter UNK what everybody else has said and er thanks for coming on telling us about the new trees as well
stuart that's the point isn't it that they're not going to look as good
well you've only got to go onto UNK row and see those trees there they're like toy town trees
peop they're like they're like UNK that need UNK and people say oh they'll spread out and they'll develop UNK well there're similar sorts of trees on UNK and they've been there about three years they've done nothing in fact they're dying
and er you know there is this attitude that nature it has been said nature is UNK well nature by its very definition is UNK
but you know you see those tr trees outside st UNK square they look good the church looks good UNK behind them in the country they're trees country churches are surrounded by trees and they look better for it they frame buildings
yeah it won't look so good if they put those funny little trees up there
all right barbara is on from UNK
hi barbara
hello geoff
what are your thoughts then
my thoughts the leaf stem should never have been there in the first place it was a waste of money
what do they do with it now then
whatever they like bottom of the river trent if you like but it would be very going off the subject and i've only got a minute or two to spare but what someone pointed out to me that terrible UNK outside the theatre royal UNK and every time i pass i UNK
i've been meaning to write to the post letter page about it for several years
it's an insult to feminism and i'd like to know how much that cost out of the rates
all right yeah well let's erm le let's stick to talking about the leaf stem for now cos we don't want to go on er UNK off every bit of art that's around the city centre do we barbara otherwise
is it art over the royal centre
we'd be here all day
that's not art it's horrible geoff insult to
you don't like that either
insult to UNK it's an ugly UNK
all right then well
i've seen people come up and stop and UNK at it
well er we'll leave that for another day now barbara
do you think do you think about the trees the trees should stay there or what
yes i do yes
and what do you think about this idea of turning it into like a little UNK there for everyone to sit out on do you like that idea
well yes anything like that especially as it should be the shopping area
yeah
yes
if you had if you had some seat there though do you think the seats would be nice under some trees
of course yes i know it encourages the pigeons and they make a mess but anything to UNK the inner city
all right barbara thanks for coming on
thank you geoff
we'll talk about the one by the theatre another day and see what people think about that
er UNK on hello UNK
oh i'm here again
oh right what's up
now then geoff we don't go to nottingham to look at trees we don't go to nottingham to look at the countryside we go to see the shops and spend money
and that er leaf was absolutely UNK
mhm
anybody can spend other people's money and as for that lady saying we want the young people on the council good heavens the young ones would spend it quicker than the old ones
so do you think the trees aren't important then are you not bothered about them
i'm not bothered about them you've got UNK you can go in the countryside and see that you've got trees at well a lot of us have got them outside our own houses
do you not think that i mean the people who were saying keep them there they're saying it adds something to what's in the city centre do you not agree
i'm not er well if they're going to er if they're going to lose their leaves like they are doing now people are UNK on them aren't they
mm maybe the odd one or two will you know UNK
yes well leave the trees where they are but that UNK thing well art today i don't know what they think art is
you liked you like nice holes with flowers and UNK on and things
i like the i like the i like the old the old art we used to have in the UNK days mind you i like everything that's old er that's why i like you geoff cos you're old
yeah well i'm catching you up UNK
er thanks for coming on
well we're going to nottingham to spend money
all right then
bye
tarrah there i think i think we'd better leave it there otherwise we are going to be here all day
er give a final word to david poole
yeah well on what people have said i think that er there's a possibility that er if stuart and myself get together with the officers concerned that we if these trees are UNK and UNK as they they're saying they're over UNK at the moment surely that would cut them down in size and if they're regular UNK every so many years they won't they won't be a nuisance i don't think in future years
all right then er a final word to stuart as well
er yeah thank you yeah the trees really do matter
i mean david's talking about the leaf stem i couldn't care less about the leaf stem i'm with most people i understand that councillor barry UNK offered to look after it in his garden cos he likes it and he's welcome to do that
but er nottingham's er city that's proud of its nature it's not generally realized that there's about a hundred nature reserves in the city of nottingham maintained by the city of the notts wild life trust and er this is great on the UNK but in the city centre there's too little nature in it
there's only the castle grounds that's a park in the city centre you've got to pay a quid to go in there on saturdays and sundays and i think these trees really matter i am concerned and i'm going to ask questions about them and i will talk to david about it as well although the leaf stem he can keep himself
well we've got people on both sides of the political fence agreeing here for one
erm if you want to er to make your voice heard about it then write them letters write letters into your councillors erm and er and let them know what you think or you can write them to me and i'll pass them on
i'll say thanks very much to councillor stuart UNK for coming in our thanks as well to david poole for joining us on the phone thanks david
thanking you
thank you
i'll leave you for now it's radio nottingham it's seventeen minutes to two
i think all we can do after that is er have a frank this is er frank UNK and brazil
there frank UNK that is and er brazil it's radio nottingham fourteen minutes to two bit late with everything today thanks for all your calls on that
erm more calls than we could cope with in the end for and er see what happens to it and keep in touch write to your councillors and let them know what you think or write to me and i'll pass the letters on

the trading standards department of the county council is responsible for legal controls on fireworks
in particular that fireworks comply with the british standard that people register that they are keeping fireworks retailers and UNK so that we can go and inspect the storage conditions er and that people obey the law by not selling fireworks to people under the age of sixteen
that's john nottinghamshire's assistant chief trading standards officer
it's his department's job to make sure the law's being applied when it comes to fireworks
the requirement i is that th when they are stored in the erm shops they're stored in safe conditions
that means they are stored in containers which the public haven't got access to and away from any possibility of er naked flames or any other methods of UNK getting to them
mike is an assistant divisional officer for nottinghamshire fire brigade
he'd like to see everybody going to public bonfires instead of having private ones
in my opinion er and probably a lot of fire UNK opinions as well bonfires in private houses are no longer necessary
but i if while we've got them we will still be there we will still be called to put them out and one of these days we'll be dealing with bonfires when somebody's house is on fire and we need to be there instead
er with the possibility of er well UNK situation developing at that i wouldn't like particularly to talk about
so how do trading standards make sure that people aren't selling fireworks to those under age
we will try and take we will er as usual send young children definitely under the age of sixteen into shops to see if people will sell fireworks to them and if they do then er we will take the appropriate action which may mean criminal proceedings
it's the er the only way we can see of effectively UNK that part of the law
it is important the fireworks don't get into young children's hands because they themselves er will be in danger
mike says that it's surprisingly not just at this time of the year when they have trouble with bonfires that go out of control
right throughout the year we will attend er a number of bonfires every single month
er a quiet month will be one and an say building up to october and november time as many as fifty sixty in that particular period
so far if we take on the ninety two figures we attended something like eight hundred bonfires
UNK measure and in fact to put fires out
er in november of last year we actually attended fifty five bonfires that got out of hand
if we hadn't have put them out then serious injury and damage could have been done to property
there are statistics kept on accidents by er central government which all hospitals are asked to put to but you've got to realize that these are only people who have attended hospital
most accidents in the last year occurred at private or er family parties as opposed to larger displays
there were nearly twice as many accidents at private parties as there were UNK er public displays
but then there are street accidents which usually mean people UNK fireworks in the street which in itself is an offence enforced by the police
the highest type of firework last year if it was specified was the UNK remarkably enough and we would make this point very seriously that parents tend to give children UNK very small children UNK and they must remember tha that these things are fireworks they are dangerous they do get red hot er they must UNK them at all times when they give them UNK cos they may wave them around they may se set somebody else's clothing on fire with them they may get the UNK in their eyes if they get too close to them er and one particular danger of course is that they may get hold of en the hot end when the firework has finally UNK and they think it's all finished with
and that is very hot and will give some nasty burns to people's hands
the business about UNK erm it is one of those things where the very young children like to hold a UNK but it has got to be done under proper UNK conditions
you are playing with a fire the temperature at the tip when it's burning is approaching about a thousand degrees UNK
and that is awfully hot it's enough to bend steel and you can the effects of that on the UNK after it's burnt away
and there we are putting it into a three or four year UNK hand something that's erm got that sort of temperature round it
trading standards on nottinghamshire's big bang so a week of fireworks chunk four of that on tomorrow
it's er dennis next with afternoon special i'll see you tonight at the star inn on middle street in beeston at eight o'clock for drinking partners if you want to come along and watch there
it's the county's favourite radio station b c radio nottingham the time UNK two o'clock

the proposed closure has been confirmed twenty four hours after british coal announced the pit was to go into the review procedure and it was revealed that it had lost more than six million pounds in the last six months
union leaders at the pit say they'll challenge the closure by taking legal action
nottinghamshire police have revealed released a recording of a girl they believe called the UNK hospital in UNK in ashfield claiming she'd had a baby
they think it's the same UNK who's made at least a dozen calls to the police and a hospital in lincolnshire since reporting the birth at the weekend
nigel bell reports
i was the one that killed it and i didn't
he was the one that got me pregnant
this is the voice of the girl who sometimes uses the name UNK and sometimes linda
she says she's fourteen and that the father of her child is her own dad
acting detective superintendent mick UNK says they realize the girl could be in danger but believe it's necessary to UNK the recording
this has been talked through but with both the social services and the er hospital and er we decided to take that chance
they've checked schools and housing estates in the mansfield area but say they've no leads
half a dozen officers are investigating the case but police forces across the east midlands are on standby
mick UNK is urging anyone who recognizes this voice to contact the police
there's a free phone number o eight hundred six two six nine
and every time i've run away from home and then every time you lot have took me back home and then i end up getting pregnant

on to the weather forecast now for nottinghamshire
many area
when you're ready what would be what things will we shall we start with
well erm sort of how you how you became involved in the erm in the strike
in the strike are we starting off with this stuff
yes
not now
yes now
oh
well we started off and we were working for
and we and then we had been working for him for about ten or eleven years on this contract that he had for us
and erm his son came along to take over from him
and he put a new table in the mill
and erm being as he put a new table in the mill he thought we could work for thirty pound a week less on this table
and we could produce more slate on erm thirty pound a week less in wages
well none of the lads were prepared to take that on cos we'd been on this contract with for the last eleven years
and was quite happy and all the workers was happy until this son came along
and that's what's got us fixed in all this trouble
you said that you'd worked erm quite happily for er t
oh yeah everybody was happy
yeah
aha
can you give me some idea of erm h how you started up with him in the first place
well he bought this slate quarry to scrap it
i believe he er didn't give much for the quarry
but somebody put him on there was slate to be had only a if you had a machine to clear
and he started clearing to get this slate and he got at the slate quite quick
but we were working for him then for fourteen pound a week
and make preparing the mill ready for the slate
to ma make putting fixing new tables in and that
and erm anyway we got more from the unemployment exchange that prepared to work for him for fourteen pound when we could have a eighteen pound on the dole
four pound a week more on the dole cos we were having elected earnings and tax UNK on the dole and it and it made it up to eighteen pound
and we were working for fourteen pound at that time
i UNK erm at that time was there a lot of men who had work in the quarries
well
on the dole
well everybody that was working for him had always worked in the quarries all their life and they er they just been working for the UNK company before the quarry shut down
and that's the time they were put off work when the quarry of the why the quarry shut it they had too much expense on the electricity to pump the water from this from the mine
that's why er the quarry shut
or the quarry would have carried on with this slate mine
how many p people d di did he take on at that time then when he first took over
there was about six to start with
how did he select them
well he knew they were all slate quarry workers and that's how he went on to them
he knew they were all slate quarry workers and they were prepared to work the slate again
every one of them
were they were they men who had erm a l lot of expertise in the slate
yes all their lives you know they'd worked
we've all worked in these slate mines since we left school
i left school before the war when i was fourteen we all went in the slates
cos everybody was working in the slate then
hundreds of men working in the slates
my fathers and UNK all worked in the slate they seen nothing only slate
and when the war broke out of course everybody left the mines
cos there was more money else where
we were working for my father was er earning one pound sixteen shillings a week before the war
when the war broke out that made a world of difference for everybody
the wages stepped up
i went into erm UNK you know be we were having working seven days a week and we were having seven pound a week
a pound a day and we were UNK weren't we
aye UNK
only because the war broke out
yes
and then from there in nineteen forty three i was called up
and was going back to twelve and six a week after to the forces
and i wasn't long in this country they shoved me over UNK on the landing in UNK
and all i got for that was a couple of tin UNK uh aye dear aye
when you er when started up again opened up the quarry
yeah
can you tell me all the sort of work that you were al er engaged in
well to prepare the mill we were erm UNK and or doing knocking all the old tables down and preparing get the er big saw table in you know to diamond saw table in to cut the slate up
erm or any other little UNK lift there which the quarry belonged then
and was on to us he only had four thousand five hundred that's all the money he had that's all i've got four thousand five hundred
and believe me in a couple of weeks after we got the slate for him
we had a new UNK lift we had tools UNK everything was coming in
there must be money in slate
and in no time after that built a massive big bungalow for himself
he had a brand new UNK
every money was coming in everywhere
from a poor man he didn't half step up
aye in no time cos there must be money in slate aye
mm
yes he stepped up right UNK me
and then his son they had a UNK each and he's built a new bungalow now in they've all got massive big places it's fantastic the money they made out of it
and this is what they ga done with the lads in the end
just shoved them off put them on the dole and there was some young lads that i wasn't worried myself cos i i'm in my sixties but there was lads there with mortgages and kids
he didn't think of them either eh
there's lads of real trouble there but there was lads you know young lads with kids and mortgages and we had er he i'm sixty all your worries are over aren't they
but there are young lads there
what he didn't worry about them either he didn't care who went just that he we he had his own way
w when you were starting off UNK when you were starting off with erm was there any sense in that you were all including him involved in a joint enterprise to g get the quarry really being profitable
well what he said to us if i go up we go up together he said
if i make money i i'll make you i can pay you as well if i go up i mean if i go down he said i can go up or down as well he said
that's what he said and he kept on saying he had only four thousand five hundred pounds or something that's all the money he had he was on about that all the time
but he didn't half make money cos he had nothing before that
he had that coal business but no money he had no money there
but that slate quarry put him on his feet all right
w why do you think his approach t to the UNK of slate was successful
where as the previous owners had erm had great problems with f UNK flooding
well he worked the slates from outside you know
they were all slate there the old new there was slate there but they weren't prepared to get the machines to clear it at it
where as he bought these machines and cleared up the rubbish to get at the slate
cos the lads knew where the slates was and it wasn't far from the surface
there was plenty of slate there but he just slate mines wouldn't pay t to get these machines and course this grant story this had you know millions of pounds of grants for these machines and that
we know he had fantastic grants we know how much he had you know when we went on this strike
we got to know all the money he had from these grants to get all these machines and all these
every penny he was paying he was having grant for it from the government aye
where you UNK a aware of that you were in a b business that was UNK when you were working for him
oh yes we everybody knew of that of the slate we were making you know cos erm we were making about two thousand UNK a day
what
in twenty four UNK and twenty t twenty two hours an this fantastic you know the slate cos it was good slate there
and there's no contract to start with the first year or two there was no contract at all
and we had terrible job getting a contract off him
he wouldn't give a contract and he wanted us to work like on the make plenty of slate but he wouldn't you know he wasn't prepared thee to pay
but we did manage to get the contract from him after
but he wasn't prepared to give a contract to start with
out of all the slate mines of all the years that has gone i've always worked on a contract
that's been the bo the system of these slate mines
there was used t the work in the old days there was used to be two underground and two in the mill they used to be partners
the lads underground used to send the blocks up and the lads in the mill used to make produce the slates out of them and they were all partners these four
and there was hundreds of contracts like that in the quarry everybody was on their own for t thing you know
not one big contract but everybody on their own little contracts
four men in each contract that's how they were
that's how they carried it out in the old days in every quarry
but in this quarry now in when we were working for everybody was on the same bonus you know they was they were all partners
everybody in the erm in the er on the slate face and everybody in the mill were partners everybody
get the same wages not like the old days then they were all individual partners then in four you know in each partner work working
when you came to get your contract with er te and you were all in the same c contract was that because you got together as a union or whether you got t together as the worker
oh we were all together and the union was behind us you know the union was with us
even in that early day
oh yes we had the union with us all the time from the start you know
everybody paid the union then aye everybody was a union man there
but erm you know when we were on the strike if these lads wouldn't have gone back there was couple of scabs went back into the quarry
it's them that made it worse for the others if everybody had a stayed up together and stayed out we everybody had the same troubles money trouble
cos there was youngsters there who that stayed out with us they had mortgages
and these scabs that went back well they're the ones that let us down
st
d do you think you would have succeeded
oh yes if everybody would have stayed out they would never had a scrap of slate made there everybody would have stayed out and stayed out till the end and not a scrap of slate would have been made there
but these scabs went back and made slates and there was erm two officials there they they'd never made slate when we were working up there
but when we went on strike they started making slate so in a way they were scabs too in these two officials not touched a slate if they were er not making slate before why should they make slate when we were on strike
d did they know how to s how to make slate
oh yeah well they weren't good UNK as the you know but they did produce slate there but they didn't they weren't good UNK the just that well they make slate but
if they wouldn't have made a scrap of slate it would have a world of difference to this strike
not a scrap of slate would have been made there and he would have had to do something with us then
but these scabs went back and that's what really ruined this strike
had you any had you any clue at all that they were going to go back
well yes we had you could see on some of them they didn't want much to turn them on you know there was two or three there and they took some others with them of course then didn't they you know
if you get one or two that prepared to go the others w drop one by one back then wou that's how they went
but there was two or three there when the strike started you couldn't trust them they were scabs from the start
they weren't prepared to stay out
where they men who had been quarry men
well no they weren't really they weren't they hadn't worked in the quarry like us
they only did they were new to the quarry really
but they were on this bonus system you know they were you know on the bonus but they weren't quarry men
they UNK they ne hadn't been working in a quarry all that long
what sort of work had they erm been engaged in
well driving and for erm you know he had plant hire he'd been driving for him and that
that's what they had been doing before
they hadn't been working on the slate face they hadn't worked any slate but they were doing all right on the tables you know on the UNK the slate up for the others
and then you had a couple of scabs they were UNK this is one or two of them they went back
and so with the help of these they just managed to do a bit of slate but if them had not gone back i thinks this strike would have turned the other way
stop 'em having any slate at all that's what we wanted to do
you stop 'em from any s scrap of slate e
c can you gi give me some clue now a about w when the penny began to drop that trouble was going to g going to start
well no when we started when the strike started in the mill i told then you know y i don't know what you are going to do with us i said but the way you are carrying on now you are going to bring trouble into this quarry cos these lads aren't going to give in to you at all that quick what you're trying to do make them work for thirty pound a week less so you better think it over now i said before it gets any worse
but he wasn't prepared to do that he just he wasn't worried about us
he'd put his mind to it that he wouldn't you know this he had it in mind that we were going to work for this thirty pound a week less take it or leave it
he wasn't prepared to do anything else
wasn't prepared to let us go on now that same wages as before
how did i it come about that y you were placed in the situation that you were going to get thirty pounds a week less
well he s all he made a little contract out himself you know that's what he did after he he'd put these new tables in the mill
he made a contract then out for us
and we worked on this contract for two month to try it out for him but we were thirty pound a week less and we had over two hundred slates a day more on the on this contract
t we were thirty pound a week less
but nobody was prepared for it to take it and that's how it was
what w was it about th the new tables that produced the situation
well these tables he bought well i hadn't seen tables like that before he bought them in italy somewhere
and they were UNK these slates in into blocks you know UNK them square like into the size of the slate they were quite handy
but the time involved to saw them was too much
the other table what we had before was better was no much so much time involved by the time you'd screw them round and turn 'em to saw them into blocks there was a lot of time involved in it
cos we're UNK a lot on 'em
but they were handy when you had them UNK cos they were quicker for the slate i said to er UNK they were quicker then to split 'em up
but we found we were UNK a lot of stuff up was no good for the slate making you know it it's got to be good for slate making a lot of veins and lots of muck in 'em
but the tables were good then but erm too much time involved in them in UNK with in them
that's what i found out
w where they w once when they'd been installed or was it thought that it a mistake had been made in obviously a lot of cash had been spent on them but erm was it considered a mis a waste of money or
well it was a waste well i'll tell you what it was really he saw a lot of waste on the other tables going on the tip you know there was a lot of waste going over
well these tables were doing away with a lot of waste
getting more slates not so much waste out of them cos these tables were UNK er them into blocks
there was no what we call ends on the slate you know going over the tip there was not so much waste with them there as the new tables
why is it that this machine c could trim it on all sides
yeah we used to trim 'em with a hammer and UNK before
yeah
and there was a lot of waste but these new tables did bring that it was something for the company it was more than anything you know cos we were on the bonus system
slate we wanted to produce we want you know if there a lot a bit of waste going over the tip we weren't so much worried UNK the waste cos we was on the bonus we were making the slates and that
but he was worried more about the waste then ours contract that's what he was cos there was a lot of waste on the old tables and they make a bit more waste than on these new tables there
ha how did it come about that you were on you were on one side very firmly and the employers were on the other side very firmly and sides had been had been drawn up
well i don't think and nobody will turn this you know this he nobody would he'd put his mind to something and there is nobody on earth that could turn him
nobody on earth could turn him to do er to er change his mind
and behind him again there was his son in law you know that only he's worse than
then the one that runs the quarry to us he's well he's worse only he was behind it in a way he had he was the one with the brains he was the one that new how to get the men to work for nothing
he was behind ee he had the brains and was carrying it out for him cos erm this erm i dunno if you know him eh he runs this quarry to us up here
oh he's terrible there he even had them he had young girls working for him up there and they found out they were paying he was paying them too little and then he got caught up with 'em and erm what he done after he charged for taking them up there in the morning and charged 'em for taking them down in the evening with a land rover
so he had them both ways didn't he
he's a terrible man that one
aye but he was behind the this cos they're all in the in the same boat you know they're all families family affair isn't it
but they say the old man didn't have anything to do with it but i dunno he could have had something to do with it i dunno
i dunno there
can you give some idea of how it came about that you in fact decided strike
when we started well we were in trouble in york when we at then we were going on the go slow system you know we didn't produce much slate we were on the go work to rule
we let this carry that out for a month or so and he was very annoyed about it
and then erm the lads in both they had decided they were gonna go on the go slow but they were told if you go on the on the go slow system you're gonna go home he said i'm not prepared to carry on with that he said the manager there that's brother that is
when a they were sent home from we went home from this quarry then and the everybody went home so the were forty of us in altogether
everybody went home an we were all on picket line after
have you got any idea of w what they thought then of the fact that you were all acting the three quarries were acting as erm one body
well we were all union members and everybody wanted to be together if you are if you are in the union well we had to stuck together an the more we stayed together the stronger we are to keep out if we can stay out
that's what we always thinking of ain't it
and it was last august last august bank holiday this was started just before the bank holiday weekend when i cos we were all on that gates bank holiday weeks stopping all the traffic going in there UNK that's how the know is maybe if we'd a gone back then and yo you know if he offered us to go back then about september
yeah to go back to work on this thursday but we didn't go an all we should have gone then
and tried to get some settlement but i don't believe it are giving us any settlement cos he wasn't prepared to do anything like that
and i know he had you know he was UNK he wouldn't give in nobody would he give in to nobody then
he was stupid UNK that's what he was
when you first erm when you first came out on strike
did you have any idea how long you would be out
well everybody thought we'd be out for a week or so but we were out for a month or er more when these scabs started going back
well i knew then it was gonna finish off you know
if more would have gone back then the strike would have come to an end quicker cos i thought more would have gone back then but all the lads in they stayed out and nobody went in to work
when the others went back to work how did you manage to stop anyone else from going back to work
well all th all these lads that have gone back they were having a hell of a life in the town of course
if they went for a drink everybody was calling them scabs and if they went anywhere then some had their cars UNK with paint and oh they had everything done they were all against them
and the still now
the they were scabs then and the scabs now and they'll always be scabs all their lives now
they will be called scabs wherever they go
er even e even n now they are marked men yes
yes they'd like if they were in south wales in south wales you know if your grandfather was a UNK you'd be a UNK wouldn't you they carry it out in generations there
and i believe in this it's brought a lot of thing in this town there small town like this
cos these lads now that have gone back and they were scabs then and they'll scabs they will be all their lives now
everybody will be looking at them as scabs wherever they go
no matter what they do they'll always be scabs
no and as for and i dunno
i suppose they've shot better men than 'em aye
yes
could be
i couldn't have shot any worse i don't think so i don't know what'll happen
well i'm not worried cos i'm over sixty there but these lads i'm worried about these lads that have mortgages and children to rear up they had lots of worries and they still have
but these quarry owners they're not worried about them
they just worried about themselves
mm is it rather on the ye yo you said earlier on that er the old s system of striking UNK was on a individual basis
yes
on a team of or a contract of four men
so there's obviously a tradition of people of the quarry men and the quarry owners talking to each other
yeah
was the fact that there was no talking going on completely surprising from the point of view of the tradition of bargaining
yeah well in the old days you know everybody was in the union
you couldn't work in the quarry you couldn't go through the gate in the quarry without being a union man in the old days there
and there was this system of four men in a bargain nobody knew the other man's wages we were all on different wage everybody was on a different wage
and if you were well in with the staff and the owners of the quarry you'd have more bonus
they'd fix you up with er better bonus but if you were a black leg they'd er be on less UNK
that's what is was it was a terrible system there but that was the system that was the system they carried through the quarries in all the years that are gone
it is contract it's a monthly contract you work for three weeks for one pound sixteen shillings and at the end of the month they count all the slates you've done during the month
and you get this little bonus at the end of the month maybe a couple of quid on top of your one pound sixteen shillings
that's what they were doing and then if you made too much slate this month the following month they'd drop your bonus down so as to see as to keep you on the same level so you couldn't go any higher if you if you had good slate and worked your UNK out
and the following month they drop you that's how they used to do it
was there any sense that er you were in fact being put in the same position as your parents had been your grandparents had been in the sense not being able to get above a certain level by having your wages your bonus cut
well they i tell you this they we'd worked for him for er good many years and there was no talk of any cuts in wages we had this wages all through the through these years and everybody was happy with it
everybody were working on it and everybody was working a g a g a good days work and hard cos slate quarry work has always been hard anyway
but everybody was happy there and er till this came along he's the one that wanted us to work for less
when he came along how could you see things had changed or how could you see in the process of changing
well straight away the first thing he done was to put these new tables in and that was his idea when he put these tables in to get more slate and less wages
i dunno whether he thought his father paid us too much i dunno but erm that's what he had in mind to start with was drop the wages down thirty pound a week
for everybody
was there any alteration in the style of management at all
no not a thing jus we were all working just on the same everybody was working fr real hard but erm
he had that in mind all the time to cut the wages down that's what they wanted to do
that's what he wanted to do to from the start cut the wages down and make more slate that's what he had in mind
he wasn't prepared to do anything else there no ar and he was he was to have these plant hire you know these two when his old man used to work us in the quarry well this was working up there as well he had lads working on the plant hire for him
he had about a dozen lorries on the road and machines er working the roads there all they were working for nothing for him these lads and he'd come along and before christmas he'd stop a couple of them just before christmas he used to do that every year
stop 'em just before christmas he used to stop 'em
and my son in law he was working with him and when he had that accident well it's ridiculous what he done that day
when he reversed that UNK over the tip
eleven o'clock in the morning and lost his leg
and he held the wages of the afternoon of him
no i'd r i thought that was really terrible there
stopping a man's afternoon wages after he lost a leg
er it was and he was only paying him twenty two pound a week at the time
was that considered a hard thing at the time
very hard very hard i told the lads i told 'em the union about it what he done that day
must be terrible man to do a thing like that eh
and you know is after an accident like that well we never the old slate quarry company wouldn't do that they'd pay the day off in one a serious accident like that
but that holding the afternoon off him after UNK a leg i think that was really terrible aye
when it became obvious that the strike wasn't going to last a fortnight or it wasn't going to last a month
how did you organize yourselves to stay together
well we had a meeting every week a union meeting every week
and we had the fantastic help in from south wales most UNK terribly good er people were terribly good to us in organizing er different things
many supported us and the present the people
fantastic i never thought of anything like it the money was coming in everywhere
they really did help us aye
w what sort of er p people or organize or organizations where helping you then
well union you know the union in the coal mines and all different well er everywhere in the north wales here to UNK well every union was helping us with them
organizations and er money coming in everywhere and food parcels
they were helping everybody
i never thought of anything like that i couldn't believe it
really fantastic and there's still money in the fund now for after it
there was money coming in from overseas germany belgium holland there wa everywhere helping us
aye
w were you as erm a large were you organized in any way in UNK d er to c con t UNK the strike le length of time
well we could a continued it for erm well i dunno but erm it was getting a bit out of hand with the picket line really cos there was a lot of these youngsters who weren't prepared to do these picket line
you know they were coming there this week and they wouldn't come there for three or four weeks or something thinking with this picket but it was very important to keep that gate stop everybody from going in there
but there was a lo lots of these youngsters who wouldn't prepared to do this picket business
as they got fed up with it i suppose i dunno er
but there was no point in carrying it on really you know it
if we'd a carried it on for say this time of the year now you with this erm UNK holiday now we'd have had to do it seven days a week cos you'd have to be there saturday and sunday to stop anything going in there
but they weren't prepared to do it were they
you know these youngsters they weren't prepared to stay on that gate
w was the encouragement then for the picket from the older men
well we c couldn't we had a lot of arguments about it you know in the union meetings about this picket line
but we couldn't make anybody do it you know they'd say anyway that we'll do it there's next week they wouldn't catch you up some of them
so er well we couldn't carry it out cos the ones who weren't prepared to do the picket wasn't erm going to do it we'd have to do more of 'em to keep these youngsters on doing the picket you know
where they then a group of people who to whom the burden of being on p per picket falling more and more
yes that's how that's how it was yes all i was on that gate i'd been on that gate myself dozens of times
on my own there i wasn't worried about it er you know
but if one i man does the picket and the others don't well it's gonna not gonna go show are they
that's what the company wanted us you know to break up on it
they wanted us if everybody would have gone with me too the picket
that's what these slate quarry owners wanted us for us to fall back
the strike would have fall apart then
that's how it was it had fallen apart with er without
everybody was standing they was gonna go out
that's why all these UNK have a different in it
you know these self worth they're so terrible keen aren't they
when you began to make all sort of when c contacts began to be made between erm you and south wales in terms of support
yeah
d did you get any sort of erm apart from financial support and material support did you get any moral support of how a strike should be con conducted
oh yes they were they were telling us not to pack up there that keep the g gate going and you know they were keep it going and they they'd er help us
for years to come because if they stay out they give us hundred percent help to carry on with it
but erm i dunno there's some of them weren't prepared to carry on with it you know these youngsters there was a lot of 'em they wouldn't anyway everybody's not hundred percent you're not going to get anywhere with anything
you f UNK the fact of erm s solidarity fr from want of a better word
yeah
erm was it in your opinion because the young men had a lot of financial pressures
that they weren't as s solid as the older men let's say or was it because they hadn't
no they hadn't a no they started alright on that picket but as time rolled on and they was getting erm fed up with it you know they that's how it went as they were getting oh i we won't go up there today bugger it
and that's how it happened and you know some weren't prepared to s stay there on the gate an watch that nobody don't go in it er
when you were in when you were discussing these things in the l lodge meeting erm d did the younger men sort of indicate how they felt towards the picket
oh aye know these youngsters today they not er not the same as when we were young i don't think
they don't seem to worry about anything a lot of these youngsters today
you know if you're out on strike you're out on strike and must make it hundred percent that's how it is
cos if you do anything you doing you must do it go at it the right way and stick to it ain't it
but a lot of these youngsters er you know
there was a few in the lads they were just didn't want to do this picket line
and they were letting the burden on the others weren't they to do it
and there was lots of the we came to an end and if we were going to carry on with this further we the everybody was getting a bit fed up with it
we were all getting fed up with it cos having to stay on the gate five hours a day you know three or four times a week
was really poor there but i dunno if we'd er stayed there or and carried on with it
was the er erm attention of the press the television the radio the support of the local m p er m ministers in the town university students and all the other organizations was that in any way a help
oh yes it was a help the students give us a fantastic help you know in financially and the came on that gate a lots of times with us
they were on that gate with us very often in the mornings and that
and er the m p
on this he was up there with us he was hundred percent too with us
oh yes we had fantastic support out of them aye fantastic
everybody was p hundred percent everybody
but it was the scabs er that well they put us down to start with and then the was picket line started UNK up was the these lads not prepared to do it
that how it went out of hand in the end in it
and everybody was getting a bit bored with it cos as it dragged on this is s seven months when you know a long time to be i never thought it would have gone this as long as that when we started off with it
where you erm aware at all that people were having serious financial problems
there's quite a few there with had fantastic trouble with their finances you know
cos the mortgages and that but there's a lot of them and kids causing it and christmas was coming well you know we just that's when they helped us at christmas was really fantastic yes true i never thought anything really out of this world how the how the people helped we got toys and everything for the kids' christmas everything you could think of
nobody or kids were short of a thing cos erm people from everywhere were sending things
and everybody had a t a twelve pound turkey each
aye everything was gi really fantastic the people that helped the people that gave to the strike out of this world i know the help they had was really fantastic
you e mentioned earlier on that people received er food parcels
yes
ha how was this organized
well the erm the girls were doing all the wives were doing all the food parcels every week
they were going up to the we call it
and they were organizing food parcels for every UNK
and delivering them around on a friday night and saturday morning
and it's a really good parcel th they thought of everything they had everything in the in the food parcel very good
what sort of things would
oh
you know sort of
had erm eggs butter tea everything you could you needed was in there and tins of all different kind of soup and were apples oranges everything was in there in the parcel
really good parcel every week they were having
would
yes i think that probably this had been er very wise in this er in so i'm not saying that they've helped us or anything but they've kept the middle of the line and erm in the beginning when things were beginning to whatsit er the inspector sent two policemen down here and asked me would i ask the lads not to do any damage to property and all this and that and said right there's a lodge tonight and i shall ask them i shall tell them to do that
and er why he sent for me because i'm not a shop steward or anything
but as i said before probably it's the white hair that er that does it
so what they had done it had a big UNK there and it had got on it er the world's largest slate mine and perhaps you've seen it yourself they've rubbed the t off and they put v and somebody's done a very good job of it er in the same paint and everything
so tourists have been stopping even to take photo of that the largest UNK in the world
i mean that's not the right description of it but er anyway
now will brought down an old van er which was scrap it was quite a good body i mean and he painted on it we're still open er something like despite transport and general workers' union UNK we are fully open and he UNK this van with no wheels on it just the body right th in the entrance of th on his own ground naturally er right in front of the UNK which was like you know UNK
naturally he wanted to keep his place open and when he got up the next morning somebody had painted the side of the van completely over
so and smashed all the windows and everything in it erm so what's that and as i say it was only a scrap van er and now he'd bought the little chapel on the corner
er there were lots of er little UNK broken before but er whether our lads were having a bit of a pot shot
i mean when you're on picket line it's very depressing it's very heart breaking unless you get some UNK or something you know it gets er y you don't know what to do with yourself and perhaps they'd been taking pots of this paint i'm not saying
so i asked them in the lodge like don't do any damage and tom was in e he gave them a good lecture so and the lads in the lodge said well look you tell them as well not to do this attitude and perhaps you've seen it on these UNK when they saw a crowd that was there they were changing gear with the land rover and through you know like anybody in the way you'd be underneath
so i said fair enough
well the next morning i was up at the top gate on picket and erm came with his van and he UNK up through and the lads jumped one side well i'm nearly sixty five i didn't jump so quickly
and i don't i don't think i tried jumping
and i think he meant and i say this quite fair now i think he meant to come straight up to me and brake suddenly to frighten me
but he missed his trick and he came a little bit too far and he knocked me over and i was underneath the front of the van
well naturally i was i was UNK wild when i got up and that's well the lads i thought they were going to turn the van over tell you the truth
and course he'd frightened himself and er i counted up to about eight nine and ten i said to him look when you go inside that bloody gate now i said go straight into the office sit down and think for a minute where the hell are we all going to in this carry on
and i don't where i got i gave him quite a good sermon which i thought was y know quite erm to try and help the situation and he said i'd give them er my conditions
i said while you adopt them that you'd give them your conditions we're getting nowhere
and i said you sit quietly and think and we shall do the same
and erm he was still at them and then that he was in the right
and said UNK well UNK you'd b UNK about it i said we can't never be solve it
anyway in the end he went in and erm the next thing the inspector came up and er he called me and the union chap into his car and er he said we got a mark i said yeah well i had a little UNK across me knee
so he said erm do you want to press charges
i i's thinking well this long would make the UNK situation worse and we're trying to resolve it
i said no i don't
and he only had to wait a couple of erm points left on his licence so if i'd taken the dangerous thriving or something he could have lost his licence but erm that's besides the point
at the moment i thought no the best thing was to forget it and that's what we did
and i'm not sorry that i did that because erm i wouldn't like i wouldn't have like to think that er anything i'd done had UNK the situation you know
and erm then the inspector then found out if this UNK works is going to carry on charging through these men
and as i say we did the mass picket down in inspector was coming straight up t an the sergeant to y you know what's like to leading er people and he said now what's the what you going to do what's what you want this morning
and we used to say well we want to stop the land rover
right there'll be no punch ups no nothing just one person to speak er to the driver or whoever he wants to speak to
yes right
well in that case and they'd been stopping them for us you see and er excuse me stopping them for us and whoever decided to speak to them has had his few words and that's it carry on
well the other morning we were there and everything was quite in order what the police were afraid that somebody was going to get hurt
and when we were getting people from outside coming there and some of them quite UNK they were going to sit and lay across the road
naturally police didn't want that
so we thought no if we can stop them to speak to them cos at the end of the day we can't actually stop them going up we can give them as much harassment as we can yes er and keep within the law
well as i say the police stopped them the other morning and one of the lads had a chat with the driver and all this and he carried on
well after they went round the corner one of these erm well stupid young lads in the back er lifted his two fingers on the UNK
but you see the sergeant saw him
and the first thing he said oh who's that bloke
and he got his name and he was up in the quarry during the morning and he's giving him his final warning that if he does that again he'll book him
because he's really UNK the situation
and the same person this young lad i know he young stupid but erm i mean er i've had many a black eye for er speaking instead of listening but er h perhaps he'll be learnt the same way
erm he goes round the pubs and he UNK on these lads
the lads that are on strike well i mean you'd think it'd be vice versa him being like a UNK er that's er they'd be UNK but he's vice versa
i don't know if he's looking for trouble and of course that er would undermine er what public er relations and everything and we don't want that
but erm unless he UNK his way you know i can see it coming off
but erm i think the police realize as well that he is a bit of an UNK and he's not to strike that's wrong
yeah
has there been any sort conflict open to in the in the town at all
i think there've been one or two not er brush ups you know in the pubs once er or twice they er they won't drink with them and that and er some of the lads some of the lads that have gone back have really realized the situation they've put themselves in you know and they sorry and now they're on they don't know which way to turn
i mean i feel sorry for them erm they've put themselves in a position UNK forever more or less
one lad went back because his father went back
they did work in er two worked in two different quarries but within a week or a fortnight that young lad approached one of our members and said he's sorry that he'd ever gone back and i said to him well come back and join us and forget it all
and he's back in the lodge he's on less money but he's much happier so
he's out
he's out yes and there are two or three in which have erm you know they're sorry that they've gone back and er we feel sorry sort of for them that they've dropped into and a lot of our young lads have got mortgages and all that but there are some gone back er they need not people erm they'd finished UNK their families and everything
and erm if they could have given us a proper explanation why they'd gone back and prove us wrong them fair enough
but i think they'd just gone back for the money creed and once you get that well erm they don't realize that they could be falling into the trap unless we blokes stand firm now to maintain this standard of living
well their standard of living will come down
right they're getting everything they want at the moment because erm er ease the situation
but i mean once this strike is over unless we come to proper agreement erm they know then that then it will be too late then cos there's somebody saying then they came for the jews first was it
i wasn't a UNK so i didn't bother
and then they came for the communists i wasn't a communist so i didn't bother
and if i remember they came then they came for the trade unionist
i wasn't a trade unionist so i didn't bother
then they came for me and then there was nobody to bother and that was the end of it
and
it works in this situation the same
and erm you know er sometimes i'm sorry that it's come to this because like this family er they made a bomb out of it we're not saying that we're not denying them that at all
we've had a good living out of it but if that same system has brought them on their feet you know and built them nice homes er right they've UNK into company's house now all the dirty water not dirty water all the whatsit has come up how much they've drawn from these quarries
i mean used to say quite often erm er i'd flat i'd erm show my pay packet against UNK any day if we had a good week
we were much better off than him
well yes because he had a UNK which er with UNK number plates which the company buys him
the company runs for him
you know it's come out of the tax situation he's built himself a er massive big house or put an extension on it
the extension is bigger than the original house
we're not saying that er has been done er through all the cheap channels i don't blame him probably do the same
but he wasn't saying that he was getting eighteen thousand a year from UNK slate alone as a UNK bonus and he's a director of the other quarries as well
so how much is he getting
er not trying to kid us that er he's worse off than us
well never can he and er the other partners with er the plant hire that's been going for UNK ages and never shows a profit
but i mean erm er figures can lie and UNK can figure and he comes back well now when you go into company's house and get all these things how much they putting aside of the money which should erm like er so that they can get a good pension well that money it doesn't come actual from their pocket it comes from the company's funds which er really would have gone to the tax man
so er you know they're making their bed er nice and UNK and yet they denying it us and then that's where the erm the sore point comes in
you mentioned earlier on about your attitude towards the erm minerals and mining
yeah
is it i mean has your attitude you know th that because it's under your feet is to use your expression
yeah
that it is in fact something that ought to be shared more and people ought to benefit more from what's here
oh yes definitely
yes erm excuse me
er reading old books there the they talk about the and er around and the beds and all that you know and the UNK people they're well known about it
my wife and my daughters are all erm great c n d and nuclear er whatsit people so now when these people wanted to drill in way drill for er UNK mineral er estuary cos that's a different story the estuary
er they were a bit erm er all the c n d group i'm saying this now with no UNK or anything
they were erm a bit reluctant and were going to fight against it cos they thought they were going to look for er places to bury nuclear waste and it was UNK but i can't prove them right and i can't prove them wrong
but definitely they should er explore this county and not erm wanted to come into i think it was into the estuary to drill for gold and minerals an all that and the planning of the national park said no and the UNK hole is only about four inches wide
what i think should be done at that time was that the government should be fifty percent shares in it so that anything that's er sample that's brought up they should know what it is
because in one county there was erm i'm not sure it was ireland was a big erm hired firm like that came they explored round they paid so many hundred to each farmer for exploring the land and he said oh no we've found nothing
a few hundred quid was smashing
as the years went by these farms were bought up
they didn't know by people were paying good money for them as er the farmers were moving out and it was er a good copper bed
but you see they didn't know the truth of the exploration but if the government was fifty in it they'd be entitled to know the exact amount and quantity and what was underneath your feet
and i still maintain er of course they use the old argument that er tapes and all this and erm they er UNK the countryside
well to me when i come home of the UNK i look at these massive tips you know in UNK on your left and the old on the right and that erm if the old man that first UNK his pick and shovel or whatever UNK and or whatever they started would have known what he was starting then it was like the UNK of wales
i mean i i'd love to see the whole history and that's why i'm glad that erm you people are taking an interest now in not helping us but some day somebody saying who's that UNK who's been talking on there
but erm no i think we should take full advantage of it we we're sitting on erm you know good minerals because as the minerals of the world getting erm shorter in UNK erm in africa they're getting all the copper its getting well now they're shifting their interest slowly into anglesey
as the minerals are getting er slightly UNK well the percentage value of erm is it's UNK working now
can't see why we shouldn't er take advantage of it
but i mean you don't want to er start working in the mines for UNK or anything do you want it to be a good job such as everybody else
erm throughout this you know since we've since we've been talking you very clearly have given me erm picture of the people who own the quarries and own the and have the erm of the directories
mm
they are very much local people
ah yes
and erm members of local families
yes
i remember UNK and the kids were very young i think some of the were born in UNK erm and they were UNK an old quarry at there his brother w r from UNK had bought it UNK like a machinery merchant and UNK then borrowed a lot of tools off me for UNK it then we started we we'd done a lot off and on together we'd been in er i enjoyed working with him he was the type of man very hard worker himself but he wanted his pound of flesh
er you know while you're working er there was no you had to stop him sometimes because he'd kill himself ha that's it
yes he's built a business up and i'm not denying him that er or anything at all but somehow now er i don't know whether the wheel is turning too fast for him to co keep up with it or whether it's erm oh never mind the erm the industry of the locality providing the money UNK a i know every business has got to pay for itself and that we we're not if this quarry was on the down grade and er somebody had come to us said look unless you take a drop in your wages er we can't survive that would be a different issue altogether
but it's not it's UNK and there's plenty demand can't get enough slates and er yes they say they've got er terrific overheads this and that er well erm they can put them figures there they change the tune changes every day
they haven't got one and i'll s er say this as i've said everything on the wireless or anything whatever i've said i'll say to their face and i can slot the num perhaps they can't prove everything but you know it's there
they can put figures down er you know writing things off erm whatsit twenty percent per year for a machine right in five years' time that machine is scrap
but it's still worth thousands of quid so to them that is there're thousands erm er there's quite a lot of things they built up
and whether the wheel is turning too fast for them to cope with it somewhere along the line they've lost control any and there's still i'm told young many a time a good shop steward and a good management should be a good team together but erm unless they can work in harmony you know it's no good
you seem erm a bit puzzled as to the silence of the big group
yes erm when i was talking when they erm they UNK they went all silent erm there was not talk about UNK slate
whether they're moving the money from UNK slate into something else like nobody can prove it but that's my UNK
they getting er they training UNK slate now
mean i'm putting i'm er if i was in their shoes that's exactly and i think i'm not far from wrong
training UNK slate men one of these days they say there is no more UNK slate and that's it its gone bankrupt and er but i mean that can be easily arranged sort of thing
erm right er tom was going on his holidays our union bloke about a fortnight nor three weeks something like that after the strike situation
oh they wanted tom then cos er the deputy i think it was old was it or something like that oh they didn't want to talk to him oh they wanted to talk to tom and all this and tom wasn't available
but as soon as tom came back they didn't want to you know
so they'd been playing cat and mouse game and er it hasn't paid off you know
as they say erm whether they were thinking well we will UNK them on the gate out and they'll have to come back that's another situation but erm i never thought we'd have so much support from people and we can still erm i mean i'd rather be back at work but erm that is the situation
i mean said the other day why don't you pack up this stupid idea of UNK
i said why so that you can just carry on normally
no he said we have given you my i said yes see we haven't if you adopt that attitude we getting nowhere
i said i don't want to hassle you but i'm going to give you as much as i can
and i said you flat out there avoiding it so he said erm you've UNK us of erm taking slates out at night
i said yes i stop me and we stopped the waggon half past two in the morning on top of the a load going to erm holland or somewhere
oh he said we've always sent them out at night
i said oh no you haven't
i said that is a he didn't deny it er and he said that driver won't come back again because he was UNK into coming up
it was the same waggon yes but it was different driver and er not sure whether they taken the slates themselves there now
so really whatever little slates he's doing it's er costing him hard labour and er just because we can't er resolve the situation
and erm i say he wasn't er he wouldn't go to UNK will and our UNK from erm they went to UNK and they said oh everything's fine in our quarry but they were side stepping the main issue that we'd been sacked and there's the boys are out and majority of
there are those that have gone back and erm er it was all right them shutting their eyes to what the main the UNK of the matter and saying no everything's fine in the garden that's just er trying to kid us but er i don't think it will work
mind you erm there's one or two of the lads that are driving the UNK there
well there's one lad he driving the waggon er he works for another branch of them it just the UNK whatsit
well he's like the pig in the middle again er they've told him well unless you drive the waggon backwards and forwards through the gates well you're no good to us sort of down the road
well if he came out on strike with us erm and we won if we won everything we g he'd gain nothing in the end cos he's in another section
so i mean people can't say that we're just like er blind UNK we'll you'll lose the situation these lads are in
er we'd like to see them out with us to give the company as much harassment
erm right there's one of the partners there er he's a bit er i don't know what he's doing he's doing UNK i think backwards to help the situation but it doesn't
well there's another lad he's been ill in health he's worked more now than he ever has cos he used to work a few days and lose a few days and he wasn't
well perhaps they've given him er a green UNK
you know you can't blame them i know it's going against our policies and everything but we erm we're not blind to the situation
er we are a bit er UNK at the management er they are sitting down to UNK er UNK s tt split slates
erm he's had three UNK the other day back cash UNK shows you that poor slates are going out
well they maintain oh no anybody can UNK split them
n yes anybody but then there is er a quality and a grade and everything to them
because they are one of the worst ones if they bought er a land rover or any british make oh look at the UNK british they're crying they're up in arms and they're doing exactly the same thing now
right they've er they've been preaching against spanish slates
well i've seen spanish slates in the quarry
so when i tackled mr about it he said oh we must maintain our customers
so really they're not er playing the game
and i mean i'm not saying this now to advertise our cause or anything but i think it should be noted down
right all the machines they've got erm are either german or italian say we got dump trucks erm we
dump trucks there they know they're over five years old and they're still working
er they say they're not worked hard well i think they have they've moved er moved a few thousand tons from there and erm
of course er they have about erm well i'm not sure about twenty eight or thirty thousand gallons of diesel UNK up there and of course in them buying it in bulk like that they get it at a cheaper rate
they would fill the UNK from there and we go round the quarry filling the front machines but erm they say at five or six thousand gallons has been UNK out of that er dump
as they say it would have been all over the village the smell and everything it is wrong
well i have made a statement to the police and have put it in the police station in a sealed envelope
i was about the last one with a UNK er before er strike i mean they've been there afterwards but er and er a certain tank was empty
well i marked that certain tank and i put it in a sealed envelope to the police station and i said i don't know which tank they said whoever's UNK it has done but i said if it happens to be that tank then they are lying
if it's another tank i can't prove otherwise but i know one tank er the fourth tank you can't empty it it's got be UNK out it comes from the top and er if you went there and just opened the valve you can get a an ounce of diesel out of it
so really you know it leaves them and erm they've got to prove it erm
i'm not out to if they're going to claim on this diesel then that's up to them but i'm not going to have our lads or anybody else blamed for something which definitely does not exist and i shall tell as soon as i erm i meet him to have a chat with him again that he's going along the wrong lines
and i think er well i mean they haven't said any i think the police had a little bit erm suspicious about the story
you again you mentioned earlier on about erm members of your lodge members of going out erm and talking
yes
to other groups
erm how did that h that may be quite a sophisticated thing to t to do in a way isn't it
yes erm how can i say we were invited manchester university er to speak at dinner time four of us went up and i was nominated as the speaker
i made a bit of a speech and all that and er like a clever dick i went without me glasses
so i had to make the speech best as i could and it went down all right i think
erm then we had to call on the way back in UNK er in UNK and there was a UNK support group there
we called and saw them and we had quite a nice reception
there was only about oh about two or three dozen there
and er and because we call him he spoke there and he spoke very well because and erm that's it
people came to us after the meeting we met this lady and er she was really interested in our cause
she's erm she's a UNK in UNK so it can shows you how much cross section we've got and erm she said her and her boyfriend was coming up to UNK to be on the picket line and so on and we were quite friendly with her
then she said i've arranged now if you would like to go down and speak in er a meeting in oxford
we said fair enough
er two of us went down to oxford we pick her and her boyfriend up in shrewsbury and we went all down together and erm excuse me
we went down there they'd arranged for us er place to sleep and everything and we went to this meeting it was quite a big hall i think they were all like trade union delegates and that
and erm we spoke to the chairman during the afternoon in his house and was talking to him and spoke to him about erm an accident he'd had in the quarry
anyway erm the chap the first speaker was from silent night UNK and they're in dispute for a long time
he spoke and he spoke quite well and that's it
then the next one spoke was er one of the yorkshire miners one of these er that hasn't got a job to back to
he spoke quite well
and then it came turn and er was er speaking quite well when this girl behind us this wee well along side us was UNK up on him all the time you know he was doing well and that
and erm and he did this sermon so the next bloke he came from kent somewhere er he was a miner or a UNK delegate and he could really speak you know arms waving and all that and he was a real preacher
but the thing was nobody was impressed with him he was too much of er he was too good a speaker you know
you have a feeling er let's get it over with him
so anyway he erm had his say quite a long story and er the chairman turned round all of a sudden and he s he couldn't say the chairman er said call him cos that's what we call him and he said er he said erm would you like to come back to the rostrum again and he said erm you were explaining to me about an accident you had in the quarry in quarry erm some years back and he said i'd like you to explain to these people
so said to me yes carry on you're doing fine you know and he went up and er well he didn't know how to start the poor fellow doing smashing and he said well erm imagine this hall he said this hall we're in now as a big UNK underground
and he said he was working with an old fellow which is getting on in age and he was quite absent minded and he said i was about thirty feet from the ground on a UNK er filling er s a hole ready for shot for UNK and the old fellow was about twenty feet higher than him and then he was UNK er whatsit another hole and then a at the top of the chamber there's a little hole he said like a roof we call it which is a little passage that goes up into the next floor and then we used that as an escape route he didn't have to go far
well then er quite so he said erm it was all quiet and i looked up into the darkness and i said that the old fellow had gone and he UNK his fuse and there was me there i could see the UNK in the darkness and i was way twenty feet below him and he must have whatsit
so i said i had to make a quick decision either i was going to go up me chain past his whatsit and into the roof or else go thirty feet down and run right across the chamber into whichever er level they could go to
and i UNK out of me chain and as i was doing that's the last he remembers
either a UNK had come down from the old UNK hole up there or him with UNK boots had UNK on er black powder and set it off and his hole went out underneath his feet
it was only a small one he said
and the next thing he know he remembers he's hanging upside down with a half feet around his the chain had slipped UNK was round his UNK and he was hanging upside down in the dark twenty feet from the ground
and of course the old UNK holes went out but they went right over him UNK never a scratch on him
and er he was there er two blokes had to get come get chains and get him out of it and all that and here wasn't a scratch on him but erm he was off for about five or six months you know he had ee this brain tests and everything the shock had er he was quite bad for some time
well the people were so impressed they you could have heard a pin drop in that hall and he really in our welsh way he put it over proper you know and erm the chairman made a quite a nice remark in the end he said now he said we must remember these two fellows here i said they are welsh and they speak welsh as their first language they don't speak it for fancy they use it every day and he said i think they've done UNK well er to come down here and give us the because what happen i was sit in the front row and somebody asked me a question and he said perhaps er UNK there can answer
so i got up then and i spoke to the room you know and we were more or less helping one another out and i thought the chairman had done well when he said erm they don't speak er welsh for fancy or anything they use it as every day
and he give us
well we've had quite a lot of money from oxford from different people so you don't know
there's some people send us money and say i've read in such and such a paper erm somebody send it from UNK the there their paper there and they send us ten pounds or something and erm you know erm you never know how the fruits er
somebody want us to go to newark i think that is by nottingham isn't it to speak there
and now there was a chap on the phone last night he want to go to valley and i was trying to tell the bloke who he between doing UNK and trying to keep count and er
oh he said you don't have to send er professional speaker or anything just somebody to have a chat with ya
that'll boost the situation up some
got to see later today to see what arrangements we can make
you erm you said that er y you felt that possibly after christmas that the things would go UNK flat a bit
how do you sort of manage to keep people's spirits up the UNK
i don't know you know it's er it er we do manage and of course what breaks er people's spirit is i mean we know we don't get the money we should be having
well if you've got a big bill or something hanging over your head that will send you quite erm into the UNK
we try and help them out mm best we can
of course we haven't got erm money to just er s do what you like
we had a party a party for the kids in UNK on saturday but all the students paid it never cost us a UNK
and it was a UNK party really
yes they gave us a drink of beer and that erm and that was entirely up to them and erm
and i mean there are lots of things now er which er how can i say i never had much interest before erm never thought th that they when you've seen the help in hand they've UNK out erm s d p the erm oh the council of churches which you know never there are all sorts of erm i tell you another people and erm i UNK the gay and lesbian society you know people take them er lightly but er it makes you sit up and think now
and we had a really nice letter and good donation from them you know
so everybody that reaches out a helping hand
naturally mrs thatcher doesn't reach out a helping hand cos this is right in her er cricket pitch
no without being erm we get them from medical sides you name them they come and erm oh it's fantastic
but i never thought i'd er be doing this type of job UNK day er
no as i say i haven't got much to lose or anything but i think it's a trade that is worth protecting and er you know it's not a trade er it's a living for the people innit
and should be a decent living erm yes but surely with all the demand there is today for slate and that
you you've indicated that the work that you've been involved in has changed you in some respects i it certainly m made you m more aware of other people and the way they're prepared to help
do you think that's had an effect on your mates as well
yes erm i don't know if i mentioned you a question properly er right there were young lads in there they be young lads in that lodge do this and they jump up and they make a decision quickly
but you got to start putting all the works in motion oh yes what is the end product or what is the outcome of this and that
and i've been a few years on the council now and when i first went on the council i was going to move mountains and make oh big UNK everywhere but when you get on these things you have a rude UNK it doesn't work out that way and it works out exactly the same in this erm
you can have one quick move and if it's a false one well er you made a bad mistake and you've gone back about er whatsit and i think 's done exactly the same here he's sacked us and he's put himself in er in er UNK corner s like a game of UNK you know and he's trying all roads to come out of it
fair enough well if i can help him in any way by talking to him it's not a case of who wins and who loses we all lose
i'm quite prepared to do it
and er i've told tom and the union bloke who's said yes if you can talk to anybody member of the family to bring anything any UNK do it
so i'm not creeping back for my job but anything erm it's not that and erm but the lads in the lodge sometimes you've got to and er i've got a bit of er well a UNK voice you know rough so sometimes i get a little bit of control on them and erm also as i said about these chaps that are working erm we're not blind we know what's happening and we've got sympathy even with them
and we don't want another thing we don't want to do now is erm get man against man
you see if we can split this union in two that's exactly what the management wants
well we're playing right into their hands
though we're not in agreement to what's happened we got to be very careful because you see what's happened to the coal er dispute
and er if i can help it i've got to erm do me best to stop that happening
is that is that level of un understanding er sort of part general within the mine
no not you get different statements different erm i wouldn't like to repeat some of them right but if them lads sat down and studied it erm same as i've said now and they say well yes aye
if we UNK if we have a good punch up and all that between us and them that would suit the other side right down to the ground
so we're losing
so really we've got to erm give in right in our UNK they were wrong
erm and i've said further on that erm some could have afford to stay out but that's they we're not all built the same and erm we must avoid that at all cost
and i suppose it's up to us like the erm the old UNK to we should know better and i think tom the union chap he's he can see that and he wants to avoid it cos he's got to speak to the lot of them
you've made it clear with him that you discriminate quite clearly between the people that go back to work because they've got children or they've got l lot of UNK and they've got to do a lot of financial obligations and those who don't
would you say that is true
no there are some er lads gone back to work yes they got children they got mortgages we realize that
there are some gone back to work they haven't got all that heavy obligations but there are lads on the line which have got very heavy UNK and children and they have stuck it out you know
so it all depends how you different people different personalities and that and erm right though i don't agree with them at all what they've done erm as i said if i don't speak or if we don't whatsit we going to UNK the whole thing we're fighting for
would you say that the that the experience of the n u m has been a very important one f for you in that respect
oh yes very much so and we've been these er lots secretaries and presidents and all miners and that they've been coming up you know and er you had a chat with them and they put us don't let this happen don't let that happen and make sure that erm you know people don't suffer and er oh it's been quite a vast experience for us yeah
and they still keep on sending not just one flash in the pan you know
they still know that we need that help
now erm they've been quite good to us
as i said i don't like to UNK to pick people out because it sounds as if the others are not doing
we've had people we had one chap an old mate of mine he give us fifty p well he's on the dole there
you know er you felt whatsit
but that's it the system isn't but they send us a donation which they'd had for appearing on b c or something
now erm i think it is and he rang me up and asked me would the strike still be on in the middle of er february
well i said i can't say i wish it was over tomorrow
but if it was over tomorrow i said it's still left our lads in quite er hole financially and we shall still need that
the help won't stop like overnight we must keep going
i said in that case we will make you a concert in mid january and i think he said are coming with them
now er they were having a concert and i think was the principal part and when he went to have his fee he said oh no you can send it to the UNK
so i think writing to john to thank him
i mean i don't like to pick people out there's quite a lot erm er dr from south wales he lives here well he was born and bred here
we had a UNK for him they call him
erm won't mind that
he's been quite good to us and er they sing on the street for us
erm act i could go through that book and erm it's never ending
yeah
well UNK thank you very much
okay
really miss
well i oh i'll tell you i've got er a photo a girl
a girl
and she knew i didn't care for school
that i wanted to come from school but they wouldn't all ow me to come from school because me father had signed for four years you see
and this was two years
and he owned a shop did he
mr 's mr yes
mhm
i had a letter from the daughter yesterday
from america
and erm then of course she told me about this so my mother went to see him
and you know we arranged for that but i had a bit of a job to come from school
to leave after two years
you know but we man i got out at any rate
how old were you then miss
fifteen and a half
and then my erm my mother saw him and then i went to see him and then i started the last week in july with him after the school closed
and then i was with him for five years till nineteen the same week nineteen thirty i took over the business from him in valley
but i was in holyhead
he had a shop in holyhead and in valley
why did you want to leave school
i dunno
i wanted to go work
you know
wasn't interested in sc well i mean interest i suppose but i think what it was to start with i missed the first term you know after passing for the county i missed the first term
we had diphtheria see
i had it first
and we must have caught it from there
because er my mother was fair and she must have carried it or something and then i i'd just started i think a week of two or three weeks and my sister got it and the boys never got it
so i suppose if you don't get the first term in county school they don't bother with you
you miss the counting don't you because it was different to a school like in the valley school
and then er i suppose the interest well i did well there two year really
i mean i saw a came and i started with him and i liked it
and i kept to it
and then they were giving up and going to america they were going they had a sister
mrs had a sister and er a brother
and his sister was in texas and the brother was in UNK
so they were joining them they came over the texas sister came over for twelve months and they must have persuaded them to go back or something
so they went
so i didn't know anything about it you know till somebody asked me well asked me really mr 's going away isn't he
i said no i don't think so i said i haven't heard
oh he is he's going to america they said to me you see somebody one of the customers i suppose
ooh i said i haven't heard
so next morning i approached him
i said i said i heard last night i said that you're going to america is it true
oh yes he said like that
but we weren't going to tell you anything UNK yet
we had something else in mind for you
so that's it
i knew then they were going
so when they did say they were definitely going he said what he you see he wanted me to take the valley shop over
and of course he came to see my father and my father thought i was a bit young
h how old
fifteen and a half er well no i was nineteen and a half then you see five years isn't it
and he thought i was a bit young
well i hadn't got a chance to
so er mr he told my father oh no she'll be able to do it all right
she's sure to get on mr he said like that
i remember him saying this
he said you're su she's sure to get on
so my father didn't know what to do because he'd only just started on his own so he was tight for money as well wasn't he
and of course in the old days they didn't have money like they have now
and you couldn't get any money in the old days
no
no the same as you can now
well they get money now a and somebody else had got these days
so erm still so he said to me what'll do
well i said i'll give it a chance i said and if it doesn't pay cos he was better off than i was because he had the two shops
if he couldn't get rid of fruit here he could get it in holy rid of it in holyhead because the country place weren't so fond of fruit in them days as the english people you know
welsh people didn't sort of eat fruit like the english you know
no
no
the not the same
and of course they have gardens and then they have apple trees and things like that
well i said i'll give it a chance
well so i went and then they came on the friday night it must have been the twenty fifth of july UNK nineteen thirty
they came the friday night to go for the midnight mail you know the one that comes to meet the boat
or the boat meet meets the boat
s so they came with the keys for me the shop keys and to say goodbye to us
and then i opened up on saturday morning first thing and there i was standing in the shop
this is all mine now
and it's funny how you get used to a thing
you're afraid of doing this and afraid of going into this and afraid of going into that thinking it's not yours
isn't it
but i soon got into it
so that's the way it started for me
so i carried on and carried on and of course the travellers i knew l most of the travellers i knew
a lot of them i some i was told not to bother with
by him
i knew myself
i had a lot of trouble with them in holyhead
you know
yes
yeah some of them
some of the UNK you know
especially the UNK
short weight and things like that
mm
so he told me to keep clear of them
just to go to so and so
so that's what i did
then i found my way you know you learn as you go along really don't you a lot
and of course i carried on carried on
oh we used to do very well there
really
and we used to have a very good erm fruit and UNK business
and cigarettes you know that sort of thing
used to do well with cigarettes
and of course the firms used to call themselves you know the i used to but direct not from the UNK
c er cigarettes and things like that
was that er
wills players and er craven a isn't it
and erm what were the others
er UNK and hedges isn't it
we used to deal direct from all those
so it was worth it for the w for the when the war came
it was worth it because you had a good erm quota from them
during they were a we were put on UNK with everything
and when i first went to the business they didn't have fruit like they have now everyday you know
and round the year
oranges only came in october for christmas
october
yeah
er they started coming in the christmas oranges
you wouldn't see perhaps and orange during the summer
but now you can get them from different places but then they were spanish
spanish oranges
and the UNK oranges and things like that
and we used to get a lot of UNK fruit
apples and things like that
UNK and another sort of
and a lovely jonathan they had too
UNK fruit is lovely fruit you know
is it
mm
beautiful
nicer than any really
but we don't get that now they get south UNK now don't they and they get italians and french and there's all sorts of things but they're not as nice as the UNK fruit
so that's they way i started and then of course when the war came in nineteen thirty nine isn't it
well we used to er get jersey potatoes and things like that and then new potatoes
everything like that vegetables and everything like that
and when the war came you see we were rationed for nearly everything
so the more you bought during the time you were in business the m more quota you got you see according to what you'd been buying
and of course some you used to have points to get sweets and things like that
and i carried a very big stock of sweets because there was such a variety
and everybody you had to keep to suit every customer if you wanted to make a business
you had to do that
or do without isn't it you know you had to stock for the sake of getting the business
then between that and i was never short of sweets during the war
i er kept going
and they were on points
and i remember being called to UNK once during the time asking me why did i have such a lot of surplus of points
you see of course some people didn't take use them all they say oh you might as well keep them
then other people couldn't get enough again you see so if they were giving you er points well naturally you had the sweets to give them you're not UNK anybody or anything like that
you were having points for them
and er i was called there so i told them
i said we is a family i said we're a big family i said we don't eat sweets i said well we've got those i said it's no use throwing them we just put them in
and it nothing happened
you know but they were very keen on er with the points
and then UNK
and that's how i started to go into grocery because you couldn't get fruit
and during the war years like s perhaps we were allocated a according to what we were
if we were a UNK we had more quote like er wh what did they call them
points was it
or quota at any rate you know
to no units they called them
units two units four units or six units whatever according to your trade and where you were
well UNK a allocated me as a grocer you see and the UNK i dealt with the UNK the i dealt most of with in was he said to me you're not getting enough for what you are he said to me
well no i said i don't know why
well they've allocated you as a grocer he said but you're not a grocer
only i just turned into grocery because you couldn't get fruit when you want well you had a bit but not much
you couldn't keep going without something isn't it so
they had a committee somewhere i think in UNK i think they had their committee
and he brought this up about the units i had and he rang me up on the friday night isn't it
this was for UNK i think the quota of UNK
i couldn't understand them neither really
because they could afford to give me my back ration and yet they said they were short of things
well at any rate he gave me a ring about erm sometime about four o'clock i think
he said they've changed your units and he said there's an allocation a back allocation for you of forty baskets of UNK he said to me
i don't know if you want them he said to me like that you see
well i said i'll have them i'll chance them i said like that to him
i'll have them i said like that
well he said i'm putting them on the train and they'll be in valley on the seven o'clock train for you on friday night this was
right i said like that
so the UNK in the valley station here came brought them on the hand cart he had
not the lorry
and he brought me these forty baskets of UNK this friday night
right i said i'll clear the window i said i'll put them all in the window
because they were UNK goods it was no use keeping them you see
and there was twelve pounds in each basket
clear them all except six baskets on saturday
good heavens
yeah
but mind you i used to give them six whatever they wanted you know
and of course there was market in holyhead and people passing and things like that in it
and i cleared the lot except six baskets and they were all in good condition so i was glad of these six baskets really because it helped you to give them one or two more
because you'd only get half a pound perhaps and perhaps you'd only get perhaps this UNK only get two according to what came into the country or what was on the market
and then perhaps the next u erm lot that came perhaps you'd get six to a unit so you had twelve baskets that's the way they used to work them
i see
and the same with oranges
i remember getting one lot of oranges though that half of them were bad
so we had a lot of waste on them
and then of course the boats were sunk during the war
and then every boat that came in it depended how many cases of oranges or whatever it was apples or whatever it
but i remember one time one week i had fifty cases of oranges in
big ones you know three UNK er boxes
not er like they bring them in these cardboard boxes you know wooden boxes
remember they used to used they used to get these the farmers used to ask for these boxes because they made er UNK you know that type you know where they oh they were good boxes
but i think fruit was better in them than in these bo cardboard boxes too
but er i w i had fifty of them
well i'd no room in this shop there was no erm anywhere to store them expect the man just here see where the g where they used to keep his car
just there
oh yes
mm
for the storage
so i said my brother was in the army then and my father was there on his own so i asked him i said can we put them in the workshop
i said like that
and he said yes he said like that
so they brought them down here and they had fifty cases of oranges in here
in the not this one the old workshop
and i used to take them as i wanted them and i cleared the lot
i didn't get any waste they were in lovely c condition
but mind you they went quicker then because they were hard to get
you know people and i didn't well you were suppose well we did mark the book at perhaps a p a pound to a book you know like they were in those days
but of course with them coming like that and UNK goods we let them go as they wanted them to clear the lot like that
and perhaps we wouldn't see an orange for a fortnight three weeks perhaps
perhaps a month
we wouldn't get one
and the same with all fruit er they were rationed like that
but we managed
and then the grocery built up and built up like everybody
but they used to ask me for things but i thought there were enough s erm shops here really
because this corner shop was here
then the co op was where i was this one
and then further on there was a little shop like this one they were UNK
then over the line again there was another shop where mr a p jones do you know the retired UNK that used to be in valley he lives now
there was a shop there
and was there a shop no i don't think there was a shop anywhere on this road
and then i thought to myself
they were on oh and there was the er where the midland bank is there was a cafe there and they sold odd things you know
there was enough there and people used to tell me used to ask for things
well i said there's plenty of shops here selling that
i said i'll well they sell fruit and they sell this and they well i said the i that's my trade i said the fruit and the sweets like you know more
but oh i don't and then of course the war came didn't it
so that changed me and after that it went from you know higher and higher all the time the more and we used to get
we have used to quite c quite a lot of the coming round here
and that way
oh we used to get a lot of them
and er when i first came to the shop the mo m a lot of them used to come by train and you know UNK or meeting and at the station and away from holyhead they used to stop by the shop for fruit
and i don't know what it was but they all seemed to say the same the visitors they all used to say you've got lovely fruit here
well i said it's only the same as everywhere else
but yours is much nicer
but i think the building you see was a warmer place in the summer
ah
you see
UNK and wood
yeah
draws the heat doesn't it
yes
and i think it sort of sort of UNK the fruit better than if it was in a cool shop
i used to but mine under ripe you know
all my fruit
did you
yeah
because of that
but i it's obvious that you've always y gone in for quite UNK displays of your fruit too haven't you
oh yes i we us always used to do that
we had baskets special baskets for it
and i kept it the same and that's when we bought this in nineteen fifty four there was a lot of alterations to be done
to suit me you s yes
to suit me
because you remember that er picture o you saw with the fruit in
behind the counter
yes well in well i've got some photos of this to be inside somewhere
i'll try and find them sometime for you to see sometime
but this used to be a bicycle shop the first world war
this one
the w the UNK iron one
th yes that's what that's why it's got a window like that you see
i see
and then it's the UNK high from the f floor
and i had to get a box and many a time i've fallen on my back from that so cos somebody had moved the boxes i think
i've had a lot of falls in my time
and then that was erm a UNK place
that's next door
yes just a little place and that's where mr started in that one and then he moved into there when that went empty
yeah
that's h how he started there
and the UNK next door isn't it
the that came after
and er i dunno it went from that and i'm sorry i had to leave it really
i enjoyed it
i feel sometimes i could go back
you know but things are different they say now
why did you er did you leave the business in the end
well because of my mother see i came home to my mother
because my brother was here and he couldn't go out with mother being here old
you see my mother was eighty nine when she died
and then she couldn't cope with going out to the people there
and of course i was the only one that was single
and er really i'd well i mean i had my pleasure in the shop
it was a pleasure to i liked it
but i couldn't let my mother be here and then it was more for my brother because he had a wife and he it was more for him to be working than er for me really cos i come to pension age then you see
when i was leaving for my mother
i was sixty one you see when i left the shop
and then after that but er many a time i wish i was back you know
but my mother came first isn't it and it was easier for me
to come home than for anybody else
so that's why i came home not that i wanted to come you know to give it up
and then we and my brother wouldn't carry it on
i had my brother with me and his UNK and they wouldn't carry on
no
no
he wasn't keep on being inside you see it's alright going out
with a van
so he wasn't keen on being inside so he wouldn't carry on
well he had a job to go to in the council too really
because he was looking after the council offices
and then he had a job they had a job for him you know and of course i he didn't want to leave me well i said you can go i said it's alright if i'm going to sell i said that would be alright
and but he didn't leave until after i'd sold you know
what er encouraged you to move from your first shop t to valley stores
well because i hadn't got the place to keep things that's why
it wasn't suitable for bacon butter cos it a hot place you see and there was no room for putting any UNK or any well i did have an ice cream fridge there
eventually like when we had UNK electricity
we didn't get that then till nineteen fifty
didn't you
we had lamps you know
erm UNK lamps we had erm lighting up the place
hanging from the roof
yes
from the roof yeah
so there wasn't er the space for storage really
and er of course the co op went
closed
and of course it was up for sale so i don't know who said are you going to try
ooh i don't know i said like that because i was in a g in a good spot there you know it was a very good spot
i was there if i'd have been there to july that year that i moved there i would have been there twenty five years on that road
but of course it went you see with the traffic and things like that i'd perhaps it wouldn't have been s quite so handy for me because i'd no parking room there because there was a big back to there
you know parking space
and er so mr was where mr is now then
so we asked him if he'd come to the sale just and i told my father cos my father wasn't keen you know
er i told him i was going to try for the co op
well you're very silly he said to me trying
well i said i'm going i said i'm going to give it a try
i said but i won't pay more than i can afford to pay for it
so we went it was on a friday afternoon i think in june
i don't remember the date
and er we went in there were quite a crowd there you know
and er there was four i think there was a mr from holyhead and there was a mr he lived in bangor but he was running the UNK that was by the station in the old days
there was an UNK shop by the station in the
yeah
and he was from bangor
erm what was the name of the place in bangor
he was there
and i can't remember who the other was that was there
there was four of us and we started bidding and somebody in the crowd started bidding four thousand
everybody went everybody went like there nobody saying a thing
mhm
so of course i g i was not bidding myself mr went to the UNK mr he's dead
mr now
and er he went to him so he went to speak to this woman about the thing and she was member of the co op see
and i suppose she had money there must have been
it was a sort of like a i don't know what i whether it was erm some sort of a private or it belonged to this manchester co op or something i think it was
there were UNK i suppose that would keep it
oh at any rate he they started UNK and then of course it went and went and it fell and then this mr gave up and whoever the other one was don't remember who he was
and er somebody asked him why he'd stopped bidding well he said i could see there was nobody in my line trying for it
when he saw who was trying you see
and then this mr he had a grocery shop in holyhead
but he wanted the living place more than he wanted the shop
i knew this mr william
he was friendly with my erm uncle they'd b both been in starting when they started in business
so he stopped and then it fell and it fell short of the hundred pound they wanted
they had a reserve price on it
so we paid that because they wanted and then we had to pay for stock
there wasn't much stock there though
all rubbish we had to throw it
but i paid about four hundred for it oh but you had to if you wanted it
so er that's the way i er had it and s and somebody else asked mr why did he stop bidding
oh he said if we had carried on it would have been dear for somebody
but it fell for one thousand five hundred then in nineteen fifty four
so it wasn't a bad price really but i was able to pay for it
that was the main thing
you know i didn't want to
the UNK came to me oh i suppose you'll want to borrow some money now
i said no thank you
i said everything's all arranged
was that er would that have been considered unusual to have had the money to pay that amount in those days
no i don't think so no
mm
well er it would in a way because you'd have to pay interest on what you were borrowing wouldn't you
yes
oh yes you have to pay now a mortgage won't you
you have to pay interest on what you b you borrow now
so it was better for me if i was able to pay
i was free then i could do you know
and then i came home after the sale
i told my father
i teased him for a bit that i didn't get it went for so much
and he said to me er and then i said no i said we've been lucky
i said about it
mm
and i told him all about it
he was glad in the end too
there was nobody more glad than him really but i suppose he thought i'd go into debt or something but i d wouldn't do that
i'd rather be without
oh and the er one of the co op members he was a big noise there i think i don't know if he was the chairman of the committee or what
but he s he met me on the road one day and he said to me miss it would pay you to give a decent price for it he said to me
oh why
i said
well to keep somebody else from coming out
i said it makes no difference to me i said
i'll only bid as far as i can pay mr
his name was mr
mr i said like that
and if it goes more than that i said it can go i said
it makes no d difference to me
i said it's up to you to make your business
you don't want to keep anybody else er space for everybody if they want to try
it's er up to you i said you've to make your business
and er i don't know what he said after i don't know
mhm
but i think oh he was a all nice and everything er you know
but you see the more money they had the more they had to share i suppose with m
yeah
i don't know
we to my w way of thinking like that isn't it
i suppose they was
he owned the place you know the it was a good place
so we were lucky and then we opened up on january the fourth nineteen fifty five
on the day of my birthday
yes
mm
when i was forty five
getting old
why worry isn't it
it's just how you feel
and er w of course with that one i owned the ground
in the old place but i didn't own the shop
so nobody could i kept that shop i paid the rent on the shop for twelve months i kept it closed for twelve months to get that place going
you know to get the people used to coming
not that it would have made any difference because i mean people used to go into shops on that side which never came up our way and the same with us coming up there and not going that way isn't it
so we managed and we opened up see how quick they came
they soon got into it though
did they
y oh yes
well i suppose they'd have been used to going there before you see
and near the post office opposite the post office so they were but the only thing i didn't like there was the houses opposite me they all seemed to be in their windows watching everything
that's the only thing because n the other place you see it's quite open
oh you can't see it can you
i across the road you see er there was a road er opposite
that it was very nice there too on the main road
but we soon got used to the place
you had your work and then you just don't didn't bother
but er you could see them you know
we were a bit from the road and then you see a bit higher
and then of course we carried on from there and we just i was going to do a lot of things you know
but i never got to do them
if ever i'd lost my mother of course we were lucky we had our father and mother
you know you know some people they lose them a bit young don't they
when they're young and they've got the chance
but we had our father and mother for years
actually for that
er and then er i was going to make a v nice flat and i was going to build a warehouse and things to but i didn't got to do it
i came home
and had to settle home
don't know if there's anything else you want to know
you would have liked to have extended the business a little m more then would you
oh well yes i'd carry on oh mind you we UNK everything then
we had everything
o only the only thing was that you hadn't got enough room to display everything that you could stock isn't it
you know what i mean
they had to ask if they wanted
but it didn't matter what they asked for they had we had it
because they used to say oh go to so and so's you're sure to get it
you know and word goes round
i never advertised you know
never advertised
my own advertising was giving them the service and the quality
and the attention
but i ne erm advertised in papers anything like that
so if someone w wanted something s specially
yeah
you would order it for them
yes
if they wanted and during the summer months we had the same people coming every year
since a some of them c came when i was with mr
and they kept coming and coming to me just the same
and when i was there and they used to send their orders they used to come holiday times some people had houses in and
they used to send me their orders perhaps three weeks before they were coming either for us to deliver or for us to erm have them ready for them to collect on their way up
some used to stay in farms and things like that
and they used to send orders isn't it was nothing to see fifty items on an order
isn't it different things
and we were always able to supply them
w yeah
and they used to say some of them used to say er if there's anything you can't get if you UNK you can't get for us or haven't got er just let us know and we'll bring it with us
but they didn't have to
we always had them
and er my father used to do the garden then
we used to have a lot of UNK and of course summer summertime we didn't see so many because everybody had a garden here and everybody er you know grew UNK
and i remember one year we'd had some UNK and i was we had a good crop and i remember one lady who stayed in and she come used to come well practically every other days for six of these
and they were like UNK
oh they were lovely too that year
they were nice
and we hadn't got any more of those nice UNK you know
UNK nice and UNK they were lovely UNK
and er we used to try and them in the garden just to get the odd one or two for somebody you know
oh yes we had a we had a lovely time
they were nice though
nice people
we had very good customers really
they were
and a lot of them have gone now you know passed away
a lot of the old ones
and we used to have one gentleman come in from the country
and he's g he's dead now though
and he used to come regular every friday
when this was with mr
and i was there
and he wouldn't allow anybody else t anybody to serve him except mrs
i couldn't serve him
cos i was only young yet
he obviously though i didn't know what to
well and he used to come regular every friday afternoon and he used to go the s a ch lower down you know after you pass the police station on the left there used to be a UNK place there
lovely meat they had too
and er he used to go there for meat but he used to buy two lots one for his o his own place and one for the farm he had you see
for the one that was in the farm
he used to buy two lots of things
so if he three apples of apples he'd have two lots like that
and of course this friday one friday mrs said to me said if mr comes tell him i'm not here
she said to me
i knew i was telling a lie
i'm sure he could see on my face
i'll stay in the back she said
so she stayed in the back
so mr came in he said is mrs in
i'm sorry i said she hasn't come
expecting her any minute
and then of course he allowed me to serve him then
and then after that he never asked for her
no
no
i suppose he thought i didn't know the different you see
but that's one thing i did i used to tell the girls i said give them decent things i said like that
if you want them to come back i said
i'd rather take the loss myself than for people to get you know rotten stuff
or to bring anything back
but some don't bother do they
you know i get things now i just have to throw them some of them
but er at any rate we managed and he never asked after that
whoever was there served him then
it's funny how you get into a lot of people are like that
in business till they get to know and things like that
some nice customers too
but the only thing was sometimes you know the visitors in the mornings they used to come out the visitors
during the summer
some people oh these visitors and people used to say to me well now look i said like that visitors i said like that there's enough stuff for everybody
we cater for them i said we buy extra
for visitors and they want things that the locals don't want i said
they buy things that the local people don't want
and i said another thing i said some visitors i get here i said they buy more from me in a month than some of the locals buy in a week
more er and more in a month some of them than the others did in a year
and those were the ones that UNK
of course it's extra isn't it you see when you think of it
you buy you're not doing the locals they we they weren't going short of anything
and if you had your UNK and things were in short supply you wouldn't put those on the shelves you'd keep them back for when they came in
mm
you know
mm
that's the way i used to do it at any rate
well what sort of proportion would you say of your trade was purely visitors
well what i used to always say it was pretty steady all the year round
mm
on the average
you do get a bit extra because you get UNK by in summer don't
mm
you know stop for things
you see the locals have their own things in the garden in summer
their potatoes and their vegetables and well fruits and apples UNK things like that isn't it
if they want
and then they used to keep you in the winter more or less and the visitors making up so it was s a steady trade all round
i used to think mine was pretty steady all the year round
if you missed your k certain things you were gaining by the visitors
stuff that they wanted you know like the erm sugar and the tea and things like that
but other things they had in the garden like vegetables and like UNK things like you know the fruit
i mine was pretty steady
i c you know
of course you do make extra holiday time
like you have easter eggs don't you and you have christmas goods
we used to run a christmas club as well
and then i used to bank i used to post put that in the post office in a separate account i didn't use it you see
i used to keep that separate see t till christmas time
i never used it in the like people put it in the till
i never did that
no
no i kept it on its own
because it wasn't mine till they had the stuff
you know at christmas and then i managed to save a bit in the post office with that
for my old age
you do just do these things
you've got to work for yourself really haven't you
you can't expect people to tell you this tell you that
you've got to according to what you think
is that is that o one of the reasons that you went into business in the first place
in order to be independent
well i don't know
er you know when we were children wasn't it
people used to ask they do with their children no don't they what are you going to do when you grow up
i said shop owners
well you couldn't go nursing till you were about eighteen or nineteen or something if not more
in those days
isn't it
my sister again she was asked
oh she was going to be a that's what she said
well she was
well she went nursing again
quite the opposite to what she was going to go
but she stayed in school four years you know
she did
did she
yeah
but er she went nursing and she's still nursing
she does two days in nursing home in bangor
and er she oh i was going to go well i like the shop so much i wasn't going to change
i liked it
and meeting people and that's what i like too
i liked serving people
did you
yeah
i used to i used to love being by the counter
not that i'm one for erm like talking like some people do and wanting this and er you know
but i liked serving and i liked to feel that i was able to have sold somebody something
and not to go out w empty handed
it was you know i did like that
i enjoyed serving better than anything
i had to do the other jobs as i know but i used to like serving people because i used to like meeting people and sort of study people
you know their characters and things like that
and knowing how to please them
that's what i one thing i liked
was able to please a customer
which UNK i think i managed
i don't think i turned anybody away i don't think
what do you w what would be the im important ways that you would think you used in order t to please them
oh well i suppose put all your attention to their needs isn't it
you see you go into some shops you se i'm serving you
you'll see them talking to somebody else somewhere else and you're serving this person
well that's wrong to me
if you're er serving this lady or gentleman whoever it is you should put your whole mind with this person not er wait for them to ask what they want and talk with somebody else like that and that's done i in a lot of these shops
well they used to but it's self service isn't it and that's a another thing
i couldn't join
no erm UNK no what was it
UNK
nothing like that
i didn't join any of them i kept independent the whole time i was there
because after all they were having the cream of the shop people and some of them found out that the hard way
and i said oh it's so and so that gets all the profit
i know i said i haven't joined them because er they e they tell you what to sell everything
well you see now say tea say for instance it was a shilling
well perhaps if you bought it direct yourself you'd perhaps get fourpence on it
i'm not saying it was fourpence but perhaps you'd get fourpence
well if you bought it through that UNK they tell you to sell and you'd only get on it
so i didn't join any of them i kept independent while i could at any rate and then
so you maintained a direct link between you and the manufacturer or the UNK
yes more of them yes
we had a UNK of course we had to get UNK for some things
more or less but i used to buy my bacon from 's
i used to get that direct from them
and then i used to get from we used to get our sausage and things like that
pies and then frozen stuff UNK eye we used to deal with
came there weren't many then when i was there there's more now frozen stuff
and then er UNK all them
the main all the UNK firms we used to deal with
and how many UNK firms came and we still bought from every one of them
but they've all got their good lines you see
see UNK were noted for their crackers more than anybody else's
so between them all we were able to b buy the best sellers from you know
christmas cakes
i was looking the other day when i was looking for some of these things
the price of christmas cakes in the old days
twelve and six the cheapest the smallest
honestly now it's price they are now
mm
and they were nicer then than now
they were lovely
w wasn't there a an enormous amount of erm work involved
in ordering all this stuff
well i don't know
e w it never worried me
i knew what i had and i knew what i wanted
and it's funny things some of these travellers oh you get some awful travellers you know southern some of them
they're pushing stuff to you
and er they used to say don't you want to go and see what you've got
i said no i said i know what i've got
i know what i want
they'd go i've never seen anybody like you
they always seemed to want to go and look or what they haven't but i never used to do that
i was ready f if a UNK came in i'd be ready for him
i knew what i had
see if i was UNK anything or anything like that oh we had an UNK we had a big stock er big stock you know
but we used to turn it over not like they push it in front new stuff in front of old we never had that we never did that
we always used to have the old ones out
and before easter after christmas i used to start buying extra of things that kept
ready for the season so that i wouldn't have to buy a lot of things when you were busy
i'd have them in stock ready
and that's what we used to do
and er then there was a UNK used to say oh you're not afraid of buying
well i said if i don't buy i don't get a chance of selling
you know
and sometimes you used to things had gone up you were lucky in that way
other times perhaps things had come down but not so much then
if things were dear not by so much
but if they were cheap that's the time to buy
you h you learn these things as you go along
but we had some there were some good travellers then though
in the old the old travellers
they were good
used to deal with erm er fruits well they were er i suppose
liverpool he used to come
as i was saying we didn't get we were buying in october ready for christmas buying them in
and this mr he was he used to c he well he was UNK calling f with mr and he kept calling with me the same so i used to order my bulk in october to come in for christmas goods
and he used to come regular
he used to come in UNK october and he used to drop off the ten o'clock train here
he came by train
and then he used to have the bus on from here to holyhead to see the other people in holyhead
yeah
and we
did he
mm
and you know i don't know if they're still in UNK are they
daniel and son are they
no i don't think so
no have they gone
well they used to call too
they used to come round with cheap stuff getting rid of their rubbish
i remember them coming through the shop once want any cheap bananas
yeah what sort of bananas
and they were noted weren't they for rubbish
what are they like
oh so and so oh they
have i done anything
no
er i said
carry on
i said oh i said yes what are they like
and he'd say oh they're like this
so like alright bring them in to see i said like that
you know he knew i didn't want them
and then he guessed i didn't want to start with them
erm he brought them in
nice ones er one or two nice ones on top you see rubbish underneath
oh i said i don't want things like that i said take them away
and they didn't c oh i didn't used to bother with them
no
no
they were rubbish the bananas
they were coming from bangor with these things to sell
of course i didn't get rid of them
i suppose they always stock you see a lot
mm
you said that erm you enjoyed er m meeting people and talking to them
yes
did do you think you were able to form a judgement of people on the basis of your experience
oh yes
yes i think so
yes
mm
you could see through them you know
oh yes you got to know th that's one thing in business that's one thing you have to do
at least i think so at any rate
that you have to find your way with people
what sort of people they are some like a lot of chatting other people don't
and you've got to know their ways to be able to serve them properly
i think
study them not to go and rush and push things to them
you've got oh i'm breaking everything now
no
it's alright
erm you've got to go gently you know
around
and then when you got to know your customers and when you know what they like and what they want it's so much easier to serve
once you get to know the customer
if you came in now and asked me for a pound of apples well in a way i wouldn't know a stranger whether they like them under ripe or just ready for eating
well if you're UNK to serving and studying what they like t cos some will ask you oh i'd like some ripe ones
well you'd naturally one or two just to see if they're in what they want
well after that if they asked for yo a pound of apples you could get them the pound of apples and you'd se sell a lot quicker
and you would remember that would you
yes oh yes that's one thing i've got i can remember
and during the war you see we had UNK for these things when they were on ration
and one gentleman in the crowd he said are we allowed to shift them
well i said i've got to i said i can't i haven't got time to talk to anybody i said i've got to shift it
you see you were a lot on your own then you couldn't get any help
you see if the girls were sent to taking them to other work
so if i had a queue isn't it i just used to carry on with whatever was going on
and they were outside you know standing
were they
a lot yes
there wasn't enough room in the shop
but i used to s shift them and they used to say to me you know how to shift them
but i don't think people some people like you to chat with them for a long time other people they just like you to serve the so they can go
don't like to wait about
you know
and of course er we used to if we were busy we used to tell they girls i say look i said you can talk any anytime you like
i said like that but if there's a shop full of people i said just serve carry on and finish and then if you want to chat after
and i said if somebody's serving somebody in the shop and perhaps they you know two of three of them perhaps together i said but don't talk in the shop i said go through to the back if you want to chat
because some people are very UNK they'd think you were talking about them
and somebody might laugh or something with something
one of the girls saying a something you know and they laugh
i said don't so that i said like that
i always says it
you've to sit a lot in the shop go to the back if you want to chat
u unless there's somebody else wanting serving isn't it
if you happen to be serving but i used to serve quite a lot myself
but i think they make a bit idle because they knew what they knew what i w you know i was able to serve the what they wanted isn't it
oh
it was lovely though
w was there anyone who came to work for you
oh yes
yes
who was who you were able to erm if you like if you were y who you were able to t teach and show this sort of enthusiasm
yes they were all there you know everyone of them you did
they only had to be with you
sometimes they'd stand with you while you were doing
yeah
yeah
but e of course they're no e you've got to have an interest i think to a lot
but i had some very good girls though
they were very good very nice all i had
they were all country girls you know
no town girls
no
no
country girls are much better workers
are they
oh yes
is that
yes
that's the difference is it
well for me it was
mm
the others were more for dressing and er you know
but er country girls they set to it and work they're good workers
i had very good girls really i w would just erm lost one of the ones that used to work for me
she died last month is it
yes i think
she died of UNK
she was only forty three
mhm
yes she was a nice girl too
very nice clean girl you know
very good
my UNK used to work for me too
there were six of us when i left
in the shop
mm
then my brother
and i had a part timer a friend and my UNK and i had there were six of us altogether there was another like two isn't it that's four
yeah and my sister in law used to come m my brother's wife used to come and help us with the cleaning at night
but we used to clean the shop ready for the morning
always ready to open
floors done and everything we didn't have to do jobs as like that in the morning
no
no
i used to do a lot of the cleaning myself
at night and er if there was anything wanted filling up
and i used to see to the fruits
i used to fill that
yeah we were yeah we was we was like a happy family really you know everybody through and through
and that's a mistake a lot of shop people do
they look down on their staff
i think
they just want to show who's boss
but it doesn't work
not for me
no
i'd rather be one of them work with them
just put yourself one of them
it's so much nicer i think
i was treated like that by mr and mrs they treated me like their own daughter
and i said to myself i've been under a boss
hello and welcome to central lobby
later in the programme we ask are positive discrimination and UNK thriving in the labour party
but first there was time when reading a UNK report in a sunday newspaper meant catching up on how many people were UNK and how many pitches were UNK
the football authorities say we can now concentrate on what happens on the field rather than the terrace because UNK is being forced out of the game
the introduction of all UNK along with the new football offences act which makes it illegal to run onto the pitch are believed to be responsible for the reduction in violence
but UNK relating to football have failed to show a consistent decline and actually increased by more than twenty percent in the ninety one ninety two season
and it's claimed the battle against the UNK is still far from won
yesterday andrew fox went to the UNK local derby between wolves and stoke
this was the image of football in the eighties a game UNK by fans fighting on the UNK and running onto the pitch
you might have thought this sort of behaviour was all over
it's not now
UNK this month brought it home the UNK are continuing to UNK the game
UNK it's claimed is still a long way off finding a cure for violence
anyone who er regularly UNK games knows full well that the game does attract a minority of er young men who for whom a punch up on a saturday afternoon is all part of the game
so i fear er that any decline is er theoretical rather than a real one
i still think we have this problem not as serious as it was about established UNK between particular groups of fans
what's interesting is that those UNK are not focused as strongly as they used around the very big clubs and we're talking less here about what's gonna happen at manchester united and UNK and perhaps more about the difficulties of wolves and stoke
wolves in fact have done more than most to provide evidence that the game is UNK itself of violence
the football authorities come to UNK to support their claims that grounds are now fit for families not homes for UNK
in just four seasons here the number of people arrested on charges connected with football have fallen from more than three hundred and fifty to just under one hundred
it's been a long time since a league game was played at UNK against stoke
wolves themselves season have been quite well behaved
er but there are a number of factors
er for example it's erm it's a local derby
er very strong UNK between the two teams
and so er we're expecting perhaps it might be a little bit lively
on the day itself we had UNK er at the ground up here so everybody clearly understands what's expected of them
and in addition to that of course we cover the safety aspects that are required up at UNK
which is as important as preparing for disorder itself
it would be nice to think that we don't have to consider this we didn't have to have meetings with our local police to decide what we're going to do on the day of the match in case there is trouble
er yeah by all means er we'd love that situation but er i'm afraid er that's not possible at the moment
our main priority is to stop trouble inside the ground
i think er the supporters like to be er looked after by the sort of their own people rather than er the police force
the club has more than two hundred stewards to control the crowds as well as search the ground before anyone gets through the UNK
the police have decided to UNK more than one hundred officers on what called a UNK flow operation slowly shifting their attention from outside to inside the UNK
but this elaborate operation it's claimed only goes to prove that UNK rather than disappearing is just UNK beneath the surface
those of us who attend UNK matches as i do er regularly you've got to say that er it's not gone away it's merely been contained
and containing it is extremely expensive and i personally feel that it's wrong to expect the community at large to go on paying week after week month after month year after year er in order to contain a problem which through no fault of its own belongs to the UNK
to imagine that there is er a great UNK of violence inside our football grounds is now quite wrong and i think the game isn't getting enough credit for the way in which it's tackled it
or it may be there but the police and the stewards aren't allowing it to come out because they're keeping a lid on it so efficiently these days
no i think that's an unnecessarily pessimistic view
i think that crowd behaviour has improved the clubs are catering much better for families
the climate of violence that used to be there inside football has diminished
as the first fans takes their seats another operation is under way to ensure that some never get to see the game
the police have UNK intelligence officers with the job of spotting UNK in particular those who have been banned from UNK
we're always looking out for somebody who could cause er problems in wolverhampton and problems generally
the er
how do you know what sort of person that is
comes with experience
lot's of different factors go into it
er sometimes what they're wearing you find that er they tend to wear er a little bit of a uniform on occasions but they're not the normal people that we would be looking at
and not the ones with er i'm a UNK on their heads
with the fans now UNK through the UNK many of them being stopped and UNK before going any further there's a final briefing for the man who could influence their mood referee paul harrison
unclear we will only come on the pitch when you invite us and we will deal with anything off the pitch
you give a decision UNK
an honest decision
and it's only after that decision that you are aware of any crowd reaction
er not at the time that you did it
always comes seconds later
any more of that
the atmosphere may as they say be electric but it's nothing compared with the nervous energy being generated in this box
from here police and stewards are directed to the slightest hint of trouble between the rival fans
let's er keep an eye on the bottom now
summat gone over the top now
give me the red give me the brown UNK
it's hard to see er a situation in which the kind of young men that we UNK produce in this country er are not gonna be interested in some kind of group aggressive violent activities
it's hard to see er a change in their interest in this kind of thing
football merely provides the opportunity because a match is taking place but if they we if the football matches weren't taking place those criminal acts would be committed in another context
football has done it its best in order to cope with the problem inside the grounds
you can see it's a tense game er we've said before it's a local derby and er there are one or two minor problems
you've had UNK already
yes we've had one or two UNK but they're disorder offences and minor disorder offences
we still have a small hard core of football supporters that are willing and able to create trouble if they're given the chance
but i think if we persist if the club and ourselves continue the way that we're going those numbers will become less and less
as the game ends the police prepare to respond to any clash while supporters make their way home
UNK are reported but they're not given the chance to develop into any serious UNK
the stoke coaches are UNK as far as the motorway
and within an hour of the final whistle the police operation is called off
of course for the police the one score line is not as important as these figures eighteen UNK and thirteen UNK from the ground
that's out of a crowd of more than twenty thousand
i think it's fairly reasonable particularly when you consider what we've experienced over the last two three and four seasons
what sort of offences were there
erm people UNK er UNK gestures er we've had two UNK er but they have been relatively minor UNK as far as we're concerned
there is a violent UNK in our society which has got nothing at all to do with football and where football mustn't be UNK is to provide the opportunities at its matches to allow that UNK of violence to manifest itself
i think the game i think the game has done well in tackling that problem but i don't think we as a society have done very well in tackling it in the country at large
football clubs football supporters er and UNK have got to talk between themselves to try and come up with a solution
at the moment all we're doing is keeping the lid on a still a pretty serious problem
well last night only three days after the shadow cabinet elections one of the women mps who was thrown off john UNK core team accused her male parliamentary colleagues of a cynical plot and a stitch up
ann UNK who was not re elected to her heritage post used her address to the welsh labour women's conference to attack macho m ps
after the change in party rules forcing all labour mps to vote for four women in the shadow cabinet elections has labour's policy UNK
i'm joined by labour's UNK reed m e p for leicester and the labour mp for joe UNK
UNK reed first of all what went wrong
is positive discrimination the way forward
i think it still is the way forward and i don't think it was so much that things went wrong as that they didn't go as well as we had hoped for the women elections to the shadow cabinet
it may be that it's time to look again even though this new rule has been enforced for only these elections at this particular method of positive discrimination
joe UNK who did you vote for
and is it is it a case of UNK basically UNK within the labour party
no it isn't
there are some brilliant labour women in parliament
i mean the speaker betty UNK is magnificent
UNK reed is a superb m e p
it's nothing to do with that sort of battle
it is the fact that if you change the UNK you'd better make sure the ball still goes between 'em
and that's what the women did
and what they didn't understand was the basic experience of any trade union branch which says if you wanna get six or eight people elected you don't put fourteen up
the thirty seven strong women's could not agree among themselves on what's known as a
and if they had stuck six or eight pe eight women mps up they'd have all been elected
but fourteen of 'em were saying no me and it er spread the vote too thin
joe UNK are you saying that really there was no plot as such that there wasn't a sort of campaign that er some of the women mps have claimed there was
there wasn't a plot
there was some UNK because what happened they tr they changed the rules
now the first time they tried to change them in may they lost the vote the women to increase it from three to four
usually in the labour party any other organization you're gonna have to wait a year but the women didn't
they went round the back door and got to john smith and they got the chief whip and got the chairman of the party and had a UNK of the vote two weeks later
this time they won
and er the men then got UNK they said this is not on
you know they should they should UNK by the rules and wait a year
and that's when the sort of backlash built up
UNK reed do you think you could have predicted this sort of backlash
that perhaps things were moving too quickly
i don't think so and i find it difficult to believe and disappointing to believe that as many man are would deliberately spoil their vote
this is a very serious matter the election to labour's shadow cabinet and i do not want to believe that men would deliberately spoil their vote
but i think it's a little bit rich if i may say so joe to blame the women for this because the parliamentary labour party did vote for this new rule and the fact that a number of women very able women put themselves forward i don't think it's right to say it is the women's fault
a large number of men put their names forward in a perfectly proper way
what happened though did in essentially basically dilute the vote and the UNK tactics were allowed to happen
that surely was women's fault
do you think the danger in positive discrimination is that er it's implying that women can't compete on equal terms with the men in the first place
no i don't think that is the problem
i think we have to face up to the fact in the labour party that UNK that positive discrimination are essentially UNK
they can UNK they can lead to some UNK but what they are is a signal that other methods of getting a better representation of women in parliament in local councils has really not worked
this is the real dilemma you see
i think either we as a labour party are serious about having more women in the house of commons and we do very badly compared with many of our european neighbours
we either say we are serious and look for ways to achieve that or we say we've failed
but we all we can do is reflect the position of women in society and i do not think that what's we're about and i do not think it's what the parliamentary labour party
no it wasn't a backlash against women
it was a backlash against UNK where you have got to vote for a certain number
we don't have a section for the disabled but
it hasn't stopped david UNK and jack UNK
joe just
doing tremendously well
just briefly how do you encourage more women into the labour party very briefly when they UNK fifty two percent of the population
but they're not fifty two percent of the candidates
and what we've got in standing for a general election is about two and a half thousand men and about five hundred women
there is no way you're gonna get equality
just
with that volume
just very briefly UNK i suspect perhaps a lot of women would stand if conditions in parliament were more
i'm sure that they would do
in the european parliament for example we do have a nursery we have child care facilities for seventy children which you don't have in the house of commons
perhaps
i'm afraid there we must leave it but perhaps that is the way forward
thank you both very much indeed for joining us
well here it is part three of those memoirs
in today's UNK in the sunday times lady thatcher UNK on the UNK conflict
she UNK the then foreign secretary UNK now lord UNK for the part he played he would have agreed to a negotiated settlement she would have regarded that as nothing less than surrender
lady UNK been on the road promoting her book and a couple of nights ago she was in birmingham at a dinner UNK by the birmingham post
there is of course nothing new in the battle by UNK
you have to go back a very long way indeed to a more UNK age when politicians didn't use the UNK as a weapon for UNK old UNK
there were nineteenth century memoirs and occasionally they were quite UNK but it's lloyd george's memoirs of the great war the first world war that set in many ways the modern pattern for old battles to be re fought
and indeed as lady UNK would say for ready money
that's not to say however that occasionally you don't get UNK to a UNK more UNK age
for example UNK memoirs were described them as this little book about fishing a beautiful UNK of a UNK in UNK street who would always rather have been with his fly on the river UNK on the scottish borders
so it's not a progression all in one way but i have to say that even by the standards of the lloyd george era the battle by UNK which we now see for considerable sums of money has become more than a cottage industry it's a production line industry
that industry probably started in nineteen seventy five with the diaries of labour's richard UNK
after his death his executors decided to breach the convention of not UNK private conversations with other ministers and officials
the UNK did change in mid seventy five
but i sometimes think it's earlier than that
it's now forgotten that when hugh UNK began to publish his memoirs with large UNK of his diary in the late fifties and early sixties particularly the high tide volume that came out about the labour government of forty five to fifty one which was very UNK
he was a deeply unpleasant man hugh UNK
what would you say have been the successes and the UNK of more recent times
the ones that have done well in publishing terms quite rightly i think are those who have pl been plainly written by the person concerned above all dennis UNK and also roy UNK
now i have to be careful what i say about lady UNK because of the laws of UNK and also i don't know who's written which pieces but it's known she's had help you see
and when i see a wonderful phrase like william UNK is like without the jokes i think now i wonder if she thought or said that
is that quite her style of humour
could it not be one of the two or three people who've helped her with the writings
just touch that bit up
i may be entirely wrong but i'm going to be reading those when i'm allowed to put my hands on a copy finally
and i constantly wonder now is that robin UNK speaking or is that mrs thatcher
is that john UNK with one of his ripe little one UNK or is that mrs thatcher
or is this perhaps my old friend bernard UNK coming in one more time to help the lady of his UNK
but if i can just quote a couple of cases
you would've thought wouldn't you that UNK memoirs would've sold very well in fact they were a complete UNK
again i don't want to be UNK but UNK i suspect in the public view is a man somewhat but not entirely without trace
he just left a little trace of UNK in any government seat he occupied
now by and large you don't want UNK boys' memoirs do you
what people like is a brilliant UNK like dennis UNK a character with a capital c UNK is much too variety i think to appear more widely
why do you think they do it
well the tom UNK of british political life i suppose write their memoirs for a couple of reasons because they can't ever admit to themselves they are tom UNK
UNK there's nothing like reflecting in UNK to help heal those UNK and most of them were pretty UNK by the nineteen UNK experiences of the recent crop
and some of them think they're gonna make money
even those that tend not to do very well attract some kind of an advance
and also given the nature of the kind of people who want to UNK authority over others they can't bear being out of the UNK it gives them one last throw
particularly if they get UNK in the sunday newspaper
one last time the name is going to be talked about in the circles that bother about these things and it's all to do with mrs thatcher who's UNK to say about her UNK all is UNK
peter UNK talking to our reporter philip UNK
with just two words prison works home secretary michael howard has upset some members of the UNK
next week we try to find out why
till then goodbye
fresh police appeal in murder hunt
we're investigating a cold UNK execution
we badly need the help of the public
the man who took a one hundred and sixteen thousand pound UNK and lost
and are we lighting up too early
with the children i know this while in front it's too soon
a very good evening to you
an eleven year old boy has been held at UNK by armed UNK and forced to lead them to money and jewellery at his family home
the boy's mother father and younger brother were bound and UNK during the raid
the attack has left the family terrified for their safety
was asleep in the early hours of the morning at his home in road UNK
he was UNK by a gun pointing to his head as he lay on the floor of his living room
two UNK both with guns had got in through a kitchen window and were threatening to kill him
then he said if you shout i kill you
don't shout
then i'm frightened
say how many people live in this house
how many people live in this house asleep why shut up
three other members of the family were pulled from their beds
mr wife and his four year old and eleven year old sons
mr himself was in the living room because of a back injury
they were bound and UNK with UNK tape
the UNK repeatedly demanded money and jewellery
mr eleven year old son offered to help so one of the put a gun to him and forced him to lead them to him threatening him at the same time
he shout me dad shut up gun
the phone was UNK and the family's heads were put in UNK
eventually they were able to raise other people in the house
mr a forty four year old restaurant owner is still unable to sleep although his four year old son appears UNK by what happened
the rest of the family is still terrified and don't want to be identified
the UNK described as UNK made off with an UNK amount in cash and UNK
police believe they didn't get anything near what they were expecting
it may be because erm they believe he has access to money or money er i would say here and now that information is wrong but er there would appear to be no other motive for this attack
for the moment detectives are UNK for the reason for the attack
they say the UNK from mr restaurant business aren't taken to the house and they've no evidence of any important jewellery being kept there
as for the family they're still frightened and they're scared that it might happen again
detectives hunting the UNK of a UNK who was shot dead as he walked his dogs today carried out a UNK involving the car and a motorbike that they think may have been used in the murder
however they admit they are no nearer a motive for the cold UNK killing of the forty year old property developer
UNK of flowers mark the spot where mr UNK was shot dead exactly a week ago
roses from his two children and his widow with moving UNK to the property developer police believe may have been the victim of a UNK style contract killing
today timed to the minute a policeman wearing similar clothes posed as the UNK detectives believe fired the five shots from close range in a remote country lane in UNK in UNK
the white motorbike with black UNK was later found abandoned in road in the town
it was here on the morning of the murder that a red UNK car then UNK off from the area
detectives say the two vehicles had been seen in and around UNK on a number of occasions
they're appealing for urgent help from the public
we're UNK hundreds of man hours at a cost of tens of thousands of pounds and of course UNK other lines of enquiry
what we really need the public to do is er get in touch with us and tell us of any associations between vehicles of those types
through his business dealings the victim had been involved in a UNK pound civil UNK
his home and car had been fire bombed and mr UNK had been attacked in the past
a police UNK used the streets around UNK today in a bid to UNK someone's memory to catch his UNK
two teenagers who were badly injured when a horse UNK are to begin a legal fight for compensation
but their solicitor says their chances are slim unless the law can be changed
the UNK were pushing two UNK along this pavement when the accident happened
three horses were being led down the lane opposite when one UNK across the road
thirteen year old keith and fourteen year old colin suffered severe injuries
five weeks later colin is still in intensive care
the boys were waiting to cross the road here and the horse came down this lane UNK straight across the road in front of the traffic then onto the pavement tried to jump over the boys and jumped onto the boys
and colin finished up just down here on the pavement and keith maybe a few yards further down er with very bad injuries
he's had to have his UNK out his UNK has burst inside him
erm that was a bad time er a critical time they didn't know if he were gonna live or die then erm he's had a number of UNK to keep him alive but er he's stable at the moment
in cases like this the solicitor says the law favours the horse owner rather than the victims
it does seem extraordinary and indeed we're hoping that we can change the law with this case
because really in my view it should be that once something like this happened then it should be on the owners to prove they haven't been UNK
that there should be a presumption of negligence and for them to show that they've done nothing wrong
i don't want anybody to go through what we've been through
it's hell
i don't want erm i to wish this on my worst enemy
it's a nightmare
the families are now appealing for witnesses
today the owners of the horse were UNK for comment but their solicitor said that while they accepted the horse broke loose they do not accept liability and are UNK any claim the horse caused the boys' injuries
a UNK who thought that he'd won more than a hundred thousand pounds on a bet has today been told that he'll get just seven hundred and twenty eight pounds
after five months of arguments a special committee has ruled that the bet wasn't valid
phil who's seventeen and works as a UNK in mansfield UNK in nottinghamshire thought he'd won one hundred and sixteen thousand pounds by correctly UNK the first three horses in the derby
UNK accepted the bet without hesitation but claimed afterwards that their rules clearly state they can't take on such UNK
they agreed to pay him thirty three thousand pounds but he rejected the offer
today the UNK betting disputes committee met in london and ruled in UNK favour
now phil will get just seven hundred and twenty eight pounds the thirty three thousand pounds offer is no longer on the table
you're watching central news here in the east midlands coming up next police appeal for information after a horse is UNK to death
cash help for UNK still waiting for UNK training
and boring or brilliant are the christmas lights going up too early
an investigation has started into an attack on a pony which was left dead and UNK in a field
the police say it was one of the worst attacks that they've seen on a horse
police were called in after the fourteen month old grey UNK was found dead on a farm on road in lincoln
the attack happened on saturday night or early sunday morning
police say a sharp instrument possibly a knife was used to UNK the animal
they describe the attack on the pony as UNK and are appealing for information
anybody who might have been er at the UNK store on saturday any time during the day who might have seen the pony or even people who walk their dogs because the UNK used quite extensively for dog walkers
the police are appealing to horse and pony owners to be extra UNK
detectives investigating the murder of a woman at her home are following up new leads
they're appealing for help in UNK a red car
who was thirty was UNK at her house in the UNK area of derby
the car was parked near her home on road last tuesday
the body was discovered that night
meanwhile two people who were held for questioning over the weekend have been released without charge
figures just out show that coal UNK have risen by five hundred percent over the past ten years
it comes just days after the announcement that even more east midlands pits could be closed down
the figures released by the government show clearly the economic problems facing what's left of britain's mining industry
in the ten years between nineteen eighty two and nineteen ninety two UNK have risen from four million tons to twenty million tons
during the same period sales to the domestic market fell from one hundred and seven million tons to eighty million
and as a result the amount of coal produced by britain's deep mines has fallen substantially
the government says these are the harsh economic UNK faced by the industry
mining unions who've been told even more pits may soon close say the government must do more to secure orders
meanwhile residents have begun a campaign to stop a former pit being turned into a waste recycling plant
the scheme could provide more than a hundred jobs
the UNK all live within sight of UNK colliery which shut down a year ago
the u d m is planning to set up a giant recycling plant here to provide employment for an area badly hit by pit closures
local people say they don't want it
UNK dust pollution children getting run over on the roads road traffic
i don't think any of the committee disagree with the fact that people want jobs
this is what we're not against that
er but it's at what cost to the environment that these jobs are provided
some of these residents have lived in this road particularly all their lives and they've suffered the UNK of living next to a pit and are absolutely horrified er at the prospects of what is basically going to be a scrap yard
a decision on whether the plant will be given the go ahead will be taken early next year
hospital authorities are worried because UNK and nurses aren't getting enough training in a fast developing new form of surgery
so called UNK surgery is being UNK as the way most operations will be carried out in the future but only a minority of UNK can actually do it
now thousands of pounds is being spent to make sure that they know all about it
for this patient at leicester general hospital the t v screens are what make the operating theatre different
shortly the screens will give the surgeon their only view of the UNK
the operation is one of hundreds that have been carried out in the last few years by UNK surgery
the area of surgery has expanded at an incredible speed from virtually from nothing three years ago to taking over as much as fifty percent or even seventy five percent of general surgery
but the training of UNK and operating teams for UNK surgery isn't keeping up with demand so trent health authority is spending a hundred and fifty thousand pounds on a training centre at leicester general
around the country there have been isolated examples of operations going wrong perhaps because UNK have not had good enough training
for the patients UNK surgery means no big UNK
it's done through holes a centimetre across
there's less pain and a quicker recovery
for the surgeon suddenly everything's in UNK
a lot of the operations now i do i think i can do better that i'm now seeing detail that i never saw before with the naked eye
at the moment it's mainly UNK bladder and UNK patients who benefit but the skills the leicester general will be passing on should mean more UNK will be having operations through the UNK too
apologies if you're eating your tea
a city council has come under fire for putting up its christmas lights too early
some businessmen say they're losing trade as a result because people are getting bored with christmas weeks before it arrives
UNK
here in the town hall square in leicester the city engineers are starting the UNK of the christmas lights
already there are lights everywhere in leicester but no sign of christmas
many businessmen say the big switch on is proving a big switch off for shoppers
lights and everything like that is lovely to see but you see they've got lights here in leicester which other cities and places haven't got
we've so we've got an extended night lighting er display going on for er two months or more
other retailers don't agree and say the lights are essential to creating a happy and relaxed mood in the run up to christmas
but many shoppers aren't so convinced
christmas doesn't start until the end of december really or twenty fifth of december and you've got guy UNK to come yet and halloween and all that
i think it UNK it for children it makes them it seems too long for them they're looking forward to christmas
i always feel it takes some of the magic away if you put things up too early
leicester city council says that with forty thousand light UNK to install it doesn't really have any alternative to starting so early
we to put the UNK up in th in a s in a short time limit the UNK take quite a long time to put up and as you know the UNK are erm are very famous er they're nationally recognized
with signs the recession is ending the next two months will show whether the leicester lights help or UNK
now though it's time for the break and coming up after that crossing the channel with those magnificent men in their UNK
in sport UNK speedy chops forest down and preparing to take america by storm
two businessmen have just completed an UNK journey which has taken them across the english channel in a UNK aircraft
they took up flying for a hobby and say all you need is courage and a taste for UNK
a little UNK a little UNK the start of a thousand mile journey that would test UNK to the limit
pilots philip and ian began their challenge in UNK france
the aim to compete against the elements and fly the craft safety home to nottinghamshire
the flight was a tribute to a fellow UNK who died earlier this year from cancer
ten thousand feet up there's just you and the clouds
with no telling when a sudden UNK of UNK can mean a sudden landing
not far from the channel the two surprised a french farmer and his family when forced to land UNK
we put down er obviously a local UNK came along to see what was actually happening and actually bent over backwards to help us
it was absolutely terrific
er they actually took us to the petrol station to get more fuel and after a er five course lunch with the local farmer and his family er which was all very nice and er not too much wine of course as you can well appreciate erm we UNK the UNK and they came along and er closed the main road for er approximately twenty minutes and we took off on a road
the next stage of the journey was the most UNK the crossing of the english channel
the last time a group of pilots attempted the trip an engine failed a pilot UNK and UNK
but this time success
back on the ground in nottinghamshire philip has nothing but praise for his flying machine
tell us about the UNK it's behind you on a machine like this
yes it's er actually pushing you along rather than the sort of conventional aeroplane light aircraft er which normally er pull you along
erm as you can see it's er had quite a lot of damage on it since we actually came back but er it's been a very UNK er UNK and engine
it's er the actual engine is er a UNK five eight two and er it never let us down once
er we're really we're really pleased with it
and the next journey an even greater challenge
a UNK flight across china
wow and from those UNK heights to the new depths that forest has sunk to here's keith with all today's sport
mm and in our magnificent monday UNK we pay our regular visit to goal city
just the one at leicester but strike makes the foxes that top dogs
and derby are on the UNK of promotion too after UNK crystal palace at the b g walker wings in as the UNK pinch a point against portsmouth
there's no hanging about here tonight it's straight into the action from all the weekend and we start with the big match at UNK street leicester city against nottingham forest
UNK new stand will be ready by christmas
some of the UNK street faithful reckon they'll have UNK promotion by then too
was about to introduce a note of caution
leicester are on a high though this season while forest are very hit and miss
david certainly more hit than miss goal number eight of the season coming from this corner
you just can't keep a good man down even if he is only five foot seven
ironically leicester are heading for the top using brian UNK style of passing football and it's forest who are UNK to more of the long ball game
leicester particularly dangerous from set pieces too
a speedy show
it's all going wrong for forest just when frank UNK thought his problems were coming to an end
even stan could only find one opening
my fellow UNK i will never ever forget how proud i was to say those words fellow UNK my first as a UNK after being UNK some thirteen years ago
that same feeling of pride and excitement is here today and i use those so meaningful words to UNK you as your national president
fellow UNK i thank you most sincerely for the honour and opportunity you have given me to become your UNK national president
round table more than anything else is about people
it is people who make things happen it is people who bring that special UNK of fun and fellowship
it is people who give you encouragement and support to turn ideas and dreams into reality and it is people who become friends
in this regard i couldn't have been more fortunate
and my enormous thanks go to my own table UNK seventy six very true friends indeed and the same for the whole of my own area thirty six UNK and the UNK where nothing has been too much trouble and they are here today as you've just seen in some considerable strength
they have been absolutely incredible and i would like to publicly record my deep affection for everything they have done and are continuing to do
my p l c under the UNK of UNK mark has been wonderful and the encouragement i have received from seeing the enthusiasm and commitment of the very young UNK as i UNK invited twenty year old UNK to be involved in the p l c has given me considerable optimism for the future of round table
most importantly there will be one person affected more than me in the year ahead
she's the UNK that keeps together our family life my business life at the same time has always been supportive of my involvement in round table
UNK from the bottom of my heart thank you for your willingness to share thirteen years of round table and the twelve months of presidency ahead
fellow UNK i will never ever forget my first a g m in manchester
UNK who is here today was president and i attended with my own table chairman at that time david who not only encouraged me to attend my first a g m but encouraged me to get involved in ri in round table right from the very UNK
he helped to get me hook round table did the rest
UNK that day and UNK late and david later when retiring used the UNK words please take care of my table
it is now our responsibility in the year ahead to care for this movement which is so dear to our hearts to those who have gone before and to the young members who with our encouragement will be involved in the future
the membership issue now has the profile it deserves and demands at table area and national levels and this must be continued
if the answer lies anywhere it lies in the hearts and minds of UNK
all i'm gonna do is add to what keith said earlier today and encourage you fellow UNK to use your hearts and minds over the next twelve months in this direction
there is good news from the tax man our UNK on subscriptions has been accepted and we are due a refund
this could be a substantial amount of money and it is important in the year ahead that we debate fully how this should be invested in the future of r t b i
the forward planning committee will be asked to seek your views and bring the proposal to the a g m in UNK
round table day is made for table and table only and has all the best features which are UNK in this movement
each table or area doing its own thing in its own way and as an association moving UNK in unison
it will be a day which will be inevitably based on fun on fellowship and on UNK others
whilst at the same time improving our public image and increasing our awareness
i would very much therefore like to think that round table day on the nineteenth of march nineteen ninety four next year will be the success that you wish to make it
focusing our UNK and our efforts UNK
i promised in my five minute address last year that i would be a UNK and i've already listened to many of your views over the last twelve months and indeed today
i promise you that i will continue to listen and where i can i will do my best to respond to the wishes of the ideals of and the aspirations of this movement that i hold so dear
the opportunity to serve you and to meet you over the next twelve months i look forward to enormously and while i'm not UNK enough to think that i can move mountains in the year ahead or naive enough to think that i can please everybody fully fellow UNK i promise you i will not let you down
