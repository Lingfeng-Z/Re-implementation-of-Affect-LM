and it and we had to collect twenty cans and then when you've collected twenty cans that is enough for one trees one tree and it is gonna be planted in sherwood forest and it's going to stay there for hundreds and hundreds of years
and then we're sent a whole lot of UNK so we could test out the cans were
and then UNK been collecting a whole lot with and everything and she's got the most
and she has a hundred and forty and he's UNK of cans for the his mum and UNK been getting some cans for the shop for his granddad and i've been asking for permission to go into the dump and get some for there
and erm the girls they have UNK four hundred and twenty four cans and the boys have UNK two hundred and sixty eight and altogether we're collecting nine hundred and ninety five cans with the whole school
how many trees will that give you
don't have a clue
quick calculation here
divided by how much in the school do we know
i'll get something like no
about twenty four trees
er no er there was a lot
a lot
a lot a really lot
are the trees just for sherwood forest
i think they're just going to be planted there
no they're not no
no
no
no
no
don't
they're not the whole scheme though is for third world countries isn't it
mhm yeah
and did david UNK have an have something to do with it
yeah he had something to do with it and we're gonna have thirty four trees
thirty four how mu
mhm
thirty four point nine five isn't it
seven five seven five yeah
thirty four point seven five trees so far
yeah
well done
and there's and erm we're doing a project on conservation and actually helping the conservation as well and erm as well cos so them up and it's and it's UNK good for our own project
and we're well erm getting a whole of trees planted and field there cos her field is hardly ever used and we gonna be getting a whole lot of trees for that
we're going ask permission for that and that's really it
so you're not going to be able to see UNK school for the trees very soon
erm they'll be i don't know when we getting them i think it's maybe next spring or sometime yeah
UNK are you going to speak to me about art from UNK
i suppose so
well erm made models with stones and other rubbish that we found about the place and a whole pile of had still standing
we er put a flag on the top and a sort of plant pot stuck on the top of that and then me and UNK we made a erm we put to stones and we filled that with UNK and had a aerial stuck in it
and that looked pretty funny like and it fell down a couple of days ago and maybe a pretty while afore that i dunno
and erm well we wrapped up a whole pile of paper for paper recycling and erm we UNK it up and the best of the stuff we put in the UNK and erm we put it in a tank and UNK left some stuff as it were and we UNK some other stuff green
and erm for summer then we put some here and some UNK and it made it look kind of UNK like but mr davis our art teacher just thought it would make it look more interesting
and erm we did UNK some folk did monster outside the door
s er got one lone piece and it's got a piece of wedge and it's got another piece sticking up and something sticking out of that piece of branch or something sticking out of that
looks right sight and there's chair in that room as well
and erm we collected a whole lot of colour glass and we stuck it on the window and it's a UNK glass window y know
it's lovely i thought it was the real thing
looks like nothing from outside though
it looks lovely from here
yeah well that's really it i think
right
up and call me now a little music as well we have on the show we have a video from UNK to give away in the second half of the programme and star guest this afternoon is mary UNK
oh ho UNK dan and erm UNK out the UNK
hello that's a nice way to start it isn't it
good morning good afternoon whatever you like to call o never mind you know the number
now er we're going to start this morning talking about animals
more specifically why we're so cruel to them
britain must be an animal erm a country of animal UNK looking at the statistics
why do we hate animals so much
if you have a view on that o nine o four six four one six four one and i'd like to hear from you all you have to do is pick up the phone and give me a f a call now sorry
did karen say to somebody on that thing did i hear her say what are you on
she looked at me and said that when i walked in this morning
what are you on
i didn't like to tell her is was UNK but there we are
anyway erm we've been hearing on this programme recently of course that er people are against hunting against fishing er they say it's cruel
but they are willing quite willing apparently to give and receive pets as presents and millions of them end up getting abused UNK and destroyed
every year we see that UNK little puppy on the television screen and every year thousands of people give pets for christmas
the r s p c a have to pick up the pieces and they've launched a campaign to try and stop it and joining me now is alan
is this alan UNK alan
correct yeah
ok you're the superintendent for the north east of england that covers this area too
i'm the chief superintendent that covers the north east of england yes
ok
so you're the big boss are you
one of them
one of them
have you er polished your brass today got it all ready to talk to me i hope you have
now sorry alan i've got to turn you up a bit you don't mind do you
no not at all
it won't hurt there we are that's nice ok
now alan first of all er have we learned anything do you think over the years or do we seem to be getting worse
sadly the things seem to be getting worse
er we the society try our very best to get over the message to people just before christmas
please don't give a pet for christmas
but unfortunately er it seems to fall on many deaf ears and we the society as other many charities who deal with animals are left to pick up the pieces
why is it seems to me also and i may be totally wrong here but it seems people who are least likely to look after themselves are the ones who want to have animals
i mean you see them walking around particularly people who go for the big dogs you see them walking around with a big thick UNK the UNK the er the boots and the jeans rolled up
well i think that's a little bit to do with a bit of macho image
erm and er perhaps it's the owners wanting to look rather big
unfortunately they don't think before they get the pet that you've got to look after it
it takes
but an
time it takes money
another thing is of course it's all pets it isn't just dogs and cats
that's right yes
i mean people have er UNK or er another sort of bird and they think it doesn't need any looking after
that's right
er just before christmas you see people think that buying a christmas present er that's easy
once you've er got over the UNK of it the thing can be put in away in a UNK can be put back in it's box
but with an animal it's for life
er you've got to look after it
you've got to UNK a lot of time to the care and attention that it requires
i heard the other day what i thought was one of the best advertisements not to have an animal for christmas very UNK er i think it was for the r s p c a and i i'm told i don't think you've heard it but it b basically it's er the sound of a er well it's a human pretending to be a dog really and saying you know well this is nice my er family have taken me to the vet i didn't think i was ill but never mind
oh here comes a nice man with er an injection
ah perhaps they're going to give me some UNK
yes
and it goes on and on like this until the voice is erm i can't feel anything any more
yes it's it was one of the er advertisements or programmes that went out on radio er again this is why i've been trying to get over to people the sad things that have to happen to animals
erm we hate putting animals to sleep
in fact it was the UNK policy now that we won't put animals to sleep unless there is an extreme er cause for that the sick UNK
erm and we're attempting to try to get over to people please think before you get a pet
why is it that in the north of england particularly in this region of the north of england we seem to be worse than anywhere else
i don't think you are
now i've spent seventeen years in UNK and yes that er
they hate UNK in UNK did you know that
found a UNK they monkey
i wasn't going to say anything the UNK hotel
they hung it
er yes and there's one hanging behind their door
er the thing is that the people in the northeast yes er there is a lot more work done up there by the society but you know since i've been down in UNK i have found that the northeast is not alone
there are many other areas in the country where animals are seriously abused
the northeast isn't the only place
mm
ok thank you very much indeed er chief superintendent
and pa pat i don't think i don't hold out any hope at all that people will pay any attention they will go they'll see a little puppy somewhere they'll say oh that's lovely we'll buy that for tommy er and then tommy will abuse it totally and er they'll say well the dog was a waste of time it didn't work properly and er didn't know how to er how to look after itself
may i just say that the majority of people will care for their animals but it is those people who buy we have s er cases where erm people will turn up on christmas day and say to their elderly relative we bought you a puppy
the elderly relative hadn't didn't want a puppy
never ever wanted a puppy because it makes them a UNK person
mm
they've got to look after something
and this is where the society is called in er to look after that puppy
or just after christmas usually between christmas and new year
we're called to waste ground behind pet shops a any place to pick up boxes of unwanted UNK that have obviously been er planned for selling to people er before christmas
good alan thank you very much indeed
you're very welcome
let er let's hope it'll mm won't be like that er mm this er this year
now he says deep intake of breath don't have a puppy for christmas
do as i do have turkey instead
i'm playing this one because i like it
it's a little a little fresh UNK music from new UNK from the and i can say that er that's why i'm playing it really
o nine o four six four one six four one any calls about dogs or er any other sort of animal you want to give us a ring call us now
which er probably rude i dunno it's just
er b c radio york you are not in the south of france but as it is UNK around the county at the moment i thought you know a little french flavour
was it the UNK wasn't it this week was it
everybody seems to be UNK around here i thought it was thursday it was wasn't it
could anybody bring us a bottle down here you know because that would be nice wouldn't it on a on a cool saturday afternoon here as we sit UNK the grand UNK of york
it would be nice to have just a little UNK of the erm of the new UNK
has anybody UNK it
i haven't UNK it anybody taste give me a call
i cos quite frankly i have never heard such an exciting r s p c a man as that last one so i don't expect to get much response to that
er so let's talk about the can't hear can he he's not up in this area
no he doesn't know does he
er stuff it
ah anyway so erm i don't think anybody's bothered about er fish and chips arrived have they
everybody's in there
thing about this programme it is so it is so crucial to everything that goes on at radio york while it is happening they eat in the other room that's how much er interest there is they eat in the other room
tour buses around york
should they be banned
should we get rid of them
is york a big enough city to have them
you know the open UNK buses where they go round they hold up the traffic
i know the tourists are very important to york but for goodness sake it isn't a huge city can't they walk round
why can't they walk round
i think if we got rid of all those open UNK tour buses in york traffic would be a lot easier
what do you think
give me a call you know the number o nine o four six four one six four one
you can ring now
you can ring about anything you want actually
anything you feel like you can ring i'm really you know
shame of the UNK oh no i don't think we'll do that er look through the sun see if there's anything interesting erm in there i've got nothing in the UNK
UNK chris UNK worth around eight million is UNK that he's got no money
what has he done with his money
what has got he didn't give me any
oh he's bought a big house has he
ok
usual sort of sex drugs rock and roll as you get in the papers on a saturday as well
or is he the best dress man too
chris UNK is the best dressed man
that'll upset jonathan ross he always thought he was
er o nine o four six four one six four one
anybody who can UNK by the way the er theme to the television programme UNK and i would be interested to hear from you as well
now as the united nations doesn't have enough on its plate dealing with the problems on earth and obviously they're er they're there at the forefront of everything that happens
action is being demanded to track down possible visitors from outer space and this is serious
a small group UNK have UNK a protest outside the u n headquarters in new york calling for an end to what they say is a cover up over the existence of u f os
one of the UNK michael UNK says president clinton is scared to acknowledge that superior beings do exist
the united states er government is afraid as are other governments to admit er to their people that there is a higher form of life
obviously if the u f os touch down that would mean they would be charge and not bill clinton at the white house
okay well er i figure that there must be quite a number of er UNK around north yorkshire and i thought it would be quite nice actually if er if there are any UNK listening at the moment they could ring in and we could have a chat
so if erm if you yeah yes e t e t phoned when what do you want
i'm not even speaking to you because of that flipping letter
i mean i just noticed it i read sorry karen walked into the studio totally UNK through a red light
that's a particular no i mean you know for goodness sake can't we UNK can't we actually ob observe studio discipline
what you doing
just shutting that up a bit
that's my UNK if i want it open i'll leave it open
don't UNK yourself
there we are you see
just UNK mind haven't you really
er the individual responsible for this is your letter from the er director of er the officers of the director UNK broadcasting principle assistant UNK to the director general
get bert on the phone i want a word with him now
come on you lot you know where he is get him on the phone i want to talk to him
the individual responsible for this unacceptable behaviour shall remain UNK protect his listening and viewing UNK suffice it to say that his name suggests that he is capable of making a big UNK
is this the sort of person that's running the b c
i don't believe he wrote this
erm likes to UNK a lot and is never happier than when he is UNK up all the small UNK in the world
this is
the d g joins me in wishing you every success in your future career
you're UNK for big things obviously
i wondered whether you were erm i wonder whether you were for the bullet or not

that's between UNK and UNK at the moment and slight delays are possible there
also on the a one in the UNK area the inside lane of the south bound UNK closed at UNK for emergency gas repair works and delays are likely as a result there
in selby there's a demonstration taking place this afternoon it starts at half past one and will go via UNK road and UNK road and some traffic delay delays are likely as a result
also in york today traffic near to the UNK could be slow due to an event taking place there
in the ripon area weekend roadworks mean the road will be closed as it passes under the a one bridge delays are likely as a result
at UNK on forest UNK main bridge over the a sixty four is closed for UNK work through to six o'clock on monday morning

hello i'm fine thank you
what are you on here for
because er because i was invited on to speak about current educational issues
oh that's good i couldn't you see it's very difficult for me you know i have to look up there i can never distinguish one call from another
right
do you have a UNK do you want me to your a title do you have er
i'm press officer for north yorkshire national union of teachers
yeah
yo you're very lucky actually noel that this is not erm a quiz show
shall i tell you for why
why
i'll tell you why cos the b c there's a directive just gone out i've just been informed the b c for quiz show UNK on the b c to treat their guests with a little more UNK
can you believe it
how much more flipping civil can you get
have you heard these quiz sho i mean they're all on radio four aren't they
all the quiz show yeah basically
well UNK radio one as well
mm where do you live anyway
in leeds
oh good
mm it's freezing outside isn't
it certainly is yes
what are we talk oh education we're talking about education right yep
okay let me do the UNK right er noel that's a funny name noel by the way isn't it
it's erm appropriate for the time of the year nearly
mm it's like pulse but not
oh er yes
is that how you pronounce it
erm it is pronounce to
not the noel y yeah okay
anyway right so erm head teachers in the area have been complaining their schools are not tidy not cleaned sufficiently
yes
why
i mean why are our children going to school in pig UNK
well i think it's er down to the competitive tendering process where the county council has had to put out the cleaning contracts for schools to tender
there were problems a few years ago when it first started with th the initial contract which was won by the county's own direct service organization and now it seems we're having a repeat of those problems
er with the new contracts that started in september erm basically it seems that some teachers are having to do bits of cleaning themselves to keep their classroom up to up to scratch up to the standards they ought they ought to be
erm we're hearing reports that parts of schools having to be closed or th threatened to be closed because they're not sufficiently UNK for pupils or teachers to work in
oh how disgusting
and er
that is isn't that disgusting
it certainly is yes
that is disgusting yes
so all these a lot of these firms are not up to the job why do why don't you sack them people are not up to the job why don't they get sacked
well there are monitoring systems which are meant to be in place a and which may be er are not are not effective enough erm
i mean i've heard representatives for county council th this week saying that er as far as they were concerned th the standards weren't sufficiently low yet for them t to take action
but basically th every time the contract comes up for renewal what will happen for a company to attempt to win the contract it's got to cut the hours of its employees and its also got to try and c cut the costs erm by cutting pay and that's the way that's the way contracts are won in this situation and as long as that keeps happening then the UNK going to get UNK worse
what are we going i mean we we've heard also i'm changing the subject now because that was the sort of political answer i'd expect and er i suppose until i get somebody else come on and say he's talking absolute whatever er i mean i think it is down to the people who live and work with the school
i think if you all make a mess you should be severely UNK quite frankly expect other people to come round and pick up your mess
well that's something that a as a teacher we're erm in my school we're constantly saying t to the pupils i mean if they ha they have a they have a certain responsibility t to tidy up after them and t to try and keep their work area tidy that's not the same as er as cleaning at the end of the day as sweeping up all the dust and so on
what about this UNK army of teachers is this going to come to UNK as some point or not
i don't i don't believe it is erm at the mo well earlier this week a report was published by the national commission on education which was er an independent erm commission that was set up erm and they they've said that basically what we need to be doing is t if we're trying to raise standards is to keep the idea of having an all graduate UNK profession followed up by high quality for train training for teachers once they've actually started work
the problem there is that graduates are so terribly boring and UNK people basically aren't they that they find it difficult to UNK their er
you would
i would yes
you're a graduate
i am yes
yeah i thought so anyway
er i
would have thought that graduates find it more difficult to UNK knowledge to people than anybody else
no i'd i don't i don't believe that that's the case erm
karen come to the studio please
karen come to the studio please
karen co sorry i just want to do something go on
yeah so okay i'm
i don't think that's the case
i'm winding you up a little bit but no i mean there's a little method in this
when are the teachers going to stop being political animals and get down to teaching rather than try to score points off the government
oh we're
cos anybody can score points off them i mean it's simple
we well we'd love to be able to get on with our job and er wi with far less interference than we receive at the moment but er when government UNK on er on UNK to the extent it does an and there have been well i've been reading recently so something like five hundred new powers the education secretary has given himself in the in over the last few years
well he's not going to be there for ever
decisions are made decisions are made erm there that we and we have to live with the consequences of them
if they affect education then it's our responsibility to speak up about them
you see i think er probably one of the best erm ministers of er of er education that er has been for quite some considerable time and i bet you throw your hands up in horror when i say this you will totally disagree and i'm talking here cos his name's just slipped out of my mind
who was tha who was that oh for goodness sake tall thin UNK looking man always had to have about fifteen UNK of sugar in his coffee whenever i met him
s sir keith joseph
er you knew you see sir keith joseph
now i remember talking to him for hours once on a programme about education and this was when he first said what we want is teachers to be accountable
and i'm a great believer in everybody should be accountable right
yes
we well i've no objections to that to that at all
no none of you do now but when he first suggested it everyone was up in arms and he poor old soul i remembered he said i've had enough change i believe in this i i've tried i'm too old now and out he walked
is there a chocolate machine in the building
and off he went
he was UNK to chocolate
i think erm a lot of teachers would now look back on those days with er a certain UNK now bearing in mind what's happened since and the succession of education secretaries we've had since then i mean had the only one in recent years who i would say has attempted a genuine dialogue with the teachers and tried to do something constructive is john UNK
so when and i would agree with you again so when are the teachers going to be accountable when is somebody who is a bad teacher and heck there are quite a few of them you know it only takes a couple in every school to make it difficult for the rest going to be got rid of you know you are not up to the mark out
there are systems in place in schools already for that and there always have been
you UNK with me now come on we're being serious noel if you are a teacher it is almost impossible to sack you
almost totally impossible
that's simply not true
there are disciplinary procedures in all schools erm which are there to be used
why are they never used then
are all teachers too good to be sacked because it is it is as rare as erm teeth in chickens
i think it's i think it's very easy to er to ex UNK the problem to take one UNK evidence of one about one or two cases and maybe about one or two people and say this is a major problem in every school
let me put it this way to you noel
i don't think it is
let me put it to you this way you know as well as i do people who really ought to be doing something else other than teaching
you know that as well as i do and those people don't seem to be given the encouragement to move on to another profession
i
some are some are promoted to head teachers i know and i knew you were going to say that
i wasn't going to say that no
erm no i honestly don't think that er that the problem is as big as big as you say it is and i think the structures are there to deal with that and if people had you know if people used them then they would they would work and they from time to time that they are used and you know it is not impossible to get rid of rid of a teacher in the way you are suggesting
okay noel thank you for your er your time and being a good sport this afternoon and i hear you have a little one you had better go back and sort things out
that's right
okay
okay thanks
thanks a lot noel bye
noel from the er n u t
erm i don't know what this is serious point actually if you fancy yourself as one of these so called mums and i think it is a little UNK the er title of a UNK army of teachers if you think that maybe you could do that and you'd be interested in doing that and you think it's quite a good idea i'd be interested in hearing from you all right
o nine o four serious talk o nine o four six four one six four one erm if you'd like to do that give me a call

er i wanted to talk to jim UNK you see about this quiz show host ought to be a little nicer than they are and apparently his answer machine is on at home
well i must admit james i've threatened to put mine on
have you
well karen said that if i won the competition she'd ring back
mm and then you thought oh god i've done it now
but i had to speak to you see and i UNK you while you actually said on the air that anyone that won had to speak to you and said to karen look if you ring back i'll put the answer phone on
i know i thought that was good because then everybody puts the phone down you see and they all think they're going to be terribly clever
yes i think it depends on what kind of a message you actually have on your recorder to start off with
is UNK rude
no it just says that it's basically to the effect of that the answering machine is quite reliable
i
and if you leave a message it will be dealt with and people do leave a message whereas before when it just said i'm sorry i'm not available they didn't they just put the phone down
i usually leave a message saying i'm having sex at the moment ring back in about three seconds
and do they
sometimes they never ring back at all ever
i should've just say you're UNK
yes you're right you been speaking to my wife
well yeah we'll probably use the same supermarket i don't know
so listen i wan er so is there any snow out there at all anywhere
no UNK
there's not
any chips out there
well to be honest UNK i can't see that far normally from where i live i can see the white horse bank but it's UNK in UNK at the moment erm no i can't see so i couldn't tell you whether there is snow up there or not
okay
i also i also erm er what was i going to say i would take the disc but i can't find a way of getting into this machine actually it's broken erm
it sounds about par for the b c
young danny the big boss now weekend said er take a disc take a disc and i said yeah well it's UNK er erm
what
sorry
i'm doing that talking to you look for jim UNK mobile phone number so i thought we'd give him a ring that'll surprise him UNK it
yeah
okay er
can the b c afford these phone calls
i don't think so no i don't think so at all that's why they don't call anybody back
oh well you can call me back
erm oh hang on just a minute can you hang on there
yeah well UNK waiting
i'll get to you in a minute
for his lunch but it doesn't really matter
no stuff that who cares
er
hungry
he well so am i
actually i was hoping someone's going to bring in some er some UNK cos a new one came out on thursday
is there nobody round here listening that can erm that could bring in some UNK no little off licence that will do this free publicity on the b c to come in a say look i'm an odd bin or something like that
i thought the b c i thought the b c couldn't advertise then
no the b c can't
but you can
well
you're the exception to the rule i suppose
yes you wait till you get severely beaten and then you say i'm very sorry i didn't mean to do that
hang on hang on i've got rachael from er from guide friday buses
oh UNK hang on just a minute
i think i think i think you've probably UNK a UNK nest up with that
hang on just a minute
er rachael
rachael
hello
is that you rachael
yes it is
god i've been in love with you ever since i met you all those where are you at the moment
i'm actually in the office in tower street over looking
are you
UNK tower
why don't you wonder over here
there isn't actually a bus in oh yes there is a bus in sight
why don't you wonder over here and bring a bottle of wine and we'll share it over the next hour of the show
oh i can't i've got things to do in the office a busy company here
i never did like those open UNK buses
well unclear
so i'll be back to you
at the moment i can see about half well a dozen people sat on one of the buses
can you
yes
no wonder there's no traffic moving out there today
there is traffic moving it's moving quite freely apart from the cars going into the car park just behind UNK tower
is that right
that's right yeah
there's never any spaces behind UNK tower so i don't know how you're just telling me UNK aren't you
well they're all they're all UNK up to go in there so i not sure
i just don't understand all these buses with the open tops it's freezing out there and all these tourists look they could walk rachael
well are tourists
they could walk why don't they walk
it's a seven UNK tour
it takes an hour and a lot of people don't want to walk around the city they'd like the option of going around on the bus
what did the minister of health say the other day
UNK and lack of exercise
and that's what you're encouraging rachael
not encouraging lack of exercise we're encouraging an informative tour around the city with a qualified guide
you still got that beautiful UNK hair
we're not on the air are we
no we're not on the air
heaven UNK i wouldn't talk to you like this if we were on the air would i
anyway so go on
right
what were we talking about
so you don't mind
talking about the buses
yeah
so i mean i think it'd great guide friday you run around little flag in the air i've seen them in london and you can do that and people get so fit
not that you need to be any fitter than you are
well they are fit cos they get on and off at any of the stops they go along to the attraction that they want to do
yeah i walk from my front door to my car as well and people say that's not enough exercise
well the a there's the UNK centre for the exercise perhaps they should encourage the tourists there then
mm forgetting all about oh dear i've got a UNK when i go on the air i'll clear that
er can you hang on a minute
yes certainly
i just got a we commercial breaks call you back in a minute don't go away yet
rita

erm
you look similar

it's not
it is
yeah
i thought when we did we did that programme out to lunch in the summer and you came along and we talked all about buses and er your organization and i was very nice to you actually
you were very pleasant
and didn't say you know it's flipping these tour buses in york that cos all the other people trouble because you can't get anywhere they UNK the roads up
well that's really not our problem i mean that's to do with the UNK of er bus companies allowing any anybody to start up a bus company
oh that's a bit political rachael isn't it a bit political i wasn't expecting that
UNK the last er three years some of the other companies have only been here since last year and the year before so i mean we're a national tour operator
experienced in running open UNK tours around cities

oh hang on the ex directory UNK ringing
that's the boss he'll be complaining
so there's no chance of getting rid of all these coaches and getting people to walk round the er the guided tours and stuff like that
er well that would defeat the whole object of offering the open UNK tours if people were actually walking
well it would defeat you making a few bob
there is actually there is actually walking tours around the city for those people who wish to opt for
mm
for a walking tour
so there is the option of doing both the walking tour or the bus tour

in york travel near the
UNK very UNK
UNK could be slow due to an event taking place and york city are playing UNK at UNK today so traffic will be fairly busy around that area
in selby a demonstration is taking place this afternoon it starts at one thirty and will go via UNK road and UNK road and some traffic delays are likely

er to crash a er right let me just read er right er okay
what
it's quite wrong to er ring oh yeah right okay
to crash a plane into UNK
to crash a plane into UNK around about the anniversary of UNK it isn't funny at all it's not funny and it's not clever
well what do people think about it
well what do you mean what do people think they're not out there they've all gone flipping sunday shopping
shall we call our dot his name isn't alan UNK
well what's his name
his name is erm richard er UNK which is why am i looking under t in my book
you are
i haven't got it there i haven't got it there haven't got it there
i mean he might be listening if he's listening perhaps er perhaps richard will ring in thank you
er right okay
i'm going now
what's that yellow light on there that shouldn't really be on should it that one over there look
that's a telephone line
oh all right okay
the participants for h two will have already discovered we are still tackling part of h one from yesterday but and i apologize that you will have to sit through the outstanding items of discussion
on the other hand you will have gathered already that we are going to talk about greater york so i think there may be some distinct benefit and merit in you being he here to listen to that er particular part of the topic now the i hope in fact that we can deal with the remainder of h one because it does lead quite UNK into the next issue which we want to talk about which is the new settlement in the greater york area er and i hope that we can get through this item by our morning break that but whenever we do conclude on h one we will have to have a slightly longer break just to enable the UNK arrangements to be sorted out properly for all participants who are involved in the discussion on the new settlement
now can i er also suggest to you that in discussing this one outstanding item of the housing land allocations we pursue virtually the same sort of approach that we did yesterday er and in fact if you look at what is set down under matter one d for discussion it says is the provision proposed for the greater york area including the new settlement appropriate etcetera and in fact when you look at the first item for discussion under the greater york new settlement issue we come straight into does greater york new settlement represent an appropriate and justified policy response etcetera
so what i'm going to ask effectively that when we are talking about the greater york element of the housing land allocation we concentrate on the question of is the level of provision enough
and we know there are various er responses to that question and i would be looking to the districts to say whether or not they could cope with the various levels of provision that have been identified for greater york and it's the view of whether they can cope within their own districts i haven't said how you can cope i said whether you can cope you might i will i will leave you free to make the odd comment but i want to focus on that part of the issue and then the natural UNK to that is will it be necessary or is it considered necessary in the context of this alteration to provide specific guidance within h one policy for the distribution of that er development to er at sub what i would call sub district level in other words do you want a specific entry for say ryedale or hambledon
has anyone got any questions on that approach
is it clear how i'd like to play it
er so with no more UNK i will ask mr davis for north yorkshire to present his opening statement and then i'd like mr curtis your moment has come mr curtis er to follow on from mr davis
thank you
peter davis north yorkshire county council erm i'd just like to make five brief points in response to the issues that have been raised erm on one d
the first of those points is the principle of a greater york dimension to the structure plan erm we'll all probably be aware that in the original structure plan the secretary of state wasn't prepared to accept a greater york dimension in the structure plan but did accept with the support of the district councils on the first alteration the inclusion of a greater york dimension
having that greater york dimension has certainly allowed progress to be achieved dramatically in greater york erm it's led to progress towards progress towards green belt definition and more importantly it's led towards resolution of future strategy for greater york
er we at the county council think that to delete that greater york erm dimension would take us back to the UNK of uncertainty past uncertainty in the greater york area we're therefore proceeding with a greater york dimension in policy h one at none thousand seven hundred dwellings which UNK to hundred percent migration
the second point i want to raise is the issue erm of the green belt er which is er a constraint in greater york erm we've made significant progress in moving towards the statutory definition of the green belt the green belt local plan has now completed erm its public enquiry and a lot of the deliberations in greater york have centred around the effect on of the green belt on development potential in greater york so that is a main issue i think in response to issues the discussion of issues in greater york
the third point which has come out in a number erm of comments certainly from the c p r e is the issue of UNK in the approved structure plan in respect to greater york and as we made clear in paragraph eight of our er erm position statement we accept that there has been in UNK terms in the period eighty one to ninety two something like fifteen percent UNK in terms of UNK er in that period
we would wish to stress again with the district council's support i suspect that UNK really it's to sites within the urban area as in windfall sites in general planning terms we have seen to be acceptable er in planning terms but we would wish to stress that part of that approach has been a continuing resistance to development on UNK sites on the edge of the urban area
the fourth point chairman er is the new settlement issue and while that's due for discussion on policy h two that issue does shall i suggest UNK policy h one because an appropriate form of words has to be agreed in policy h one to reflect the new settlement issue and as you'll be aware the county council is about a step by step approach towards the UNK of the new settlement erm strategy for greater york and then finally a specific issue that you mentioned is the distribution of developments between the greater york districts er within greater york now as you'll be aware chairman that has been done informally following the original structure plan in nineteen eighty the county and the districts got together and agreed the distribution of housing and employment land in greater york
following the first alteration when the secretary of state approved the greater york dimension that matter was resolved UNK between the county and the districts erm through the er greater york study so the issue therefore is there a need for more guidance for the structure plan to break down the greater york figure to individual greater york districts and our view quite clearly er is the answer that the answer to that is no
certainly it would be very difficult to introduce any statistical rational erm to the UNK of greater york to its district components bearing in mind the small populations er in some of the greater york er districts we think that the general level of detail erm in the structure plan is appropriate and we think to go down to any UNK detail would be an inappropriate to a structure plan and thirdly i think on that issue er we would think that it would prejudice erm the work that district council would want to do erm in their er local plans
so those chairman are the five points er that i wanted to raise on greater york and obviously we will be interested to hear the response round the table today
can i ask mr can i ask mr davis to give us a bit more explanation please as to his rationale behind continuing resistance to the development of UNK sites on the edge of york
peter davis north yorkshire county council erm i think the clear answer to that is that districts erm and county erm were very aware of the greenbelt constraints on greenbelt sites
but
erm adjacent to the urban area
are you saying that UNK development on the edge of york would be in the greenbelt as you have defined it in the deposited local plan
i'm talking about the UNK and my comments about UNK sites were related to period eighty one to ninety two and it became quite clear during the eighties that the sketch plan green belt or development was at that time through the eighties was by and large UNK onto the urban area that er through the eighties what everybody understood to the sketch plan green belt was tight up against er the urban area so in UNK urban UNK sites erm on the urban edge through the eighties the county council were recognizing the greenbelt constraints
that isn't quite the question i asked
unless you are telling me that the sketch greenbelt local plan is the same as the deposited greenbelt local plan
well
is there land between the current edge of development in york and the inner edge of the greenbelt which is as yet UNK
yes and then that approach was taken on through the greater york study and in the greenbelt local plan and the greater york study identified a number of sites
part a goes ninety one to ninety six part b ninety six to two thousand and six sites adjacent to the urban area in the greater york study er which were acceptable for development because UNK the districts and the county did not think that those sites discharged a greenbelt function as the greenbelt local plan was progressed those sites were excluded from the greenbelt erm and yes we did identify a number of sites which did not conflict with greenbelt objectives erm on the urban edge
are those sites within the city of york administrative area or other districts
the bulk of them erm i think almost without exception are erm in adjoining districts around york the significant contribution from york that we identified in the greater york study erm largely comes from UNK windfall sites by and large
which districts please
erm the bulk of the erm commitment erm or the or the sites that we identified er would be in would be in ryedale district in south ryedale
thank you thank you
mr curtis
thank you chair
david curtis york city council
i think some of my er introductory comments might now be inspector er understand the er sort of urban situation erm we heard yesterday about er discussion about the similarities between different districts in north yorkshire and the possible differences
i think everyone around the table would accept that in this situation york is unique
UNK a historic city of some hundred and four thousand people covering some two thousand nine hundred hectares but that city itself is only part of the settlement that i think we would all regard as york itself that covers a larger population of some a hundred and thirty five thousand people er contained er within the york outer ring road and UNK to the map submitted with my h one submission and also the greenbelt plan which we've just put up on the board there er will show you the broader extent of the urban area
clearly in that situation the city of york is highly constrained it's a modern industrial city with a very tight medieval core a historic core which is world UNK but a historic core which actually only covers four percent of the built area of the city itself when we look at that wider area erm the central historic core together with the eight other conservation areas in the city and conservation areas in the remainder of the urban settlement comes to some thirteen percent of the urban area
furthermore we have a series of major landscape features er which are been referred to in the greenbelt local plan and elsewhere as UNK which you'll see from the map enter into the very heart of the city itself
some six hundred hectares of that land is actually designated as greenbelt but in addition within that a number of those areas are er prevented from development in UNK we'd argue because a large part of that area has got a historic status as stray land which is a form of common land which means it's actually not available for any form of development similarly the flood planes of the river UNK in particular is for physical development reasons er prevented from development in many areas and those of you who were here this weekend will have no noticed the reason why it was a flooding that took that took place on the UNK valley in addition to those constraints open space within the city is at a premium erm the city falls below the UNK standard erm by er something like erm half a hectare per thousand population so compared with the UNK standard of two point four per thousand the city reaches a quite a generous erm UNK of the UNK space we have available only a total of two hectares per thousand therefore and this is very relevant to the greater york debate erm really the only land for development within the city is recycled land there are limited number of er sites which have not been developed in recent years erm which can be identified for development and are being identified for development in our draft local plan
but the majority of any development land in the city would be recycled either from housing uses or industrial uses
the draft of the city wide local plan will be going to the city council in december and prove of the consultation but the figures some of you've seen in our evidence have been a agreed by the local plan steering group who sit in council members er across party committee which has agreed the basic numbers so the draft allocations which are in our submission and which we have seen in the schedules yesterday are accepted as a basis for consultation by the city council but are clearly subject to review
turn turning then to just touch on the issues that i've we didn't cover yesterday for york erm you'll notice from our h one submission we have a slight difference of opinion with the county council on the technical side of the er the calculation we believe that the calculation we believe that the calculation for UNK need rather than three should be a four thousand figure taking into account the issue of concealed households and UNK sharing
however that doesn't have an effect on our er ability to agree a figure of three for the city itself in the structure plan because the work we've done on the local plan taking into account commitments and suitable allowances for small sites does indicate to us that a figure of three is achievable but would be extremely difficult to exceed the difference here between the four thousand and the three does however have an impact on our neighbours clearly and as was mentioned yesterday the city council does own some twenty nine hectares of land outside its current boundary er located in the ryedale district council area that land some of that land has planning consent the remainder is allocated in the draft southern ryedale local plan and was excluded from the greenbelt that land it is the city council's intention to use to meet its er requirements for affordable housing could accommodate some seven hundred dwellings i think it is very important for me to emphasize that is a very clear commitment of the city council and therefore that land in ryedale would not er in the majority of its case be available for open market use we would be seeking to use it to meet er affordable housing requirements
er the other point i would make about the figures under h one really is that erm the twelve thirty figures that you've seen in the tables is our best estimate at the present time based on the site survey we've carried out
that is a very comprehensive survey erm i wouldn't envisage any additional sites being recommended by the city council er at the present time although clearly some of the sites may be suggested by a private developers and UNK during the consultation process
it is quite possible clearly that number could be reduced during the consultation process on the on the local plan i think that's an important point because of the issue of windfall that was mentioned by mr davis and was raised yesterday reference to historic trends in the city of york do show that erm we have exceeded structure plan targets by substantial amounts i think the figure is forty percent or more er the county council could confirm that slightly difficult calculation to do because i'm sure you'll be aware that to our eternal shame the city council has not to date adopted a formal local plan with reference erm to your question on day one er as to whether or not we might calculate contribution of windfalls in the past we have looked at the nineteen eighty seven residential land availability er study which was agreed with the house builders adjacent districts and of course the county and in the five year period of that study by comparison with the sites that we agreed in the study an additional four hundred and thirty dwellings came forward and were completed on sites that had not been identified in the study now i'd i would say very clearly that level of windfalls erm would not continue in the future and it could not be a reliable basis for erm looking at windfall contributions in the city in the future clearly the supply of development land in the city is a is a UNK resource er given the constraints that are current holding and although some additional windfalls to the two hundred i'd suggested in my h one may come forward on the other hand i suspect some of the sites suggested in the draft local plan could fall out of the equation
just turning briefly to the issue of affordable housing you'll see from my h one submissions the city council has a target er which is in the york area housing strategy which is currently with the d o e for its consideration of something like a hundred and fifty dwellings a year giving over the fifteen year period a two thousand two hundred target how we will go about achieving that is primarily where it's possible using land we already own or is in ownership of housing associations and taking into account the seven dwellings outside the current city boundary we believe in total they will contribute some fifteen hundred dwellings towards that two thousand two hundred target this will leave clearly a significant shortfall and it will therefore be necessary to seek to negotiate if i can use the terms of p b g 3 erm with house builders as sites come forward in the local during the local plan period
turning now very briefly to the h one d the greater york issue clearly the comments i've made about the calculations for york have a knock on effect for our position on greater york the greater york figures as i understand it from the county council are based on a one hundred percent migration assumption if the technical difference between us er we are right then we believe clearly the greater york figure should be increased by an appropriate amount and the we've suggested the increased cut should be seven hundred er relating to the city itself i can't calculate with any great accuracy what the figure for the surrounding parts of greater york might be but it would be we suspect only another one to two hundred more on top of that therefore that UNK explains the reason why the city council suggests that the greater york should be increased to the ten four figure from the nine seven
the other concern in the city council's evidence on h one er is this issue of distribution i note mr UNK comments about the difficulties of UNK the greater york allocation between different districts and i do acknowledge the difficulty in relation to harrogate and particularly hambledon which obviously has a very small proportion of greater york on the other hand both ryedale and selby do contain a substantial proportion of the greater york population er based on my calculations of their er proportion of the population of greater york which admittedly is a somewhat crude way of doing estimates but in the absence of any other projections that was really the only way to do it my estimate is that the er compared with the nine seven target of county council would take in the could potentially be seen to be taking a share of four thousand two hundred in ryedale and seventeen hundred for selby if you base it on their existing population distribution on er part outside the city now i'm not saying necessarily that's how the way you would do it but i think it's an indication that the scale of development in those two districts is quite significant in greater york our concern is that the policy as it currently stands does not give any real guidance as to the way in which distribution of development outside the city but in greater york erm can be er should be di divided up and i think the problem really occurs from the introduction of the new settlement into h one erm i don't want to stray into the h two debate chair but i think it's the fact that h one does include a figure for the new settlement that the new settlement is not located within any particular district but that all the district totals do include in effect a figure which is UNK at this stage that would be absorbed by the new settlement as i understand the policy at the moment and i think that really does introduce a problem erm because clearly all of the emerging districts wide local plans could be in conformity with the structure plan and not include the new settlement i think it's er interesting to note that the d o UNK recently published a good practice guide on development plans did particularly highlight the situation in greater york as a problem as a UNK of the existing plan and if i can just quote it does say this on page forty three it would seem appropriate for broad locations of new development to be established by means of an alteration to the structure plan
so we have suggested erm you will see in our evidence that policy h one should be amended and their are clearly a number of ways in which that amended amendment could take place but we would particularly suggest that erm an indication should be given as to what the proportion of each UNK allocation is assumed to be going to the new settlement if the new settlement is agreed under the h two discussion thank you
thank you very much mr curtis
i mean effectively what you're saying is that york has got a capacity for about another three thousand three hundred dwellings
yes
over a whole range of sites
after
yes
that you're really UNK almost to get a UNK into a pint pot never mind a UNK aren't you
david curtis york city council
yes that is correct sir
does that include all land within the city boundary not included in the greenbelt
yes
david curtis york city council
yes it does the there is as you will see from the greenbelt plan a apart from the issue of the fact that the city boundary is in many areas er sort of hard up against further urban development so there's no space between the city and the parts in adjacent districts the greenbelt boundary as currently proposed by the county council erm which as you'll see from our evidence is not a boundary supported in its entirety by the city council means there is no further development land between the city boundary and the greenbelt
thank you
thank you
i think i'll ask mr smith from ryedale to tell us a little more about UNK problems or efforts
thank you
to cope with the pressures from york city itself and the greater york area
ian smith ryedale district
erm ryedale district as can be seen from the table supplied by greater york has taken the largest proportion of the greater york housing element over the past ten years as regards the proposed level of future housing growth suggested for the greater york area the district council supports the figure in the structure plan the greater york study identified a number of sites around the greater york area which could accommodate further development without UNK greenbelt objectives or UNK affecting the character of the settlements surrounding york and within that part of southern ryedale within the greater york area the identified sites were by and large incorporated into the southern ryedale local plan which has recently been through the public enquiry the district council does not believe that a larger amount of land could be identified within southern ryedale without UNK greenbelt objectives
as regards the distribution of lands between the districts erm if i can refer to mr UNK comments first the greater york study never anticipated that the distribution of housing around the greater york the districts would be based around the percentage of population within those districts but purely on capacity of sites within those districts to accommodate future housing growth without UNK greenbelt objectives ryedale as i've said before has taken the largest proportion of recent housing in the greater york area and has identified a substantial amount of new land for housing within its southern ryedale local plan what the district council is concerned about is that within the local southern ryedale local plans this is taking a large proportion of its district wide total plans yet the district council from the structure plan figure given is unable to calculate the remainder of housing that should be allocated in the remainder of its district
what ryedale is seeking is not a figure for its sector within the greater york area and the same with the other districts but rather a figure for the greater york area as a whole and then a figure for the remainder of those parts of the districts outside the greater york area so you don't get a situation with my colleagues on the left where you are in the structure plan UNK the number of houses that should be allocated in for example two parishes
i follow the i follow the er the point but the thing that UNK me is that your south ryedale local plan allocations have arisen out of the discussions on the greater york study yes
that is correct yes
where do you go post two thousand and six for example in obtaining a strategic view about the distribution of growth around york and in the greater york area
i mean how is that going to be provided
how are you going to be given and i'm making an assumption of course that the present two tier planning system is still UNK
stick with that scenario how would you anticipate or how would you expect that strategic guidance to be given as to where development should be appropriately located to serve the needs of greater york what mechanism is there in place for being
i it's
given that guidance
ian smith ryedale district council
erm beyond two thousand and six i would have thought the strategic guidance would be in locations other than peripheral expansion around the greater york area which i would have suggested would more than likely be to new settlements
can i pursue erm any fact no more without UNK greenbelt objectives no more than that er you said a couple of times
i th i'm not challenging that i simply wish to be clear what you mean by it
two questions
does that mean no more without development in the deposited greenbelt as in the greenbelt as defined in the deposited greenbelt local plan or does it mean no more unless it is hard up against that greenbelt
and secondly to which greenbelt objectives did you refer
ian smith ryedale district council
er to answer the first answer the first of your two questions erm the greenbelt as defined in the greenbelt local plan is hard up in many respects against the edge of the built up area excluding allocated sites allocations above that within the southern ryedale area would in fact require UNK green in a green belt boundaries
but there is allocated land allocated UNK land between the existing urban edge and the inner edge of the greenbelt
yes where sorry ian smith ryedale district yes er where it was considered those allocated sites could be developed without extending development into the greenbelt
thank you
mr davis and then mr
i'm sorry there was a second question
oh sorry yes
erm the greenbelt objectives which we identify with or could be UNK by significant peripheral expansion or the expansion of a settlement within the greenbelt were primarily the UNK the setting of the historic city which we and the county considered and refer to more than just the green UNK and but involve the whole countryside and the setting of the settlements within the greenbelt around the greater york area expansion of UNK large urban areas into the countryside possible coalescence of settlements
not the historic city itself
yes er it the first yes setting of the historic city
how would you describe the setting of the historic core of york
erm it's a city this takes me back a few months since the southern ryedale local plan enquiry the character special character of a city is UNK from a number of elements there's the green UNK which centre on the UNK which UNK into the heart of the built up area there is the UNK belt of open countryside which links those areas together there are the numerous settlements within the greenbelt and their relationship to one another and to the city of york
there are a number of UNK of the city from the ring road
yes
erm in some of which the minster is clearly visible
mhm
in a setting of UNK industrial residential development and some of those UNK on the ring road all one can see is the UNK industrial and residential development
ian smith UNK
that's what were aiming to preserve is it
well ian smith ryedale i think in the majority of views across from the ring road you have a belt of open countryside before that UNK housing
what you yo were trying to achieve is the expansion of the built up area towards the ring road and thereby having built development hard up er as it is at the moment the ring road goes through for the most part open countryside on either side of it
yes
thank you
mr davis
very briefly peter davis north yorkshire county council you raised the issue of procedures looking at the er post two thousand and six scenario within the light of er a statutory greenbelt er at that time and i would envisage that the county council and the districts if indeed we're all er in business at er in the next century would probably want to run a similar sort of exercise that they would be ran through the end of the eighties and that is to sit down together er and look at all the options er that are available for greater york in the same way that they did it in ninety eighty nine one additional factor at that time would be that er the greenbelt would be statutory and it would be statutory if the county council and ninety five percent of the district support on sites would be a tight greenbelt so the options would be looked at erm er in that context on the comments that er miss UNK erm questions that miss UNK raised there is a paper that the county council produced for the greenbelt local plan enquiry that i remember well as n y two which set out in detail the various components erm of the york greenbelt in addition to the historic title that the that the focus of the green belt comes across a variety of matters and if it if it is helpful to this panel that document was acceptable by and large supported by the district we can certainly put that in and can circulate it round
yes please if you would
thank you sir
mr grigson
steven grigson from barton willmore
sir i would want to come back i UNK
can you
i will want to come back i suspect later on
am i on
thank you
i want to make a limited point at this UNK i reserve the right to come back later on and it's become three points as a result of the discussion we've already had my view on the contribution of the of the greenbelt to the york issue isn't just the setting of the city it's the character of the city and that would include the central city and the historic city and the need to limit the physical expansion and size of the urban area because of the implications inside the historic city and that would certainly apply to other cities with UNK that i'm familiar with like york like er oxford which the character suffers from expansion possibly excessive norwich that considered a greenbelt and london if you like that didn't get its greenbelt until we had the character rather UNK altered so i think it isn't just the setting and how you see the city from the ring road it's actually what happens inside the core the second point i want to make is really for clarification perhaps er and it relates to the question of allocations between the built up area and the inner edge of the greenbelt as i understand it all those allocations are already er included in the ryedale local plan and are already therefore included in the commitments that we looked at in ryedale i don't think there is a further reserve of spare opportunities that might be used either before or after two thousand and six that's certainly my understanding and if anybody was taking a different view i think that should be clear and now i come to the one point that i was actually going to raise erm i think it's important that in this discussion of the relations between york city and greater york that we get a early on a clear view of what the requirements are in york not just its capacity which we've discussed so far and a figure of three thousand three hundred seems to be a fairly common currency but its requirements and i want to address a particular question to the county council which is in my proof so they've had as it were four weeks notice of it
and that is that in the projections of housing requirements for the city of york not greater york but the city of york the county council have a figure of four thousand four hundred households extra but propose a provision of only three thousand three hundred dwellings extra that's purely within york and the question really therefore for the county council is i had thought that their dwelling requirements that their sorry their policy h one figure for york was what they thought the requirements were but maybe it's what they think the limited capacity is and they are UNK an UNK of thousand odd from the city of york into greater york
mr UNK
malcolm UNK the figures in policy h one are quite clearly referred to as provision that will be made in particular settlements they are not stated as the requirement for dwellings generated by that particular settlement erm that is quite clearly set out in policy h one that is the wording of the policy
if the city cannot provide mo physically more than three thousand three hundred it would not be wise to include a figure of four thousand five thousand six thousand dwellings within the city that would be misleading and would not provide clear guidance to any local authority in the preparation of their local plan
i don't think that was the point mr grigson was making
well the
for clarity is that the actual projected requirements as a series of projections produced by county council are for four thousand three hundred households and a projected requirement for three thousand three hundred dwellings well quite clearly if the city of york itself cannot accommodate the requirement generated from in that city then it must be looked at in relation to the whole of the greater york area and the projections of the greater york area do take into account the er the figures generated from within the city of york therefore yes they are included within the greater york figure
do you accept mr UNK as mr grigson says the projected on a tr on a trend statistical projection the figure of households for york city is four thousand four hundred
the figure i think that we yes i wonder if mrs long could re to that particular question
yes
mrs long north yorkshire county council
wait a minute pull the microphone towards you
mrs long north yorkshire county council
i did the demographic projections erm i think the difference that er mr grigson is talking about between dwellings and households comes about within the ability of the UNK model to input erm tt calculated dwelling requirements
now i did it in one method and mr grigson did it in er in a second method and the ability to do that changes the number of households that it would project to the er the dwellings and UNK out this makes judgements erm on the actual population projections based which are estimates that have come out i don't necessarily believe the best measured estimates have come out for york and have adjusted some of the figures in accordance with that
now i'd like to emphasize this as because within york area it saw a difference between the census counts to the actual base population of a growth of five point seven two percent
this is more than the change that inner london received and i think it's quite unbelievable that UNK population base population is actually starting of from the figure of er a hundred and three a hundred and four thousand and i think york city council will agree with that in any case erm the new major estimates for nineteen ninety two would already suggest that UNK declined by a further thousand which i think UNK that these major estimates are estimates and because of the differ the difficulties within the census for nineteen ninety one with under UNK some problems may have occurred
erm so i'll agree with mr grigson that we do suggest there are more households changing their own dwellings but it's simply because we're trying to iron out of the problems that we feel have occurred within the major estimates
what's your projection for the city
in terms of additional households ninety one two thousand and six please
erm just one moment please four thousand two hundred
four
four thousand two hundred
thank you
mr grigson is that moving in the direction which you wished to get an answer to your question
well it it's moving a bit in that direction i mean i knew what their prediction was cos they kindly supplied it to me which is why i made the point but i mean as you know from our proof we have a higher view of the demographic requirements in york even than that for reasons that were UNK discussed in general on day one to do with vacant dwellings mortality and i think still probably a difference in migration between us on york which is statistical rather than environmental but i think it is important to have that established early on that even in the county council's view and with their as it were doubts about the statistics which they themselves use that er there is more need generated in york however much it is than york itself can accommodate and that is of course without york UNK seven hundred addition for reducing concealed and sharing households which is not in the county council's figures
yes er i see from the supplementary proof which you have put in the other day i mean your calculations of UNK requirements is six thousand six hundred
yes
yes
yes
no doubt we will return to that
mr donson
thank you
roy donson house UNK federation
i'd like to take up some points as they've occurred this morning
erm the first point relates to erm affordable housing targets in york and the consequences that has in relation not only to york but other areas on the on the assumption that there is there has to be an UNK to UNK adjacent areas
erm i heard mr curtis say that the shortfall of affordable houses was seven hundred he had a target of two thousand two hundred and felt they could find fifteen hundred somewhere already so another shortfall of seven hundred that actually UNK with UNK four one of the one eleven should i say four one eleven of the york housing strategy which has been submitted and appendix four of the york evidence which actually says that yes there's a two thousand two hundred target but there would still be a shortfall of about one thousand one hundred dwellings if this land they're talking about land that they own outside of york is developed for affordable housing
well there seems to be a slight UNK there and perhaps some of this UNK is also a part of with the confusion i have of the various shifting policy of york in term in terms of their requirement there has been in the in the not too recent past york were saying they had an additional requirement beyond need which they termed their concealed requirement although it might not be a concealed dwellings as we might otherwise describe them of one thousand six hundred and that has progressively come down to seven hundred as presented at this enquiry
now it seemed to me that one thousand six hundred was initially as a result of survey work or shall we say investigation into the housing waiting list carried out by the york housing department and i have to say that i have a certain respect for the york housing department and they have a certain reasonable and good reputation within the region as a housing department and so there seems to me that there is a gr a there is a potential to UNK er the affordable requirement that's been put to you another point erm i'd just like perhaps to seek a little clarification from mr curtis was unfortunately i was looking something else up or my attention was diverted when he gave some figures for ryedale and selby i think he said and i'll happily stand corrected on this that if you take away the york requirement figure from his ten thousand four hundred for greater york then the remainder he would UNK to selby and ryedale so that selby got four thousand two hundred sorry so that ryedale got four thousand two hundred and selby got one thousand seven hundred erm that doesn't add up to ten thousand four hundred and i in total and i wondered where the rest was coming from if i the point correctly
my note indicates that what mr curtis said was that on a pro UNK to their existing
yes
population levels i in the area of greater york an allocation would suggest that he wasn't advocating that it was just a pro UNK ball park estimate and he didn't UNK to make it add up to the residual requirement okay
it's still one thousand two hundred dwellings short and i don't know where there going to go
mr curtis
thank you chair
david curtis york city council
there's a few issues i'd like to cover from a number of comments i'll
i'm sorry
you hadn't finished
no i hadn't
alright
hold your horses then mr curtis
to two points
you can pick that
do you want those picked up
no
yes my other points about ryedale anyway
er yes chair first of all the last point first as it were the erm senior inspector is quite correct what i was doing was allocating the nine seven figure that the county had proposed in h one er that's why it doesn't add up add up to ten four clearly i haven't done the calculations for ten four but on the basis that erm there are seven hundred extra dwellings going into ryedale i think mr donson can work that one out
erm in connection with erm with reference to the york area housing strategy again there is a simple explanation in that document was prepared before the current work on the city of york draft local plan had progressed to a stage at which members had considered housing sites and a number of sites in city council ownership erm within the city covering some four hundred dwellings have now been agreed by the city council members as coming forward over the planned period for affordable housing and in the case of two of those sites it actually requires sites to be taken out of use as public car parks to bring them forward for development and that is why the eleven hundred figure is actually reduced now to a seven hundred
thank you
mr donson do you want to continue now
er yes thank you very much
sorry my other point is about ryedale and its and its UNK its relationship to southern ryedale and erm mr smith said that erm as far as ryedale council are concerned they can't identify any more land within southern ryedale well of course they would say that because was there position at the southern ryedale plan but the fact of the matter is that there was a great dispute at the york greenbelt southern ryedale plan enquiry UNK around the issue of what were the bits of the greenbelt which made up the historic character and thereby what were you left with that potentially could be developed albeit it might be reserved as white land in the first place but could potentially be developed and a great deal of this land on the UNK side lay in southern ryedale that in that in fact there was a view around the table not only sh not only shared by the developers side but erm that large parts of UNK and huntingdon didn't fall within the definition of greenbelt as set out by the county council in their n y two document now that matter clearly has got to be something left to the inspector and the greenbelt inquiry but i think it's fair to point out that there is actually a difference of view so it's not an absolute position that you can't identify more land within southern ryedale and indeed erm not that i want to raise the local government UNK head again but of course the local government commission is proposing that york be a unitary authority expanded and once UNK if york does become a unitary authority expanded then some of these areas will fall within their area and they may have a different view than er the ryedale current ryedale district council does and therefore i think it is a little unsafe to take just at pure se pure face value that there is no more land within southern ryedale that could be developed
i think we live with the local authority set up as we have it
mr smith erm obviously you want to respond to that but at the same time could i just press you towards your view and it's really relevant to the districts surrounding york that we know you can live with the figures of provision as set out by the county council in the alteration how ar are you aware of the figures which are being proposed by other participants in the discussion for greater york
yes
you are
could you comment on whether you could live with an expanded requirement er in south ryedale
and if you could how would you see it being met
i suspect you've already made that answered that question
ian smith ryedale district
erm UNK i i'll come back on that a couple of points erm regarding mr donson erm and the southern ryedale and york greenbelt local plan inquiry
the site that was identified or potentially identified by the house builders in york was a site which both the county council and the district council considered performed a number of greenbelt functions i think that it would be accepted that in any development plan land should only be allocated if there were some degree of certainty that it would come forward for development within the plan period the site that was identified there had been no objections made to the southern ryedale local plan so therefore there were no indications that it would have come forward for development within that plan period anyway had it been identified had it been allocated
erm regarding the question of erm additional sites for housing i erm if i can turn to erm barton UNK g one ten erm in paragraph
can i can i just pause you there
have you had a copy of dare i say it the UNK which was produced by the panel which summarized the various er submissions and if i just read them to you
the h b f figure for greater york was twelve thousand three hundred the barton willmore figure was twelve thousand seven hundred but they did break it down on a district basis and they gave five six five o to ryedale and then michael courcier represented by mr sedgewick a much more modest figure of ten thousand six hundred for greater york
ian smith ryedale district
erm as i've said before i have reservations about whether a much increased figure about above the county council's er proposal could be accommodated within ryedale district council and i if the figure above that is proposed i would suggest that the extra is accommodated within the new settlement which i presume the ar argue answer you would have expected from ryedale erm barton UNK figure is based on an assumption that they believe that within ryedale there is a capacity to increase past building rates i would UNK that erm the building rates in southern ryedale i would suggest were UNK high because of the development of clifton moor airfield the north western part of the southern ryedale district sorry south western part
the land there is now nearly exhausted and i would suggest that building rates in future years are in fact likely to decrease from what were UNK high figures in the in the past ten year period
yep er yes
l coming back to your other point i mean your saying you could not physically or you would not wish to accommodate let me put it that way you would not wish to accommodate anything more than is now you're making provision for within the south ryedale local plan
ian smith
can i just pursue that you said so the if you embarked on another scenario and you said that the only way in which extra over that beyond the figure proposed by the county council would be by way of a new settlement i'm sort of UNK my own ground rules here i know that ryedale has expressed support for the principle of a new settlement are you saying that you would be looking for a new settlement possibly in ryedale
ian smith ryedale district
we would be looking for a new settlement in the best location around greater york
i thought you'd say that
was that meaning yes or no
yes we support the principle but the question about whether or not it should be in ryedale district has not been erm answered by our members and indeed it we consider it should have wait i mean this is answering something that'll be discussed at later within this issue something that should not be er assessed until after the er
well let's put it on the shelf for the time being
but i we're going to have to discuss when we get to h two just how you're going through the process of actually finding a site
if you know finding a site for a new settlement is an acceptable way forward but i let's leave it on the shelf for now
mr curtis
thank you chair
er david curtis york city council
i'd just like to comment on two or three issues that were raised earlier
clearly we do not wish to go through the same debate that we had at the greenbelt inquiry erm but it is very relevant erm you'll see from our submissions to the panel that er quite clearly the city council did not agree entirely with the proposed boundary of the greenbelt the city council did take the view that there were certain areas of land proposed to be included in the greenbelt er which did not fulfil a greenbelt function in the council's view and that was clearly was discussed at the greenbelt inquiry it was not just one site er we clearly were not in our er responsibility to identify a specific site outside our district but there were a number of areas er subject to those objections not just from ourselves but as mr erm donson has said er from various objectors
the greenbelt boundary as i mentioned earlier as proposed by the county council is very tightly drawn excluding the sites which have been mentioned which our allocated there is no land between the edge of the urban area and the proposed greenbelt boundary and that does seem to us continues to seem to us er not an appropriate way forward
in terms of the
i'm sorry david i thought
in terms of the definition of er what is historic york i think again an issue we went over for some length of time at the greenbelt inquiry i would draw your attention back to my earlier comments that york is basically a modern industrial city with a very precious historic core that historic core er represents no more than actually five percent of the built up area that something like eighty five percent of the city was built after eighteen hundred the view that was expressed by the county in n y two in terms of the definition of the greenbelt the greater york greenbelt and its purposes was not accepted by the city council we do not accept that all of the UNK elements of the york greenbelt contribute towards preserving the character of the historic city we rely on the fact that the two comments the senior inspector made at this the green UNK and historic core itself that establish the historic character of the city there are many parts of the edge of york which could UNK be UNK in many cities historic or otherwise around the country and finally just coming back to the issue of scale of development erm the point i should have made earlier about the house builders figures for the city of york is that the house builders did suggest a figure of four thousand for the city erm i'm not aware on what basis that was made but clearly my evidence would quite clearly indicate that i believe that could not be accommodated certainly on any known sites within the UNK current city boundary thank you chair
mr sedgewick can i just ask mr sedgewick to
sedgewick michael courcier and partners
as you know from our submission sir n we've taken a more modest requirement for the greater york area and that's based to some extent upon what we think is achievable there we're not saying that erm the figure should not be higher we're not saying that the h b f figure for instance should UNK not be er put in there but what we're saying is if that higher figure does go in because of the clear constraints on the provision of additional land the higher figure may well mean that there's a need for two new settlements ra rather than just one
the approach we've taken which is set out in our submission in section seven we've we believe that maybe some nine hundred additional sites could be found this is in addition to the existing allocations er some nine hundred additional sites could be found within greater york by making changes to the boundary of the greenbelt we you do it the greenbelt is too extensive in some parts it can be rolled back without affecting the purpose erm mr UNK already identified those areas if that's the case on our figures a settlement of fourteen hundred plus nine hundred on other sites is quite achievable
in the longer term if there i is a need for a for UNK additional supply that can be done by increasing the size of the UNK or using some of this additional land
thank you
thank you
mr davis
this is very brief and solely for the record chairman at the york greenbelt local plan inquiry the city council made one objection and one objection only in respect of sites and that was a site that UNK the york selby boundary that was there only expressed concern on sites specific objection one site in the entire plan
that's a matter of record
thank you
well i think probably ought to make it clear of course that we won't have available to us the greenbelt local plan enquiry so
well certainly not in the period during which we're going to be discussing the various submissions er un at the e i p now mr heselton erm in a way your comments yesterday would probably be taken that selby could cope or would be prepared to cope even with additional development now you better sa tell me whether that's true or false and i'm thinking particularly of that element of greater UNK of selby which is in greater york
er yes that's true to a degree chairman
er terry heselton selby district
erm well in the context of what i did say yesterday it'll come as no great surprise to anyone that like ryedale we also accept the north yorkshire county figures erm which in short we find are based on reasonable assumptions and an appropriate methodology compared to some of the more extreme interpretations and projections that have that have been put forward if i can illustrate that point by reference to er potential building rates that the highest figure that's been suggested is the one put forward by mr grigson of barton willmore i'm talking for the moment about greater york generally and i'll come onto the selby aspect in a minute
that's a suggested figure of twelve thousand seven hundred which imply a building rate of eight hundred and forty six a year in comparison with the adopted re er rate in the in the adopted plan of six o six and an actual building rate of seven o one er my re calculation shows that would be a thirty nine percent increase over the adopted plan rate and a twenty one percent increase over the actual rate
in comparison the er the smallest projection put forward by mr thomas would actually result in a twenty one percent decrease in building rates over that approved in the adopted plan and a thirty two percent increase over the actual rate experienced since nineteen eighty one
so i don't find either of those two alternatives UNK acceptable largely on the basis of the arguments put forward yesterday
mhm yes
so coming back more specifically to selby and taking er mr UNK ball park figure of seventeen hundred erm now already we've got approximately eight hundred and fifty committed in terms of a hundred and eighty con er UNK five hundred and sixty UNK including conversions and a hundred and ten dwellings identified on a site at UNK in the greater york study and there's really not a great deal more flexibility erm because of the greenbelt constraint
we fully support and endorse the deposit greenbelt boundaries then i think it's UNK that at some point that is going to lead us to UNK over the greenbelt boundary at some stage during the plan period there may well be sufficient erm commitment and identified sites to UNK up in the short term but by the end of the plan period it's my belief that there will be a need to address this issue by bringing forward proposals for a new settlement er which obviously selby district er full fully supports
and you would see that as an inevitable er way forward if you want to meet the housing provision in strategic terms in greater york
that's right i mean i would suggest that we've arrived at that point now and we're increasingly likely to do so because as we've already heard york is very constrained it's a relatively small compact historic city the greenbelt boundaries are drawn fairly tightly correctly in so in my opinion and there's really not much room for manoeuvre within with er in a existing settlements within the greenbelt
thank you
mr donson
er roy donson house UNK federation
i just wanted to take up the point that's been raised again and it keeps popping its little head up from time to time this issue of building rates
i would say to you that the history of north yorkshire county is that the house builders have built more or less the building rate of planning policy whatever that has been and that is a matter of fact and if and if and if we are in a situation where the market is being UNK as is the policy and it's not a policy which we are seeking to go away from specifically and it is inevitable that the house builders will build to whatever the policy building rate is and UNK of one building rate with another are simply telling you what's happened in the past not what needs to happen in the future er in terms of meeting the housing requirement and quite clearly in any area where you are introducing a new settlement if indeed that's the conclusion we come to er late later on erm and i hope we do but if we are introducing a new settlement you are bound to UNK the building rates and the more and more you reduce the area in which you consider what the building rate effect is the more and more that it actually gets UNK er and erm you know quite frankly when the developers built a new estate at the end of my particular street the building rate went up UNK in my area er and er you know we can go on forever like that i just think it's very misleading to just deal with the judgement of building rates
mr thomas
thank you
i had thought that builders built houses when they thought they thought they could sell them i didn't realize it was part of some UNK policy of UNK with planning policy still we learn everything every day don't we
erm sir i want to address the point if it's the right time about the level of housing provision the greater york area in particular erm that we've seen round the table here that we have special circumstances applying to york and to its surrounding area
erm i won't dwell on york city centre and its historic core because you're all clearly aware of that but it its setting was accepted at the greenbelt enquiry as being sufficiently important to warrant protection wider than just its physical existing physical limits erm the special protection was UNK also to the special character rather was UNK also to the surrounding countryside much of which is very attractive and many of the typical yorkshire small villages and UNK that UNK the area as well er and we're clearly in a position in greater york which is different from the position that arises in many other counties and many other districts within this county we're in a position of grave shortage of suitable UNK land we're in a position of high quality er character and landscape we're in a position where york in particular has extremely good transportation links to the leeds bradford conurbation where we discuss at length over the last two days there are policies for urban regeneration subject to regional planning guidance in that area erm and we're in a position where quite clearly york is under pressure a great deal of pressure from migrants er because it's a it's an attractive location to live
when you put all these factors together it concerns me that nobody has been UNK the case that as with other districts some other districts in york it would be appropriate even more appropriate in my view that the migration assumption should be discounted there are in my view special reasons why this should be the case special reasons over and above tho those that have been applied to the other districts this in my view would be that the greater york housing provision for all those reasons i've just highlighted should be reduced should be reduced to the seventy five percent level in other words that would be reducing it by between a thousand and twelve hundred and fifty houses now i won't get on to the reason that the fact that that's one reason why there's no need for a new settlement erm but it is a reason in its own right just to protect the character and the capacity requirements and the environmental UNK of the greater york area
a second factor which i'd like to raise and please stop me sir if i'm not playing your ground rules here is to get back to the original point made by mr davis as to how this figure is going to be split between the districts i think it's absolutely essential that this figure is split between the districts and it may well be if you decide sir to recommend in favour of the new settlement that you may have to leave that as a floating figure to go around the districts at the moment it is not
i would like to have more information from the county or anyone else from the table for that matter how this UNK going to be split clearly p g requires it to be split between district and i'd like to see it split on that basis
thank you sir
thank you mr thomas
erm i get the impression from what you're saying is that there is a distinct strategic view which should be taken about york and its role which in a way would tend to limit the amount of housing development you should be putting in and around york
indeed er and
and that's the way the authorities should be moving forward with their planning for the county
i think that is the case UNK so considering the discussion yesterday where we saw that whether some of the districts liked it or not there is going to be development in excess of the projected figures in their relevant districts over the plan period
there is UNK elsewhere to effect a redistribution to the benefit of york and its greater york area
probably an el well certainly an element which ought to be considered within the umbrella of the r p g but lets
indeed
wait and see what comes out of that
er i'm glad you raised the point about the distribution between the districts and apart from your comment er i know mr davis is opposed to the idea i haven't UNK a view either way from anyone else whether they would like them or would not like them
well it seems to me sir that er the new settlement is becoming a bit of a dustbin which people are throwing their UNK allocations in and then passing it around from district to district
mhm
and selby are the people who are prepared to take it
i have
it maybe it maybe sir you should allocate all the housing to selby and we can all go home
i'm about to apologize to mr grigson because i see from his submission he actually did distribute it by district within the er greater york area er UNK planning by selby is not i think the right approach but
mr cunnane sorry mr grigson you want to come in
well i i'm happy i mean i was just going to make that point sir but i do have other points but i'll wait
can we have mr cunnane then mr sedgewick and then we will have a coffee break
chairman
joe cunnane
my point is a very short one i simply need to put it on the record that it is erm our position that the panel should distribute the er UNK york UNK if i can call it that as well that the panel should address the issue of distribution because our fear is th is th is the selby problem that selby are embarked upon a clear strategy of er substantial growth and we do not want to see er the greater york UNK being unduly er UNK in that direction
thank you
mr sedgewick
sedgewick michael courcier and partners
our position in the submission was that if there is not the need to distribute UNK own population around greater york then the argument for a separate greater york figure UNK
the original purpose was to deal with problems arising within the city of york
if you feel from the discussion around the table that the u requirements of york have not been properly reflected in the published h one figure er and that there is a need to distribute that population and therefore there is going to be a greater york figure
the overlap with the districts needs to be UNK it's a black hole at the moment every district can pass a its surplus on to another district and indeed it would be the last district to prepare a district wide local plan that has to meet the residue of the greater york requirement it may maybe a good stimulus for the districts to get on with their local plans but that's not an planning way
what we would advocate as indeed mr smith did earlier is that there should be a global figure for greater york and a reduction in an appropriate reduction in the requirement for each district and i believe that anticipating you might ask me what that is what that reduction should be erm i can say it must be related to the ca capacity of that district within greater york
that proposition UNK that if you make a reduction in the district figures then you must have an idea what the district contribution towards the greater york figure is er and i find it difficult to see that you can have if you have a new settlement if you have a new settlement the c provision for the new settlement floating in this table erm but can i just say before we adjourn for coffee that i really would like to have some very firm answers to the questions which are posed under issue two er and particularly about two d and that is specific guidance on the location of the new settlement
assuming you end up with a new settlement
can we break for coffee
yes
sir announced the end of debate one i certainly wasn't under the impression that it had finished
well i've got if you just bear with me a moment i still have one foot dragging in h one but i thought we'd got to the stage where in order to try and clarify thinking on the matter we ought to progress onto h two erm that just let me reveal the thinking erm that before i do that can i just say in terms of mechanics those of you who have just joined us for the first time could you turn your name boards round so i can see them thank you and when you want to come in the normal practice is to put your name board on end so it will attract our attention
but just let me come back to the point i want to make it is it evident to us from what was said yesterday collectively by the district councils that they could live with the figure of forty one thousand two hundred as proposed by the county council without a new settlement
there's a UNK to th that was is our impression from the various views that were sp s spelt out around the table
you'll have a chance to come back on whether we have got the wrong impression on that i mean i recall mr UNK quite clearly but let me pursue that at a stage further if we take that as our impression of what you have said collectively and you are asked to make provision for nine thousand seven hundred dwellings again collectively in the greater york area and i'm addressing this question to the districts what provision would you make in your districts of your district figure in the greater york area
mr davis you want to make a comment
well i was i've looked peter davis north yorkshire i've just UNK down the table at certainly at the er my greater york district colleagues and er certainly we er are rather surprised that er you have the impression that you have the impression that er erm we could do without the erm the new settlement quite clearly erm certainly harrogate selby er and ryedale and the county council believe the new settlement is absolutely essential erm and i think that's erm certainly a matter of agreement between er us and those three districts it's absolutely essential
i think the point i think the point we're making is that none of the districts yesterday told us that to meet their figure in h one they would need to have a new settlement for example i well remember selby saying to us if we go above our h one figure we would need a new settlement but they did not say to meet our h one figure we would need a new settlement
mr heselton
it's in that
sorry
context that we are ask now want to get clarification from the district councils as to what proportion of there h one figure would be in the greater york area
er may i reply please
mr heselton first yes
thank you
terry heselton selby district
er it yes it it's true to tell gone on record on several occasions saying in terms of environmental capacity there's the potential within selby district to accommodate eleven and a half thousand dwellings however i did later qualify those comments with reference to the emerging local plan which is the main vehicle we've got for identifying potential development sites and the qualification was that was that land is not necessarily available in the right places to enable us to make a reasonable distribution for development in accordance with p g advice so that the question of a new settlement remains an extremely attractive option for selby district and as i mentioned this morning in terms of whi we would be approximately eight hundred and fifty UNK whi we would be approximately eight hundred and fifty dwellings short in any case erm
how much are you saying would be in the greater york area in your district
well i haven't suggested a figure i made reference and i also referred to the fact that when you then discounted UNK identified sites and existing measurements you would be approximately eight hundred and fifty dwellings short
short of mr short of mr UNK figure
if i be yes mr UNK ball park figure
mhm so we'll credit you with minus eight fifty shall we
this probably being the best
er as a basic starting point yes
yes
mr UNK
er david UNK harrogate borough council
erm first of all chairman i would confirm that it is our view that with a provision of six thousand five hundred for harrogate district we don't think we'd be looking at a new settlement to serve our needs erm having said that we support the greater york strategy and we certainly the level of provision erm for greater york as proposed by the county council er but leaving aside for one moment the issue of a new settlement it is our view that we'll be able to accommodate the level of growth that i think is anticipated in our district erm within the figures and i'm referring specifically to n y one and the table on the last page where there's an indication there of the sort of er housing numbers that would have to be accommodated within harrogate district and our part of greater york is essentially a rural character UNK of a number of small villages so there we have er a total figure of two hundred dwellings to be provided within our part of greater york that basically represents erm existing commitments and a yield from small sites in the future perhaps conversions and UNK we're quite happy with that
i think our view is that if that provision was to be any greater then we would have significant difficulty in UNK that provision within our part of greater york primarily for greenbelt considerations not reasons erm any additional provision would require a rolling back of the greenbelt er significant provision would have two implications erm either it would mean peripheral expansion er of york into the greenbelt around york and into our district we feel that would UNK affect the special character of york lead to outward UNK of the york urban area UNK into open countryside and coalescence of the urban area with the villages in our district er and we wouldn't want to support that
the other option would be expanding the villages themselves and we find that would be equally harmful so we'd be opposed to any significant additional development in our district over and above that that's been assumed in that table
mhm
if i if m i summarize that i know harrogate have supported the principle of a new settlement within the greater york figure but you hadn't anticipated that it would bite on your district if i can use that word
we er haven't er certainly been through or down the road of looking at whether there are sites within our district that could accommodate that exercise is still to be done
but if i put it another way you could meet your anticipated contribution to the greater york figure as spelt out in the structure plan
that's right sir
ninety seven hundred
thank you
mr jewitt
michael jewitt hambledon district
michael jewitt hambledon district council
erm before we leave item one d sir there are two things that hambledon would like to say both on the q questions that the chairman asked capacity and also on the principal of breaking down the greater york figure i into the constituent districts erm the first point on capacity erm we feel that we have a very limited capacity er to accommodate development needs advising in greater york you'll see from our statement that we have just two settlements an sorry three settlements in two parishes er within the defined greater york area UNK and UNK
two of these settlements have just ten and eleven dwellings respectively erm UNK is the only settlement of any consequence erm being two hundred and er twenty dwellings
now within that overall context it really would be meaningless to identify a contribution for hambledon in terms of greater york as this erm figures are so are so small
the second point being that erm if a figure was to be identified for greater york we'd feel that this would er unduly interfere with our duties and responsibilities as a district council to allocate land in our district cos in effect what it would do is direct us to making a housing allocation in one particular settlement UNK we feel that's our responsibility not the county council
mhm
mhm
isn't
go on go on
isn't there an argument and perhaps i am st getting now onto two matter two that says from UNK point of view what has just been said is UNK is a UNK argument in favour of identifying where the new settlement should go because that will at the same time identify where it should not go
ah erm well chairman i think that this is something that's going to cut as far as UNK got concerns is going to come up in the erm in the next debate certainly erm the erm the issue of erm whether policy should be expressed in terms of principle and criteria or erm area and a district as being a dilemma erm to hambledon erm it feels it's erm not being able to support the policy as defined because ultimately the council would object to a new settlement in hambledon
erm and therefore it feels it would be UNK of it to support the principle at this stage it may well lead to a situation where were encouraging the county to go down a particular route but only to get to the very end of it for us to pull the rug from beneath the county's feet
mm
yes erm we are aware of the view that the district council have expressed about the new settlement that's perfectly clear
but if i just turn your attention to the figures that are UNK in the county council's n y one the UNK in paragraph twenty on the last page it's UNK forty dwellings due in hambledon more or less
my understanding of the situation in hambledon is that there are we're talking only small figures i realize there are twenty commitments currently within that area erm clearly there are going to be some UNK sites come forward erm i don't wish to er critical of that figure i would accept the figure
sorry
i would accept that figure and
thank you
yes
mr smith ryedale
chairman
ian smith ryedale district
i've already said this morning that the district council does not consider that it can accommodate any further dwellings within the southern ryedale area without UNK affecting the character of the settlements that are already there or UNK greenbelt objectives erm so therefore to meet the greater york total the district council considers it essential that there is a new settlement to take that amount of housing that cannot be accommodated within the southern ryedale area
what figure can you accommodate in south ryedale
part of
sorry in UNK in the ryedale part of the greater york
if you look at table at the county council's m
yes
y one erm
is that the one you can live with
we could live with that figure and indeed our local plan is based on that sort of a figure being accommodated within that area
and the york figure we take as three thousand three hundred mr curtis
dave curtis york city council
yes sir
and ou and going back to mr heselton he has said i i've got a negative factor for him at the moment in terms of minus eight fifty but let me let me take the figure which is actually quoted in the county council's table of nine fifty dwellings
is it nine fifty or is it something slightly higher or something less
er terry heselton selby district
erm i believe the figure of nine fifty also includes a an allowance for windfalls
mr heselton i understood you said when we started this debate that you were eight hundred and fifty short or thereabouts of mr UNK pro UNK figure which was four thousand two hundred
did i UNK
no er mr UNK er hypothetical figure
yes
of seventeen hundred
mm
i beg your pardon
yes
which takes you back to nine fifty
sorry eight fifty
eight fifty more
yes
or less
yes
hypothetical
so in progressing through there and i'm sorry we haven't done it this way we end up in terms of the county council figure of nine seven hundred for greater york possible er provision from collectively from the districts of about fourteen hundred fifteen hundred short
is my arithmetic correct
yes
thank you
mr grantham
erm
and then mr UNK
er i just want wanted to pick up on your opening remarks sir after coffee that the impression you had was that the districts erm could live with a that the county council figures
erm with without a new settlement erm that was indeed the impression that erm i was left with as well and what we've sought to do in the evidence that we've put before you is to take the nine seven nine thousand seven hundred figure in greater york and er s based on the data supplied by the county council to demonstrate that actually when one looks at outstanding commitments erm with planning permission identified the sites er without planning permission those that are allocated in local plans making suitable allowances for small sites erm windfall sites and conversion erm the residual figure that is left in greater york which i calculate to be eight thousand six hundred and thirty seven once one has taken away UNK which i think is an agreed figure between nineteen ninety one and nineteen ninety three of one thousand and sixty three that erm those existing commitments and the sites likely to come forward ma virtually match the figure for the outstanding housing requirement so one is left with a view that erm from the data that's put in front of us that there isn't a residue of that size to accommodate although i accept that there may well be a residue of some sort erm and it seems to me that the established greater york erm framework er is the process by which that is distributed around the counties along the lines that the UNK proceeded this morning
in that context i think it would be helpful to us erm if we could have submitted to us a version of the table originally submitted by the h b f relating to commitments
relating solely to the greater york area
if you remember at the end of yesterday mr donson will no doubt correct me if i'm wrong he UNK finished up we started the day with a total guaranteed minimum of about thirty three and a half thousand we got that up by arithmetic to thirty four point nine thousand and i think we finished up at around thirty six thousand at the end of the day
i think it would be very helpful to the panel to know what proportion of that thirty six thousand is within the district within the greater york area don't ask for that to be done now because it may well involve some difficult arithmetic perhaps it's tonight's homework
is that possible mr donson
roy donson house UNK federation it's not possible by me no but
right
i'll leave it to the
your sources your sources of supply are on the other side of the room
indeed they are yes
thank you
mr thomas
yes thank you sir
i think that the districts there possibly given the exception of selby have taken a rather cautious approach as to what they anticipate being built in their areas within the greater york area itself er over the next thirteen years
er a similar cautious approach which none of them took yesterday when on examination it was found that there was more potential there than before erm so to help with the figures i have found very helpful erm appendix eight to the er york city council erm statement i think it appears in both of their statements appendix eight greater york housing provision sorry could i also direct you at the same time to the county council's n y five appendix three now the two make interesting UNK because they both start of with the same h one proposal of nine thousand seven hundred dwellings and i'll remind you there sir that only five thousand seven hundred of those are required by the existing population four thousand of those are for migrants and the two schedules go of in slightly different directions under the heading of UNK and the reason for that sir is that the greater york the er county council's figures as you can see were UNK in october nineteen ninety two when only seven hundred dwellings had been completed yet six months later under item c for the greater york er housing provision figure york UNK york city council figures the UNK were one thousand and sixty three
erm i'll not go through the whole of this table sir but i do want you to look at the next column outstanding planning UNK
in october nineteen ninety two the outstanding planning UNK were three thousand three hundred and fifty in april nineteen ninety three there were three thousand four hundred and seventy three
in fact sir the county council's figures produced in another appendix can't lay my hands on it at the moment had put this figure in as three thousand six hundred and fifty but the UNK of those two things are that over that six month period we're not only seeing more houses built but we have more UNK and that hasn't affected the residue that appears in the rest of these schedules
now the county councils and the city council's assessment of the capacity of the greater york study sites are roughly the same you can see sir that as things have moved forward in only a six month period the city council calculate there's a residual requirement of nine hundred and forty seven dwellings only twenty five percent of the migration assumption none hundred and forty seven dwellings left compared to the county council's UNK information which suggested it's one thousand three hundred and thirty five
both of those figures sir exclude any windfalls whatsoever over the next thirteen years now if that is a justification for a new settlement i'm a UNK
it clearly is not the case that we have heard from the city this morning and in the city alone windfalls have been progressing at the rate of eighty per annum if it was only half that rate over the next thirteen years we would see five hundred more houses and that UNK windfalls from the rest of the greater york area excluding the city of york
it is quite clear sir that on the existing allocations thirteen years to go that the figure of nine thousand seven hundred dwellings if you want to stick by that figure my view it should be lower because it has too much an assumption for migration in a constrained area if you want to stick by that figure the nine thousand seven hundred will be reached without a new settlement of that i have no doubt whatsoever
now a new settlement option is a last ditch option we're far from being the last ditch here we're hardly the first ditch
thank you
thank you
mr grigson
thank you sir
steven grigson barton willmore
i will want to come back on the same point that's just been made but if before i get to that there are some other points that i think i should make in explanation of the lead we have given if i may call it that in putting forward the distribution of the greater york total
i think it's necessary to set the scene for that to say that in fact as between the county council and barton willmore there's very little difference in what we see are the requirements for the ring around the city we both have a figure of six thousand and something quite small
the difference between our figures for greater york and the county council's figures for greater york arise almost entirely within york city and bi i think been established earlier this morning that some UNK albeit the size maybe in dispute is necessary from the city into the ring
erm i think it's also now pretty much common ground that the capacity of york city is around three thousand three hundred but i think in taking an view on that and in taking any view o on future windfalls it is necessary for the panel to keep in mind that historically in the nineteen eighties windfalls were coming through at a time when it was not a adopted local plan for the city of york so to some extent anything by definition of a substantial size was likely to be a windfall erm but also more to the point than that UNK point i would expect to see and i think what mr curtis has said earlier on that the local plan is likely to UNK up on criteria for release of sites both small and large he referred to the shortage of open space and i would expect to see a policy change in short a policy climate change within the city of york that would UNK past historical rates of windfall release
so that i think the situation affecting the greater york area is that there UNK there is a requirement to accommodate within the ring part of the needs of the city and on our best estimate that er i apologize for the word UNK but it is descriptive is of the order of three thousand three hundred dwellings to be accommodated in the ring which after the needs of york
i don't intend to discuss the housing whether seven hundred acres sorry seven l land for seven hundred houses is owned by the city of york that's not part of our case one way or the other but we have offered you a distribution of the greater york provision figure between the districts because from barton UNK very extensive experience of participation in local plan work up and down the country i think we share the view that er city of york have that ryedale have my colleagues to the left and right on this side of the table have that there does need to be a distribution otherwise there will be at best confusion as to whether local plans comply with the structure plan and at worst a game of pass the parcel and everybody will be UNK but nobody will actually be possibly meeting the figures and that is the situation that i don't think anybody would wish to see as a result of er the outcome of alteration number three i mean i don't know how the county council would really be able to say whether they thought a local plan UNK to the structure plan without knowing what that distribution was perhaps in some bottom draw manner which is not now the approved way of going about these things so that i think there does need to be a distribution for the proper planning of york and before coming on to our to explain our figures a little bit i should also say perhaps in response to remarks mr thomas made earlier on about the general character of the york area and the need to protect that course is precisely what the greenbelt is for and what it does it isn't necessary to extend that concept across the whole of the vale of york and therefore to seek to er discount migration outside the greenbelt
that is what the greenbelt is actually there for and if you have it there for that purpose as i said yesterday the necessary UNK is that you have additional provision beyond it and i can't resist to offer mr UNK some support i'm sure one piece of evidence that he gave you about the letter from the parish council he's probably already replied to that parish council saying as you're in the york greenbelt have no fear all the selby needs will pass straight across your heads and land somewhere else
the erm point about are distribution within greater york is that we have attempted to look at this in what i think is a rational and realistic manner we have looked and you'll see this from our supplementary paper i apologize for its UNK but i think it's benefited from the additional thought that could be given to it we have looked both backwards at the present day and forwards we've looked backwards at past build rates we've looked at the present day position in the sense of the population shares within greater york and we've looked forwards in terms of the commitment figures that are given in the n y one paper that we've just been looking at and taking all those things into account and adding in what we see as the right location for a new settlement namely selby district we come to the figures that are in our supplementary paper and there is clearly a great deal of common ground between the evidence you get from looking either at past building rates or population shares as now or future commitments which all point towards a broadly similar distribution we say with the addition of a new feature namely the new settlement so that i commend those figures to you as somebody who's actually UNK to put their toe or maybe their whole body into the water and given you not only some numbers but also a basis by which if you should er have a different greater york figure in mind a basis on which that could be UNK er approached i would not certainly defend to the last ditch the need to put a figure of fifty dwellings into the structure plan for the hambledon part of greater york there may be a cut off point beyond which you don't go but certainly for ryedale and selby with very substantial numbers there is a need to indicate what the appropriate division should be and you could not for instance indicate what the er ryedale non greater york figure was without someone telling us the as the chairman rightly said having an idea of what the ryedale greater york figure should be so it isn't really i think feasible to have district figures for non greater york and one greater york figure that doesn't er get away from the issue and nor does it solve the potential for confusion
my final point is that and we have had it raised this morning erm from er i think it was consultants on behalf of the c p r e that there was sufficient capacity within greater york and they referred to a table in their and their submission
i had a close look at that table obviously a matter of some interest and that's the reason i return to this as i read the table there is a very substantial amount of double counting within it for this reason that all outstanding er planning UNK are included once and there are then separate categories of allowance for all types of sites namely large windfalls conversions small sites and allocated sites those are all put in er or most of them are put in at thirteen years worth that being the remainder of the plan period to two thousand and six it will not have escaped you that if you include thirteen years worth all the existing commissions are part of that thirteen years and so simplest approach to correct that table would simply to discount the outstanding commitments because they're all counted again as part of the thirteen years i do have a secondary point that the allowance for conversions is very much higher than what seems to be happening and in what is in the tables that er mr thomas drew it to your attention from the york city er appendix eight so that er on two counts but mainly the double counting one there is a great deal of er erm optimism if i can call it that in that table
thank you
thank you
mr curtis
thank you chair
david curtis york city council
er i merely want to comment on the erm apparent misunderstanding on my comments on windfalls earlier on erm it has been suggested that we we're UNK down on windfalls was the quote actually used erm there is no intention in the local plan to er ignore the er windfalls to actually deal with them in a different way than had happened in the past clearly if sites come forward which are windfalls which are suitable in environmental terms then the city council will give as p b g one requires the appropriate consideration to those applications what i was merely saying this morning was the likelihood of such windfalls coming forward and the scale was clearly going to be substantially less than had occurred in the past and the figure of eighty a eighty a year which was for a five year period which was quoted to me erm clearly would not be representative of my expectation of the future
thank you
er mr UNK
malcolm UNK county council
erm i was going to pick up on a number of points that have been raised by previous speakers but erm mr grigson and mr curtis seem to have er dealt with a few of those erm just with regard to the table put in by c p r e with their figures i would just agree with mr UNK er mr grigson that there is a very substantial degree of double counting in those figures there is also a very substantial degree of over provision in the allowance for conversions er past conversion rates in greater york have UNK something like twenty nine dwellings per year over a fifteen year period your talking about four hundred and thirty five dwellings which is the figure that both york city council and ourselves have made allowance for conversions that UNK with a figure of a thousand dwellings referred to by the c p r e and i see no foundation for that figure erm as i say mr curtis already picked up on the point about windfalls rates by mr thomas erm just turning to the difference between the tables er submitted by the county council and york city council on the residue within the er greater york area i would accept the figure the figures put in the tables by mr er by mr curtis i think that they have picked up the more recent planning UNK and the UNK information and they also take on board there more recent work on erm development within the city and i accept that table
thank you
mr smith
ian smith ryedale district
i'd like to comment on mr UNK table in particular the figure proposed for ryedale er his figure is based on the assumption that because selby gets the new settlement it therefore gets a corresponding reduction in house building elsewhere in the greater york portion of selby
the development strategy adopted in the greater york study never envisaged that the settlement or the district that got the new settlement would therefore get a corresponding reduction in the amount of land it had to provide to meet the needs of the greater york area the strategy we use to identify sites within the greater york area that could be developed without UNK greenbelt objectives and that the new settlement would be added on outside that area without a reduction in that figure
mhm
mr cunnane
er joe cunnane sa representing sam UNK brewery tadcaster
just like to make a comment on mr UNK submission erm points on erm the greater york figure
first of all i should point out that the nor the county council er figure of none thousand seven hundred is actually a figure for local needs plus one hundred percent migration and if you follow mr UNK figures that leaves a residual requirement of nine hundred and forty seven dwellings without any windfalls over the next thirteen years which is quite UNK so in order to establish his point on the need for the new settlement on tha on his figures the bar mr grigson of barton willmore has to up the figure for greater york to twelve thousand seven hundred as set out in his erm paper
the s the point i would make is that first of all i don't accept that twelve thousand seven hundred is er a UNK figure but that probably the more important point is that there has to be a policy response and a policy response to this issue demands that there is at least some response to the mi to the level of migration er you know my view has been put forward very clearly about that but i would simply make the point for the record that even accepting one hundred percent migration there is no statistical case for a new settlement
thank you
mr sedgewick
sedgewick michael courcier and partners
the may maybe i just comment on that last that last point which as i understand it the justification for a new settlement is brought about solely by increasing the requirement for greater york to twelve thousand seven hundred going through those figures there seems to me for instance for both ryedale and selby to be more provision than could be met in a single settlement i think the figures put forward by barton willmore are more than can be met in existing allocations and a single new settlement of a reasonable size
so i think the new settlement remains justified even with the significantly lower figure for greater york
mhm
thank you
i noted the point erm i think to some extent we probably can now move forward to h two in a proper sense but i'll ask mr davis er a if he wishes to give some reaction to the last few comments er and then your lead in to h two
mr grigson said he really
i assume mr grigson as he hasn't raised his board has said all he wants to say at this stage on the points that have been made
in relation to factor
do you want anything else on matter one mr grigson
mr grigson for barton willmore
i don't feel any need to respond on ryedale o or to michael courcier
there was one little bit of UNK as you've given me an opportunity before i depart and that was that erm we did discuss earlier today under this heading the possibilities of erm their being sites on the inner edge or between the built up area or there might become sites between the built up area and the inner edge of the greenbelt i think the implication was they may be in ryedale
my understanding is that a those don't exist at present within the deposit plan but if they did at some future date for any reason that their function would be to be used after two thousand and six to sustain the UNK of the greenbelt
thank you very much
mr davis
yes
i think just two points
er erm we think the nine thousand seven hundred dwellings based on one hundred percent migration for the greater york area is the appropriate strategic approach erm for the greater york area the county council does not see the need for any policy intervention in terms of migration in respect of greater york in the way it feels is necessary in respect of er of four other districts
erm on a general point about the ability to find extra land erm in and around the urban area erm of york particularly erm on the inner edge er of the greenbelt
having been through the six months of the greenbelt local plan enquiry i can say quite clearly to this er examination in public that i doubt whether there is the land available erm er around the inner edge erm to increase the level of housing development in and around the city without seriously UNK greenbelt objectives
thank you
now before you make your opening statement in the context of h two we have some extra papers to distribute
er mr donson leaving us
yes
mr grigson leaving us
they both are
it would be appropriate to say something
yes
to them
is donson coming back
is grigson coming back
grigson
i do i don't know
i don't have handy
don donson isn't yet
erm
just a minute
mr grigson are you retiring altogether from the UNK
yes i am yes sir
thank you very much for your contribution
thank you
ah mr brighton
mhm
no mr UNK with us all this week
we've put the slightly put the cat among the pigeons
pardon
haven't we put the cat among the pigeons
yes indeed
it was all that capacity elsewhere
i know
i mean that's more capacity than we need to
UNK
do your
do your black do your white dots drop into the black hole
we have a
right
it's very difficult to roll a and b together
mhm
i wouldn't have said
no
alright
i know what you
well what's one new settlement to
no two is two is a very important
yes i know that
a copy a copy of these yet which we've nearly
alright
thank you
ah
are you ready to go tell me tell me when
alright okay
no
alright
thanks
so can we now move in the formal sense to looking at the next issue for discussion which covers policy h two the greater york new settlement and the first part of the issue which we shall address is does the proposed greater york new settlement represent an appropriate and justified policy response to the assessed development land requirements of the greater york area and i'll ask mr davis to make his introductory statement
peter davis north yorkshire county council
thank you chairman
i'll go straight into er item two a i think the first thing the county council would wish to say this erm examination is that er today we are really seeing the UNK of i suspect er ten year work erm in greater york by the greater york authority and a particularly intensive period of work over the last five years er by the greater york authorities the paper that i put round n y five the matter two a really addresses the history and why we reached the conclusions UNK that we have and as all as we've already indicated erm progress was able to be made when the secretary of state included a greater york er dimension erm into the er into the structure plan in a the first alteration erm and that enabled a body of work to be undertaken by the greater york authority and i think i ought to say at this point that the greater york authority comprises of the county council er and five district councils and there you have six different councils all with an interest in the future of greater york sitting down together trying to sort out the way in which the future of greater york erm ought to be developed and the means they did it did that of course was through the greater york study which began in nineteen eighty eight and started off immediately with a study of forty fifty development potential development sites erm in and around er greater york which produced a report as i said in on page three of the of n y five around about april nineteen eighty nine the conclusions of which were quite clearly unacceptable to erm members of the greater york authority because they saw quite clearly and they were supported by the public in this that to continue peripheral development which had been the pattern of development in the greater york area erm certainly through the sixties and seventies er was unacceptable in terms of its impact on settlements and particularly er its impact erm on erm the york greenbelt which still at that stage erm had yet to be made statutory and that was again one of the main UNK to making progress the need to s formally define er the york greenbelt
the greater york authorities therefore looked for a widening of the options available er in greater york and those that have seen the greater york study and it is a document that we've put in to the examination will see that there was a fundamental full scale wide ranging er assessment er of all the options er open er within the er greater york er area and they are er set out erm in pages three er and four of n y five
the public consultation exercise that was part of that erm greater york study and quite clearly the greater york study was not a statutory plan it was an informal plan but it was the only way really that progress could be made in the absence erm of adopted local plans in greater york it was essential that document was pursued to give a framework for the preparation of district local plans er and the greenbelt local plan and the resolution that followed the consultation and the long body of work and i'll read it out was that the development strategy for greater york from ninety six to two thousand and six should be based on agreed sites within and on the UNK of the built up area and that the residual requirement be met for the development of a new settlement or settlements located beyond the outer boundary erm of the greenbelt a quite clearly there's a major policy implication there that a new settlement was not acceptable within the greenbelt but would have to be er outside the outer boundary of the greenbelt and the public consultation on that er study er attracted widespread support for a new settlement strategy in greater york all six authorities agreed that was the direction er that had to be taken it also had another benefit in that it enabled work on the york greenbelt local plan erm to proceed and that has now been taken forward to the stage where the enquiry UNK in may it's a joint enquiry in the greenbelt local plan enquiry with a southern ryedale local plan enquiry in april ninety three and we would hope that the inspectors report on that six month enquiry when he considered all the objections to the er greenbelt proposals of the county council largely supported by the er district council will be available er in the near future
the county council also accepted as part of this oral approach that there was a need for an alteration to the structure plan because the approved structure plan did not make provision for a new settlement as an element of approved north yorkshire strategic policy and we've progressed that erm alteration through to the examination er in public er today
so the current position is that there's been substantial progress er in greater york and i think its testimony to the willingness of the greater york authorities to work together there that there's been such a level of agreement i think probably er never before achieved in the greater york area as to the direction that greater york erm er should take
we think that on balance we have er the majority of the support of the public at large within greater york that this is the strategic er approach that is necessary for greater york it's necessary to protect the greenbelt and it's necessary to protect communities and villages er in and around erm greater york
could i also say one thing finally and that is the fact that we've tried to run together the alteration and the greenbelt local plan as UNK er as possible er it would appear that the timing erm is coming together reasonably satisfactorily erm in that we hope that the report from the greenbelt local plan enquiry is not to er far distant erm and we would expect sir that you will be reporting on the proceedings at this examination in public er in the not to distant future well i think i did give an undertaking at the greenbelt local plan enquiry that the county council because the two are er UNK to a degree that i would expect the county council would not wish to pursue either report er until er the other er is available and that seems to the county council to be entirely sensible that the two reports the structure plan alteration and the greenbelt local plan enquiry erm should be looked at together
there we are sir that's erm er a very brief history erm of erm er of the new settlement strategy erm it's one clear that the county council thinks is the appropriate way erm er for the greater york area er to proceed
thank you
thank you
i noted and we've already had the flavour of it in to some respect today that initially you had almost UNK of support from the district councils er york city have changed their view erm and equally hambledon are very luke warm if i put it no more than that er on the idea of a new settlement in the sense that they probably support the principle of the new settlement but not in hambledon
but could you comment and no doubt mr curtis will also want to UNK why york er seem to have UNK on the idea
there is a there is reference in your paper to that
yes
peter davis north yorkshire county council
i mean york city council will obviously er mr curtis will obviously give his views on the situation erm the particular issue that seems to have changed the mind of york city council is the reference in p g thirteen transport to sizes of new settlement not being erm er desirable in transport terms small scale UNK
now there is no definition of what's small erm is erm in er p g er thirteen and perhaps mr curtis could help us in due course erm on an assumption that the new settlement was somewhat larger that th what the county council is proposing whether that would erm change the view of york city council i think there is another factor again i could be corrected on this by mr curtis and this tended to come out in the greenbelt local plan enquiry er and that york city council seem progressively to place more importance on peripheral development than on the new settlement strategy
mhm
erm that is my general feeling for erm the position UNK emerging views erm at the greenbelt local plan enquiry erm weren't shared by the districts er which UNK the city or by the county council
strictly on p g two terms er because of the effect er on the greenbelt but i wouldn't want to go any further than that that's my impression mr curtis will UNK correct me if i'm wrong
yes i mean i noticed from the draft p g thirteen that they do not define small
how small is small
mr curtis do you want to
yes thank you chair
come back on that
david curtis york city council
erm clearly their is a long history of cooperation between the authorities on greater york and er i think it is important to explain the development of thinking on that and the reasons why the city council has i would say progressively er reduced its er the warmth of its enthusiasm to such a state that it's actually become extremely cold now
the original dispersed development strategy ended up with a shortfall something like two thousand dwellings compared to the sites which had been agreed between the various authorities at the time it's also worth noting that was based on a dwelling target of nine thousand one hundred for greater york i think that's correct over the period since actual sites which have been agreed between the authorities since then have clearly increased so as you've seen in my appendix eight the residual requirement has now been reduced to a level of nine hundred and forty seven
the eighty nine strategy was actually supported by four of the authorities including the county council but clearly and i fully appreciate why that decision was made two districts particularly ryedale and selby felt unable to support the strategy
the city council faced with the view that er there was two thousand shortfall in dwellings that clearly two of our most important neighbours in terms of their land area were unhappy with that proposal agreed to er proceed to pursue the issue of the new settlement
in that interim period of that work the draft p g three came out and made it quite clear that the new settlement would have to lie without beyond the outer edge of the greenbelt and that was a fur a further consideration
since that time clearly we've also had a series of further er indications development government guidance on the issue new p g one three and twelve all produced in march ninety two which made it quite clear the environmental considerations were to be given greater attention in development plans
p g three the revised p g three when it came out clearly in my opinion changes the emphasis from the draft p g three from the draft p g three paragraphs thirty two and thirty three which i would emphasize should to be read together clearly indicates that new settlements are as someone said this morning sorry earlier in the discussion today an issue of last resort
this has further UNK to ourselves with i accept our reading of the draft of p g thirteen and also more work we've been doing on land in the city and on the potential traffic implications in particular of further growth outside the ring road
all of those factors lead the city council to the view that the current level of residual given emerging government advice the city council could no longer support the idea of a new settlement of something like fourteen hundred dwellings set in the countryside beyond the outer edge of the york greenbelt
it's interesting to note that actually now we've since made that decision the residual has as i've said come down to nine four seven so if we do have a new settlement of fourteen hundred we're already ending up with a higher level of proposed development for greater york now the nine seven would obviously be exceeded if we had a fourteen hundred new settlement within greater york
the further out from york the new settlement goes the less self contained it will be the more the tendency will be for travel into the city which is the main service centre to be car based
the belief of the city council is that notwithstanding there are clearly difficult traffic problems in the city there is more opportunity to encourage people to use other more environmentally friendly UNK of travel by UNK development in and on the edge of the main urban area a view that's supported by p g thirteen and the research document onto planning transport and planning UNK planning and transport UNK on which it was based
it's for those reasons sir that the city council feels that it can no longer support the proposed proposals for new settlement just to come to your question about the issue of scale i am not able to define what er small is in p g three it's obviously been left deliberately vague but i would draw your attention to the UNK t p a study i've just referred to which makes it quite clear in their terms that to be self contained in transport terms the nearest any settlement ne really needs to be in excess of twenty thousand people
now i could not UNK and i'm sure none of the authorities around us could UNK a new settlement that scale in greater york
if you compare a fourteen hundred new settlement three thousand people with the new settlements around york as you've seen in our papers and some of the papers circulating it's very similar in size to many of the expanded villages around york which are all virtually without exception UNK settlements for the urban area so the inevitable consequence of that size of new settlement in my opinion be it fourteen hundred be it two thousand five hundred dwellings it will be primarily a large housing estate set in the open countryside
on that basis the city council is doesn't feel able to support to support that proposal
thank you
can we have the county council's response to that
mr davis do you want to make any comment on that
er yes i do erm
before i return to other people
i really don't want to UNK the debate because i know there are other
no it's alright
but certainly one three things i'd like to respond to erm mm mr curtis
first of all erm he justified his view on environmental considerations as considered by the city council i think we would say the county council that one of the main considerations that has brought us to the conclusion that we have are environmental considerations the environment of york and its UNK immediate UNK the protection er of the york greenbelt environmental considerations have been er at the most er in our minds
but if i may interrupt how do you cope with the argument that mr curtis was making that if your settlement is say less than two and a half thousand it is no more than a large housing estate which relies on the centre of york for its functions of service shopping entertainment and therefore that the difference between that the difference between a new settlement beyond the greenbelt and peripheral development in those terms is no different
well mr curtis of course is erm is what i would describe as using UNK descriptions to try and do down what's going to happen with a new settlement erm he seems to be convinced that what we're going to end up with er in greater york is a development of the sort of er character that he has described it would be the clear intention of the local authorities to ensure that an appropriate self contained community erm er is developed now erm there is no re
is that really feasible at that level
can sorry can i don't want to stray into item matter b
mm
if we can at this stage
i just want to get the concept of
yes
of the thing clear
is it really feasible that at the sort of level that's being talked about be it your level or the level being put forward by some of the objectors to the structure plan the new settlement could actually hope to provide a good level of comparison shopping for example
well can we make it absolutely clear that no settlement anywhere er in north yorkshire or in york and humberside probably is self contained
if you want to en try and ensure that you're going to have a self sustained community one hundred percent you make sure that presumably you've got a show case cinema with fifteen screens there er a b and q erm a whole range of facilities that nobody ever needs leave erm er that new settlement the reality of the real world of course is that all settlements to a greater or lesser degree er have a relationship with other er larger scale settlements now then let's look at the new settlement fourteen hundred dwellings we estimate that is going to be of the order of around three thousand three hundred people now that is UNK it is not small it is larger than a number of the small market towns er in north yorkshire like UNK settle it is a significant development erm and within it erm there will be a requirement er be a requirement for a primary school it justifies that
certainly we cannot provide a fully one hundred percent sustainable community you'd be talking about some vast city to move towards that erm the re the real world is that the hierarchy of settlements erm all settlements have greater or lesser degree of facilities depending on their size and there'll be no difference er to the new settlement and i think to run an argument on the basis of mr curtis er has run it is unfair to the concept of the new settlement
thank you mr davis i
well there were two other points chairman
yes go on
erm the reference of last resort was mr UNK reference erm it is not a reference which i think you find anywhere er in government guidance and i think what p g UNK three says is the opportunity to pursue them will be relatively rare we think this is a relatively rare circumstance er in north yorkshire it's unique er and it's entirely driven er by UNK er reasons to protect the wider environment of greater york
the third thing and i UNK would have to say it's a bit of a red herring thrown out by mr curtis is the issue of traffic growth con concern on traffic growth
could i say to you that in terms of greater york the county council is the highway authority the county surveyor UNK the county council on traffic implications as a concept the county councillors highway authority is satisfied with the merits er of a new settlement
i won't go any further because i know there are other UNK up UNK round the room chairman
ca can i say i'm attempting to stick with two a er i think i'll take mr grantham and then we'll adjourn for lunch
but would you gentlemen who have UNK that you want to speak leave those UNK up
alright
mr grantham
er john grantham c p r e
