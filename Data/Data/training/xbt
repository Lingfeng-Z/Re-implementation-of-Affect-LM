er sir at the risk of UNK slightly into two b you do forgive me in advance but you raised the specific point about size and erm there was er one or two statements that there isn't a clear view on size in p g three i think it's important to bear in mind the UNK between all p g s and as mr curtis said the research that backs them up and i point you to three quotes in the statement that c p r e have put in erm i paragraph four point one seven an and s the quote that UNK to that is taken from the research that erm er backs up draft revised p g thirteen transport and erm i shall quote from that on this question of size i it is also evident that smaller settlements those with populations of less than fifty thousand but particularly very small settlements are UNK less transport UNK efficient than larger settlements i think the erm essence of that particular piece of research is not as mr davis was implying to achieve totally self contained settlements i don't believe such a concept exists it's actually erm a planning land use in the long term to reduce c o two UNK something that is essential now to government policy i think perhaps more UNK though is the quote that i've in included in paragraph four point one nine and that's taken from er this book here which i perhaps should submit the whole chapter in evidence to the panel i've only just included one quote it's i suggest one of the more interesting reads that you may have as a result of this panel it's by colin ward and it's called new town home town it's undertaken by er sorry includes some of the work that's been undertaken by the university of reading erm and er david lock associates on erm er new town research and this is due to be published by h m s o shortly it's unfortunate that it wasn't available in time for this e i p but i think erm if you'll bear with me i will read out the quote that i put in four point one nine because i feel that it is useful on this question of size we concluded that if you are interested in environmental impact energy UNK consumption and sustainability new settlements have to reach a certain size to be worthwhile it's parallel to the old arguments that used to take place around self containment in new towns we found that new settlements of much less than five thousand houses that's about fourteen thousand people are not really worthwhile because if they are smaller than that you are simply putting a housing estate in the countryside a phrase that has already been put round this morning it appears that the best minimum for a new settlement the best minimum is about ten thousand houses that's twenty five thousand people which as it happens is about the size of the original garden cities
starting from the logic of sustainability we end up with a very similar size for a new community to the one that howard was writing about a hundred years ago
i erm think that is quite useful research that has been undertaken for government and it has been carried through er as i'm sure everybody is aware into the u k strategy for sustainable development the consultation period of which is just UNK erm i won't take you any more of the panel's time to read that quote as it's written in my in my statement
yes i we have read it we have read it
er obviously i mean the new towns movement as conceived immediately after the war was geared to meeting london housing needs you know we're not comparing like with like but i think i take the point that you are making in terms of er sustainability
mr UNK
mr UNK
to say something
malcolm UNK county councillor
i was very interested to read this quote from david lock erm of david lock associates and i just wonder how it squares from the fact that er mr lock associates submitted an objection to h two on the grounds they wanted a settlement of eighteen hundred dwellings to the north of york
erm it does seem to be something of a contradiction in terms there and in fact mr lock isn't here today because his clients have subsequently withdrawn from the er e i p but er it would have been interesting to have asked him the question
on that note i think you should you should go and UNK yourselves
can we can we UNK at two o'clock please
we stayed in that house till i were eight year old and then we were went on to where i lived the rest of my time and that would have been from nineteen twenty to oh a couple of year ago
what was it like on wyre then was it very different
oh entirely different from now
the pier and the hydro and the telephone made a big difference to it
but erm other eighteen inches or two foot to a UNK to land it
all the feeding stuff and there were a pile of feeding stuff then for the hens were all and cattle were fed and all the feeding stuff had to be imported
and sometimes it landed in a gay sorry mess and it really wouldn't there just a couple of feet a couple of stones high just the height of the UNK
and we've had many a UNK landing the stuff
UNK sometimes UNK off and sometimes it didn't anchor there was too much wind i guess the anchor didn't hold too well when it was a rough day
how often did you get the UNK
oh it varied from time to time
in the winter time they'd come out on a monday morning and came back on tuesday from kirkwall
and then the summer time they come out on a monday morning and gone back at on monday night
that was the first one i can remember
the shipping company supplied the boat for bringing the goods ashore
there's usually a old salmon UNK they'd pick up from down the coast somewhere
very flat on the bottom and turned up to the bow and that's what the salmon UNK used in the in the rivers for pulling their UNK in and fishing salmon on the
why choose one of the was it cos they were suitable or cheaper
well they were suitable and cheaper they were too blooming cheap for the they were usually condemned by the time we got them
they UNK alongside and they UNK the stuff right onto the onto the UNK to start with we UNK it ashore with a couple or UNK or maybe four UNK and took off the cattle and that the same way just
or they put a sling round them or made a UNK and two supports on the side of it and the sling to be too hard on the UNK sides
like a sort of UNK
and er put that on and tied them back and front and up on them tied them to the sides of the UNK and usually UNK it with another UNK boat
it was all done by UNK then
were the cattle and all
oh they were not too bad for that we never had any real disaster
just had one jumped over the side from us once and UNK ashore again and we caught it on the on the land again and put it away
i'm having to swim them off the UNK and tow them in a UNK to get our put the UNK on them before we left the beach and just pushed them into the water and UNK them off and hook the hook the into the sling and up them to give them a good wash before they went to kirkwall
it's funny how an animal like a cow or a horse would swim you would think it would be
well they can they can swim like fish
for i remember us doing a flipping er a family came to wyre once and we were on the same old UNK we were er doing the flipping and we thought we had nothing to do but take the rope off their heads and push them over the side of the UNK onto the side of the small UNK
and instead of going up the UNK they went down and they were going to go right back to rousay again
and another instance of that was well this was not so long ago when we had a loan of a barge from just a mini landing craft sort of thing where the front of it folded down
so i UNK some cattle from the farm of and right between UNK and rousay just a short distance oh maybe a quarter of a miles or thereby and oh did the shipping perfectly well and went home and by the time i got home the message had arrived back before me that the there were two old cattle among the younger ones that the fellow had put there just to feed up and the last we saw of them was going up over the island and that was okay we thought everything was okay
so the message was that the two old cattle was back in rousay
they UNK that strong current you know and landed back on rousay again
just imagine it
you'd think it would be totally UNK for them to go in the water like that
i know
but they will do it
were the cattle in rousay and wyre and UNK were they used to that kind of thing
oh no really no
well you see UNK and rousay had UNK that they could land at and they were never used to be in the water
but i've seen in my time UNK to ship cattle with to swim them off
at it was on a nice day it was all right
i suppose when they got in the water they enjoyed the dip
what about other animals
sheep can be very sort of UNK and UNK
oh yes
there's sometimes there's a job to handle them
i've seen them taken to the sea too and er have a job to round them up
and the horses well they they're the worst to ship some were really bad and they had to be severely tied
some use to keep pigs too but not very many in wyre
we had a job to handle them
the UNK on them more than enough
what happened in the depth of winter when it was really bad and UNK as far as supplies and things went
oh it could be UNK right enough but well the UNK might call at rousay at that time and they would land the goods in rousay the UNK for wyre and when the weather UNK we would get it from there
it was just about a half a mile of water to cross
what happened with UNK because you said there was no power no electricity no UNK no UNK nothing
nothing no i've seen the bread coming out on a monday morning warm and landed at from the big houses and that was before the days of the cooling of the bread
they have UNK now to take the steam away from them
and the boxes would even be warm when they landed at wyre down in the hold of the UNK
but the bread soon turned green in this time of year and there was quite a lot of penicillin about hence
did folks still have UNK then or was that going out
oh yes i guess they'd UNK oh i suppose when the hens failed the UNK were possibly thrown out
but the hens when was the UNK there about finished them
about at their height about the UNK time and was it fifty one i think
what was it like
oh terrible
i thought i would never seen the next day
the stacks were just simply not there
it just lifted the UNK from the base of the stack and hen houses just scattered all over the place
just hens laying here there and everywhere
i remember me gathering the hens up that night late oh about ten or eleven o'clock at night and we had our own power you see by that time
just our own lighting plant and the hens would even come out and meet you in the dark they knew you were coming
and they'd come along cattle there just UNK as could be and then they got their supper and we'd give them a wee while of light still to eat their supper
and the first was a twelve UNK but then we came to a hundred and ten so i just UNK it down along the two top wires of the fence and they were live and oh there were about six or nine hen houses attached to the fence with those wires for electricity
but the next morning there was nothing left
on this night you said you'd gone up to feed them
yes
oh well i gave them and went home and went to bed
and the wind got up in the night and pretty strong and we had a hut a twenty by twenty five foot fourteen eighteen war hut in the middle of a square and there was a shop and a UNK besides
and there was nothing left but the base of that
whole thing just went like a UNK
and i got up and i was gonna tie her up like but and by gosh i thought i'd better make for the door again
and there was a lot of space between the hut and the door and the wind took me and UNK me right up against the tank and i went down to the ground and UNK on me hands and knees
i didn't go out again
i remember before that the wind changed pretty suddenly from UNK to nearer west i think and i'd made a new hen house i thought UNK
and we had sixty UNK at the point of lay in this house to be moved out from the house to a field
and we were standing on the end of the house and i thought i had nothing to tie that down with but there were concrete blocks there i had a pile of those in the corner and well it took the whole blooming thing
and UNK the hens up with the blocks
oh it was terrible
and it let an old house alongside with nothing in it and hardly a door on it and that stood right alongside of that one and it must have been like a UNK it just must have gone in strips the gale for that house was now twelve foot away from the other one
and why did that one stand and the blocks in this one and the hens and everything
so that was disaster
were you married then
mhm
did you have a young family as well
yes and we took the whole thing down to the kitchen for the upstairs rooms were just going like this
and when we were down in the kitchen the UNK between the UNK and the UNK as they called it was going like that inside of the house in the gale
and it ripped about a quarter of the roof off before it finished and the slates but er still good
oh it lifted huge stones you know it wa it was incredible
were the UNK frightened
well some of them i suppose slept over it
what
yes
but i certainly did not
and when it daylight came the next day next morning you could hardly believe it you could hardly see rousay for the UNK that the gale kick up like a thick fog
the had risen in the air and i never want to see the like again
it must have done an awful lot of damage everywhere else too
oh it did that all right
and some of that hen houses blew right on the sea
not our owns but erm other people and they could see them the next day when the UNK went to the north isles for the er the UNK or the hens sitting on the top of them
and they could do nothing to save them
did the UNK go the next day
well yeah the wind fell but i'm not really sure whether they went the next day or the day after that i can't remember
oh it took some sorting out on the next morning
and you see all the crop had UNK over the night
and they had to import hay and straw and goodness knows what
did the council have to set up some sort of emergency system
er yes i think they did but er we UNK we lost about eight hundred and fifty pounds worth of gear
fifty or sixty pound worth of that but which was nothing
were folk insured for that kind of thing then or
well no really some of them were not
what about UNK would they have been in at that time of year
oh yes
oh some of the roofs sort of and that were UNK off no bother
was there any loss of life
no funny to say
had it been in the day time i'm sure there would have been lives lost for they wouldn't have stayed in to seen their stuff go under
going for the wind
thing about boats you know you were speaking about the UNK coming back and forth to wyre but what kind of a boat service was there local boat service
cos if the UNK only came once a week that wouldn't have been enough
oh that was about the lot er we had
if you wanted to go to kirkwall you had to cross to the rousay pier and then either hire a car or walk to and get across with tom
erm that was in the early days UNK and tom did the crossing there for the UNK and early in nineteen fifty one no fifty five that we took over the UNK
and we before that we made quite a few runs to kirkwall with a that was a small one that we had and erm you had to get the bus from UNK of course to kirkwall and back the same way
back along with the back to what you would call the sea crossing er to and get on to the rousay pier then and get a UNK or something and row across to wyre
did you start doing a passenger service when you got the mail contract or did you to the mail just on its own first or did you
no we did we did passengers before the UNK
we used to run direct to kirkwall via and erm it was then that the post office caught hold of us and wanted us to take on the UNK
so
how did you work that was it er sort of round like UNK or did you
no the first mail run we had was just merely from to rousay to collect the rousay UNK and dump them at the rousay pier and they were sorted in rousay for UNK and wyre besides that
and as we were coming home from rousay pier we met the wyre post boat coming across for the UNK that we already had dumped in rousay
and UNK crossed to the school just there yes
er they crossed there to for the UNK for years and years
and
you said you met the wyre post boat coming back so you didn't
as we went back to wyre home to wyre we could meet the wyre post boat coming across for the UNK that we put to rousay
they had to go and collect the UNK
well you see they had the mail er contract on wyre long before we start
but it finally ended up that we had the whole thing rousay UNK and wyre
so did you do a passenger service direct to kirkwall calling at UNK and rousay
er yes just er no really a service it was more UNK than anything else
just er for the business
oh so that so the passenger service it wasn't actually a daily passenger service like it is now then
oh no
well we went every day on about the mail so it was a passenger service that really started off in nineteen fifty five but we bought maybe in nineteen fifty three or fifty four
we had to run direct to kirkwall quite a lot then
when did the bus service start to then
oh it was a while after we start
actually it not that long ago
but a few years now
well what did folk do when they got to then
oh well bob had a mini bus that he went with and picked up the passengers
and of course he died and i think
there was no bus then
no
they only thing they could do was to go walk up to walk up a road to and contact the UNK bus but it didn't come down along for years and years
and then er tom retired and he used to run the bus long after we start the UNK and then he retired and er the bus service to come down along and pick up the passengers and that was how it start
there was tom running a passenger service at the same time as you were doing the mail
mhm and he lost the UNK in nineteen fifty five
he packed up the UNK and er tackled the to have a go
and we were not too keen on it at that time but had been all right
so are there two boats going every day then
well yes there would nearly two going every day indeed
did you take supplies and things as well then
mhm
i took our tin of bread across for UNK years
what happened in the days before UNK i mean well like going back to this you know when folk didn't have power
things wouldn't have kept what you would have had a totally different kind of eating habits
well i suppose more UNK meat i mean more home UNK and erm making bread i suppose or the UNK were likely baking every day
it must be totally different now i know that in places like hoy that just used the UNK all the time
yes mhm
even with our daily transport
mhm
oh yes we yeah we use a UNK too
we took in and for and still use it
i thought plenty believe in fresh meat and that
i suppose fresh meat is better but you're only suppose to keep a certain time anyway even in the UNK
what about fishing
when you were younger in wyre how did folk make a living
oh plenty of UNK and milk and er oh there was no much money to be made i mean and there was a lot bigger population then than what it is now
you said about the hens making a lot how did how did they work that as an industry with the eggs and things how did they collect and work
we had a oh nearly a dozen cases of eggs dozen sometimes for some farms
and it was a big business and tons of feeding stuff
for every ton of feeding stuff then there maybe a UNK now coming ashore
it was
what happened
well imported eggs i suppose
irish eggs and goodness knows whatnot
oh and there's factory farming this er big business
i guess it UNK the lot of it
you could always tell a deep litter egg
oh absolutely
it UNK and it was dark orange
yes
you could tell a UNK what they call them er UNK
that was absolutely white compared with a fully range UNK
i mean that's the meat
oh that's just no so good
there must have been a big business even when the deep litter started cos i can remember the farm next door to us working a deep litter
mhm
and they had hundreds and hundreds of hens in deep litter and they seemed to be making a lot of money out of it
oh they would yes
oh they and i guess it set a few farmers on his feet
but it didn't last
what happened with the egg packing station
oh well it just packed up you know no eggs and that was that
there were two packing stations at one time
one down at here and er where was the other one or the down the road here
that was a fairly big one and i think there may have been one at stromness too
oh it had washing machines and goodness knows whatnot auto
what's
automatic UNK and such likes
what sort of prices did folk get for eggs then
oh i can't remember that
mm
was it the women's business really
well up to a point indeed but er the men would er help out i doubt
i always seem to recall the women up to their UNK in freezing cold water washing
washing eggs
mhm
oh yes
and plenty got this egg wash you see
and just filled a net basket of eggs and put it down in the in the water and the water UNK through it kind of
possibly with a pump i don't know
but it would be better if it did not need washing
the egg was actually the eggs would keep better washed
oh why's that then
well i think it broke the seal in the wash and er which was good get them as they were laid they were okay
keep the UNK clean but that was no good to do either so
sometimes the hens would start eating them and break the eggs oh what a mess
when they changed the deep litter did it erm i've heard folks say that it actually affected the hens that they that they went UNK and
oh yes oh they would do that all right
they started UNK one another and it was a job to get them stopped
yes it's funny to think of hens having feelings but i suppose being UNK up like that it did affect them
oh aye it must have done mhm
see they got on the lights so long of the day in the winter time and made them lay just like as if it'd been summer
well that was the idea of the
mhm
deep litter
mhm
old one old ones just used which was at the bulb in every hen house and it was free range and i think there was nothing better than that
and they would lay just when and collect them eggs that night afore the gale
it was i just heard about
welcome back
all week elton john made his various UNK and UNK from the high court where he was honest about his UNK to drink drugs and UNK eating
he left with his head held high but what did he have on his head
should men fight nature with UNK and hair UNK or is bald best
well with us we have some gentlemen who believe that bald is not best
and
we do
some people who think that maybe they're wrong
barbara you wrote an article in the times about all of this you've been following elton john's UNK and UNK in the court what did you think
ha
of his new appearance
i just thought poor guy i mean he was somebody who thought he'd overcome food UNK drink UNK drugs UNK and he looks like a UNK
i thought it was really very funny this long UNK black hair he looked absolutely miserable he thought he was now UNK calm and UNK and he's got this peculiar thing on his head that makes him look so daft
nobody's told him obviously
well listen is it is it just UNK that look funny you've got something against or have you got something against all sorts of things that men put on their heads
we er i think i have
i mean it is if they look funny i feel that they're UNK if you can't tell then that's you know jolly good luck i suppose except that somebody knows
they know
elton looks like UNK in drag in that wig
the funny thing is that if you know that what you've got on your head is something UNK then you can't feel all that good about yourself
well listen let me i let me introduce you to now who shall we pick tony first of all what have you got to say to it sitting
there in your then do i call it a UNK or a wig or
call it what you like call it a cat if you want i mean i don't mind i like UNK on the head
it probably was i think it's actually it's been made from cubic hair er UNK hair sorry
come on
and er i feel i've been wearing one for about twenty five years and i feel a lot better i feel i feel as if i look good in a wig
and without one i'd
excuse me
why are you all laughing
excuse me what can you wear to improve your face
i wore it for one year and that
come on alan
was the worst year of my life
come on come on you said you said it's the worst year of your life the w year you wear a UNK why
why because i felt it wasn't me
i was an artificial thing walking around i was scared i was scared of
i wanted to see the real me the real me
and that's me without it
listen
has he got artificial teeth
have you got your own teeth
yes
and they're all mine and they're real
UNK why do you wear yours
because i don't like bald heads
if you see for yourself have a look at 'em
alan bald is not er alan bald is not necessarily beautiful haven't you ever thought of covering it up
no not really
see this man here he thinks he's comfortable with his wig but he UNK the jacket so we don't even get to look at his hair
actually i like to you don't say much but when you say it it's nothing
is there a volume control on that jacket
turn it down a bit it's a bit loud
okay john why do you think it's important that you should be allowed to wear a UNK if you want
because i'm emotionally affected by not wearing it
all these people who are UNK half of them have got their own hair
yeah
yeah
if they didn't have their own hair they'd kn they'd know the emotional effect of hair loss
now i i've been selling UNK for twenty three years so i'm probably better in a better position than anybody here to explain the emotions of men who're losing their hair
and some of those guys out there some of them have actually committed suicide
yeah but my argument is
right
that they shouldn't feel that bad
well your argument is that they shouldn't feel that bad but they do feel that bad
well that's because somebody has told them that bald is ugly bald isn't ugly it's
i'm sorry my darling bald is ugly
calm down guys i want to ask you is he better with it or without it
take it off
you might not be better but you're natural
what's the difference
excuse me excuse me do you wear false teeth
no
how many people in the audience wear false teeth
what's that got to do with it
it's exactly the same thing
listen this is getting too noisy one person at a time please
sh
i will answer if you shut up
UNK all of you UNK one at a time
gentleman here
can i just make a point
can i make a point
i've had a bald patch for twenty years
it's part of my character it's who i am and i'm not gonna hide underneath any wig
my friend if you didn't have hair at the front
would you guys like to look at me and ask a answer a question
why do you bother
why not live like nature intended you to
but nature didn't intend
intend it
we was born with hair wasn't we
you were born with hair
we weren't though
i was born with this UNK
okay what do you think now you're a UNK of some standing in london why do you think that men get so hung up about all of this kind of hair
because it's a sign of UNK
never
and if
let me finish if it makes them feel better if you wanna wear a wig or UNK you wear one if you want to stay bald you stay bald but whichever way it doesn't interfere with my life right so if you want keep a wig on and you feel happy and you feel more of a person erm then fine
why do you think it is that people need to do it
well the thing is that you know erm somebody's got no hair they think a lot of this the problem UNK round the UNK and er they haven't come to term with it
so they go and wear one and it makes them feel better for job interview pulling girls er going to places you know
is does
does it boil down does it boil down to a lack of security to the fact that
one at a time
sorry
simply to a need
i mean i've had people who can't get work because they look old right
yes now that group have come into me and two weeks after they've worn the UNK they've got a job after two and half years of not finding work so what do you say to that
okay
it's not rubbish it's the truth
UNK
these gentlemen here have got such big mouths it's unbelievable
i wish they'd listen to other people
i've been bald from a very early age but i happen to be in the UNK industry and i travel all over the world teaching
what right does any individual have to tell other people what they should or shouldn't do
excuse me excuse me if you if you used your mouth as well as your brain you'd be better off the thing is this that quite honestly nobody here has the right do you like the way that gentleman looks
he likes the way he looks good luck to him he wants to wants those boots great
these guys wanna wear UNK they feel good with it let 'em do it who tells you what you gotta eat where
talking about talking about life here is someone we all know here's someone we all know from that's life
howard
when did you start going bald
i started losing mine when i was nineteen and er i must say in answer to that gentleman's
yeah
er comment about erm the chap not getting any work erm i think i can UNK most of my work to the fact that i do have a bald head
you're in that nice kind of profession where people
it c it certainly hasn't been a UNK to me
it hasn't
tell me did it give you did you actually just say i mean UNK young
yes
to i mean did it ever bother you
well i was a drama student at the time and i suppose erm
yes listen can you just shut up one at a time lady there
yeah i wanna know right why don't you just you know go bald you know normally why do you have to hide it
cos i'm happier with a UNK on
okay listen there's someone over
people treat me differently
yeah but you know
women treat me differently
if a women puts her hair hands through your hair
yeah
right and it falls off in the soup
it doesn't fall off in the soup it never falls off it's only the ones you see on the advertisements that fall off
can you can you run your hands
these never fall off
can you run your hands through it
yes like that how's that alright
listen let me let me come to david UNK
david we know you so i'm going
swim with it do everything in it
ca can you stop talking
wait
you tell 'em
david why do you want to grow your hair
i would be happier having hair there's no doubt about that
mm
erm i started losing my hair at twenty nine
mm
i've come to terms with it doesn't bother whether i've got it or not but to be honest i'd rather have more hair than i do now
and i put it down to having a fairly bad circulation and i'm get getting my circulation back using a product called and going on this er hair programme and my hair is beginning
you're doing it for charity does it i mean is that
really the bottom line or would you do you
er i'm
hoping it works
i'm growing hair for charity but in many respects that's probably an excuse
i'd like my hair to grow back
is it working
and it's beginning to grow back a little bit
the little hair is growing back and er that makes me a happy person
mm
if it doesn't grow back i've accepted that it might not but if it grows back i'll be a very happy man
okay th you you're the UNK of this system or the UNK of this system to the wider public should i say er why is it gonna work
because we know why people lose their hair
there are a number of reasons why people lose their hair stress is a very key factor
UNK means that one may have a UNK to lose one's hair but
and why is why is going upside down for two minutes twice a day gonna make it grow again
it's part of a programme it helps get blood back to the hair fo we've all got all the hair UNK there what we haven't got is the UNK network feeding those hair UNK
okay is it is it is it going to is it going to work
well
i mean is tho though we can see david upside down
okay erm i'm a UNK i'm a little bit i'm a little bit worried about er this er exploitation of people and security because they've got no proven record and no medical evidence if he was that good this guy will be a UNK and people will be growing hair all the time to put somebody on the chair without knowing if that person's got blood pressure or heart problems they could suffer from a s a stroke erm have er or be partially paralysed so i think i like to see this man here maybe in ten fifteen years time with proper proven er medical evidence
okay it's quite a serious point you should answer it
yeah we have a number of doctors who are part of our distribution er set up we have people like brian who's UNK growing his hair back there are medical UNK for people who can't UNK so
okay fine
do you think it works
well i c i i've seen so many things over the year i just don't believe it until i actually see it and th literally four weeks ago i'd just got back from germany went on a meeting the following morning and it's that gentleman there steve and h he's got some pictures in his pocket which will prove exactly what we're talking about
because when this guy put his head down i just did not believe that was
you've grown your hair doing this
am growing my hair
that had happened
proof of the pudding
UNK believing
we don't happen to have the picture of you before so i've no way of knowing
i do
well i can't put it up we do
yeah
okay
there you go
we who can see it who can see this picture
you need some glasses as well then
you got it
would you bother editor of UNK here i mean i don't know why i don't know why i should think you know what women want i guess you know what men want
i spend i spend a lot of time with them so i spend a lot talking to them
do you do you think that women actually mind whether chaps are bald or not
i UNK think er that women mind at all i don't think that people in general really take that much notice of it i mean i personally er have no objection or would not try and UNK these gentlemen from wearing these things but i personally would never wear one and one of the reasons i would never wear one is apart from maybe two cases there you can always tell and i think the thing is that when i would feel very uncomfortable walking down the street and UNK i'd feel that everyone was there going wig and the other thing is there's a young lady at the back there made a very valid point er
i spend a lot of time with a lot of girls it's my job i don't want one of them to run her fingers through my hair and it come away in her hand you know that's
gentleman at the back there
it's a UNK
people don't know anything about the things that they're not talking about you've had no experience of it you don't know you know of the bad UNK and UNK
yeah
any form of hair replacement that you see down the UNK down the street this gentleman here is just anti hair and the story whether it's your hair up there trying to grow it or whatever
erm people that haven't experienced it don't know what they're talking about
you don't know you've passed you've passed you've passed
thank you it ain't it's my own
you believe that i'm wearing a UNK so you don't know and i speak for most
i wanna answer that because cos you were sitting over there i assumed
can i finish you were sitting there i assumed that you did
the fact is that every other gentleman there i can tell it's a UNK yours i couldn't
tell i was wearing a UNK
yes of course i knew you were wearing
the point i really want to make is that if somebody can come up with a UNK that really looks real i think people may consider wearing them
john the best kept secret in show business
it is not
twenty five years that man has worn a UNK and no one ever knew
barbara at the end of the day at the end of the day UNK let me ask barbara this question at the end of the day everyone's been saying if th if they feel good doing it and it gives them that much confidence and they feel great about it whatever it looks like why object
well you don't object except you feel really sad for them because everybody's wig
feel sad for me
i'll tell you what it is
you think you look like you've got hair i think you look like you've got a wig
now
look when you get as old as me you'll be i'll be glad to have a head like you
it's mine
i shan't see eighty again
i don't mind
i don't mind how
well i want to stay out of that UNK
but UNK if you won't see eighty again if you won't see eighty again
look if i take my hair off i'm gonna finish up with an old girl with a bloody UNK frame
i'll tell the secret and he's eighty four
don't you think that at eight at eighty four you'd be like to be chasing the girls with your wig on
hours of endless fun for you girls out there
his teeth come out his hair comes off sex by numbers
the trouble is UNK has got the wrong
how old are you now
it's got a bad reputation we associate it with old age the truth is man loses his hair because he's got too much male UNK and he loses it because he's got a sex drive like a UNK
the truth is ladies you only have to touch a bald man and you light up like blackpool tower
that is the truth
why do you UNK your head
because i was going thin
but why did you UNK it
why did you UNK it
because i didn't want because i didn't want people laughing at me like everyone's here laughing at you
gentleman in the audience who looks as though he hasn't got much on top what did you wanna say
i th i think that's just UNK why they wear it
you know he he's on about he's on about chasing women why wear a wig to chase women
another gentleman in the audience in the blue t shirt
i gotta say that thousands of people wear contact UNK f through UNK and nobody UNK about that and that's more unnatural
okay
aren't you aren't you aren't you actually getting bald people a bad name
isn't he
yes
doing more to get people to be proud of being bald than you are
UNK his hair off
now if he didn't UNK his hair off and he was walking around with a UNK round the side of his head
i'd say maybe you're right
but he's UNK his hair off so he looks better he thinks he looks like UNK
right
and that's why he's done it
can i just ask you a question sue
UNK anything you've heard barbara change your mind
i wanna ask you a question
i want to ask why you thi why you feel better with people knowing you're wearing a wig
they don't know i'm wearing a wig
oh gentleman up here what do you think
if a person
wait
if a person wants to wear a wig and erm you know you should feel comfortable with or without a wig doesn't really matter does it
you don't have this problem do you
obviously not no
that's great thank you all very much indeed thank you
well that's it for this week
er let's have a look at what we've got here on our cards
the doctor who was advertising himself this is mr from UNK the doctor who was advertising the cure for UNK is going bald himself so obviously the cure isn't working
from birmingham says hanging upside down has always been known as a cure in the far east and it does work
alan from derby says i wonder why wearing a wig is any worse than a woman wearing make up
and tony from telford says i spent years UNK my hair over my bald patch it stopped four months ago and i'm much happier
so that's it for this week sorry we didn't have room for our promised body building item i've been told to work on my UNK before we get back to it and er it shouldn't take too long
next friday we'll do our level best to keep er our hair on during another live edition of central weekend
may i wish you UNK
UNK
welcome back
right this week an army lieutenant was UNK for fifteen months after a court UNK heard him plead guilty to seven charges relating to bullying and UNK new recruits
the sentence on the UNK regiment officer is subject to confirmation but the question we're asking is how often are other recruits subject to bullying and UNK
brigadier how often
well of course i can't possibly give you any figure of how often but bullying occasionally happens in the army
and may i say very clearly and UNK at the outset that it is UNK when it does happen to us because there's no place for it quite simply because er it is UNK to UNK and UNK is the basis for operational effectiveness and when there is an incident of bullying then we very promptly and thoroughly investigate it and that investigation is followed if there's a case to be brought by a trial of the chap that's guilty
and may i say also
please do
that we're well aware of the fact that when we're doing this of course there's usually a degree of adverse publicity
that is UNK to the business of UNK out the cancer where it occurs
from you than the statement you've just made er and i think you'll be you used the word UNK i think you'll be UNK by some of the er stories you're about to hear
if i can come to you andrew you were in the royal UNK what
that's correct
happened to you
basically the full time i was in basic training and when i went to the UNK the royal UNK regiment the first UNK i was physically beaten and mentally UNK er into the same bargain
well what do you mean by mentally UNK
well they can physically do it to you with use of UNK use of hands and whatever else they've got and they can mentally do it to you like put you in jail that or all sorts of things like when i was on sick leave they came and lifted me
right well t tell me about the physical abuse what sort of things were they doing to you andrew
beat ya up
n c os UNK officers beat ya up and a above them as well
you get
so
in a battle camp you're supposed to be learning how to fight in a war and basically they beat ya up and in camp as well it happens in camp too
and did you see th w was it widespread did you see it happening to other people
it's very widespread
actually i witnessed a guy being raped in the army
that was by that was by normal recruits but it still happens it actually the bullying goes down the line
the n c os bully the officers bully the n c os the n c os bully the UNK and the UNK bully the UNK
it goes down the line all the way down the line
it's a UNK it's a non
if you're bullied you bully somebody else
aye
and so on and so on
let me just get back that was UNK as a word w has already been used and er should be used again by what you said you saw s somebody being raped by two soldiers
did you try and help that particular soldier
i did i did i s actually put a stop to it
that's
so that was a brave thing to do
i wouldn't say it was brave it was a normal thing to do wasn't brave there was nothing brave about that
was just a normal thing to do
you'd expect yeah y you'd expect somebody to do that for you of course
of course i would
did you find wh when you were being bullied or when other people were being physically UNK that other soldiers would help them or would they just stand by and let it happen
basically you'd er just stand back and ha actually in my UNK of fifty men it happened to me more than it happened to anybody else because i came from glasgow
oh he's a glasgow hard man let's get him
i came from a rough area so that's the way it worked
so they find your particular weakness your UNK heel and th they'd go for that
brigadier evidently and we've heard lots and lots of these stories and you've said you think it's the occasional example but you're doing all you can to stamp it out but evidently the army is a UNK for UNK and UNK
well it's not of course that's absolute rubbish and of the cases that we'll have here tonight each of them if they are true are very er unfortunate indeed an and i wouldn't UNK any of them if they're true
the fact is of course that what we're seeing here is a tiny minority of people and i could bring thousands of people here tonight who've been in the services thousands of parents of those people who've been in the services who would give you a very different story
so i think we should get it in perspective
we're seeing just a few cases and i don't deny the fact that occasionally there are UNK in the army
but there's certainly not a UNK for UNK or no nor is it UNK in any way at all
well some people would claim it is UNK
some people would actually claim that there is a culture of bullying within the military infrastructure
but let's t let's t
well i would deny that
well let's talk let's talk to richard
richard er h these are occasional examples and they're very rare
i would disagree with that
i would disagree with that a lot
well what's your experience
well erm apart from my own experience erm i witnessed i couldn't even m er name as many erm instance of bullying that went on in my regiment erm and for all different kinds of reasons you know
erm in my regiment i was in
you were in the UNK guards
i mean i was the on i was the only black guy in the regiment erm for a very long time and erm you know it didn't it doesn't matter what colour you are erm apart from my case there was if you was erm if you were slow on your runs or you wasn't good at cleaning your kit you would get bullied
and it was severe bullying
and it wasn't a case of just a few UNK and that
it was just disgusting stuff you know
what sort of stuff
well i mean there was an incidence where erm maybe a guy who didn't clean himself very often they would er a whole group of guys would find it funny to take him into the toilet erm fill a bath up with half with water put UNK in it erm UNK in it UNK in it and put him in hit him with ba erm UNK all kinds of stuff like that
let's make it clear
are these occasional examples that you're
they weren't occasional at all not in my regiment no
and this was in training as well
but is this not something you just have to put up with if you join the army
it's part of the UNK up process
no i do no that's rubbish
i don't who said that but that's rubbish
that i it doesn't UNK you up at all
it doesn't UNK you up it just turns you into a bag of nerves basically
aha
you've got two choices you either stay and you take it or you leave
if you leave you get caught you get put in jail
if you leave do you feel you've lost
i mean there is a school of thought that
yeah
says if you can't take how would you be able to handle the front line
if you leave if you leave let's say if you get caught and sent back then you're gonna get back you know twice as much as you had for the reason for leaving
have you learnt anything from the experience
yeah i've learnt a lot basically i've learnt erm basically what sort of organization that is and those other ones i could mention as well which run along the same sort of lines erm i've learnt to look after myself
has it UNK you up
yeah it has
so some people might say perhaps UNK that it th it has achieved its desired effect it's UNK you up
i think that depends on the individual
well david UNK i mean er the brigadier said that these are very occasional examples but from these stories that these gentlemen are telling us and who are we to UNK them the they make their claims this is a very serious problem in the army
perhaps some sensitivity is n needed for our young recruits perhaps a type of counselling is needed to help them
would you agree with that
no i don't
erm i go along with the brigadier on this i don't approve of any of the things i've heard this evening and i don't believe that is the normal course of action in the army
i've been a soldier myself i was a soldier a long time ago and er training was different in my day to what it is today
but i also have one of the largest training UNK in my constituency and i see that unit erm in action a couple of times a year if no more
now by and large it's a tough game being a soldier
and the difference between being tough and responding rapidly to instruction and discipline and bullying is something that er you have to UNK er i in this discussion tonight
right fair enough that's er that's a very fair point but is being thrown in a bath er full of UNK and urine part of the UNK process
no it's not it's qu it's quite disgraceful and nobody would approve of that and the co th the army if they got hold of anybody on that basis they would court UNK them immediately and they'd be very severely dealt with
that yeah can i answer that
andrew
now you would court UNK them well i put it to the s i b
s i b what's that
that's the special investigation branch
special investigation branch
all the allegations i made all the UNK i took i'm bleeding they investigated nothing and what the brigadier said the brigadier is talking nonsense
he knows that the army is w widespread in the army and he
it's like everything else you company commander you tell him he throws it out the window
he sends you away make you feel happy
do you know i've served in the army for thirty three years and i've UNK every thing at every level in the UNK which both these gentlemen have been in from a UNK right up now to a UNK er brigade and i can honestly tell you that i haven't seen more than a couple of incidents of bullying in the whole of that time
you're a commissioned officer
the point is the point is that's a good point what you've said you don't see it
that's the whole point
you come at a UNK room as an officer
mm
or a UNK it doesn't matter
mhm
you'll see it
with rank on your arm
yeah
the soldiers i that room will act a different way
i agree
when the door UNK
i understand that
a different way again
they will
i can understand that i can understand that
but it's a matter leadership
and leadership in the army is some
leadership has got nothing to do with it whatsoever
leadership
it's just a case of it's just a case of a few individuals or people with rank who think they've go so much power they're gonna press people
yes i'm sorry to hear that people in rank in your particular case were involved
yeah well we've got a job to do if you're a soldier you've got a job to do okay you've got a bit of training you've got a job to do
right absolutely
yeah you don't need no UNK and bullying and bullying
i quite agree i quite agree
and racism and all that UNK
i quite agree
and if you're gonna send people to northern ireland and places like that you want 'em to defend the next soldier
well c could i just come in
but they do
david UNK yes david UNK
andrew i'll let you back in
in a minute in a minute
i certainly didn't go in with a rank on my shoulder i went in as a recruit
but you said
but when i when i when i trained as recruit i trained with a lot of other er lot of other people
but that was in different days this is nineteen ni
there was no easy way out in my day you w yo y
one second andrew i'll come to you in a sec
you were UNK in and you did your national service
now when you did
this national service you served your country for a set period of time
i actually did three years of that period of time in the army
the majority of people that went through that service all had some recollection of things they didn't enjoy very much but they by and large thoroughly enjoyed their experience in the army it UNK them up it made them better men and we have got after all one of the best UNK if not the best army in the world it's got to come from
i don't think that's
somewhere and it has to come from the training
alright andrew briefly
go on
basically i don't disagree with you aye we have got the best army and i loved my i loved my time in the army but i'm totally against the way i was treated in the army
that doesn't there's when you're off duty it's great but when you're on duty it's different
the UNK made me a lot better person
i'm a i totally disagree
you had a you were unfortunate in the way you were treated
with you in the way it is run when you when i took my allegations to him because that's basically what they're saying it is i know it's no allegations
let's not go into the UNK of the court case just now david UNK what i want to say to you do you think it's a case some people might perhaps UNK but they still would say that those people who are bullied are bullied because they are UNK and in the military one has to conform and many people
well of course of course they do
it's what our the UNK all about
so if in any way you're different if you're black or if you're short or if in any way you're different you're fair game for the UNK perhaps
it's not whether you're black or white it's not whether you're pink or green it's how you respond to orders
and how quickly you respond to orders situations
did you not respond to orders richard
it's not a case of black and white did you say
no
it is it was a case it was a case with me that i was black or white and that's why that's why it hit the press like it did
look you're a guy that's been through a lot
i accept that
yeah
but you survived it
and you will go on surviving it you will turn
why should i have to survive it my country too you know
i know it's your country too
and nobody no nobody is saying that you were tr
i was told when i was in my regiment i was told my country it wasn't my country that was what i was told
nobody is saying that
david UNK
you were treated correctly badly treated
david UNK david UNK
survivor
david UNK one second
now er w with every respect to say that he survived it is something of a UNK statement because i remember reading about him thinking isn't this country getting good that we can have a black UNK and i remember my own disappointment when i read that he had to leave the regiment
let's speak to er tim er
now tim er you were a soldier now you're a social worker
we heard earlier on about this UNK bath i think they call it this bath of UNK and urine and UNK and the brigadier and david UNK said how rare this was er did you ever see it
certainly to the extent that er richard has experienced it no
but it was a fairly common way of getting people who perhaps wasn't up to standard or whatever other recruits would grab them and as he's described take them into the bathroom
throw them into a bath filled with whatever they chose to erm
so it's a fairly common UNK
it happened certainly two or three times during my training
in your own training you saw it
mhm
er the so called UNK bath
now there's another case here we've heard of er of racism and i mean racism is the UNK very often for bullying and UNK and UNK
and er paul your UNK er he died while he was with his regiment
what happened to him
yes my brother er joined the army about two years ago until he took his own life earlier on this summer
erm he started his life er in vietnam in the violence of vietnam and had therefore a lot of violence in his early life which i think really stayed with him but when he did join the army he was very proud to be doing so and very proud to be wanting to be part of britain and serving britain in whatever way he could
and a i would say that actually during the early period in the army i think he probably gave as good as he got
i mean it was tough life was tough for him and i know that he faced quite a lot of comments both of racist and other things
he was UNK presumably the comments were of a racist nature
yes er yes that's right
and he took quite a lot of them but in the time that
name calling
oh all of that name calling and quite a bit more
but during that time when things were going well he managed it
i think the thing that worries me most is that later on he didn't manage it too well a lot of other things were going wrong in his life and at that point the name calling continued and the stuff that maybe wasn't so UNK early on seemed to become very UNK then
and my main concern and complaint is that the army with its emphasis on being macho on being strong on being okay doesn't allow people to have their own weaknesses and in 's case i just wish somebody somewhere in authority had spotted that he was a lad in trouble
but if you do have pe people will say if you do h have those weaknesses and if er there were times that he could was quite up to the UNK and the name calling there were times when he wasn't the very fact that there were times when he wasn't doesn't that tell you that perhaps the army wasn't the place for him
well i don't know about that because i don't think that anybody stays the same all the way through their life and i don't think there's anybody in life that's strong in every circumstance
i believe everybody at some point needs support
now one of the problems is in the army that if you do need support it's a sign of weakness it's a sign of failure it's almost impossible for you to get the kind of counselling and help that a lot of young lads need and i think that a lot of young people in the army today who maybe have got a lot of worries in their soul and they don't have the courage at the moment or the possibility of getting that help because of the army culture
sergeant major you've been in the army for about UNK on twenty years now do you think that a soldier has to be able to cope with that sort of UNK and name calling when he's on the streets of belfast for example
when a soldier goes to belfast he is abused verbally abused
yeah
on the streets he has to react or react in a manner that erm really when he's on there he doesn't he doesn't react to that particular incident that's happening in front of him
he must be taught that and he's taught that through his training
discipline
does that yeah does th that mean that if he's say h he's UNK about his race he sh he should just turn the other cheek and have a stiff upper lip
yes
i do
if i was on the streets of ireland now and i've been there many occasions and someone said to me look at that welsh get there i would just have to take it
and i do take it and i have taken it
and i just get on with my job
but that's
it's a lot easier it's a lot easier to say that
richard if you w if you were on the streets of belfast for example goodness only knows what they would say to you just because you're british and they'd use the UNK that you're black to really throw horrendous UNK at you
let me tell you let me tell you one incident er in northern ireland
erm we was on patrol we was going somewhere we passed er a big factory wall on the way back er a day later on the wall was go home british UNK
what am i meant to do with that
did you though er feel yeah go on brigadier
er i'd just like to say something actually to put this in context because this dis discussion which suggests that there's a lot of this goes on i don't believe that an army that's got bullying as an UNK thing would be able carry out its role in the gulf in the UNK in bosnia now
that's right
in the way it has done and furthermore every year there's a survey taken in this country where we look across the country at the public service and we ask people in the community what they think of their public services
year after year we come out with a satisfaction rating of over eighty per cent
now the community doesn't feel that we're a load of UNK the community doesn't feel that we're not doing our job properly and i think that's very important
well robert here a barrister i'll just get the microphone over here you're a barrister and you've prosecuted quite a lot of you've been in the army yourself and prosecuted a lot of cases now h he says that er that the british public love the army but from what we're hearing tonight there's a lot that's rotten to the core
well can i take issue with the brigadier on one point
it's true to say that very few cases come to court UNK
but it's the nature of the offence as such that if a soldier is bullied he's unlikely if he wants to stay in the army to bring it to the attention of the authorities because he know that afterwards he has then to live with the people who he's complained about
and if he does bring it to the attention of the authorities the problem then arises that in many cases and i've seen it in my experience he will be UNK
yeah
from taking the matter further
that does happen
how because
we heard there from r richard and andrew it's a UNK bullying as well
i i'm sure that's right i'm sure that's right
can i just say one thing about andrew's point about the s i b
in my experience the s i b when they receive these sort of complaints do investigate them very thoroughly and i'm surprised at his experience
but the problem is the lower level at that i it's at the n c o level where complaints are made by soldiers and because the complaint has to be made through the regiment then the pressure is for the soldier to withdraw his complaint
rea really brief so how widespread is it in the army bullying or UNK
how can we tell because as an officer and this is this is UNK point as an officer how do you know what goes on in the UNK room
UNK can i have a word
with wa andrew i've got somebody else to speak to
if i
okay
get a chance i'll come back to you
er where's james
james
now you're on the run from the army at the moment
mm
er why did you run away
er mental UNK i just couldn't handle it no more
what were they doing to you
er i was UNK to a UNK in the UNK and UNK on
i was tied into a sleeping bag and hung upside down from a tree overnight
er
why did they pick on you do you think andrew er james
my size
yeah
and you know
did you s did you te did you say for god's sake stop doing this to me
did you try and stop them did you try and make them see reason
th there was no point the chain of command to make a complaint was blocked
there was just no way
did you see this happening to other people
yeah
what sort of things were they doing to other people
erm two people back to back with their trousers round their UNK newspaper shoved up their UNK lit in the middle first one to move got a kicking
and is this common
or were these just a few isolated UNK
yeah no this happens a lot
brigadier life is er hard enough in the army when you're being UNK up for the sort of UNK you have to face on the streets of belfast for example
that's just UNK
i couldn't agree more that UNK and of course there is a distinction a complete distinction between UNK of training and in the UNK in particular it's very tough and bullying
but i'd just like to just go back to pick up something that the lawyer the barrister said
and that is that
pick that up briefly then we wanna talk about james again
very quickly
because of course we're looking at the importance of bringing this on right from the time that a man joins as a recruit and i realize that's when they're very vulnerable indeed they're UNK probably they're nervous they're not a team yet and we've developed all sorts of things
for example we now brief recruits on their rights and tell them and encourage them to actually come forward with their complaints we very carefully brief and select our n c os we have open days for parents we bring parents in so that they can feel part of the set up right from the start and so that their sons join the army and they tell their other friends to make sure they do to
we've introduced women's royal volunteer service people outside the chain of command so that young soldiers can go along and speak to them
and you deal yourself with new recruits and so forth as a sort of p r man you deal with new recruits
i personally don't deal with recruits but there's as you know there's a depot which er
sure
so what are the army saying
and this is where it really matters and really counts what are the army saying to new recruits who might be going into the UNK office army UNK office tomorrow
mhm
what are they gonna be saying to those new recruits about the dangers of bullying
they're not gonna be saying anything about the dangers of bullying in the recruiting office
well that's shocking
from what we've heard tonight
well i don't think it is because you're again you're back to the line that everyone is bullying and i don't believe that everyone is bullying
i don't i don't i don't have any more time we're just gonna have to leave it on that very er worrying note but thanks all very much for taking part
thank you
mm
and thank you for phoning in
thank you stephen from leicestershire he says that he has seen people tied to posts and set on fire
it's terrible
erm anonymous my son joined the UNK five years ago and he was bullied and another anonymous person from rugby my two children were in the army and though they weren't bullied they did see UNK things happening to other lads
ian from UNK i spent fourteen years in the air force bull bullying has always gone on but only when soldiers didn't conform
and someone who's and ex military policeman called to say a lot of bullying does go UNK but i if it was left to the royal military police bullying would decrease
and darren from stoke on trent was in the forces for three years and he didn't see any bullying at all
well after the break you can buy them this is one of them for as little as twenty five pounds elton john's been wearing something altogether more expensive at the high court this week but does it look much better
will you see the join when you join us
and men in UNK next
welcome back
the body count in that most british of places a fish shop was nine dead
by tonight the UNK toll was seventeen but the city was over the water belfast and even the politicians were running out of words to express their horror
today the british and irish prime ministers debated whether to talk to the terrorists
should we or should they just be UNK up and locked up
john taylor UNK unionist mp for UNK
in nineteen seventy two the i r a attempted to UNK you and you were a very lucky man yo your body was absolutely UNK with UNK
erm th thank god you're here today
yeah
er what's the atmosphere like in belfast what's it been like this week
well the atmosphere is very bad indeed in belfast because er we had this before of course twenty years ago we had various bad situations but it hasn't been so bad in recent years but this last fortnight er we've had u v f UNK then we had this terrible bomb by the i r a killing the UNK in the UNK road
the u v f which is now a much larger terrorist organization has responded by killing UNK and there's tremendous fear now in both communities there used to be just fear in the UNK communities they were being attacked by the i r a but now as the UNK has said there's very big fear in the catholic community as well
there's re the tension really has
there's what i have called a UNK of fear
yeah
in both communities now and this is creating tension
so what's the way ahead with dealing with the terrorists
now
well er y it's you cannot solve it by a security policy alone
yo first of all you must distinguish northern ireland from other ar UNK in the world where there has been UNK
like in south africa or like in cyprus or kenya
in those areas the people didn't have votes
UNK they didn't have votes
p l o
we'll come to this but briefly t
in northern ireland we have democracy and
yeah
ninety per cent of the people vote against the terrorists
sure
they don't want anything to do with it
so what's the way ahead against the terrorists
the way ahead is to UNK the terrorists from
wi
both communities
without trial
oh yes without trial from both communities and secondly alongside it and in parallel introduce a new political initiative in northern ireland to get the UNK and UNK involved in the administration of their own country where they live
and why by UNK terrorists you would include gerry addams for example
definitely yes
how many years
one second i'll come to you we've got more talking to do before i do come to you
clare short look at that picture there
we've got gerry addams who er wanted earlier in the week if we were to believe what seemed now like to be sitting at a table discussing peace there he is carrying a UNK coffin
how can that man ever be taken seriously should he not be locked up
i think to talk like that is to just to want to let it go on and on and on
w we tried internment before it caused a massive UNK of violence cos you never you get families are angry it UNK the numbers who are committed to UNK last time it was just the UNK if we did it on both sides it would just UNK
it would be a disaster
what we also have is the british and irish government john major and gerry addams all talking seriously about a possible peace initiative
how can he be
taken seriously when he's doing that
i'm not interested whether you take him seriously or not
i am interested whether there's a possibility of bringing an end to the violence in northern ireland
and all serious people who regret all the people who've died and been UNK should be interested in that
and just playing games with that picture takes us nowhere
everyone can UNK each other and we can go on forever
it's not games
and it'll never get better
it's not games
it is a reality
he that is a photo opportunity that gerry addams took and it was on the front page of everybody's newspaper
everybody in the country knows that
john taylor
well what i think what clare UNK i know clare comes from a republican background in south UNK and she s probably sees it only from that point of view
i come from birmingham actually
i know but your family are from that
i come from here
yeah but i'm thinking of your background where your roots are
you've got to s remember there are two sets of terrorists in northern ireland now
not just republican we have UNK as well and the UNK have the potential for being the bigger and more effective of the two and if we let the i r a to continue without UNK them you are going to have the situation UNK in the way which you don't want and i don't want and you're going to end up as the chief constable of the r u c said a few weeks ago with dublin being bombed
that is what's ahead of us and we've got to warn people that is ahead and try and take action now before it gets out of control
and that's why the unionist parties have a duty to be more interested in this possible peace
lots of the people who vote for you have been hurt and UNK and injured
you are all saying we're not interested we're not interested
we are interested
maybe this could take us somewhere and your people would and you yourself were nearly killed
yes i never
surely we should try and see
i don't know what you're talking about we of course we're interested in peace we want peace
we
no you're not you UNK it all the time
had talks round table talks at UNK this year and john major hardly ever appeared he stayed in strasbourg
he's he puts more into talking with the i r a and UNK than he does with the unionist community who at the end of the day are the majority in northern ireland
let's go back to the terrorists just er just briefly clare whatever you say that's a p UNK picture and it was a deliberate photo opportunity
what was he doing what's his thinking there
you're an acknowledged expert on the i r a tim pat
well i think even if you don't do it as one christian or as one human being to another even if you do it in the view of a general who UNK with the enemy UNK picture over his bed and you've gotta try and think into this man's mind remember he's from west belfast he's from the area that this man was killed in
he'd already made a very UNK statement UNK him
no he didn't condemn him
at the time
he didn't condemn it
i didn't interrupt you now
yes
i know your UNK of democracy are based on your former UNK but don't interrupt me
but i'm UNK you yeah no he didn't condemn it he did not condemn it
i don't like UNK what he's saying
he condemned that man
no he didn't
who is dead he condemned another of his followers who was lying badly injured in hospital like this unfortunate man here who was UNK and i can understand why clare feels badly about this tabloid television it's not a time for exciting you know i everybody er is UNK by any UNK or misery
let me finish
he did all that he did all that at the same time if he is go
you can't make those UNK when he stepped beneath the coffin for two minutes to deliberately have his photograph taken
th the fact of the matter is that at the next general election the UNK or the westminster election gerry addams will win that seat
not because he carried that coffin but because the people on his side are UNK their nerve ends are torn raw and if he
d backed off and didn't support a dead fellow UNK he'd be dead politically
is gerry addams
and the peace initiative would be dead and that's what we should be talking about not making cheap debating
is gerry addams a man of peace
he is
he certainly is yes
oh
john taylor
gerry addams is a man who supports the murder campaign by the i r a terrorists always UNK it and he didn't condemn the killing of the UNK on the UNK road by that i r a man he carried that i r a man's body at the funeral what he said was it was unfortunate that innocent people were killed
that's what he said that's a different from UNK it
UNK by
mm
UNK
but he didn't condemn it
martin UNK another expert on the on the on the terror campaign and also
there's an arm a general army council of the i r a
right at the top that's in the yeah
well are you asking wh what is gerry addams
and what's his position in th is he on the i r a council
l let's try to explain for an audience that's looking at television pictures here and what we're talking about
in UNK and the i r a there is an umbrella organization and we've gotta be careful legally here
the organization is called the republican movement
the republican movement has general orders which apply to everyone within that movement
that movement is a mixture of UNK which is the political dimension to the struggle and the i r a
now my i mean i would have to say i mean very clearly that they're UNK
i mean in the sense that their objective is the same then it's the same organization
now for me to say that gerry addams is a member of the i r a i'm not gonna to do that
what i will say is that gerry addams is a member of the republican movement
you can judge for yourself
is the republican movement the i r a i would have to say UNK of course it's the i r a
would gerry addams be like a large company a director of that of an organization a large company
you'd have to say of course he's a director of that company
right i know what you're saying and you've got to be very careful
sir william ross you're an mp for east UNK
erm internment is something that you believe in
now surely if you're gonna UNK the leaders and m might they include gerry addams and we could talk about the other side we could talk about the loyalist er UNK equally surely there's just another wave gonna come along because it's a never ending assembly line of terrorists so what's the point
well the reality is of course that clare has already told us that internment didn't work the last time it was badly done the last time
it worked on every other occasion when it was tried both th north and south and was used very widely in the republic in the past to UNK the terrorist organizations
and that is what we're talking about we're talking about taking out the two or three hundred really active people the control and the command structure of the i r a and of the other terrorist organizations and putting them in
but then tim pat do n other active people not just come along
that's exactly what we heard saying we're bombing civilians to take out the control and command structure
it wasn't they took three hundred people the last time and now he's talking about three hundred
you'd only just multiply the thing you'd UNK petrol on an already burning flame
and the UNK very tense at the moment anyway and it would just
but the UNK i have to say this is i r a
there wouldn't be an i r a only for internment the last time
apart from the fact they got the wrong ones as clare said
they s you know they just multiplied all through the place
that's nonsense that's nonsense
when it was done before in the republic you wanna quote history you wanna quote it accurately it was done with the agreement of a sovereign people
the whole of the people in the republic agreed within their own UNK this is a divided country a divided community rather and such a vote
has been UNK there has been su there have been successes though haven't there
no such a vote of no confidence has never yet been passed in a west european state
a british government said they were so UNK they took away that parliament
it hasn't been restored there's a bloody UNK
what is needed is a constitutional
political solution not internment
john taylor
well i still look ahead and i recognize the loyalist UNK have now the potential to become the major force
and they will be bombing dublin and once that starts dublin will be more anxious to agree with us to have internment in both northern ireland and the republic
and it's just a pity
now
it's just a pity that they're sitting back in their UNK in dublin thinking they're immune from the situation that's developing before our eyes
the chief constable comes from dublin
and the republic in fact spend three and half times as much per capita as is spent by the united kingdom in trying to UNK
yeah oh yes i agree
what about all this talk of bombing dublin what about all th
explain to you this is a this is
no it's not this is what the chief constable of the r u c the dublin man that you've just mentioned said it he said it
i walked through dublin in nineteen seventy four in may the worst single UNK that has happened was the bombing of dublin
that's right that's right
thirty five people who were killed that day and remember that on yorkshire television it's been established that there were and this is something you gotta over people like you had got the ear of the special branch and UNK people in the establishment of the
the UNK people i r a
were let off the UNK and with
yeah
that help without it they wouldn't
what about these threats of bombing dublin the loyalist UNK getting the upper hand as john taylor is saying there is bombing dublin a real
le let's deal
possibility
let's deal with that first then you can deal with what you wanna deal with
is bombing dublin a real possibility
erm of course there's a real possibility
i mean the one thing that has happened in recent times and i don't like UNK so i don't wish to be a part of one let's be clear about that i'm doing this as an UNK
erm the loyalist UNK have become much more sophisticated than they've ever been in their history
erm i would say that in the past the loyalist UNK apart from the obvious thing which was easy going out just and killing UNK as they've been doing recently
erm they've developed along the lines of the provisional i r a they've developed a sales structure
they're much more sophisticated than they've ever been in the past
they're much more capable probably of conducting a campaign
they've no political wing like the i r a they do they
no it is probably one of the difficulties if it ever
comes to negotiate with them
what i'm actually saying is they are a very serious threat
now if i could just come back to one other thing cos tim pat was raising it
erm internment erm i think is always a very dangerous option because it UNK there is no political solution
and really it's up to politicians
i mean the politicians i think have failed the people of northern ireland
on both sides of the water
it was never on the agenda in britain which i think was one of the major problems in the early days
i think the army really was the fall guy
i mean the army was left to do a job which politicians should have done
and the army opted for internment
and really it has to be said and has to be said historically that i mean the army in a way was left with a job which politicians should have sorted out before it got to that stage
we're gonna to speak to some army people martin
we're gonna have to
and that is UNK i'm just saying that it's a very dangerous
right
thing today to suggest that there is a security solution
it UNK that the intelligence people have the information now hold on the
well come on they know who they are they know who they are they must do
i r a are bombing this country unfortunately they've no right to bomb it
and the fact is i mean nobody seems to be able to stop them
and it goes on
now if the intelligence community is that good let's be very clear about it would be easy and to sa suggest that internment might make it easier i think is wrong
who's going to take charge of internment
the r u c or the army
let's speak to erm we talked about the soldiers there let's speak to some soldiers
first of all erm a man who served over there
er ray you were a victim of the i r a can you tell me what happened
yes erm i was a victim from er an i r a bomb
erm we were on patrol just a normal patrol in er in belfast and unfortunately i lost my sight and two very good friends of mine were killed and another was er UNK in one eye and severe injuries to his leg
what was your patrol doing
just normal UNK looking after the people of belfast
and of course when this all happened and i'm listening to what people are saying tonight it's sort of making me feel a bit sick what they're saying
why is that
one supports that i lay in the street looking and waiting for a man they mention tonight and that man is a well known UNK of british soldiers
and i'm now asked
which man
i'm now asked to respect him
and i'm sorry i cannot respect a man
the man who's name has been mentioned tonight
tonight
i cannot say that anybody can respect a man in this country and to run for their country as a well known i r a supporter
and he's up there on one of your pictures
mhm
and i cannot
what would then what would be your solution as a soldier who served over there a victim of UNK what would your solution be
i see many ways of a solution but there is never positive solution but i feel that they are putting units into this country like they can bomb anywhere they like in this country
there's been a car bomb in london tonight as well
i didn't here that
mm
i'm very sorry if people got injured
you're getting innocent people men and women killed children killed and we're expected to accept this
i feel they're putting units into this country why not us put a unit into their country not to kill their women and children but to kill the people who's actually doing it whether they be i r a u d a knock 'em out let's have 'em out once and for all
well you could say that's a very er a purely e em emotional er response and you can understand that but i want to speak to you er colonel michael you're with the royal green jackets
now never mind the rights and UNK
i was with them
you were with them yes
never mind the rights of UNK of what ray said
mm
er w i suspect you don't agree with what ray said
i don't
but how long would it take for the army the s a s or whatever to go in and erm clean up the situation as it were
in purely practical terms
well that is an entirely hypothetical question
but in purely practical terms
but i i'm sorry b if you would let me answer
what i would wish to make absolutely clear is i don't believe that in the context of a liberal democracy that is even UNK a UNK it's a possibility but it's not an acceptable solution
you've made that clear you've made that absolutely clear
but yes it could be done but even if it were done and you were quite right the intelligence is UNK precise to actually hit everybody
we might be able to write off fifty per cent or something like of that order er of er known terrorists but one would not be able to solve the situation even using those methods and you would create UNK you would merely UNK the situation quite apart from the legal er horror i mean i it is it is UNK in britain that sort of action
but even if it were in would be UNK
the intelligence is insufficient
can i just now you UNK that answer by saying this cannot be UNK in a normal liberal democracy
now there's seventeen people died in northern ireland this week
mm
are we talking about a normal liberal democracy
the fact that some members of that democracy some individuals flight its rules doesn't mean that those the vast majority the ninety nine point nine per cent of us follow their example
no we must er UNK by the rule of law as we always have done as our UNK as our traditions demand and as most of the people in this room i'm sure in their hearts would wish to
can i ask you when the army went in nineteen sixty nine did you go in then
in sixty nine
i wasn't as i was there in the early seventies f for my first and then subsequently
right do you think do you think did the army consider they were going into a UNK situation
no i don't think that's an accurate er UNK
i think the army thought they were going in to a situation where they could they could help they saw themselves if you like as the UNK er as a neutral party in between two sides
that situation only lasted for about a year and of course soon er the army was portrayed as the enemy particularly by the i r a and the republican party and the republican population
i take part of a UNK and i think i mean a lot of it is very important in terms of even considering internment in relation to the whole intelligence problem
i think when the army went in that the army because there was no political direction from westminster we've seen the seats in the house of commons i mean nobody's there when sir patrick 's talking about northern ireland which i think is absolutely disgraceful when they're talking about their salaries they're there
erm and so the army was left in a position where all it could do really was rely on its own history
and so therefore all it could do was look at UNK and UNK and cyprus in terms of actually i'm talking about the UNK of
mhm
you know how an army actually UNK and how it thinks
as UNK do
well internment worked in UNK and UNK and cyprus internment worked there
but the methods
the methods they used were the same tactical methods
yes
used in UNK situations
ab absolutely
some hands are going up some hands are going up
i want to find out what people are saying yes i'll come to you in just a second about internment
what would you like to say
over here
er the mp er the terrorists of today in further generations the only way to stop them is to stamp out the supplier of er their arms and their money as without th er the guns and the bombs er the edge have gone
the edge has er gone off UNK
now you're from the troops out movement
you've been dying to speak all night
perhaps you could address your point cos i know you want the troops out you think that'll be the key role to all the problems in northern ireland
what would you say to ray
i think er it's tragic what happened to ray and i think it's also tragic what's happening to people
you're talking about sending the s a s in
the s a s are already there and there are people that have been shot dead UNK people civilians who've been shot dead by the s a s
i think
that's rubbish
that the calls for internment
that's just not true
i think the calls
it's not true
for internment
of course it's not true no
i haven't finished
the s a s have operated in northern ireland and have been for a long time
but they have operated against terrorists they those terrorists have committed a crime and through intelligence the s a s have been in UNK and have immediately shot those criminals
so the s a s are there
can i just say
ray
yes they are there
yes
that er
ray wants to say something
yes i haven't said anything
then you can come back
my point is you heard the say how well equipped the u d a are
now that's the other side
so therefore if you pulled the troops out tomorrow what would happen tomorrow
can i answer
well i'm waiting for you
oh sorry i thought the
no you've you carry on
oh sorry
the er the troops w have been there for twenty five years nearly
and there is still no signs of peace
the talk of internment and sending in the s a s is an admission of political failure
now every opinion poll in er britain for the last twenty two years has said that they believe that has shown that the people believe that the troops should not be in northern ireland
right let's just another little er shout from this gentleman here
what would you like to say
irrespective of the things that are being said tonight i think we've gotta look at the reasons for all these UNK and UNK
and it's for p for p for publicity
irrespective of the things that are being said tonight i think we've gotta look at the reasons for all these UNK and UNK
and it's for p for p for publicity
publicity the er the media should get out and not report all these er
oh UNK them of publicity th that'll
surely in the in the long run
can i just say on the
john taylor yeah
very briefly on the british troops
first of all british troops have been in northern ireland for a hundred and ninety five years since eighteen hundred
they didn't just go in twenty three years ago as somebody suggested
secondly think what would happen if you took the troops out of northern ireland tonight
you would a bosnia immediately it would break up send the u n in look what it's done in bosnia
we are we are we are running out of time john taylor john taylor i'll come to you in a second john taylor UNK you've had your shout john taylor
i've had hardly any shout
be quiet please john taylor
yes
you talked about bosnia there
yeah
in bosnia dr david owen is sitting at the conference table with people who've committed UNK every day
surely the logic in that is that we sh we should sit down
the british government should sit down with gerry addams
if you take the british army out of northern ireland tonight the u d a would clean up you would have real civil war it would be worse than ever we have to be UNK that UNK and UNK
if owen is talking if owen is talking
quiet be quiet be quiet
be a nice be a nice man be a nice man
i am asking this man a question you have some UNK please
if david owen is talking to terrorists why don't the british government talk to gerry addams
they did and look where it got them
they did that in nineteen seventy two that's right
in nineteen seventy two
that was a long time ago there's been a lot of water under the bridge why not talk again
and a lot of blood under it as well
but i the reality is this
sorry
that if you don't have internment what are you going to do
put up with what's going on because the reality is there's nobody in northern ireland prepared to stand up now and give evidence in open court because if they do they're dead before the week is done
or the next day
and time after time after time there have been cases prepared and whenever they came to court there was nobody prepared to go into that UNK
UNK can i make a point
excuse me
well he's one of the people who's prepared to recognize the english the scottish and the welsh on this ireland
oh now you see why we can't get peace
i was gonna say this UNK
nothing serious
my gran
my grandparents and my grandchildren have this in common
they both spoke about the irish troubles
it's time to stop that
it's time to say the irish problem is not impossible it can be settled between the two sovereign governments it's time for these people to stop saying UNK says no that is no solution
briefly
we've gotta talk to everybody
briefly tonight er UNK and major issued this statement which said all those claiming a serious interest in UNK the cause of peace in ireland should UNK of or support for violence if and when such a UNK of violence has been made and sufficiently demonstrated new doors could open do you think the i r a might well respond positively to that
was done in the time of which set up the republic of ireland get the i r a to declare a UNK and talk to them and i think
hang on
the i r a if they're asked to will
they could deliver a UNK they would deliver a UNK and then they should be spoken to
okay thanks very much indeed that's all we've got time for thank you
tonight live the happiness pill the terrorist UNK and circuses
are they right to use domestic cats
roll up roll up it's central weekend
good evening welcome to central weekend and to our audience they come from UNK
welcome
we start tonight with a big row that's UNK over this little pill
it's new and it's given to people who feel depressed
your doctor UNK it as prozac but it's already earned the UNK the happiness pill but is it safe
oliver what's so wonderful about prozac as an UNK
well it doesn't actually make less people depressed that its UNK the great thing about it is that it only one quarter of the people who take it get side effects
so the old UNK make you know most people get a lot of side effects
the second this about it it's certainly not UNK in any way it's not like the UNK valium and so on
it's er you know it's completely okay to take and stop taking it and you won't want to have to go on
and the third thing is that about twenty to thirty per cent of people who take it UNK a dramatic transformation in their personality it seems so it's claimed in america and there's a lot of evidence that might be true erm and that is you know a huge difference from er just an ordinary UNK
so who's it really for who's gonna m get the most benefit out of it
well it's it works best with people who r UNK depressed in fact l less so with very severely depressed people but that is the great majority of people one in three women with children under the age of five are depressed for example so it's a huge advantage for them to be able to take it and not have side effects
dr vernon is this the way to make depressed people happy
have the drug companies at last come up with something approaching a m little miracle
it's a load o crap
the
i feel as if i'm in a time war i really do
twenty years ago i was on programmes li was central weekend on twenty years ago i don't twenty years ago
feels like it
i was on sorry
feels like it
well twenty years ago i was on programmes like this saying that doctors who said that valium and the other tranquillizers were perfectly safe were talking rubbish and that there was every possibility that there would be problems found in the future if we kept UNK these drugs for vast numbers of people
and now here we are again with yet another wonder miracle drug which they say has got no side effects and which is wonderful and is gonna make all these people really happy
no we said a quarter of people who take it get side effects
let me tell y er have you seen
what's it got to do with valium
what's it got to do with valium at all
it's got a lot to do with valium because it's being
what
given to very similar people for a start it's being prescribed in huge quantities no let me finish
UNK given for anxiety and UNK
you asked me a question
it's being it is being prescribed t for huge numbers of people it's being promoted as a very safe drug it's a very profitable drug and we already know that it causes a very large number of quite serious side effects
i have in front of me a copy of the data sheet produced by the company which makes it which was incidentally the same company which made UNK do you remember UNK which was withdrawn from the market it's just
what's this got to do wi it's got nothing to do with UNK
got an enormous amount to do with UNK because you don't seem to understand the way the drug companies work
they put a drug on the market and they say that it's wonderful and that the side effects are irrelevant and very slight and that everybody's gonna be very happy and it's a new wonder drug and it'll change the world and isn't that marvellous
then a few years later when the problems develop they say oh god we're terribly sorry we'll take the drug off the market
let me
be six million people in the world are taking this drug saying it's really helping them and you're telling them it's crap
i'm d let me just tell you some of the side effects which the company making it admit to
now what do you say to those six million people
look no let me just tell you what the
mm
side effects are
what i would tell them was these are the side effects they should be aware of this
no there are the side effects are only a quarter of people have those
the company's you don't want me to say the side effects do you
side effects
only a
quarter of people
do you accept that fact that it's only a quarter of people
i no i don't for a start accept it
so you deny all the studies that prove that
no
UNK
and what i'm saying is that
do you deny those studies
what i'm saying is that y i probably do
deny those studies
but what i am saying is that the that the side
yeah yes no very look hold on
effects would not be known would not be known for a considerable period of time
le let me bring in dr c er vernon let me bring in dr UNK here vernon
no l hang on a minute let me
no i just want to move it around a bit vernon
nobody's denying
these are im these are important and we should talk about the side effects that are associated
we will we will we will i have we will
dr UNK
nobody denies that prozac has side effects
what the it has less side effects than other UNK
what i UNK is depression is a common condition which is under diagnosed and under treated
one in eight people who are seriously depressed er end up killing themselves by suicide
about ten people a day kill themselves by suicide maybe one in a thousand people who take prozac get bad reactions to it but that has to be seen in balance in the balance of a large number of people UNK a lot of benefit and maybe a few people having some bad reactions
UNK you took it what happened
yeah well let me just say first i'm an UNK aunt a medical journalist i've got a psychology degree i've written health books and as a UNK i took prozac by accident
i suffered what erm is known from as UNK depression after i had my second baby
and i fought it for a long time and i wanted to get kick started back to where i was before because i felt under a cloud
well i went and i had a different drug from prozac i had something which is actually UNK and er
which one
UNK
right
okay which was fine
but let's not kid ourselves audience
these are drugs these are mind altering drugs every drug is a poison and every drug is a poison and every drug is a trade off
you do not get something for nothing in this world and they know this
and people who have
vested interests in drug companies are gonna tell you different
let me tell you what happened to me
i went on UNK and there are side effects when you start while you get used to the UNK okay
in my case i was very UNK i got UNK they don't tell you very much about this they play it down
once i took
the drug i was okay to a certain extent
okay now this UNK in the same group of substances as the one i took and i was willing to do a slight trade off here
okay what happened was i had no emotional reactions to anything i wanted to cry at something on t v i couldn't any more i couldn't cry
i g well i'll tell you later about what else happened to me
isn't aren't those symptoms of depression rather than actually the drug
listen let me finish
i went back to my doctor after two months and said well i feel a bit better can i a few more months
okay fine he then gave me i didn't know i was on prozac for a month
now he s he thought he was giving me the same stuff i didn't know what i was on all i knew was i felt twice as bad
i went home and i st i got very anxious i started feeling UNK i was UNK at everything on the television now i could cry but i was crying too much
i went back to my doctor and said what have you given me
this is not the same drug
oh yes it is they're UNK quite similar
what is it
it was prozac
well y you know th the evidence is overwhelming that these drugs are actually good for depression that they lift the symptoms that they reduce UNK
fifteen per cent have got UNK on it that's too high
i'm sorry fifteen per cent of depressed people commit suicide not fifteen per cent of people who take prozac get UNK
the evidence is
fifteen per cent the latest research says
the evidence is just against that you know the evidence is totally contrary to that
no this is not true
let me ask you UNK why you carried on taking it
oh no i came off of it
i had a month's prescription i came off of it
i went back on the c
on it
i went off of it and th and then i was okay after that
how did it make you feel
i was UNK one day i'd been on top of the world
yeah
and i could take on anything then the next day i'd be trying to kill myself
then why did you take the drug then
why did you why didn't you stop taking it
because you trust your doctor
because it was making me so bad
doctor prescribed it and we trust the g ps for
then why do you go to your g p
i've heard all this UNK about and there were tested on prisoners
in the u s and she can UNK that
this was this was exactly what we were saying
why do you go to your g ps
okay let's
what's the matter with you people don't you listen to the patients any more
let me talk to a g p down here dr stephen
i'm concerned because there have been UNK by mix m mr he's actually UNK from the register
he's not a UNK
no i'm not UNK from the register at all that's a lie
he's not a practising er UNK
that is a lie actually i think we ought to get this straight
okay listen before we go on
medical register therefore you can't call yourself doctor
now listen we've got two conversations going at once here why are you called doctor vernon
i've got a UNK of science and i've got a medical degree from birmingham university
but you're not on the medical register
no i'm not on the medical register
for a very simple reason which i'm happy to explain to
i'm very concerned that he made the UNK that the drug companies simply put these drugs on the market
now prozac is one of the highest used drugs in the states
and the states are second to none in drug testing
the food and drugs administration really are absolutely
now you're always making a balance in developing drugs and i have nothing to do with the drug industry i'm a g p you have a balance between trying to move things forward to get people better and on the other hand making sure that you're not going to do them any great harm
any new drug in britain is every year the g p who's UNK that for you gets a letter from a centre down in southampton to ask if there've been any adverse reactions
so we monitor as carefully as we can
yes there are
the food and drug administration the food and drug administration UNK of scientific data in the pre release trials by we have the documentation on that which has been a obtained under the freedom o of information act
yes
it UNK it
they w s they UNK and UNK evidence of UNK occurring during the pre release trials
yes gr this is gr just let me introduce you to UNK
you are with the UNK commission on human rights
now what
that's right
is it that you have got so strongly against this drug
what we have so strongly on this is that there are now over twenty eight thousand
mm
adverse reaction reports on the drug
mm
yeah
and that's ten times higher th that's higher
yeah
than any other drug in history
it's ten times higher than
the r reactions on UNK of those reactions thirteen hundred there were thirteen hundred relate to deaths of the users and that's just too high a price to pay
so
is it is it too no we've got to come back here is this too high a price to pay
yeah i feel very sorry for the people who've had bad reactions from prozac about
they've died there's thirteen hundred
hang on a second
let him answer
let him answer
i feel very sorry for the people living who are here
can i just say
vernon
adverse reactions
th about a quarter of people do unfortunately and they have to stop taking it
er c coming to this point there is UNK evidence that er say two thousand for example two thousand prozac UNK were compared with er two thousand UNK of the old UNK compared with people on a UNK and i'm sorry there is no increased probability of committing suicide
people who are depressed generally are UNK to committing suicide
they're also co UNK to commit violence
i wasn't
no listen i'm gonna i'm gonna talk to someone here who's probably er only here because you're on prozac aren't you
that's right yes
peter you take prozac
i take prozac
why
erm completely UNK anxiety and depression that is moderate but persistent
and it needed something to break that cycle
and prozac did the trick for me erm it won't work for everybody it's not a happiness pill it just UNK you to some sort of UNK
you you've been taking it for how long
i've been taking it continuously for two years and i want to stress that i've been taking eighty UNK a day
that's a lot
that was the dose a and i want to stress also that i didn't start off at eighty UNK i started off at two and half which i think is important and
any side effects
there was there was no side effects
erm ma
what ma what ma what difference has it made to your life peter
comp completely i mean i'm sat here in a live television studio with a girlfriend on my hand i was UNK erm just no interest in my hobbies no energy erm
peter
well i'm glad you're here
now listen UNK wait a minute
UNK listen
this is obviously of real help to a lot of people even if it doesn't help everybody
you can't throw the baby out with the bath water
no
you can't frighten people off it when
it is being of real help to people like peter
no it's now he was severely depressed
it's interesting cos you said it helps people with mild depression
no
no he didn't actually
and persistent
right persistent and moderate depression
okay bu yes now i'm not arguing that for some depressed people it's there's always side effects of some kind okay peter i wanted to ask you a very personal question
well he just told you he didn't have any side effects
are you denying this man's right to tell you what he believes is true
now wait a minute
have you ever been on UNK have you ever been on prozac oliver
no
alright
well you won't be able to UNK on it okay sexuality
but i'm asking you to address his point
you've just told this man
you've just told this man that he his experience is UNK
you said to him that there's no
no i didn't
i
such thing as a pill without side effects he just said he had no side effects
to introduce to introduce one or two patients who ar who are happy with the drug is irrelevant as you should know
exactly
because people took UNK and were very happy with it people took UNK and were very happy with it people took valium and were very happy with it
take penicillin and die of it because they have an allergic reaction
even more people have died of UNK of UNK than any other drug in the world
we didn't ban those
let me tell you about the UNK side effects of this drug because people are entitled to know what they
listen i've got vernon i i've got some people who have had the side effects
let me interview them because there's nothing like a human story
okay bye okay i'll go home
a personal face of this whole thing i ought to say that we did ask the drug company to send some along or er and they said no er but
strange
but they but they we have got a man here who is the first in this country mr to sue them
erm you took prozac
that's correct
erm what kind of person were you before apart from a bit depressed
person i wouldn't bother anybody and it changed my entire personality
it changed it so much that you co committed an offence that ended you up in
in prison
in prison for well you got a three year sentence
prison sentence
but you didn't serve it all
erm you took a gun to your UNK house
yes
you UNK her son to his bed
bed
you were very violent in your behaviour
where did you get the gun from
say again
where did you get the gun from
i collect weapons
why do you put that down to prozac
because it was something that was totally out of character
my general behaviour changed completely after i was given prozac
i was taken into the my wife died in january of nineteen eighty nine i was taken into the local UNK hospital at in the december of nineteen eighty nine and i was told i was gonna be given an experimental drug i was told nothing about it or any anything to do with any of the side effects i was in th i was on prozac for about four days i suffered horrendous side effects shaking and one thing and another
why didn't you refuse it
you didn't have to take it
well as far as i was concerned i was doing what a doctor told me
these bunch of UNK
pick your gun up and go and shoot
you're talking from a point of view of where
well i work in this field and you can refuse that medication unless you're under
you don't expect a doctor to give you drugs that are gonna drive you mad
if you're an informal patient you can refuse that medication
UNK hospitals there must have been something wrong with you
it's hard enough to get into if you're crazy
yes go on
one of things on this drug is that we have many cases UNK on this where people don't realize the incredible UNK feelings they have of UNK themselves et UNK are actually connected to the drug
and it's only when they see publicity of the drug that they actually realize
i tried to kill myself twice in the space of ten days
i suffered horrendous UNK
people do you know
government initiative to reduce the incidence of suicide by er is it er five per cent over the next years because so many
are you saying there's no connection between the drug
depressed people do kill themselves
that's just rubbish
it is
and one of the key ways of stopping people killing themselves would be to change from the old UNK onto the more modern safer ones which a are easier to take less likely to make you kill yourself and er
let me introduce you to a nurse a nurse called UNK
UNK doesn't want to be identified
er UNK had a baby she suffered from UNK depression and er can i ask for a bit of UNK there please UNK suffered from UNK depression and she took prozac
UNK you suffered some of the side effects that we've been hearing about tonight and then things got really bad
how bad did they get
i was only on the drug for seven days and by the seventh day i'd suddenly turned into some sort of UNK
i became incredibly UNK er i had violent feelings erm i wanted to go out on the street and UNK
if i'd had a gun i would have gone out and UNK shot out the whole neighbourhood
erm and really the only way i thought that i could prevent myself from doing anything like that was to kill myself in a very violent way because i
n
was so UNK the way i felt
UNK i mean i totally take your story on board but you are a nurse
yeah
and yo you understand about refusing medication
yeah
why did you carry on taking it
erm i hadn't actually felt that violent i'd been having extremes of emotion all week erm very high very low very fearful panic attacks which i'd never had before in my life
did you associate with prozac
i did yes
and i finally went back to my g p on the seventh day which was a saturday in the morning and he told me to carry on taking the drug
and within a few hours of taking it that's when this happened to me
when i just felt that i was on the absolute fringe of going UNK
and i
could have killed anybody
it wouldn't have UNK who it could've been family friends neighbourhood anybody
if i'd had a gun i would have done it
listen i can't go further into your story now thank goodness it all ended happily and you got some
yeah
instant help
isn't this is an extraordinary situation n here is a nurse a you know a kind caring woman she takes a drug and yet she must be of all people the one person to say i'm having a side effect
yes that's true
and yet she still believes her doctor
just like all of us do still trusts him
well i
still takes it
i really do think that one of the things that i'm unhappy about this evening is that people are concerned that our profession isn't caring
i take on a board all the comments that are made here i think they do need investigation
what one doesn't know is what's due to the disease and what's due to the drug
what i do know is that there are thousands and thousands of people out there for whom life is UNK roughly ten a day actually succeed in killing themselves how many more have a go we don't know
sue can i need to ask him a question
a very important question
is it that g ps don't read the literature that comes with the drugs
i wanna know why g ps don't inform their patients about what to expect
well
because i'll tell you what i came off cold turkey and i had the worst three days of my whole life
i had all my symptoms UNK into a horrendous anxiety my head
mm
was spinning i thought i was gonna jump off the roof i rang my g p and said you never told me i had to decrease this dose hang on just get through the weekend
he never told me what to expect an i feel like UNK him
we
i i've just been told i've just been told that our entire switchboard is totally lit up
one person has had bad side effects the rest of our callers think it's wonderful
but can i just answer that because hopefully we do we do try to listen and we try to give you what information you're capable of taking at the time
if you're in a very UNK state you can't take
fortunately now the drugs have to be UNK with an information leaflet so that you keep
looking at it again and again and again
okay gentle gentleman at the back there he's got his hand up
to read it
hang on UNK
yeah this drug could've been developed and UNK and er gone into a lot further but they didn't
and the reason why they didn't is because the losses at the moment are acceptable
profitability that's what it's all down to
before i come back to you UNK before i come back to you
i want to talk to UNK
you wanted to say something UNK
yes i just wanted to say that can i just say that within about three days of coming off the drug all my symptoms of feeling violent UNK completely disappeared and they've never come back since and all i've had since then is a dose of UNK b six every day
so th you are in no doubt that that's was
no doubt at all
wh w when testing a new drug you're trading off th the level of testing you can do it takes about a hundred millions pounds to produce a new drug it takes about ten years from test tube to getting a licence
so you can test it more thoroughly but in that case a you put the costs up and b it takes longer before it gets actually before patients get the benefits of it
so the big argument at present about th for example in other UNK is that people are being treatment
okay vernon
the quality of drug company testing is UNK
much of the e well hang on a moment
hang on a
it UNK regulations both the f d a you know
never mind the regulations is it good enough
the quality of testing by drug companies is appalling
one in six patients in hospital in britain are there because they've been made ill by doctors
one in six
that's that is a frightening
statistic
forty per cent of the people who take drugs suffer serious sometimes lethal side effects
there are several quite simple explanations for this
that's why you need UNK and safer drugs
would you mind shutting up for a minute
no
i'm fed up of
okay
these bloody apologies for drug companies have you ever worked for a drug company
i d
have you ever received money from a drug company
yes of course i have
you have
what do you mean yes of course i have you have received money from a drug company
yes i know about the drug industry
how much
he knows about
i know about the drug industry i do clinical trials i do research for them
you d so you work for drug companies
yes of course i do
so what the fucking hell are you doing here UNK for UNK for a drug
completely UNK for vernon completely UNK for
you take it
take it and come back here and let's see what you're like
and you take it
as well
i don't have to
you take the drug and see how you are
i have taken eight
you've taken it
that's fine
i've taken eight UNK over the last ten years prozac hasn't been one of them i must admit
now listen this is an interesting point you've taken eight and UNK people
and obviously she's had a lot of bad experiences we can't go into now but people don't trust the drug companies because of all this long history and experiences
effect
here we have someone shouting at us about the bad effects of the prozac they then tell us that haven't taken them
now i've seen a lot of people who complain about taking drugs and the side effects they get when you analyze it you first of all find they haven't taken it or they've taken five other drugs at the same time
now listen answer the question i asked you answer the question i asked you she has taken a lot of drugs in the past not prozac
yes
but because of the bad experiences when the drug companies have said for years trust us we've UNK it we've developed it you know it's it passed the f d a rules and then there's UNK and valium and all the things that we had UNK and there's a horror story at the end of the day
and now you have prozac why should we believe them this time
well i think the drug industry and i don't represent them but i think the drug industry
but you got money from them
well you know
have you have you done any work for this company
vernon i want the answer to this one
no i've never done any work for
you've never done any work
on this particular product
why should we trust them this time
i think thirty years down the line valium was developed in nineteen sixty one
now we've had all the bad news
w we're still having bad news but now we
that's right
learnt we hope that we learn as we go along and that the same mistakes don't get made again
but a twenty years ago twenty years ago
UNK the testing results i have that documentation
this here this here is thirteen hundred the list is thirteen hundred deaths thirteen hundred deaths due to prozac
we're sitting in this room and we're hearing a lot of people who've had bad experiences with prozac and other drugs
twenty five per cent of people who take the drug have bad effects
that's a lot
the drug companies say that
i'm terribly sorry madam i'm terribly sorry madam you might die if you take this drug
nobody's who's died has ever been depressed after they've taken
listen vernon
has ever been killed by prozac and you know it vernon
the drug company says
okay i'm gonna go back
relationship between
okay dr
UNK
i'm very concerned that we don't the
the th there may be an argument and i don't know the details of what's being said here and i certainly would not defend any sort of the highest level of enquiry
but if one sixth of patients are in hospital as a result of what we've done wrong five sixths are there because we haven't managed to stop them being there
so don't let's forget that
don't let's just say drugs are bad because for every one that has a bad time and some people have a terrible time you say some people die i accept that
okay
but a lot of people come out feeling a hell of a lot better
okay i would like to thank everybody on this item who has taken part in the responsible bits of the debate
thank you all very much
welcome back
there are more than twenty circuses currently UNK britain most of them without an elephant or a UNK in sight
times have changed and animal activists have been well active
but our next guests are big UNK in the big top circus animal they haven't got any big cats just domestic cats have a look at these
did you believe that thomas is part of an eight cat routine at circus international at it's been at UNK it's at UNK over the weekend but these are just domestic cats ordinary domestic cats
quite extraordinary
but they're doing this and they seem to be doing it quite UNK
we talk about the stress in just a few minutes
it seems to be reasonably UNK we should be able to take a look at something else now let's go over there again
what have you got for us now
well you can forget the UNK that cats can do it all it is extraordinary that cats can do that at all
let's put that aside and go to you UNK
should cats be doing it at all should any animal be made to do those sort of tricks
well we don't believe that any animals should be made to perform these kind of silly tricks purely for the purposes of human entertainment
i don't think it's silly
they simply don't have the right to do that
and also what we're seeing tonight is the end product of a long process of training
what we don't to see
what we don't get to see is the training beforehand
and obviously anybody's who's trained a domestic animal
i'll be getting across to you in just a second just give us a second and i'll be right over there mate
is it not just UNK fun
not at all
it's not UNK fun
people are seeing animals as objects of entertainment objects of UNK we should not be allowing circuses to present animals in this way to our society and particularly to children
we shouldn't be allowed to present animals in this way
well that's er that's rubbish because they're br er the circus was born in great britain in seventeen sixty eight by a captain in the army
but that was before television people hadn't seen animals
they got telly now
yes but what you saw er in that clip just now erm wouldn't have been done by cruel methods i can assure you of that
having UNK in circuses for the UNK for the pa past ten years i have seen no cruelty to any circus animal in that time and that speaks for itself
thanks a lot i'm going to go to you diane
now cats are pretty independent creatures
and if there's a problem a cat won't react
i've got a couple of UNK i know what they're like
if they don't want to do it they'll just say you in cat language of course
tell me
if the cats weren't trained to do that i would assume that they would walk past the UNK of fire and they would under the ropes
naturally a cat would not do an act like that
the cat has been made to do it
it is not a natural phenomenon and what worries me is we are UNK children
i would hate to think that some children at home now are going to try and make their pet cat jump through a UNK of fire
rubbish
well i s sorry let's go to that what was your point
children aren't that stupid if you're implying that my son would do that
how're the kids gonna get the fire you have your children have boxes of matches and UNK do they and cans of petrol and whatever else
well to be to be honest to be honest er i haven't got children
i'm not surprised
oh here we go it's started it's started
these are my children i wouldn't harm them for the world
UNK you adopted and trained the let's get back to the point
you adopted and trained the cats UNK
do they really enjoy this
well i think so if they didn't want to do it they wouldn't do it
but how do you how do you know
i ask them to do it
how do you know they're enjoying it
i say come here like a dog you say come here and they come here
no choice
and they do it
what do you mean they've no choice
i mean we're not just this with cats
hang on
diane what is so wrong with training a cat
i don't agree with training any animal to m to do to use
any animal
for entertainment any animal for use for entertainment like in the circus
this particular circus besides having the cats has got UNK it's got erm young african elephants i've been to watch
which was saved
pat let's forget the little cats let's turn to the big cats let's turn to the UNK and UNK
let's turn to the elephants the seals
isn't that what a circus is really about
of course it is
no we're talking about here we're talking about victorian entertainment
let's take the point about the elephants
these are not the s great UNK of the wild
of course we are
these people have UNK created oh no you're not these people claim to save elephants they're not
they're taking baby elephants from a UNK
can you imagine the trauma of those baby elephants
they've watched their parents being shot many ha many ha
because have killed the elephants
excuse me can i finish er many of them are UNK to the parent's legs while they're collected for these people then to bring to a circus UNK and UNK to the ground for life
if these people wanted to d if these people wanted to c and they really cared about conservation and education they'd do what the care for the wild have done
leave them there to be UNK
they would save elephants
let dave respond dave respond
and stop this
let dave respond
have you seen our circus have you seen our circus
i have
you have
i have
i was actually er answering your UNK comments there but he spoke over you so i wanted to answer him back
oh that's okay
i do have to pay into circuses unfortunately erm because i go in as a member of the public to watch the act and when i can i pay the money to go
did you did you
excuse me can i finish
when i go i usually pay er to go round the back er which in some circuses you can do and only two weeks ago
it's free in our circus free in our circus
only two weeks ago i actually saw er elephants UNK up by their legs in a UNK at a british circus
that wasn't in our circus
this is totally wrong it's a totally wrong way of using animals are just used in circuses for entertainment for profit
just hold tight a minute because i want to go up here and talk to the customers
now here's a couple of customers you were at the circus first of all how did you feel about the circus that you saw
it was brilliant it was absolutely brilliant
lots acts and things yeah
and what did you feel about it
i thought it was really good
no cruelty in it at all
did you feel sorry for the animals at all
did you feel that there was some cruelty going on
no
the children aren't really qualified to notice cruelty though are they
what did you find was the most interesting part of the circus
for you the most enjoyable for you
there was a knife throwing act not really a knife throwing act human acts
it's like erm
okay what about you what was your favourite part
the UNK
you liked the UNK
okay we got some more young people over here and we're gonna talk to them as well
where are you
there you are
what was your favourite part of the circus
you what was your fa you were at the circus weren't you
yeah
what was your favourite part
erm i like it when the cats erm was balancing on the rope
you liked the cat on the rope
and what about you what did you like
i liked the same
you liked the cat on the rope
and this lovely lady in front clare what about you what did you like best
i liked
here you use my little microphone what did you like best
i liked the bit
every week i have fight people off my microphone
come on clare
i liked the bit where the cat jumped through the fire
you liked the cat through the fire
okay that's what the youngsters have to s pardon me that's what the youngsters have to say dave are the animals let's pick from diane now are the animals little more than prisoners
they haven't got much choice they're with you they live with you feed 'em they gotta work for you
no that's wrong
no
and saying it saying that way we love animals as circus people
you say it's money
it's not money to us it's a way of life
circuses have been going for two hundred years
if you'd come down today or any fine day our elephants are UNK around our horses are
that's right
let out this morning at eight thirty
UNK around how big a space
there's about there's about eight acres at the moment
yeah well in the wild they would be UNK around considerably more than eight acres
in the wild they would have been UNK
not necessarily
are your animals happy
our animals are very happy
do come in do come in
with that cat going through the flame
it had all the stress indicators i UNK pupils UNK tail i saw i saw
that act was punishment centred
it's stress oh my god
and given token food at the end of the act but believe me all circus training involves a lot of cruelty especially with elephants because they're so
excuse me i don't involve cruelty in my training
have you been cruel
no i will not be cruel you cannot be cruel with them
you really can't
you need to be prosecuted under the nineteen eleven act because you hung a cat from a star
i hung a cat
far above the ground
is that cruel
the cat was placed on a platform which went
have another have a another look
i had someone come to see me the other week from the r s p c a because they said this cat was held forty foot in the air
look at this disgusting you should be prosecuted for this
and UNK round for
let me get up to our animal UNK here
swing it round
now you were sponsored to travel around and er
by your tail
look at circuses for about eighteen months
what were your findings
i found that most of the animals in the circuses were looked after with a great deal of care and attention
there are improvements that can be made but that's to be said for all animal UNK systems from pets to guide dogs for the blind and every other every other type of system
as far as the training goes it's extremely difficult to train particularly big pa cats unless you're going to use positive UNK a r in other words a r reward
if you use punishment you are likely to get eaten so there's fairly strict quick er selection for appropriate behaviour
as far as these cats were concerned i have little doubt that nothing but positive r UNK would have been given because if they had been punished they simply wouldn't have done it and they would have run away and it's very much more difficult as a as a UNK to have an animal w isn't going to want to do the act
so what you do as a trainer in a circus you try and encourage the animal to want to the act and to reinforce it for so doing and that may be food it may be actually just affection for the people who are training and that's what a trainer wants to try and
so the animals weren't treated er roughly according to our animal UNK here
well i'm an animal UNK too and believe me you don't control a four ton animal like an elephant just by giving it UNK
i it is managed with and the initial process of UNK and training elephants is very cruel indeed
we're UNK them from the wild and including africa with all this nonsense about saving them from UNK it's
let me let me ask this lady here to come in up there on the aisle third row
yes i'm a UNK surgeon so i think i'm fairly qualified
you're a vet
i'm a vet
yes
so i think i'm fairly qualified to talk about stress and anxiety in cats
i've seen these cats as well and they are stressed they're showing very classic signs of stress
fire is all UNK natural enemy no animal is gonna go through fire of its own UNK erm and again the point just moving away from the cats which i'd agree the cat was hanging on to that platform looking very stressed signs of its tail course it's not gonna jump
okay cats tend to land on their feet but they also tend to take injuries like erm severe UNK injuries if they land from high things so they don't just
so as a vet you believe there was severe stress
yes severe stress they were showing sorry
have you done any work in circus as a vet
i don't need to recognize domestic cats being stressed do i
let me ask you UNK the UNK now UNK as a UNK can let me do the show please
er maybe next week
UNK
yes
you're a UNK you're the love figure in the circus kids love you people come to you you're the UNK you're the warm
that's right
you see the animals on you see the animals off
do you ever see UNK
i'm serious with you
i can say a hundred per cent i've never seen any UNK
i've got two children in the circus i've got one five year old that's at the age now where yo he's watching everything and learning everything
if i saw any cruelty in this business i'd leave the business because i wouldn't like my son to be brought up in an environment where there was cruelty to animals
can i just say that if you leave the transportation of the animals aside and the training of the animals aside i don't think we have a right to use animals in this way
but this man here is obviously going to say he's seen no cruelty he h obviously hasn't seen the circus UNK video that w was released by i a w a and animals defenders this year where there is an absolutely horrendous scene of a UNK being beaten around the head and chest
a UNK
and it was a british circus
you have UNK in your circus mr john
that's right
you have UNK in your circus what do you ask your UNK to do sir
they do a very similar routine to a liberty pony
the sort of things they do in the wild running jumping UNK i'd just like to say that's not
that's not er actually my circus on that particular video and we haven't identified which circus it was on that particular one
my general point is that we're talking about er freedom for anybody to go if they want these people are trying to stop the freedom of the paying public
into your region
i don't ever come into this birmingham midlands region at all so i object to everyone saying circuses are cruel and UNK
is a circus a circus without animals
certainly not
it's been tried before by bigger names than me
doesn't have any animals and they're very successful
in the english dictionary the word circus actually means with animals
and it might be traditional but that doesn't make it right bear UNK and dog fighting
diane and pat
victorian entertainment
you object to animals in circuses
yes
you've made that perfectly clear we actually got that message loud and clear
she doesn't object to them on her feet
now tell me have you ever
that's actually plastic
have you ever come on let's not wander off have you
have you ever done anything apart from coming on programmes like this and talking about it have you ever done anything against it
i actually try and educate the public i do school talks i will go outside a circus and i will give out leaflets
let me ha UNK to add here
i'm not against circuses
i am against circuses with animal acts and i do not try and stand outside a circus and stop people going in
i give them information and
what would happen to what wou yes sorry what would happen to the animal acts if the circus is closed down
what happens to them now
no follow my line
what would happen to the animal acts if the circus was closed down
exactly what happens to them now
what happens to old retired circus animals now
you're say you're saying that we're cruel to animals
what happens answer me answer
from these people these animal UNK what happens to your animals
both sides claim they like animals
now you're accused by these people of cruelty of neglect shouldn't you be listening
if people actually UNK you of something as serious as cruelty and neglect isn't it worth a listen
well the point is
if you come up with some sensible idea yes but they don't
have you ever have you ever suffered yourself
no
from er from attacks from animal activists
yes we have it's been liverpool
are you gonna tell us about it or is it a secret
have been set on fire people think they'd be better off dead
what was the zebra story
the zebra was released by people calling themselves the animal UNK front
they were chased through the town in UNK until it ran off the pier and UNK in the sea
that were their logic in saving an UNK life
what needs to be done
animal circuses should be closed and we should have circuses with just people
in them because people have chosen to be there
the animals have not
we haven't got a right to treat
performing animals yes
we haven't got a right to treat animals in this manner
grown ups UNK
youngsters only
should circuses be closed
yes or no
no
that's what the youngsters have to say
ladies and gentlemen can i thank you very much UNK
right from UNK has said if the good lord wanted cats to fly he would've given them wings it's cruel doing things like that to animals
one's just been handed to me here christine from derby says i've kept cats for twenty years and taught them loads of tricks
they do the tricks out of pure love and UNK to their owner
and ray er mr from nottingham says i used to work for a circus i'm an animal UNK and all the animals i saw were treated very well
rose from coventry says cats will not do anything they don't want to do
these cats look well cared for and i should know because i work in a pet surgery
and er finally on er on our debate earlier on a lot of callers tonight are er i would say quite UNK angry about the language used in an earlier debate the earlier drugs debate by vernon
well we back that up here at central weekend and we apologize if anyone's been offended
that is it for this week so er hope you enjoyed it join us next friday for another er burning hot series of debates er another three ring circus it's called a central weekend
UNK take care
well there was men walking through the village erm to stop them for a rest
and he had this two bags of sugar you know one that was and he was gonna light his pipe and he threw us and he couldn't get off and it UNK him
are there any other stories that you know about stronsay
well UNK one day and he up this big UNK and it was er UNK off a grave and didn't ken what to do so he just put the UNK back and kept on and the next time he went to he and he it up again and he took up the UNK and
and he kept the UNK to it
one of to bring the UNK we've still got it
and i've got a photograph of the as well
well er there was man walking for the south end of the island to the north end to kept something for his UNK
so he was taking bucket to get it
and so he went the north end and got whatever it was he was wanting and on the way back he stopped at farm to watch
so watch them for a while and then he started dancing with them and he dance them all night and he just get in his hand
then in the morning he thought he'd better be getting back home so he started home and when he got home he discovered it was the harvest time
and he started up in the spring and the bucket he'd been carrying had left a UNK in his hand
and me granny to help me and he was the land nobody could really find that if you came across it one nasty day well you're there and you're kind of stop there if the went away
and that's what i like
there was this story about er the wife that shared their milk with butter
so this other wife tell had to go and steal some milk for the UNK cow
and that night UNK some milk and er sure enough it did come and then when the UNK up in the morning and found out that somebody had been UNK the cow she said er whoever stealing the milk will never work for six month
and er if that day that the wife
there's supposed to be a white horse that goes through the square at and er it er supposed to pay this UNK or something but i don't really ken much about it
this man came up to and he heard this chains
every time he walked that's him come back again and every time he stopped it stopped and this happened a few times and he was very scared and he thought he had better go and see what the noise was and anything well it was just a pet sheep UNK up in its UNK
and are there people in class four at stronsay school who's been looking at some of the UNK
here's gary
which is the story that you've been hearing about
er it's called the UNK
and it was an old woman was sitting knitting in when her wool went through a hole in the floor
it was supposed to have gone into a UNK that goes right underneath the house
well we've come along the island of stronsay now and at er the post office called UNK lane and name which has always UNK me really and er the sub UNK in charge here is dennis
the post office itself here is called UNK lane that must cause a lot of interest and people must be interested in getting a post mark from here
yes we get quite a few inquiries from south and er from UNK that want stamps UNK with the UNK lane stamp
and i suppose over the last twelve month we must have had as many as a dozen of such inquiries wanted their stamp UNK
what about the name UNK lane what ascertain about its origins
it's always interested me the name you know
as far as i can understand UNK lane is from the school down to UNK farm and probably part of the road down to
but certainly not towards the south end of the island
but er i can't say that i know anything more about it actually
so there's no clear indication that UNK ever lived here in that case then
no
no far from it
oh it's no been too bad at all i would say since the first of the new year it seems to be improved remarkably
it's been fairly UNK the odd day but there's frost and especially the snow that they've had down further south it seems to be helping us up here i would say and it's with the with the land work especially got the UNK and stuff of that kind
and what about the size of the farm of the UNK what's the UNK of it
oh well er the size of the home place here about ninety three acre and then we've three of that well that place is for UNK but that's about sixty acre all added together
and on that then er how is the actual work of the farm broken up into UNK for UNK or barley or whatever
oh well we try and keep all the cows mid fifties as far as the cows goes and we run them all home here
and then we've got the young cattle off to the two places on the other side of the island and then the third place at just last year
it's twenty two acre and we put all of that down to barley for er
and with the fifty five cows and then we buy in some cattle for UNK
usually we oh about mid sixties or in that direction and er without it we wouldn't have done extra barley
especially the winter time to finish them off
so it's split up more or less like that with a ninety three acre home producing the UNK and keeping the cows and forty of the acre keeping the young cattle some hay off of that and then twenty two acre down to barley
well we'll go inside the buildings now and have a look er at some of the cattle UNK here
it holds forty four cows
it's two structure house UNK each side obviously in the centre feed passage and they and that's the wall
head seems to work fairly well it's easily cleaned out easily fed and the cows come to calf we just put them in the UNK and after that once they're a reasonable size we put them through into a UNK and it easier to work the situation once the UNK are a fair size and pass the stage especially
would you eventually be having a UNK floor building as well
there were concerns about er that type of building at one time but er d'ya think it is quite suitable for orkney
i think it works fairly well enough
i can't say i would be just too excited about the prospects of UNK goes be a bit kind of sliding each other young calf that's just newly born
needless to say he might have a tendency to end up doing what he wouldn't want them doing amongst UNK and such like but
i think if you can calf them and then put them onto the floor i think when there are sides that they can feed for themselves more there would be nothing wrong with a floor UNK at all really
well looking at the individual UNK of animals that we've got here tell us about the basic breed line that you keep on the farm here
well for most we try and work a UNK for i think that the UNK and the black bull is the true traditional cattle you know maybe and i don't believe for one minute that the cattle would be any better if you had a lot of UNK or something else
and i think that keeping the orkney old fashioned cow is near to that than crossing with continental
probably UNK or UNK i think that that's the secret to and cattle and our broad that's UNK especially down
policy h two and the matters which are outstanding from our discussion yesterday are those which relate to the criteria and also the question of whether the policy should include specific guidance on the location of the new settlement
however before we embark on that there are two outstanding matters which were raised yesterday a and i'd just like to know how far erm progress has been made in dealing with those and one was the erm definition as far as it can be made of what is meant by the greater york area
and also the UNK of the commitments etcetera by the greater york er ag again related to the greater york area
peter north yorkshire on the former greater york i think er i did undertake to consult with the county surveyor on the relationship er journey to work er and commuting around greater york and that work is in hand this morning
i doubt whether it will appear erm by one o'clock
but er it will be in it is being pursued
thank you very much
on the second erm issue the commitments in greater york erm mr has made good progress erm on this erm and he's been had discussions this morning with er district colleagues and hopefully we are nearly there on that one
will that be ready by the end of the morning or are we looking at tuesday morning for that
hopefully by the end of the morning we'll do our best for the end of the morning
now we want to embark on a discussion of er matters c and d under issues
but before we do that er and you're having given to you a piece of paper headed possible UNK for panel reporting on the new settlement
erm a very minor point when you get it those who have got it already would you just draw a line from the top line which says discussed criteria down to the box which says evaluate sectors around york etcetera
now by way of introduction to this we had some deep thinking last night after we'd concluded our discussion and i have to UNK what i'm going to say certainly for mr 's benefit that it's the if question the if question
erm as we see it there are en two possible courses on the new settlement that in fact you end up if you look at the right hand side of that sheet of paper with four possible answers
but if i start with a
if it is considered that a new settlement is required to meet the housing provision in greater york then the first question that has to be asked is the criteria approach alone acceptable
if the answer to that is yes then we proceed to discuss the criteria and the panel could proceed to report accordingly on those
if the answer is no and here this is linked to the question of should the policy include specific guidance for the location of the settlement and by specific guidance it implies should it be allocated to a particular district then in order to do that the panel feel that we would have to be in a position of having sufficient information to make an objective and logical decision on that
and that may well UNK during the discussion on d an evaluation around york to decide which maybe the appropriate sectors of UNK which is the appropriate host authority
if we find we have enough information to proceed it's all UNK i know
but if we find we have enough information to proceed to make a positive recommendation on the new settlement and the host district for that then we would report accordingly
if we find or feel that we haven't got sufficient information to make a proper recommendation as seems likely than again we will report accordingly but there are implications obviously on that
and then finally the other if is if we find that the new settlement is not required then we report accordingly
does anybody wish to respond to that
have we missed any possible UNK out i wonder
mr
erm roy house builders federation
i just wonder what the opposition would think if you decided that the criteria approach alone was not acceptable and you equally decided you hadn't enough information to specify a location where would that leave you
or where would it leave anybody else
the ob the obvious answer to that would be we'd not be in a position to make the proper recommendation in favour of i suspect
and that would be then a matter for the county to determine how they would proceed from that point
we would of course fully report all of our reasoning at both the yes and no stages of this decision tree
if we had found good reason to say no to the first question there are implications for how we say no to the second question
peter
peter north yorkshire
er i'm still trying to digest the er implications of er these various er flows but just to comment perhaps at this stage on the possibility or otherwise of er defining a er a district location
erm i would have thought and it's a personal immediate reaction at this stage it would be difficult for you to come to a conclusion on the appropriate district location
erm you haven't had the figures of the local authorities erm on that or for that matter the public at large which i think is important
erm which we think would be very important as part of the debate
and perhaps secondly erm there is not a body of information which has been submitted to er this examination public which UNK you in detail on the various issues that we think need to be addressed leading to the erm proposal occasions and i would have thought it would have been difficult for the panel to come to a conclusion but i may be wrong on that
thank you
i was hoping that we could actually UNK out as part of the discussion whether there is erm a positive way forward if we if you are minded if we are minded to recommend the new settlement then i would hope we would UNK out during the course of this discussion erm the preferred or a preferred host authority for this new settlement
peter north yorkshire
well i would be in some difficulty there sir because erm i have clearly this is a very important and sensitive er issue one which involves erm one which would involve erm consideration by my members of the various issues erm i have no authority to express a detailed view on a ma on a matter of principle or indeed a general view as to wh as to which is the er the best location
because i don't know
because i don't know what is the er what is the best location
we are of course conscious that of the position held by the county council and by the district councils
indeed we heard more than once i think yesterday the district councils they have no
however i'm sure everyone around the table will be conscious that one of the things the panel has a duty to do is to consider what is in the light of national guidance
and national guidance does contain some fairly specific indicators of what is expected to be structure plans
the other point on that is that the draft matters for the e i p including matter two d have been known to everyone for some considerable time
the d o e objection has been known to everyone for some considerable time and their statement is quite explicit in what it says in relation to the matter of one d
there have also been several representations from those sitting on my left hand side about the possible answers to question one d in the UNK
all that evidence is before the panel we have a duty to report upon it
it may be UNK that if we spend this morning discussing criteria there'll then be a gap of one and a half working days for those who don't have to travel far to consider possible answers to the second stream of the dialogue
in other words a no to the first question
i think
we have not made
but as with every planning inquiry hearing or whatever we need not to avoid closing the discussion before we have all the information we need to reach a decision whichever way we decide to reach it
i think just to UNK that point if you look at the question which is set down under two d
it's perfectly clear should the policy include specific guidance on the location of the new settlement
if the answer to that is yes then how do we go about providing that advice
mr
richard of
erm i must say i share peter 's view here that the er location of the new settlement whether in general terms or by district has not been through the public consultation process
and i don't see how the structure plan er i the way it's been progressed so far can determine any one of those general locational criteria
all the while there hasn't been a public consultation input
and i it's a difficult question and one i'm not so sure has an answer er but i don't feel that one can be in anyway specific about the location of the new settlement certainly by district cos the exercise hasn't been done
it would of course be necessary if the county council well first of all our report will as you know be to the county council
it would be for them to decide what to do with our report
and of course it is open to them to take a contrary view to any conclusion reached on any matter by the panel
however if as a consequence of a panel recommendation or of their decision on a panel recommendation the county council decide to modify the deposited structure plan there would of course at that stage have to be a public planning enquiry
it may i appreciate mr that is a long way away or could be a long way away from the sort of public consultation which one
it would take place in a different context nevertheless there would be that opportunity and no doubt the UNK of a public consultation exercise at the proposed modification stage would be a matter for the county council themselves to decide
y er richard of
i think that is indeed correct
i was a little surprised to hear yesterday the views of mr about the need for this plan to identify the location or the general location of the new settlement
er that is not a consistent theme within the d o e strategy
one only has to look at the shropshire structure plan in which i was involved last year and the department of the environment in that case had allowed the facility for new settlement without locational criteria
so it would not be inconsistent er for a similar situation to apply here
that would probably take you to your er first scenario if there's to be a new settlement that the criteria approach alone is acceptable
that is certainly the approach the department took in shropshire
and i found it a little strange they were suggesting that an alternative approach may be suitable here particularly when th the evidence hasn't been put UNK or gone through the public consultation process
do you wish to comment on that mr
thank you
d o e
yes sir er ever since p g three was revised at the beginning of last year i believe that the department has been moving UNK in the direction that indicated but certainly my brief here is quite specific
the department expects a general location for the new settlement to be included in the approved plan
what i said to you yesterday i UNK that there were difficulties we don't know how they are to be resolved
we believe that for a structure plan to go forward now in the present state of policy guidance bearing in mind that's on the basis of p g twelve and with p g thirteen lying in the wings
we believe that for any structure plan to conform with a UNK with a new settlement proposal without UNK the general location would be
we've tried to persuade the planning authorities in greater york area for a considerable period of time to try to bring about a situation where to this e i p with specific proposals but for good sound local reasons that has not been possible
we concede on the basis of the exercises that have been discussed so far i think you will find it very difficult to make a firm recommendation in favour of a specific location albeit on a district basis
i think you'll find it very difficult to do
and maybe at the end of the day the county council will have to come to a conclusion after you've made your general recommendations with or without a location maybe th they will decide that having gone through a consultation exercise they're only course is to modify the proposals which would then have to be the subject of another e i p
now i hope that doesn't r ring alarm bells
certainly that would be o one scenario which i think the county will have to UNK
mr
peter er north yorkshire
can i just pick up a couple of points please
first of all in response to miss
i accept that er the government guidance as miss has suggested and reinforced by mr does suggest a policy is that there should be that er increased level er of detail erm in the structure plan
i think the position of the county council is UNK
first of all we feel that a step by step approach whereby we move from options to preferred option to a formal debate e on the principle erm of erm of the strategy
er that's basically i think a an approach which the county UNK er which the public at large has er has found acceptable
er we would find it difficult to justify public concern about a specific location er in advance of a decision erm the principle so we would prefer er a step by step approach er which reflects the special circumstances er of greater york and i think greater york is a special circumstance if only because of the number of authorities erm er thus far involved
secondly i think we would be looking to pursue erm progress towards a preferred general location as a matter er of priority
and in fact if you look at the comments i the blue book erm on page thirty seven of the d o e they have suggested as mr has just confirmed that we really ought to have made progress on that before there is an approved any move towards UNK the alteration
that is what we intend to do and we intend to do it on the basis of the criteria erm that we have set out
now i in terms of the fine letter of p g twelve erm er that is not entirely consistent but looking at the special circumstances of greater york erm and the long time you've spent on this trying to reassure the public that we will do this properly we think it's the best way to proceed
thank you
er mr
michael
i and UNK main objections both the draft plan and the deposit plan is there should be a s a general location in h in h two
this is not a new matter this is a matter on which the county council could have directed their mind to for several years
i like i'm sure others once the issues were published for the e i p took advice from the home secretary and were simply advised that the location that we should give evidence on locational matters to the e i p and that is what we have done
and we have given you detailed evidence
that was available to the county council to do so
the county council themselves have in fact produced a paper er which i have produced in my in my appendices which specifically identifies a preferred location for the new settlement
admittedly that was not accepted by the greater york authorities working party but it is there for you it is a base of technical information for you to use in your decision
in terms of what would happen if this if you felt unable well if there was not a general location specified in the structure plan then there are two ways forward
one that the decision will be taken by the greater york UNK authorities outside the development plan system
that would clearly be completely contrary to the plan led approach which is UNK by government in these matters
it would UNK end up a large enquiry some somewhere along the line which would UNK the whole purpose of the planning system
cos it would mean the decision would be taken by the secretary of state and not by the local authorities
alternatively the step by step approach UNK by mr appears to be totally UNK
cos the if there is to be a proposal modification that must inevitably be the subject of another examination in public
so we are basically wasting another twelve to eighteen months sitting around waiting for a decision on the new settlement
it'll mean a third UNK making decisions on where development should go in greater york
thank you
thank you
i take your point that yes you have submitted er a proposal as have other parties er to the discussion
from our point of view we're not in the position and it would be totally wrong of us actually to try in public to deal with those or to come to a specific conclusion about any particular proposal
i mean that has to be dealt with through the development control processes
erm but nevertheless that and local planning yes
thanks for reminding me
er nevertheless under p g guidance erm advice the new settlement is a strategic issue and therefore it's right and proper to think about it and look at look at it and try to determine whether it is possible to give guidance on a district location through this through this debate
michael
i fully accept e i hope my evidence in fact wasn't directed at our proposal but in terms of the erm of the general guidance given by the department of the environment that there should be a general location specified by district and by locational features such as etcetera
we feel we've given you enough evidence sir that you can come to a UNK decision
we think and i think that the UNK logic is towards the north east ryedale districts of north east of york
so i'm sure we'll go through that in detail later on today
but i feel you have enough evidence in front of you to come to that conclusion
chairman just a very brief point if i may
peter north yorkshire
mr made reference to the county council considering a UNK
the county council has never at any time considered a paper or come to a conclusion erm on the preferred general location for the new settlement
i wish to underline that fully
mr
paul planning
i wonder if we could just consider the question of what is meant by the term general location
erm are we agreed er wi with mr i address this question really to mr that this really means identification of a district within which the new settlement should be located
or is the department of the en environment looking for something a more specific area than a district
mr
d o e
yes sir the answer to that is that yes we are looking for something more specific
not site specific but sufficient locational detail to make it that there're not rival schemes
erm we've heard from selby that they could they could provide possible sites for more than one scheme
i believe it's the role of the structure plan to specify the general location in such a way that unless those schemes were very close together in terms of a site specific nature that wouldn't be left to the local plan process
yes
we did think about this point last night
we tended towards a view that when there is a possibility that one part of a district might meet the criteria but another part of the same district would either be contrary to or prejudice the objectives of the criteria we might need to specify which part of the district we meant
perhaps by reference to rivers
quick look at the map the river UNK chops selby district in roughly half and that there might well be considerations which for the sake of was not okay
equally there might be considerations the other half was okay
and that was the sort of level of detail to which we thought we might need to go in those districts where it is demonstrated to us of the district do need to be considered differently
i that is something which we hope will emerge when we talk about the relevant criteria
obviously as the chairman has UNK we don't know which of these course we're going down we UNK need during the course of the examination to go down all
and it seems to us i mean we've talked about the different principles the ne sensible next step is to talk about the criteria
can i just confirm with you mr that what i've described in terms of geographical location is getting somewhere near to meeting his objective
mr sorry
mr d o e
fine as far as it went we would expect during this er proposal the nature of the new settlement to be specific particularly in relation to the transport of the structure
and we'll be looking for some general indication as to a location in a particular transport corridor
clearly you're unlikely to be recommending somewhere that is not transport in the structure but you'll believe it's important to specify which one
if we get to that point
mr
yes sir very briefly er first of all can i endorse michael 's first set of comments i agree with what he said entirely i think it is UNK upon the e i p and on the stage that the county have reached with your such good advice in your report to come to bring this situation together towards the strategic decision
i would endorse what ken has said i certainly am of the view there are overriding reasons which i'll come to in a moment for putting forward a general location i had seen that as a central location which may or may not span more than one district
the criteria which we'll come on to debate there is one criteria in there which i say UNK or is overriding in weight and that is number eleven to be consistent with regional and sub regional policies
there are very significant sub regional policies cross border migration which have existed for many years
those policies in my view and i put it this strongly rule out certain sectors for consideration
mr
er yeah thank you sir
terry selby district
erm can i throw another UNK in the works er sir
cos what we have heard so far this morning is certainly placing me in all of the local authority
er as you've already heard the greater york authority have UNK for a number of years in bringing forward new settlement proposals but erm i have to say that i do agree it would be helpful if the panel were able to make a strategic recommendation in favour of one particular local authority
my difficulty is as you've already heard i've got no mandate to speak about particular locations or even sectors within selby district although clearly i do have a mandate as i already have said to come along and say that we feel selby district is an appropriate location
erm i had rather thought that you had been given erm sufficient information already to perhaps make a straightforward simple strategic choice between districts
erm if i can elaborate on that a little further
erm
right okay
sorry mr can we can we leave that for later on when we talk about
okay what we'll just do just a brief
it seems to me that there are two ways forward that are that are being pursued in other areas
one approach that we've already heard is in policy
erm which again wouldn't trouble selby district because we're committed to a new settlement
the alternative approach is the one that mr in terms of UNK particular strategic locations
the reasons i said i could go along with that approach as well
thank you
mr
thank you roy house UNK federation
mr raised the possibility of a second e i p
i would regard that as the nightmare scenario
we have erm there have been certain decisions made over time which has got us to this position and whether erm you agree or anyone agrees or not the right next step is to specify a location nevertheless it's embodied in what's gone on so far a series of steps towards making the decision
in my view a second e i p would be a backward step
we've already expressed concern in other UNK about the way in which the greenbelt planning this structure
we found certain difficulty with the with the with the logic of that
but nevertheless we've tackled that and come to deal with it
but in a situation where we were left with the second e i p and we had districts preparing district wide plans and as mr in his submission has said he UNK to remove the present article fourteen direction we are in real chaos
i would urge the panel to make a decision which enables us to go down a road of logical decision making to get the issue resolved one way or the other
if not we'll be in UNK land for a long time
it suits neither the development industry nor would i suggest it suits the public to be left in UNK land for a considerable time
thank you that's very helpful mr
mr
UNK leeds city council
as the panel knows chair leeds itself is in the UNK of producing its own strategic plan
the more certainty they can have from this enquiry the better for us in making our own plans
so we would certainly vote in favour of a specified area the terms that mr 's given
an the sooner the better
having given you food for thought i'd like to move on to a discussion of the criteria and can i say right now that i think it would be right and proper to limit our discussion this morning to the criteria
what i would like to do is to come back on monday sorry tuesday
to look at possible locations and i would hope and expect to have a positive contribution from the district council representatives on that and the county
and finally can i UNK that we have not come to any conclusion as to which road we shall go down on this one
but i did feel it was UNK those possible UNK to get a reaction and i think the forty minutes we've had discussing that have been extremely valuable as far as we're concerned
now can we move to a discussion on the criteria and i'll ask mr to open on that
thank you chairman i will be brief peter UNK north yorkshire
er i will be brief i really want to cover two things er in my introduction
first of all the principle erm of the criteria and secondly the detail erm of the content er of the criteria
as far as the principle is concerned i just need to say two things
er first of all er p g three and the question asked by the d o e as well that it's sufficient justification to go further than the guidance UNK out in paragraph thirty three er of p g i think it is paragraph thirty three of p g
yes
er three
i think there was a feeling yesterday certainly it's our view that what that paragraph in p g three does is to set the basic ground rules
the basic ground rules that determine whether a new settlement concept does as i would put it get into the starting gate
i think there's a need or the county council considered there's a need for certainly in the greater york context for further guidance to be given to fairly erm assess where the new settlement location er should be
we think it would be a sad day if local plans and structure plans were purely a UNK er of p g three
the purpose of the planning system i think is to develop government guidance er and therefore we think there's a need for something further than p g three
secondly er we think there's a need for a consistent overview of york a consistent view of the issues and the matters that need to be assessed erm right across greater york
we've already heard that greater york os a very complex area with many UNK
i think there's a need to assess those relationships and those factors UNK and fairly across greater york and if nothing else i think we owe that to the public er of greater york
and indeed we did give them an undertaking er that would be done
that's all i want to say on the principle erm of the criteria as far as the detailed content erm er is concerned i suspect we could talk all day about whether social should replace affordable in one of the criteria or whether the full stop is in the right place er in another one
e we largely are perfectly happy to leave that sir t to the panel having considered the views on the very detailed comments on the criteria
other than that i want to make just three comments on three important issues which have been raised
first of all is criteria criterion
one that the new settlement should avoid er the greenbelt
that i think is absolutely er fundamental erm to the issue and because of the way the practically the greenbelt local plan has been defined that means it has to be practically outside the outer boundary of the greenbelt
secondly the issue of eight rather than ten miles
the county council very early on in fact the greater york authority this is criterion three
did in fact with the greater york districts initially take a view that it ought to be eight miles
subsequent reflection and erm consideration of various comments that we that were received i think rightly persuaded the county council and the district councils that in order to ensure erm a proper search and a proper consideration of all the factors er that eight miles should be extended er to ten miles
and i think that is probably the appropriate ground rule erm all that
and then the other issue i think is criterion twelve erm avoid conflict with mineral and non mineral development
again i think that is er an important consideration in greater york
that is not to say that necessarily will discount any area but in erm reflection of paragraph thirty one of m p g one i think it is important that sort of issue erm er is included
so that's all i think i want to say chairman
er time is progressing erm and obviously i would be interested to hear the debate
thank you mr
well could i have comments on the principle or principles of er by using criteria and then i'd like to go through the individual criteria or individual criterion one by one
can i say obviously we have our own comments about these
erm but to come back to the first criterion which says avoid the greenbelt i know exactly what you mean when you say avoid the greenbelt but if in the context of the wording before that where it says to be located beyond the outer boundary of the york greenbelt do you need to have criterion one
or is there another greenbelt which may also be er affected by a new settlement proposal
i think erm as far as the green belt is policy h two in terms of its general presumption does direct erm the new settlement beyond the outer boundary of the greenbelt
mm
erm the criterion one that has been UNK has been described as a avoid the greenbelt to reflect the possibility or the theoretical possibility that er a new settlement could be er provided shall we say erm n on the inner edge of the greenbelt if the scenario arose that the final definition of the york greenbelt did allow for that possibility to emerge
i think it's very unlikely but i think it described as one avoid the greenbelt to be seen to be er UNK all possibilities
yeah
sorry i have to cut across my advice to everybody else there
it does strike me though as a that a that one of the basic points is that if this is going in as structure plan guidance then we have to be satisfied that these are in fact criteria which can operate at the strategic level
er and the other point which e you might like to comment is are they in effect set out in any order of UNK
a UNK order or UNK importance f in terms of the strategic thinking
taking peter north yorkshire
taking the second point first no there is no implied priority erm UNK to any of the criteria erm reflected in the order in which they are set out
i think it is certainly the members er input is required to balance and weight perhaps individual criteria when they have a body er of information before them but certainly er there is no intention to er to er weight the criteria or to imply that er one is er more or less important than twelve
i think it would be very helpful if participants could give us their views
mm
as to whether there should be any order of priority
i think it would also be helpful to have participants reactions to the nature of the criteria
mm
are they about what the new settlement should be like if so is that an appropriate consideration for the structure plan
as opposed to are they about where the new settlement should be generally located
which i know mr will tell us is a matter for the structure plan
so i think there are a number of questions about the principle about the nature of criteria what would be appropriate in a structure plan what would not be appropriate in a structure plan as well as would it be helpful UNK impossible to have some order of priority
mr and then mr
d o e
er can i just respond briefly to mr 's first point to confirm that we've absolutely no objection to a more detailed set of criteria being included in the plan than is contained in p g three
er we wouldn't want the plan to be inhibited in that way
i if i can just remind participants of what we said in our original objection that further justification will be required to demonstrate that the level of detail proposed in the deposited policy h two is not UNK with p g three and does not involve over detailed or unduly restrictive policy guidance
mm
now we would expect that justification to emerge from this examination and in due course to be embodied in the er lower case script for the alteration itself
but er i just wanted to confirm that we've no objection to more detailed set of criteria being included
can i
pro provided they're relevant at this level
quite so sir
did you say included in the lower case
er d o e
er as you know er miss er w the structure plan highlights the policies in upper case and the reason justification is provided in lower case script
yes i do but are y i'm sorry i'm not clear as to whether you are suggesting that there should be policy upper case criteria and some non policy lower case criteria
er d o e
er simply er that the various upper case items which are listed one to twelve are backed up in lower case script
mm
and as we see it that lower case script is not quite good enough to justify what's there at the moment
we would expect that to be UNK after this examination
i understand thank you
yeah
yes
thank you
mr
paul planning partnership
am i right in erm my belief that in fact the final version of policy h two erm need not and should not include a list of criteria other than those set out in p g two paragraph thirty three
because these criteria it seems to me are a means to an end for us to decide upon an appropriate general location
having determined that general location i believe it should probably be at a district level but clearly there is a view from others that it needs to be a smaller area that
it seems to me that it is then a matter for the local plan to erm promote or decide erm a more de probably more detailed list of lo c locational criteria and then the local planning authority considers erm the alternative locations following public consultations and possibly invite erm schemes at that stage
so it seems to me if we can agree on what criteria might be appropriate to look at the location of the new settlement on a strategic level the final version of h two will in fact probably be much shorter more concise er than the policy h two that we have at the moment
er and that's i think the basis of the erm strategy i've set out in my statement to the examination in public
the other difficulty i have is with some of these criteria and their use at a strategic level
because it seems to me many of them actually require a site specific evaluation or an area specific evaluation in quite detailed terms to be able to come to any sensible conclusion
for example the question of minerals which mr has erm raised
i think points to this erm issue erm very clearly
in the paper which erm was considered by the greater york authorities in january nineteen ninety two on the possible location of a new settlement all of selby district was ruled out of consideration erm for a new settlement because it was erm within part of the district is within the selby UNK
now that flies in the face of erm i think the er the real position on the ground which is that a development could take place within that district even where areas have not yet been UNK without any adverse impact on the either the UNK or the new settlement
and yet on that one issue taken on its own selby district is ruled out
and there are others agricultural land again is a very site specific evaluation i think from this si erm generally
we recognize that any new settlement site er in the area around greater york is likely to involve the loss of some better quality UNK er agricultural land
and it seems to me that the use of these therefore at strategic level many of them can only really be used if you're prepared to make erm huge assumptions or huge UNK of the imagination
and i in i invite i suppose the county council really to respond to this issue of how they would intend erm indeed the districts how they would intend to use these criteria certainly in a more rational and erm UNK way than the sort of erm statements that were included in their january nineteen ninety two report
do you want to come back on that mr or do you want to wait a few moments
yes
mr
michael hambleton district council
to come back on something that mr said and perhaps take it a stage further
mr said that erm the d o e would have no objection to more detailed criteria in the structure plan policy erm than erm included in paragraph thirty three of p g three
i would perhaps add that erm the structure plan policy shouldn't exclude criteria that er are in p g three
and i would erm particularly d draw your attention to criteria two there that erm the proposal should have district council support which i think is an important point of principle
and indeed if the panel are minded to recommend erm a criteria based policy of this nature we would recommend the inclusion of this important point of principle
mr
tony
i think there is a very real need for strategic guidance to be given by appropriate criteria being included in policy h two
however in my written statement i have suggested that certain of the criteria are going to be more appropriate to a local plan rather than to a structure plan
my general comment with regard to the criterion number four is that more emphasis could be made upon the need to reduce car UNK
yeah
and alternative transport UNK being promoted in addition to rail
also i think that in criteria nine that reference should be made to unacceptable coalescence being avoided
but my principle comment this morning is with regard generally to all criteria and with particular reference to criterion one avoiding the greenbelt
mm
now the planning system in this country rightly gives the decision maker considerable discretion in exercising judgement regarding planning application allowing all material considerations to be taken into account and appropriate weighting given
however policies that use UNK phrases such as will be or should only be do not allow scope for all ma material considerations to be taken into account
accordingly p g three on paragraph thirty three states that a new settlement should normally only be UNK where certain criteria are satisfied including UNK of the greenbelt
this flexibility of approach is repeated in p g four paragraph sixteen where it states that advice on UNK where industrial and commercial development is not normally be appropriate is provided in p g two
again in the recently published p g six paragraph forty six it states that regional shopping centres may well have a role to play but usually only where the loss of greenbelt can be justified by the economic and social benefits of the scheme
p g two clearly states that the government UNK great importance to UNK and in paragraph twelve sets out the general presumption against in appropriate development within them
however in paragraph thirteen it does accept that in very special circumstances exceptions can be made
while stating in paragraph fourteen that development plans should make no reference to the possibility of allowing other development in exceptional circumstances nowhere in the p g does it suggest that the authority should exclude the possibility that very special circumstances could justify an exception to be made
however policy h two as drafted seeks to UNK the decision maker of the ability to consider all material considerations by the UNK use of the words will be required to and applies this to all twelve criteria without allowing discretion to be taken into account of any special circumstances that might present to justify exceptional development
accordingly the guidance given in p g paragraph three should be followed by including the word normally in the policy requirement and the requirement for the new settlement to be beyond the outer edge of the york greenbelt so as to avoid the greenbelt with then form part of the locational criteria one
this will also make h two consistent with the existing greenbelt development control policies e nine and e ten of the approved county structure plan which are still being retained and also the proposed open countryside policy e two all of which use the qualification normally
now my submission is not intended to be representation that the new settlement should be in the greenbelt and great weight must still be given to it's protection
however no opportunity that otherwise UNK with the locational criteria should be UNK in seeking the best location for a new settlement that serves the needs of the greater york area
an area that was considered by the secretary of state as being five to seven miles of york city centre and is almost entirely within the greenbelt
perhaps as a final word i might be per better to echo the chief planning inspector stephen who at this year's t c p summer school said neither statute or policy rule out the practical application of common sense in unusual or exceptional circumstances
thank you sir
thank you
mr
sir i agree with the comments that mr just made that basically policy h two in its present form has two functions
one is that of UNK the area of search for the new settlement and secondly more detailed erm criteria for the local plan stage
i think once you've UNK the area of search and i think i agree with mr on this there are two or three key criteria
namely if you if you take first of all the UNK point that the new settlement should have good access to primary network you immediately limit the area of search to the UNK routes out of york
if you then take the point that it's beyond the greenbelt again you've limited the area of search and if we take the point that mr i think put across so well that it's consistent with sub regional policy you already immediately then rule out that part of the erm area round greater york that would have greatest impact on the leeds conurbation
the other criteria just simply ones that common to an enabling erm that we see everyday of the week in other structure plans
but because of the special circumstances of york we've got to first define and UNK the area of search to a specific corridor and then the other locational criteria are just a guidance first we take the proposals forward to the local plan stage
thank you
okay
mr then mr
mr to round up and then we have coffee
er david york city council
just a very brief statement sir to er make it clear as was stated in my evidence i support the comment made by mr from hambleton that the criteria based policy should include the criteria as required by p g three to indicate the requirements support of the district council
thank you
mr
michael
i tend to agree that the criteria tend to fall into two sorts
er one being descriptive in terms of describing the end product and i don't think that's very helpful to a structure plan i think that is a matter that can be left to the local plan
and that UNK is of course erm criterion ten
now i also agree that these criteria are not of equal importance and i certainly would put the greatest weight on criterion one which is to avoid the greenbelt in fact i think it's so important that it shouldn't be a criterion but it should be actually be within the UNK as it is now
so that it's not a matter which is weight to balance
in my professional view cos if the new settlement has to be in is ch is i has to be within the greenbelt then it's better to go for peripheral development rather than have a new settlement in the first place
erm in t the second most important criterion i would have thought is that it needs to be on a public transport corridor
and that again is UNK by p three and it goes back to the erm the o the object of sustainability and reducing c o two UNK
the third and i think very important criterion is the need to avoid is the need to comply with sub regional planning objectives
and obviously the new settlement is a very important sub regional er planning proposal and it must comply with the overwhelming run of sub regional planning policy which is to avoid doing anything which would erm undermine the regeneration of west yorkshire
now i think that is important enough to be specified in the policy in as a criterion in the policy itself
the other criteria i tend to agree with are matters which are capable of being weighing and balancing against each other and they are not overriding but i think those three matter which i specified are overriding and would rule out any location
thank you
don't comply with
mr
yeah i think just my only summing up comment would really be in response to perhaps mr m mr 's erm request for erm perhaps UNK as to how we would use these criteria
i think i'd start off by saying that it's probably and likely to f that you could find in the greater york area between six and ten miles from the city centre erm one location which met every one of the twelve criteria one hundred percent
erm let me give you an example
mr and mr have er laid great stress on the issue of sub regional guidance erm and the implication that they would be happy with a new settlement location shall we say in the south west erm of the of the greater york er area
now it may well be that er that may well be the position in the south west in respect of that particular criteria but we would need to see er how a location in that area met the other eleven criteria
and even looking at that one erm the south west location one would have to say that the increased UNK erm which will shortly be afforded by the UNK of the northern section erm of the york outer relief road er would increase the UNK of areas to the north east of erm er of greater york er to west yorkshire
and i think that quite clearly proves that what you need to do is a detailed evaluation of all these criteria all of them which reflect as a appropriate strategic guidance to come er to a balanced view
and it's not going to be difficult and at the end of the day someone is going to have to i suspect and it would have to be members initially erm who would do that as far as we see it
would have possibly to weight some of the criteria
that this is more important issue er than that
that is the way the planning system operates erm and i would have thought that the greater york experience erm does perhaps suggest that there may be some look at erm on the question of the need for sub district guidance
i i'll go on no further than that
thank you
can i can i say that i after coffee i'd like to go through each of these criteria and try to distinguish those which are relevant at structure plan level and those which may be more applicable down at the district local plan level
and also i'd welcome comments er we've had one from er mr that whether there are any things which you think ought to be added as well as taken away
can we UNK at er twenty past eleven please
can we er now embark on this assessment or analysis of the relevance of the criteria
bearing in mind that er we'd like to try and distinguish those which would fall within a structure plan umbrella and those which would be more applicable possibly at local plan level
and also i'd like an indication as we go through of the relative weights that you might want to give to individual criterion
can er take mr sorry mr
it's alright ah
so do we want to take the UNK and then and go through one by one
mr
i'm very sorry chairman er mr n and i were checking er a point in response to a question that was asked to me during the break
can you could just ask er again i missed the
ah well i said we we'd like to embark on this assessment of the relevance
yeah
of the criteria and try to allocate those which would fall under the structure plan umbrella those which would be more applicable at local plan level and added to that give some form of weighting
mm
to each of those
i really don't want to make any introductory remarks to that
erm i think the criteria generally reflect appropriate strategic guidance but i'd be very interested to hear the contributions round the table
right well we go straight to number one which is proposals will be required to avoid the greenbelt
mr did you want to speak on that
whip
on the general point of differentiating criteria between strategic and local i think that one ought to bear in mind that some have importance in both connections and particularly i would draw attention to the perhaps overriding points made in paragraph thirty three of p g three regarding the UNK of unacceptable coalescence and positive environmental improvements
those in particular have UNK in both ways for example in the sc the strategic level er they might result in a whole sector being excluded from consideration
yes i fully accept that some of these are relevant at each level
erm and i think we could quite happily define which those are
does anybody UNK from the first criterion
apart from my earlier comment that i felt it might be slightly UNK in the fact that you've suggested within the UNK that a new settlement should be located beyond the outer boundary and i did raise the question of whether there was another greenbelt which may come into play
erm well the only other greenbelt peter north yorkshire chairman
the only greenbelt erm er in north yorkshire er is the is the west yorkshire statutory greenbelt in the western part er of selby district council but the area of land the area of search that we have defined as about er ten miles would not take in any er would not be of relevance to the west yorkshire greenbelt
no
so do you d do people think that criterion one is essential either at structure plan or l and local plan level
mr
council
i i'd like to see it retained chair because criterion three says generally within ten miles of york and er i'm sure somebody would er argue that well that's only a general rule still acceptable
well that we haven't got there yet we haven't got there yet
well right er okay but erm supposing it was retained as it is i'd certainly like to see criterion one retained in the list
yes
is the reference in the UNK to the policy beyond the outer boundary of the york greenbelt in itself not enough
dave leeds city council
sorry chair my comments were in relation to the west yorkshire greenbelt of course
avoiding the west yorkshire greenbelt
yes
yes
almost a double negative isn't it
but well can we move on to two and i must confess erm i'm not quite clear what is meant by this one
perhaps i could point up some of the concerns about c the second criterion
does all refer to timescale size land use or what
peter north yorkshire
i think generally we think that it would refer to er to all three
i think the UNK the UNK explanatory text er with little two er indicates that really we are trying to address er erm a greater york er dimension that we are looking at a proposal er which meets the er development needs erm of greater york over the period er that the contribution should be made through the new settlement
i can envisage being at a public local enquiry th it would not be me where a barrister would make a great deal of an argument that york needs a regional shopping centre
do you actually mean that you want this if that case were proven that you would want the regional shopping centre in the new settlement
mr
er malcolm county council
er i'm not sure in the case of the example you've given of the arising in greater york that the question of a regional UNK shopping centre would arise because that is not necessarily something that is generated within greater york
the shopping requirements the sub regional UNK of greater york and obviously the accommodated er within greater york but obviously something of that nature is er is not part of those considerations
it is an extreme example mr trying to point out the sorts of problems that arise in relation to policies which say more than they mean
and all has one definition
it is all UNK
i'm not sure that the word all is appropriate
as written it strikes me as being a UNK to fortune
mr
yes er i agree UNK because i can imagine if this ended up in selby what might be proposed under this umbrella
erm bearing in mind the planning policies
erm i think it should be quite specific and it should say the housing needs
i would suggest that all be UNK by housing
mr
paul planning partnership
i also have difficulty with this particular criterion
erm i accept the point that has been made that the word all is too all UNK
and perhaps it needs to be restricted to the housing and employment er needs arising from greater york
the other difficulty i have is in the er the lower case text which ex attempts to explain what is meant by this particular criterion the sorts of considerations that will be taken into account
and it states that the requirement will be interpreted to UNK locations which might positively encourage in migration or create pressures for additional land releases
now i am not sure how those sorts of issues could be UNK measured and therefore assessed
erm and i you know would welcome a response from the county council on that point
can i suggest that the again the employment needs of greater york could be a UNK to fortune
if i have got the right grasp of what the county council and most people around the table are aiming for the new settlement is primarily about housing
but what is not wanted is a housing estate but the employment that is related to not greater UNK employment but the employment related to the level of development in the settlement
am i right
yes i would not erm paul planning partnership
i would not disagree with that approach er one of the problems in dealing with this erm criterion by criterion is that er i can't refer to other points i've made elsewhere on other aspects
erm elsewhere in my statement i have indicated an appropriate provision of employment land which is related to the population size which we are suggesting for the new settlement
er it should not be a an UNK figure for employment it should be related to the economically active in the new settlement that is proposed
erm peter north yorkshire
erm while i wouldn't disagree with that general UNK i would probably disagree with what that figure should be but we'll be turning to that er next week
i think the general concept that we is that we do not want to erm envisage we hope we will not envisage proposals which generate a scale of development erm which is quite clearly not related erm to the needs of the greater york area
and may be more related to the needs erm of other areas
and erm how we actually measure i would accept is d is somewhat difficult and i think it's based on erm a an assessment er a professional assessment of the issues that are current to the criteria
i think difficulties in introducing any statistical measurement to it and again it's value judgements er which need to be tested
erm in due course at er at erm UNK such of this
could i just clarify one other point erm i did UNK advise the panel on the ten miles
erm in respect of the west yorkshire greenbelt
and strict interpretation of the ten miles and mr reminded me would just pinch in a little bit erm of the of the west yorkshire greenbelt
so i if i put that in i must apologize for misleading the panel
thank you
yes
thank you
it's alright
mr
associates
if i could just make a brief point on employment
while certainly in my earlier comments i did say that it is highly desirable that there should be employment in any new settlement it cannot in my view be the case that th york has certain erm greater york but york in particular as a city has certain employment requirements as a result of decline in certain industries
it also has certain opportunities for example the university has already shown itself to be a leading research centre
and there are certain strategic reasons why the i feel that a number of the employment needs of york in terms of location advantages and other advantages would not match with the new settlement criteria once they're put
and for that reason er certainly some modification of that criteria is necessary
so i wonder could i just UNK your UNK very briefly
i have a pressing engagement to go to
could i possibly make my one minute comment on criteria eleven
you can yes
er i hope that won't disturb you or er sir my comment briefly is i did indicate in my opening er statement er yesterday that there is in existence and i don't wish to make too much of this at this particular enquiry but you should be aware of a new settlement proposal in the leeds district outside the UNK defined greenbelt
that new settlement is while it's within the leeds district is on the north eastern UNK of that district
one of the advantages of that proposal and its UNK with any proposal within certain sectors of greater york is the question about migration from west yorkshire but in particular from leeds
that out migration had generally been running according to the household projections at something like two thousand per annum
it is projected to fall to somewhere round the fifteen hundred fourteen per annum towards the end of this decade
UNK of greater york is the UNK of UNK two report
thank you the point which mr has made yesterday i think will continue to make
mr
er yes chair i'm not going to repeat the point i made yesterday but simply to clarify that the proposal mr has outlined is not a proposal incorporated in the deposit u d p
thank you
but i take the UNK of mr 's comment
chairman can i queue for your
peter north yorkshire
chairman could i also confirm that the county council would not be prepared to discount any particular sector in greater york on the basis of one criteria even if that was a valid criteria in the terms that er that mr suggested
we need to look at all twelve
thank you can we go back to two i mr and mr are your comment related to criterion two
mr first
michael hambleton district council
i think bearing in mind the clear intentions behind criteria two and the concern that we've heard over the last three days about inward migration it might be useful if we tag a rider onto erm criteria two
perhaps i'm not suggesting this as a sort of erm a definite wording just as a s UNK as a suggestion erm to the effect that the settlement should best serve the development needs arising in greater york rather than the demand generated from outside the area
something to that effect
mr
chris
i can share the concerns of er miss concerning the expression of the word all in criterion two
i mean UNK on the tail end of policy h one yesterday the new settlement isn't going to accommodate all the development needs of greater york
i think the answer to that is that the reference e should be made to the village making a significant contribution to the development needs of greater york be it housing employment or UNK erm social and community
thank you
anyone else got any comments on two
what sort of weight do you want to attach to this
mr
yes i'm sorry
i'm in a bit of difficulty when you say what sort of weight because w we need to have some sort of scale i think but
up to ten
i would simply say that i think it does deserve maximum weight because i you will not be surprised to hear er take the same view as mr from leeds city council that under no circumstances should the settlement be located anywhere other than in a location which will serve york and not leeds
so it is UNK a most important erm criterion
but i
it's one of the leading criteria
yes
put it that way
mr
michael
i think that two and a eleven basically say the same thing in different in different ways
erm they are the UNK the two criteria which i consider UNK along with the greenbelt and the need to be located on a public transport corridor which must be given the most weight in the in the decision making process
the need to avoid locations which UNK which stimulate
i think the word sir i would emphasise is stimulate in migration from west yorkshire would be clearly contrary to all the established planning principles which have been endorsed by the secretary of state time and time again
and i think it's i would give very great weight to this UNK these two criteria put together and i think they should be made more explicit sir
and they should be an explicit criteria saying that locations should be avoided which stimulate as i say in migration
thank you
mr coming in or are you just
oh sorry
a slight UNK
as we've actually had policy er criterion eleven raised by mr erm i UNK think there's any UNK voice about the weight on that or the importance of that particular criterion is that regional and sub regional policies
i know i know i'm taking it out of order but rather than wait until we get there this has been raised why can't we deal with it now
mr
it does seem to me paul planning partnership
it does seem to me that criterion eleven erm is has already been covered erm by implication in items er criteria two er and probably three as well
and i don't see there is a need for an additional reference to those policies it seems to me that erm the references to in migration pressures are correct as a consideration erm if you like as a erm numerical basis in terms of assessing what have been made in the county
but it is difficult it seems to me to use them in a sort of very locational sense which is being suggested by their use as one of the criteria
we've heard that avoiding UNK in migration particularly from the leeds conurbation is an important consideration are they conscious that the rest of regional policy is something of a black box at the moment
and i think it would be helpful to the panel to have a feel for whether the leeds in migration issue is the only aspect of regional sub regional policy or whether there are other aspects of it which are important or be it perhaps less important
peter north yorkshire
on the particular issue of regional migration as it affects greater york i would suspect and we can probably put some information in to confirm this that the UNK between greater york area and other county areas within er yorkshire and humberside vary
i say probably quite definitely that there is not a great UNK between the greater york area in UNK terms and all of humberside compared to that UNK erm with west yorkshire
certainly as far as south yorkshire is concerned again we would have to say that the UNK social UNK between greater york a and south yorkshire er is very limited
er well mr first mr please
yes er gerald
