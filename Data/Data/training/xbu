i have to disagree with er mr of i think this criterion is UNK important and in fact what peter has just said UNK my view that er the important sub regional and regional issue is the relationship between york and leeds in this er under this criterion
and i'd just like to take the opportunity to er emphasise the point that i have been making at this e i p that erm r regional migration from the west yorkshire is reducing and we don't want to create a UNK which UNK that trend
er so i would regard this UNK this criterion as critical very er it should be given the greatest of weight and erm must be left in
thank you mr
er d o e
erm as you know sir you've heard already er the department has not yet received advice from the region as to the content of strategic guidance
n we ourselves have just started to put together our first thoughts on it in advance of receiving that advice but clearly it's much to early to be coming to getting the conclusions as to what that g guidance will eventually contain
i would therefore think it's appropriate to be in this sort of format er so that if any other issues other than questions of in migration appear to be relevant to this situation then it can be taken on the move
thank you
mr
yes just very briefly
peter north yorkshire
i do think the discussion so far and the contribution from mr and mr is UNK er at this stage erm UNK a proper assessment of er a for a new settlement all the way round greater york including the UNK and i return to a comment i made before the break that UNK for example of the outer bypass of the york ring road which is UNK and is will dramatically change may well dramatically change the perception erm of people to the to the west of the greater york area in respect of the area to the north east
that is a fact it is coming
now that issue needs to be borne in mind
er in the in the overall evaluation
so it's not quite as simple to say that regional planning sub regional planning requires er a discount a strong discount erm to the south west of york i think the issue is rightly addressed and we need to address it but i must say the conversation so far and the contributions really need to be UNK in one direction
er well i realize we're beg being given illustrations but i don't think there's anybody really UNK apart from mr to the inclusion of eleven is there
as one of the criteria
well i'm not arguing for the exclusion of eleven i'm just trying to er give a balanced interpretation as to how it should be assessed
we haven't got there yet so let's wait
mr
thank you chair
now david york city council
i'd just actually like to support what mr said because erm the next er government reviews
the city council UNK travel patterns from settlements around york and it was quite UNK that a number of settlements to the north east of york did actually have a substantial commuting pattern to west yorkshire
to
so i mean mr is quite correct in saying there's already a significant er commuting movement between settlements to the north of york and leeds
thank you
mr
erm i have to concur with that but nevertheless er the north east sector is further away from leeds than the south west sector of york
one has to go through past or around york erm for your shopping facilities
one isn't gonna go past york to get to leeds
if one is between york and leeds one has a more distinct choice as to go to one or the other
my preference er under this er item eleven would be to clarify as far as we are able in terms of the regional planning guidance that exists to state what we f what is meant by it
now we either are going in the direction this morning or rather i think you're being pressed to go in the direction of seeking to identify in due course what is the preferred general location and this undoubtedly is something you can hang your hat on
it's not as UNK fairy as some of the other criteria that er might be considered as relevant to erm try and find a general location for this settlement
i believe eleven should clarify that in view of the regional planning guidance in view of the comments made by leeds er that it should one should state under this criteria that the new settlement should not be located on the south west side of york
for precisely the reason set under regional planning guidance
unacceptable
i think
sorry i don't think that was heard for the record mr
that would be unacceptable chairman as far as the county council's concerned
well unacceptable it may be in your present state of mind but
but we cannot it seems to me we cannot end up with a blank sheet of paper and draw a set of criteria up which says it can be anywhere here
i think we're beginning to stray into what i hope will be a UNK discussion on tuesday morning
can we move to criterion number three
we've now dealt with one two and eleven
criterion three
you've made a qualification to this have you not mr
yes
yes
there is a proposed change put in on this
anybody want to comment on that
silence means acceptance
mr
thank you sir
paul planning partnership
i think we have to go back to what is the fundamental purpose of the york new settlement and that is to meet some of the development plan requirements of the greater york area
and it seems to me UNK that the further the new settlement is located away from york city centre york city then less likely it will be erm to meet the housing requirement needs of the greater york area
and it seems to me that the outer suggested limit of ten miles is unduly generous and that there are more than sufficient sites available within a radius of six to eight miles from york city centre
and certainly from my submission to you in the selby district i have shown that er the plan which was UNK with the written evidence
how does ten miles relate to the definition of the greater york study area
as a general erm guideline chairman the greater york study area has a some degree of consistency with the outer boundary erm of the york greenbelt which is generally around about six miles erm from the greater york er from the city centre
and in fact quite UNK we did bring along a plan today which has a six mile radius erm from the centre of york which was er the subject of some discussion at the greenbelt local plan enquiry and by and large erm there is some consistency between the outer boundary or the greenbelt erm and the greater york study area both at around about six miles from the city centre
i don't understand that
that is the
if the circle that i'm looking at is six miles which you've implied it is
yeah
then the surely the greater york study area's more than six miles otherwise all UNK in the greater york area's within the greenbelt
UNK malcolm county council
the outer boundary of the greater york area was the parish boundaries
it's based on parish unions
the outer boundary of the greenbelt is based on physical features they're not necessarily follow exactly the same features all the way round the greater york greater york area
erm in some places the greater york area or the greenbelt UNK beyond the greater york area in some places the greater york area goes within the greenbelt
the memo i've got is that the new settlement provision according to the structure plan relates to the greater york area
yes
but the actually new settlement would have to be located outside the greater york area as you are now defining it
yes that's correct
it would be a provision both outside the erm greater york area and because of the erm statutory definition of the greenbelt being about six miles erm from york city centre it would also be outside the greenbelt
which comes back to the question which miss raised yesterday what is in reality the greater york area
as distinct from what is the greater york study area
well i
are they are they UNK
well erm the greater york study area has been defined and it is that area erm on the front of the erm of the greater york er study document
that is the area which has been used for the last five or six years as the basis of the and that outer boundary more or less UNK with the outer boundary erm of the york greenbelt
coming back to what is er greater what is greater york you would need to have to assess to look at the UNK with er with york
and depending on how you erm which criteria you use they may well vary
you may define greater york on a erm on a different basis u if you use for example as against number of trips to theatres
or shopping in york
but generally the feeling is that the appropriate sort of area for greater york er in terms of the main UNK erm are is that defined in the greater york study which appeared to er find some support in the local government commission for example
as being an appropriate erm area to look at
mr
ian ryedale district
erm i think the proposal for UNK this policy to within eight miles of york is being unnecessarily restrictive
as can be seen from the map up there in the north eastern sector the proposed outer boundary of the greenbelt goes beyond the six miles anyway and is probably nearer seven miles
erm there are a number of objections to the outer boundary on the greenbelt in that area which if they came u came up on an eight mile boundary would reduce the area of search to something like three quarters of a mile
mr and then mr
tony UNK
er with regard to the definition of the greater york area i referred to this earlier on in my submission this morning but it may er assist the panel if i draw attention to the secretary of state's letter in UNK the structure plan in nineteen eighty seven
particularly paragraph er five point eleven
erm with your permission sir i'll read it out
the secretary of state has noted the panels suggestion that the boundaries of the greater york area should be outside the york greenbelt area
but having regard to the document policies for housing and industrial land in the greater york area on which the county council has based their proposed provision and to which the panel referred he considers that the outer boundary of the greater york area should be about five and seven miles from the city centre the precise boundary being a consideration for local planning
as a result he accepted the housing provision of nine thousand one hundred as recommended by the panel compared with the ten thousand one hundred in policy h one of the submitted
following that er the greater york study area er was defined by the county council erm in consultation with the greater york authorities and er as has been explained to you it is substantially following the boundary of the greenbelt as defined
now if i can just refer as i did in my earlier submission to the possible results of that i suggested that the requirement for the new settlement to be located beyond the outer boundary of the green er york greenbelt should be rolled into criterion one the need to avoid the greenbelt
now in criterion three it also goes on to say and have as close a relationship to the city as is consistent with approved greenbelt policy
now it just possible and i will explain in a moment why that the necessity to avoid the greenbelt may not be exactly the same as being beyond the outer boundary of the york greenbelt
the reason for this is that in my submission to the york greenbelt local plan enquiry i suggested that there could be a case for making an inset within the greenbelt to accommodate a new settlement
thus excluding it from greenbelt designation
if my submission is accepted in the inspector's report it is possible that it would be consistent with approved greenbelt policy to have an inset new settlement avoiding the greenbelt but not outside the outer boundary of the york greenbelt
it is for this reason firstly to identify the UNK er the greater york area as considered by the secretary of state and also to with regard to criterion three er the question of consistency with agreed approved greenbelt policy that i make this further comment
thank you
well you'll have to wait and see what the inspector says on the greenbelt
that i will accept sir out of great interest
but it also follows from that the panel here can make no assumption other then the greenbelt is as in the deposited plan
yes i appreciate that inclusion as well
mr
yes chris
erm you'll see sir in my submissions that i've proposed a UNK of criterion three so that the greater york new settlement should be located as close to the outer boundary of the as of the york greenbelt as is consistent with greenbelt policy
the reason behind this is having regard to the advice in the draft p g thirteen and what we read in p g twelve about erm trying to reduce UNK erm distances travelled
and i think that in the balance that if you have two sites in e the area of search that are equal in all other respects except that one is closer to york than the other then the environmental considerations of that site being closer erm to york would weigh in its favour
i speak with e some experience in the situation where two sites that will be within half a mile of that which was erm supported by the inspector were dismissed basically on the basis that if i read the quotes for you
of the western sites these are sorry this is also one of the UNK from cambridge
whilst there is no great dis difference in the distance of any of the sites in terms of in UNK all the journeys which would be attracted to cambridge bearing in mind the role of the new settlement in serving UNK development needs would be substantially higher in money terms and in the use of energy than most of the alternative proposals
i would totally agree with that conclusion and i would say that in the york situation you should choose the one that is closer to york than is UNK out
all other things being equal
but we have a band of six to ten miles is that right mr
yes
yes
s i would say that you're better off chris
you're better off UNK that criterion to say as close en er to york as is consistent with greenbelt policy
mr
thank you sir
erm get my mind round the relationship between this policy and the h one policy
erm and it's something i hadn't quite considered before that the greenbelt boundary and the greater york area boundary is roughly
in fact it looks if anything the greenbelt boundary is slightly wider than the greater york area boundary
in policy h one it's talking about nine thousand seven hundred and twenty in the greater york area
is that the greenbelt
there will be requirement for part of peter north yorkshire part of the greater york requirement that is the new settlement required to be met outside the greenbelt and outside the greater york area
but er
policy h one doesn't say that
the need to look carefully at the wording on that particular part of h one
mr
there is an argument for retaining a four mile UNK for the area of search for the new settlement rather than a two mile because of the UNK which at present applies to the distance of the outer boundary of the greenbelt from york city centre
historically this was created shortly after nineteen sixty one as a rough way of judging the submissions which had been made for sketch plan purposes on the basis of the nineteen fifty five circular
and the six mile doctrine has been repeated with one minor modification of wording ever since then
at the time of the greenbelt enquiry an extension beyond six miles of the greenbelt could not be considered because a general revision of the county structure plan was not envisaged
on a general revision there might well be a case for extending that distance in view of the development of the central area which has taken place since the six miles was first established
it has been considerable
and that has resulted in the restriction of the UNK width of the greenbelt
er in other words the inner boundary has gone out since nineteen sixty one and the outer boundary has not
therefore for practical purposes it would be better not to restrict the search area outside the belt to two miles now but to have four miles
yes
so in other words you are saying instead of six to eight it's six to ten
yes
thank you
i think mr was in front of you mr
i do apologize
sorry
mr
d o e
just some points there
sir
the area of search six to ten miles there
i was just gonna point out that if you were to refer to the approved key diagram you can get a quite easily visual representation of what that UNK
there are certain things marked on that key diagram to give you clues
the position of tadcaster for instance on the fifty nine to the west the red triangle which indicates a bypass at
in the north west it's roughly where the a nineteen meets the east coast UNK railway
and on the north east it's just a little short of where the york scarborough railway crosses the a sixty four
the only point i'd make on that sir you'll see from that the ten mile limit does extend across the county boundary into humberside
and there have been er quite detailed negotiations between the two counties and my understanding is that north yorkshire county council have agreed with humberside that on no account will their proposals stray across the boundary into humberside
yes i had noted that discussion had gone on and assurances have been given to humberside that north yorkshire would no stray in the sense of putting their new settlement into humberside
mr
thank you roy house builders federation
erm this issue about the extent er of greater york
i have a always understood the distinction between the greater york study area which is an area of calculation of among other things housing needs and the greater york area which was an area in which those needs may be met
i think there's there there's a distinction between the pair and they're not necessarily the same area
and so the point that mr makes that because you have you assess needs within a six mile radius effectively er doesn't necessarily mean you meet those needs er within that six mile radius
so there doesn't there isn't a conflict and th and there isn't a conflict because we have the area of search for a new settlement which is established in the referred to which is broader than the study area
do you want to go back on it
just very briefly i think that erm the point mr raised is a fair point and erm there may well need to be a good bit of clarification erm on that
mr
well e erm i don't want to dwell on this point but it may have implications wider than just where these boundaries are
er because the commitments figures we looked at and the need figures are they the greater york area or the greater york study area
sorry
all the discussion we had in the last few days
the ones that have been asked for
the discussion we had
the figures that erm the nine thousand seven hundred dwellings related to the housing need generated within the greater york study area together with appropriate allowance for migration and that totals nine thousand seven hundred dwellings
it's on the basis of the parishes within the area that we have defined erm as the greater york a greater york study area
i think
and i'm sorry if this is going to UNK mr 's weekend
it is not going to be helpful to have the panel supplied with the information we asked for in relation to the greater york area devised from the h b f table of commitments confined to york city and the greenbelt
i think what we need is commitments within the area of search
er which month would you like that information
well the area of search is defined on the key diagram
which month november nineteen ninety three preferably before the twenty third
er yes we'll do our best
thank you
mr
er john c p r e
just er just so i can be absolutely sure about that i think i'm say i'm asking the same thing that the senior inspector's just asked
the commitments data that we've been dealing with to date for the greater york area that was supplied by the county council was that data that applied to the what we're now calling the greenbelt area or was it the area of search as well
because i think erm it does somewhat alter the discussions that we've had to date i clarification of that
all figures that we've produced and are producing in respect of commitments and the policy element the greater york policy element of policy h one relate to within the area defined as greater york through the greater york
they have not been they are not the area covered by the er york greenbelt because as mr said er greenbelt boundaries follow natural features rather than administrative boundaries which we use for the for the greater york study
and the figures that we worked out are not the figures for commitments within the six to ten mile area of search
yeah
they are for that area on the greater york study
so just on that basis mr chairman therefore presumably on tuesday there will be an opportunity to revisit some of those figures in the light of the revised data that the senior inspector requested from mr
let me see the figures and i'll dwell on that over the weekend
mr
michael
my concern about this criterion and my concern about the information asked by the panel is of course the area of search includes areas which i don't think any house builder would consider falls within the york housing market
it in fact includes quite substantial areas which are now in fact includes parts of leeds metropolitan borough
therefore parts of erm areas which actually relate to the housing needs of york
i like do support a UNK area of search for that reason
particularly as in to the west and south of york the ten mile radius gets you very close to UNK and very close to selby which are not areas which fall within the york housing market
mr
thank you UNK harrogate borough council
just to pick up a point on er miss 's latest request for information
erm the housing need figure we've been working on for greater york has been nine thousand seven hundred and that's been based on the parishes within the greater york study area
presumably if we're now looking at commitment in the wider area of search which would draw in many additional parishes i think in the harrogate case er something like seven to eight additional parishes er if we look at commitments there would we also need to revise the housing need figure as well
to look at it on a comparable basis
i think there is a danger of too much being made of this
the reason we asked for the figures is to get a ball park idea
no more than that
we certainly would not wish to open up the question of need within that area
i also take the point mr has made and only assure you that we will look at these figures when we get them and take on board the sorts of comments that have just been made by yourself and mr and by and use them with our judgement applied UNK
peter north yorkshire
you will in producing those figures chairman ten miles have to approximate the ten miles
yes yeah
as best we can
have we mr
sorry just er john c p r e
just one minor point
obviously erm in receiving those additional figures i accept what the in senior inspector says about not er opening up the need side of the debate but clearly is i think the er mr from harrogate is saying it does it does cast a question mark on the supply dimension of the debate in terms of additional and commitments coming into the figures to meet the greater york housing requirement
so whilst i'm not seeking to change the greater york i e within the greenbelt requirement as we now define it the supply side of the equation is bound to change because the commitments figures will be different given the revised area of analysis
mr
malcolm county council
accept the point that's been made we've got to remember that the commitments that are contained in the band six to ten miles are principally there to meet the general requirements arising in the districts
yeah
and they're not there t as they are at the moment to meet the needs of the greater york area
yes
anyone wish to add any comments on criterion three or can we move to four
may i play UNK advocate again
erm two things occur to me from this criterion
first of all the risk that on the assumption primary road network includes trunk roads as well as county council primary roads is it right that we should encourage essentially local traffic onto trunk roads
i'm sure those familiar with p gs will recall their purpose moving people long distances from a to b
not carrying local traffic
and secondly is it right within this criterion to put more emphasis on car transport or bus transport
road transport of some sort than rail transport
which by virtue its of its phraseology the criterion appears to me to do
peter north yorkshire chairman
just to comment on the senior inspector's first point
i think erm one would have to ac er accept that in greater york erm the existing pattern of trunk roads as they affect greater york do discharge an important function in distributing people around er greater york and it's entirely sensible in the greater york dimension that they would do
if they weren't there and if they weren't being used then there may well be more and more p pressure on the city centre of york so they do discharge i think er a positive function
the bypass for example allowing people to move round er greater york without passing through the er through the city centre and i think that's par part of the county council and i suspect city council's overall approach to traffic management in greater york
michael
i agree with the panel that the criterion should give greater emphasis to public transport that must be in accord with p g three and must be in accord with the emerging p g thirteen
it also should give greater UNK to the ability to link into the rail network
on the question of trunk roads and the general capacity of the road system around york the panel will see that we have actually presented some detailed evidence prepared by and i and for the information for the panel on tuesday i understand that all that information is agreed with the county surveyor as well
so that's w is an agreed position on highways
now in we have also consulted with the department of transport about our proposal and the department of transport have no objections to the use of the a sixty four north east of york to serve a new settlement
have you got that
mr
paul planning partnership
er whatever agreements may have been made with the department of transport and the county surveyor regarding the UNK north east of york of course doesn't mean that other locations are also not un not acceptable under this criterion
erm i've expressed a view in my written submissions that i think the emphasis solely on rail erm access i is unfortunate and perhaps should be UNK to er public transport generally obviously rail access plus rail transport has a particular type of usage
erm in terms of york the pattern of employment er within york city is fairly dispersed and obviously isn't particularly well served by the central railway station
er a bus system however is more able to provide a more UNK pattern of access to those areas from outside wherever the new settlement is located
i'm sorry if i could just make on other point
you raised this question of whether or not i think the new settlement should link into the primary net road network
erm in my view it has to link in somewhere into the primary i into the road network and it's not appropriate to link it into er the local road system and er therefore i think it's inevitable that a UNK will need to be made to the primary road network
including into possibly into a trunk road
i think if erm if you can avoid a trunk road then that is a preferable solution erm if you're able to rely on just county council roads then that is a better solution
mr
ed leeds city council
erm perhaps i've misunderstood miss 's comment on it but leeds would not want the consideration of traffic consequences to be limited to roads within north yorkshire
depending on the location of the new settlement it could have traffic consequences beyond north yorkshire boundaries
mr
north york
er the point i would like to make if i may is with er regard to the question of a positive statement er that car UNK should be reduced and er more emphasis given to the availability and use of bus transport erm as well as t er rail transport
i think in the context of the greater york area er bus transport will have greater relevance
it will be more accessible most importantly it'll be more affordable
given the relative costs of bus transport compared with rail
an interesting comment from the national travel survey nineteen eighty nine ninety one report is that trains were mainly used by those living in the highest income households
in contrast local bus usage was associated with those living in the lowest income households
bearing in mind that given a choice between the use of rail and car the question of cost necessarily will come into that equation
if the costs are not significantly lower people will til still tend to use the car
the other aspect with regard to the new settlement is that it should contain a significant proportion of affordable housing
this in itself i think indicates that there should be affordable transport as a UNK
the other point i would like to make is the question of the impact on the er highway system
i think taking into the equation of er discussing and considering alternative travel arrangements the availability and indeed the extension of park and ride facilities around york should be taken into account and an integrated transport pattern based on park and ride should figure within the transport strategy
thank you
mr
york city council
er during my comments yesterday sir i you'll not be surprised that if with a very strong emphasis on if er the panel do go for a new settlement we do in york feel very strongly that er the issue of priority for public transport usage should be a very high one in this criteria
er i note the comments made around the table about the likelihood of rail based er traffic making a significant contribution
i would share that expectation that er a location which will be ra well served by rail whilst very desirable from our viewpoint i think is extremely unlikely er given the pattern of the rail system in the area
similarly with public transport as i said yesterday the evidence is quite clearly that er the public transport system is york i in greater york is not good and it erm is unlikely to be er improved by er the on the scale suggested i would UNK
but nevertheless having said those i would clearly emphasise the importance of those two elements of the criteria
erm if a new settlement is proposed
turning to the issue of the senior inspector has raised as something like er get my UNK right but something probably like three quarters of the york outer ring road is UNK already
clearly any proposal will have a major impact on the trunk road system
similarly with the other likely locations i know we're g not going into that but virtually all of them will e inevitably feed onto the trunk network which does fulfil a dual function around york
thank you
mr is this something new in addition to what's already been said
well i'm
or are you covering the same
well i would express my support for mr and for mr on widening the scope erm to include because clearly national policy talks about public transport generally and not just rail
but just picking up on mr 's point
in my experience british rail whilst wishing to encourage the use of trains as they would er are UNK to opening stations that just delay journey times
so whilst it's desirable to encourage the use of rail i think in practice it's going to be er very difficult to achieve that and in therefore you should look at public transport in the round
i note your critical comments about british rail
mr
d o e
two points sir
erm the county council's phrase an ability to link into the rail network was geared originally to their proposal for a settlement of between eight hundred and a thousand dwellings
that has already been increased to UNK fourteen hundred er you when you're making your recommendation may or may not come up with a recommendation for a somewhat larger settlement
clearly the bigger the settlement the more the greater the significance one might expect from the rail network in this context
er the other aspect
erm much has already been said about the role of p gs and the advice they contain
er the draft p g thirteen for the moment merely UNK the public transport points that are already made in p g twelve
but there is further UNK research on new settlements which we are awaiting at the moment and it's our UNK that when that is available and the department considers it will update and er UNK p g thirteen
and our headquarters have indicated to us that might well include a UNK of the criteria which are presently in p g three
mm
well we shall wait and see
wait and see
mr
a very quick point sir
erm i would have thought it would be helpful that if criterion four could be worded in such a way that it UNK the need to UNK transport choice
and i think that must be the key
obviously i bus would be acceptable in certain circumstances it's obviously better if one has the choice between bus and rail
thank you for that
c on that on that
weight
what weight are you going to give it
somewhere near the top of the list
michael
i think that in the light of the emerging government guidance that the transport choice must be given a very s substantial weight in the in that decision UNK making process
i in the context of what mr has just said and i'm really talking about the way he's said it but the way actually looked at the criteria can i try to cos i would like to close on this particular question by one o'clock
can i ask when we deal with the others that you look at them in that light
as a sort of principle against which a settlement will be judged
i don't really want to go over the grounds which you know you would seek to weigh different erm locations
we'll come back to that on tuesday
what i'm looking for e effectively is a set of criteria which will promote best planning practise either at structure plan or local plan level in order to judge the location of this settlement
so can we now move off four and look at five which relates to the need to er again i think UNK be a suitable word in here er infrastructure
particularly drainage and water supply
all i'd say on five chairman is that this issue of infrastructure particularly UNK foul water and water supply is a major issue in york and the location of the new settlement i think needs to be very closely assessed in terms of er of five
i think it's a very important criteria that we need to look at
i agree it's important what i have no feel for is whether it is something which helps to make a decision as to where the new settlement might go
what i think i'm looking for is some evidence that the UNK of the infrastructure problems to which you refer actually varies from one district to another
if it is the same problem in all districts then it doesn't help anyone make a decision
well it's not chairman and perhaps mr has got some information i think that might help you on that
er yes malcolm county council
certainly in the work that the greater york er authorities did in preparing their proposals over the past er four or five years er we have worked fairly closely with what was then the yorkshire water authority and national rivers authorities on the questions of drainage erm and so forth which are our major problems around york
and there are certain areas around the city where a the provision of a new settlement is likely to create more severe environmental problems
no i don't need to pursue that any further
mr
er john n c p r e
can i just make one suggest suggestion hopefully it's helpful
er the reference to surface water presumably that's a reference to flooding and the need to avoid areas at risk from flooding
erm i ask that as a point of clarification
yes chairman
the conclusions of the national rivers authority erm and the water authority was that er in general terms er the location of a new settlement could have a significant impact er on local land drainage
erm and that really needs to be carefully assessed as one moves towards some conclusions on where that new settlement ought to be
can i just er is that something that perhaps should be explained in the explanatory memorandum with the discussion on this criterion in particular is quite brief
erm peter north yorkshire i think it's appropriately addressed there and i think there are so many elements of it that er i think you w you would end up with perhaps a very long explanatory section
i think the importance of the issue i think is fairly stated there
i think i think we take it as it as it as it at its face value mr
mr
roy house builders federation
i think in assessing this criteria chairman you you've got to make a distinction between the n r a responsibilities and the water company responsibilities
erm i would obviously take very seriously the n r a responsibilities but i think you've got to bear in mind there's within the water act there's a thing called infrastructure charges
yes
and in fact the provision of UNK and er and water supply are a matter of er things which are done on demand and er are covered by infrastructure charges
and the shortage of er UNK as such is not as su as such a criteria to on which to judge the provision of the new settlement because that's part and parcel of the infrastructure that would be provided
yes
six
to avoid the best and most versatile agricultural land etcetera
do we have any UNK voices or comments on that or is it acceptable
how important is it
how UNK
it's a very short comment erm
yes that's alright go on
and but the only comment i'd like to make is that there was a suggestion in i think it was a that the necessity to protect agricultural land had diminished since the food from our own resources and government's policy
i would simply like to point out that the protection of the countryside and agricultural land for its own sake is the policy that should be er applied in this case and i just want to make that point
it doesn't matter whether it's needed or not needed for food production
chairman peter north yorkshire
we have of course proposed a change to this criterion which would effectively UNK the criterion after p g seven
this was in response to requests from
well that's the one i'm reading here
then mr 's not
sorry mr 's yes
well i mean i see six as being quite specific in relation to agricultural land instead of the more general philosophy erm which would probably appear in other parts of the structure plan policies
can we move on to
but
sorry it's all yours
i appreciate you're trying to get on
mr if we have a criterion that says protect the countryside for its own sake and a criterion from our discussion yesterday and somewhere down here in relation to free standing isn't our conclusion that nowhere is acceptable for a new settlement
because by definition it is not related to an existing settlement it is not in the greenbelt it must be in the countryside
so the net effect of your suggested criterion is to get us rather further from a decision than even the chairman and i thought we might be at ten o'clock this morning
yeah joe
well my suggestion was not meant to be UNK er
erm no it y you know where i'm coming from on this the suggestion is that se
yes
that selby is UNK in inverted commas
erm i just don't i simply want to make the point that the protection of the countryside for its own sake is planning policy which must be brought within the of that criterion
but i do realize that it does er have locational implication which possibly we can deal with on tuesday
thank you
michael
as worded i think that criterion six is unrealistic
there's general acceptance and i note the d o e even accepted in their representations that any new settlement around greater york will by the very nature of the character of greater york require taking some best and most versatile agricultural land
the object objective in six should be to minimize the loss of that land and to take the land in the l in the lower grade within the best and most versatile rather than the higher grade
and that of course is exactly what p g seven says
do you want to comment mr
er just very briefly
i've just a quick discussion with mr
er we don't think that er that a new settlement would UNK of necessity er include the best and most versatile land
thank you
thank you
paul planning partnership
and i concur with mr on the point that he made
my concern about this is that i don't see how a view can be taken at a strategic level on something which ultimately can be only UNK on a site specific basis
we cannot rely on the erm land category maps which are produced by the ministry of agriculture for areas i believe of less than forty hectares
erm and i welcome any response of the county council as to how erm they would actually s use this criteria to make a to take a view on the UNK of any location around the er york area
i think we looked to peter north yorkshire
we'd look to advice from the ministry of agriculture on this and their view to m their willingness to make a positive contribution to the development of the e er assessment in terms of the er erm the availability and distribution of the best and most versatile land
i think that'll be the right way to proceed
michael
i think it's a matter of fact that all the schemes i have seen have included an element of best and most versatile land
and then include schemes widely distributed throughout greater york
the difference is in the proportion and type of best and most versatile
and that must be what should be expressed in the criterion
thank you mr
i think there's an opportunity here to bring in to six one of the considerations which occur in paragraph thirty three of p g three namely the reference in the fourth point to the importance of using erm derelict land UNK derelict land
er if that can arise
and one might one might say in six erm perhaps not avoid but minimize the best and most versatile land in accordance with the provisions of p g seven
and UNK where possible derelict land
thank you for that
any more comments on this one or can we move to criterion seven
which at the moment reads be capable of being UNK satisfactorily into the local landscape
is this a strategic matter
what does it mean
does it mean that it is well UNK built of local materials doesn't stick up like a sore thumb
if so are those strategic matters
or does it mean something else
i think chairman peter north yorkshire
er i think there's a need to have a look at erm landscape character er across er greater york on a consistent basis and er there are a number of ways that you could that you could look at this
i suspect there may well be areas in greater york for example which are of high landscape value
er but which because of their erm pattern of tree cover for example may well be able to erm er accept er a new settlement which will UNK reasonably erm er into the er landscape
erm UNK that would suggest that erm you know the one shouldn't automatically er be looking at the areas of low l landscape value
erm UNK i think we would want to look at individual proposals as they as they came forward and see what UNK proposals they have and er how they intend to UNK any perhaps adverse er landscape er implications
i think this is an extremely complicated er issue but i think it's on that needs to be looked at consistently across north yorkshire
but the implication that mr is that this is not a criterion which can effectively be operated at the strategic level
it's a local consideration
well i mean i think the issue UNK around whether landscape in the greater york context in the light of the specific proposal is a is a strategic issue
and i think the need to protect the landscape on a settlement which we propose erm of fourteen hundred dwellings and round about three thousand three hundred people i think is quite a significant and important issue for greater york
yes i'm not i'm not saying that i don't think it's a an important consideration
what i'm trying to get a feel for is the level at which it is a consideration
i would be f very surprised if any of the district councils for example would accept that a new settlement could be UNK down somewhere within their area without consideration of landscape proposals
yes i agree
thank you
mr
paul
paul
you asked the question of what this criterion erm could mean and i'd suggest that it means the following
that the new settlement should UNK the site of er low landscape and UNK value
the development should be capable of being UNK into the natural environment
and the development should be able to show a positive landscape and UNK effect
now i think the landscape issue and by landscape i mean er landscape and UNK is capable of assessment at a strategic level that's why we have er national parks a o n bs and so on
and i think a similar exercise can be undertaken in the greater york area
so in my view it is a relevant consideration at the structure plan level
michael
i tend to agree with on at least on the latter point
the criterion can be applied UNK
erm if there are areas la large areas around greater york particularly to the west of the city which because of their flat open character would not be suitable for a new settlement
there are other areas particularly to i'd accept to either to the south or to the north east where a new settlement could more easily be integrated into the existing landscape framework
and therefore i think it can be applied in a strategic way and therefore is reasonable for inclusion within the structure plan
mr and then mr
ian ryedale district
i would agree with the points made by mr and mr in that it can be a strategic issue
i'm not necessarily in agreement with their conclusions
i think that what is needed for the greater york area is a comparative assessment of the landscape quality and that the criterion should indicate that the settlement should avoid areas of significant landscape value
what mr seems to be directing is that the settlement should be directed to those areas which are at present have pleasant tree cover and things which theoretically can UNK a new settlement which in the context of the vale of york tend to be those areas which are th are of the better landscape quality
by including the words avoiding areas of significant landscape value you are by implication directing it at areas which can be improved by for example a structure plan to increase or improve the landscape value of that area
and i would suggest that the that is putting it within the er remit of paragraph three of p g three that it offers the opportunity to er upgrade areas of low landscape value
thank you for that
mr
i certainly agree that the thoughts of paragraph thirty three should be brought into criterion seven
erm and particularly the conclusion of paragraph thirty three that following the criteria they give the net effect of a new settlement will either enhance the environment or cause only modest environmental impact
that depends where on starts from what the landscape quality is to begin with whether one can bring about an enhancement
and i therefore feel that it is indeed both a strategic and a local consideration
yes
yes i'd accept that
any more comments on this one or can we move to eight
which currently says avoid areas of archaeological and nature conservation interest
mr
joe
i don't regard this as a strategic issue
i think this is a matter for erm local consideration
do you have any view on that one
i don't think i'll go to the wall over eight chairman
thank you
i
sorry
mr n
sorry i can't agree with mr erm planning policy guidance three quite clearly indicates that s i's for example are a strategic matter to be taken into account in UNK new settlements
thank you
number nine
be free standing and well removed from existing settlements thereby UNK any adverse impact on existing settlements
a comment i ha or a question i had was how far is well removed
do you intend to try and define that
i think we'd want to look at it and i think various figures we've talked about certainly as officers whether we ought to try and er quantify that in terms of distance
certainly i think er we'd be looking perhaps for a minimum of er of one mile but i can't advise you on any level of agreement as to as to what any definition of it
i think the i think you will be talking about that sort of order
is this a consideration which helps anybody to decide which district the new settlement should go in
much shaking of heads
gentleman for
mr first
with er this consideration in mind i er put forward erm to you the diagram of settlements round york
because coalescence can be in my view a very important issue in deciding which sectors might well be the id UNK
thank you
er i think i take mr 's point that er you wouldn't go to well a mile it's really going to be horses for courses isn't it
yeah i think we need t i think one really needs to look at this
yes
down on the ground
yes and not a strategic one
or is it
well
in terms of determining location
i think it's an important erm UNK it should be an important requirement th the philosophy behind that er that argument should be pursued that it should be free standing
yeah
thank you mr
er thank you sir terry n selby district
yes i was going to say whilst it's not necessarily a strategic issue there is a reference in the revise p g three to the need to avoid coalescence
which is a very similar wording to the one used and if you do decide er to go forward with this criteria perhaps erm there's scope to introduce the wording avoiding coalescence
yes
michael very briefly
i think that this erm criterion nine relates to is of the type of new settlement rather than helping select the general location
and i would my general thoughts would be that it the word free standing should be actually in included within the UNK to the policy
and it be removed as a criterion
cos it doesn't help select a general location
because almost all general locations round york could be could be fulfilled by that criterion
mhm
thank you
can i move on to ten which no doubt will UNK comment from my left
mr
roy house builders federation
you anticipate me sir
erm yes you you'll know from my evidence that i have certain reservations about the detailed wording of this of this particular criteria
er my main my main concern i is really related to the implication within it that literally every cost which is associated with a new settlement would have to be borne by the developer
so that literally means the developer will pay all the teachers that might be in a school pay all the people to sweep the roads and a and everything else
they would expenses of that nature
that would seem to me to be contrary to government guidance and the wording needs UNK up to reflect that if that is not what is actually meant by the revision and by the wording of the policy
erm a for that reason i have in my evidence UNK some alternative wording to you which is based upon erm a panel report for the nottinghamshire structure plan who considered the issue
thank you
is this a strategic matter
i'm not saying question that this is not an important consideration but does it help us decide where the new settlement should be
right
peter north yorkshire
er i don't think it probably that it does decide help you decide where the location ought to be but that having said that i would not want to minimize in any way er the views of my authority er as to the importance erm of the look of contributions from the private sector
erm obviously you've seen what ro what roy has put in and obviously you'll come to a view on the position
mr
er john c john c p r e
i think erm er certainly the first half of the UNK the criterion is a strategic consideration
erm but within that the phrase the troubles me is self contained
erm particularly your question mr chairman about er the principle against which such a criteria can be can be judged
erm i think we established yesterday or current research suggests that certainly size of fourteen hundred people no way can achieve self containment
erm mr in his closing remarks yesterday afternoon defined a balanced and integrated community
what we haven't yet defined is what we mean by self containment
and the degree to which that is consistent with the sustainable development argument that has been already been put
erm er presumably this is something would have to be UNK in the explanatory memorandum
can you say why you think it would be it is a strategic criterion
if we take a narrow interpretation at least for the moment of strategic means it helps decide where it should go
well that depends on how we define self containment because erm self containment has for example a transport implication
erm if er the extent to which a new settlement would generate new trips and that has a locational implication
i'm not sure we follow that one
well er as i say i think er if the county council are UNK that any new settlement erm should be self contained i think one would need to see what that definition is before we can be clear as to whether or not it has it has strategic implications
cos that for example
but is it not true that wherever it is we're not going to build a wall around it to keep them in
mm
but th
and therefore wherever it is it is going to have transport implications in accordance with its size
but that but that's my point really we it's not really defined what is meant in this criteria by criteria
but
by self containment
if you accept that it doesn't matter where it is it will have transport implications we've already discussed a criterion erm about relating it to transport provision and facilities
how does this criterion help us to decide where it should go
erm well er put like that erm put like that er i suppose it doesn't if one accepts that the traffic and transport erm case is ma is made elsewhere
paul
th this criterion i think is what i would call an operational criteria erm it defines effectively what's going into the new settlement
erm i don't think it UNK at all in terms of location and i think it is a strategic matter however in terms of erm the structure plan and would probably be best incorporated into policy h two in a revised form and i suggested
i believe inevitable later
thank you
mr
erm thank you
roy house builders federation
i'd just like to i don't think this is a strategic matter in the in the terms which you are now defining it and indeed the issue of self containment my understanding is only the universe is self contained
erm but er you'll notice from my wording er revised wording of the policy i seek to define the terms of that self containment by using the words and so the district council will seek to secure land for
mr
david york city council
just a brief comment
erm you'll not be surprised to hear discussing yesterday on the issue of self containment erm i regard this criteria and
would you say that again
if you accepted if you were to accept the issue of self containment we discussed yesterday about the transportation implications of a new settlement of this size
then the inclusion of the word self contained in this criteria within those terms rule out all proposals
you would like high priority therefore attached to
yes i remember we went down a very long UNK de UNK at one stage on self containment didn't we
i think we might need to look at that one very carefully to see whether it adds anything to the er criteria
mr
UNK d o e
just a very brief point sir
th don't want to extend the d debate on this just to point out that paragraphs thirty five and thirty seven p g three both related to local plan policies and not to structure plan
yes
thank you
do you all feel as though you've had your say on that
mr were you going to UNK that
er no sir i'm waiting for the next item
lead on
er terry selby district
er this i matter er item twelve
i thought i'd better get in here first before mr and er michael start UNK pieces of coal at each other
erm i'll be i'll be very brief because i set out selby UNK views in my written UNK submission but basically strict interpretation of this particular criterion would clearly eliminate substantial parts of selby district which is affected by the development of the coal field
now the coal field is a clearly very complex issue but basically it is now becoming clearer that er the life of the UNK will not be as long as originally envisaged
in fact substantial parts of it will be er will not extend beyond the end of the plan period
and al already there are significant areas of that have actually been worked out
so that the constraint wouldn't apply in those areas anyway
er at the very least i wish to see the criteria amended erm and expressed in terms of UNK impact rather er avoiding completely
yes i presume there must be some form of UNK areas laid down by british coal
and equally i presume you've also got some form of mineral protection UNK or aren't they relevant in the context of the area of search
i don't th
in terms of and UNK resources or whatever
er malcolm county council
yes
i just can't get to the reason why you have th this criteria in
well as you know we have very substantial planning permission for the selby UNK which covers
yeah
mm
part of the area that we would be looking at for the new settlement
and i think it is very important if we take into account the potential conflict
now that does not entirely rule out any possibility of the new settlement within the selby area as er mr has implied
that has never been the county council's interpretation of the of the relationship between er this criteria and the selby UNK
nevertheless it is a very clear strategic matter which must be included in my view in the in the criteria included in the structure plan
mr
paul planning partnership
the effect of the selby UNK erm is felt on specific areas of land
and as er mr has pointed out er some parts of the district are not affected at all by this issue other areas have already been worked out
and UNK other areas will be worked out before there is a need to start on site
the UNK which occurs as a result of the mining in any event is very limited and has been able to be taken into account quite adequately on other developments within the selby district
and because this issue is clearly so site related it seems to me it cannot possibly be looked at a strategic level
and the appropriate way in which this matter should be considered is through the local plan when you are considering a much er more limited range of possible sites for the new settlement
and for that reason i believe erm it should be deleted from the locational criteria in terms of the area of search around greater york
can we
michael
i consider that this does assist in general location
quite ob quite obviously cos i say so in my evidence
erm it is a the impact of the new settlement upon the UNK the workings of selby UNK are recognized by british coal
british coal haven't made their position quite clear
they consider that the new settlement should shouldn't be within the wi within areas which would affect their future workings
it's a matter obviously it's a matter of weight to be given to it
but i think that it is a matter which is legitimately it should be legitimately included within the structure plan as an important factor
now obviously the weight we can we can debate on tuesday
mr
no
no
if i could just make one further comment please paul planning partnership
the existence of the selby UNK has not UNK substantial development within selby itself
indeed british coal erm have current proposals to undermine selby town itself
and for that reason i don't believe this is really any form of constraint on new development which could obviously be built with er appropriate foundations to absorb the very slight movement that takes place when UNK occurs
peter north yorkshire
i really don't want to make too much of this chairman
you you're aware of paragraph thirty one of er m p g one
there has been some concern expressed by british coal on this issue
er and it may well be as mr has suggested that when we look at it is not a problem
but i think in fairness to erm complete the picture shall we say i really think we ought to er we ought to be looking at it
but it may well be as mr suggested that er there's l there's gonna be very little difficulty there
thank you
any more comments on that one
we're running slightly behind time but we're doing very well
does anyone have any additional criteria they wish to add
no
can i can i just raise a question er to r to clarify the point before i answer your question that i are am i are we to assume that in response to mr erm it's on the record that there's a er a request to add clear expression of local preference i by local planning authorities
that's his request yes
in that case i don't need to repeat it
thank you
mr
i think that one point er
i think one point is not allowed for in the criteria and that it is of relevance
if the new if the new settlement proves successful it will have an UNK all its own and therefore it will not come to a full stop in two thousand and six
there will be a natural tendency for expansion to occur thereafter
therefore in considering the degree to which any er area can UNK a new settlement the size which it must reach subsequent to two thousand and six should be considered in addition to the size it expected to reach by that date
a valid point mr yes
i'm not sure how we could build it into the criteria of but it's a point which would obviously have to be borne in mind in terms of the UNK you know the planning process
i think peter north yorkshire
i think we talked about this yesterday i think and certainly my view was that th s that a further UNK onto er a new settlement would be one of the options
erm of course two thousand and six is a consideration that we ought to look at once a new settlement UNK identified
er i think i share your view there's some difficulty as to how we would actually accommodate in er in the policy
the implication of that could be one of two ways
either that long term flexibility beyond two thousand and six is a relevant consideration or it is not
and i've lost the second one
it obviously wasn't important
it's getting late
well
ah yes the second point was is that a consideration which is determines location in strategic terms
erm i think i'd support the first point that we we're obviously er all in favour well the county council is certainly in favour of flexibility in terms of addressing the post two thousand er six scenario
one of those options would be a further UNK on the existing erm new settlement
erm i'm not too sure on the second point
my tired brain is trying to work out a response which it's failing to do at the moment
so i don't think i can help you too much on the second one
but in fact it could be looked at in the light of criterion nine which is free standing well removed etcetera
yeah
thereby UNK any adverse impact
yeah
mm
whether it would still continue to be free standing and well removed in terms of a second er second UNK
mr
d o e
er on mr 's point about the preferences of the district councils sir
while that's clearly the most important consideration for each of the districts over the next few months while the selection process is going on er bearing in mind what's said in p g three we regard that as UNK and i find it UNK that the department would allow any new settlement to proceed nowadays without the agreement of the district council
if that is so i would then say that by the time you get to the modification stage and the county council has published a proposal for the general location i therefore think at that stage the need for the criterion has disappeared so it may be that the approved policy will not need to contain such criteria
point taken
mr
paul planning partnership
erm i have one other criteria which i would suggest you'd need to take into account when considering the general location of the new settlement around york and that is to the need to what i term in my er planning submission to plan for success
erm in my view it's crucial that the selection of a general location should be overwhelmed by these technical considerations
it's very important in my view er because the new settlement will be primarily dependant on private sector funding which in itself is dependant on the UNK in land values erm that the area should be one in which developers wish to build
and that obviously creates the UNK in land values which finances the social structure that would be set in terms of the operational criteria for the new settlement
so i think there is a need to plan for a location where this new settlement is going to be successful recognizing that failure to attract appropriate er private sector interest will mean poor quality design and social provision which will obviously UNK from the new settlement as a place to live and also undermine its role in terms of the greater york area
now we have taken advice from several chartered surveyors and indeed the developer of the existing clifton moor industrial estate on this issue
and their very clear view based on their long and practical experience of the greater york development market is that a location south west of york is more likely to be a successful location particularly for the employment component of the new settlement than any other sector of york
and i would ask you to have regard to that erm when you look at the technical criteria which we've spent the last couple of hours looking at
thank you very much we will come back to that on tuesday morning
er thanks for your patience
can i remind you that we'll be looking at er two d on UNK tuesday morning
that'll be starting at ten o'clock
we'll have to conclude at one because the we have another issue in the afternoon
erm if we UNK on tuesday morning then we have spare time in our programme for a week day
erm i just put you on notice about that
i would hope that we might be able to arrange it but obviously if it is er out of the question then we'd have to try to rearrange it some other time
but i hope it might be a UNK to some positive discussion tuesday morning er and UNK absolutely at one o'clock
yeah
the alternative of course is that we could UNK later on tuesday if the hall is available
but er let us see how we go tuesday morning
to put you on your UNK
and can i remind the district planning officers i am looking for a positive contribution from you on tuesday
michael to assist the panel after we received 's paper on the erm coal workings in selby we have act we UNK that over to british coal for their comments
i'm now just got their comments now and it may be helpful if i UNK a copy to er whoever may wish to have a copy to be looked at over the weekend
thank you the good news for you the good news for you is that if we erm run out of time on tuesday morning we can have the hall all night tuesday night
thank you very much have a good weekend
the erm session this morning erm to try to say other than the district council and that is the council what i'd like from if we take for example the low figure thirty one k the county figure and the h b f figure of
what is the for example
i think it should be addressed sir that your UNK is UNK
did you miss the question
i just heard
chairman shall i put my head on head on the block
margaret department of the environment
erm i have to say that these are largely my personal views of the member of the regional office rather than obviously the secretary of state at this stage in the proceedings
but i think if you went for the figure as proposed by the h b f you would be going actively against the regeneration statutory which is the erm the government's policy
if you look at the strategic guidance for west and south yorkshire and i fully admit that we still have to see the erm the colour of regional guidance
but the strategic guidance for those two counties very firmly puts economic regeneration at the head of the list of objectives
i think if you let development rip for the want of a better word in north yorkshire as i suggest the house builders federation would do then it would be active acting against the regeneration strategy
as for the figure proposed erm by samuel UNK representative
i think probably that is at completely the other end of the spectrum and would be UNK the natural growth in north yorkshire and what you would be doing then is acting against the erm the UNK the existing UNK of north yorkshire because you would probably be forcing them out of their county
i would therefore go for as you well know in our figure somewhere around the middle line
do you difference between your figure and that of the county council is critical in anyway
i think our figure gives a rather more measure of flexibility than does that of the county council
setting aside the exact figures chair i think leeds position is that left late at the UNK set down by r p g two erm our members are the city council's UNK the UNK of UNK the level of accommodation that implies
it would make very significant UNK into our much against our wishes to accommodate that so that we would be looking to north yorkshire to and work to the same levels of migration the trend in migration as it were
obviously a figure higher than that would take some pressure of us to make those UNK into the green belt a lower figure UNK would require us to make higher la larger UNK into our greenbelt
so we're looking for north yorkshire to play to the same rules basically
you have already erm done it going into the greenbelt
am i right in thinking that you wouldn't want to go on with these UNK
that's right our position is that we've already erm UNK affected our environment if you like as and the balanced er approach respectively needs to meet housing requirements
erm but we've gone as far as we feel we need to
erm other people should have to make the same UNK
but what are you saying about
i'm not making any comment on specific figures
i'd like you to
well i can i decline the invitation
i don't have a an answer an arithmetic answer
i think a figure was quoted earlier i UNK read the of the with migration estimate for north yorkshire
with that was a hundred percent a hundred percent migration
k was the figure
right
which is very similar to your colleague on the right
well a all i'm saying chair is that the principle of the calculation is what i'm pleading on behalf on behalf of the city council to be met
mr
er yes bill bradford council
erm bradford and leeds have er adopted a similar approach in their representations to er yourselves and certainly er i did not come here to take a er a part in the debate over specific figures
er we er accepted the county councils er sets of figures where we took issue with them is erm the failure to take account of one hundred percent inward migration trends
not what that figure is or what period it would be
but that percentage figure
erm er on that basis erm we would and even allowing for even allowing for a dense movement from bradford to north yorkshire erm we as it said in our statements are happy that movement will not UNK urban regeneration in the urban area of the bradford metropolitan district
we refer too er in our statement er an absolute release figure of hectares in the greenbelt and that is a percentage of our new housing allocations
in addition to that it might interest you to know that er in excess of a further one hundred and sixty hectares of land is in our u d deposit version u d p proposed to be released on UNK sites on the edge of the built up areas
and that is in excess of fifty percent of the new housing allocation
erm we in our recommendation to you have suggested a figure of forty six thousand two hundred
which is would give you county council
er su suffice we didn't want to get into too much of a discussion about numbers
if you the trends then er going on to the going on to the house builders federation figures that would not cause us to release more land within the greenbelt as would the lower figure of the county council based on seventy five percent inward migration
and by implication the thirty nine thousand figure
erm certainly the low figure would cause us tremendous problems er environmental problems of our own
erm forty six thousand figure we feel is acceptable in that we still have to make environmental releases in the greenbelt but erm the net outward movement would not UNK our urban regeneration
erm the higher figure would obviously lead to bring into question something that er miss has mentioned about er urban regeneration
erm i think erm both the low and the high figures would cause us problems and that is why we have accepted the county council's figures based on continuation of past trends migration trends which as my colleague from leeds has pointed out earlier we are obliged to do and are continuing to do in following from r p g two in our UNK of the
i think it maybe has to be said that we picked these figures not because we wanted to talk about the figures but simply to use them as for you to hang on to
mr
yes roy house builders federation
erm naturally enough you wouldn't expect me to agree with miss that erm the figures that we've put forward are against the regeneration strategy
it's certainly true i don't think that we're letting development rip
however erm one thing i think that's got to be borne in mind and it picks up a point that erm leeds have made is that they're looking towards UNK migration they say
with their balance of things
it has to be said that the current u d p of leeds makes er an a an allowance of migration of net out migration of just over about nine thousand three hundred per five year period
that's embodied within the plan
if you look at the revised mid year estimate the figure there if we're keeping things in balance between county and leeds is six thousand two hundred and fifty net out migration
so there's if we're keeping things in balance there's three thousand people per five year period got to go somewhere
now if on the same basis you at the same time reduce the amount that the county's taking in that UNK that particular group
and indeed i would submit that leeds would find it difficult to actually accommodate the migration assumption which is w would be implied by sticking to the revised plan mid year estimate figure
i think that they would find it quite difficult to actually do that er without very many UNK into the greenbelt
bradford the position is not quite so UNK
but nevertheless they're very much as i see it on the border
er and the their u d p's just on deposit so got to go into it in a bit more detail yet
but it would seem to me that er there may be a marginal UNK in bradford on the basis of the current u d p and that is assuming that we have the same balance between bradford and between north yorkshire as i am implying from my particular figures
erm i see nothing in the current bradford u d p which suggests that they aren't erm UNK on urban regeneration that they're doing they're doing exactly that
and so i would say that the whole thing the figures that i'm proposing er and the consequences for both leeds and bradford er would be in fact to maintain a balanced strategy for urban regeneration
and it does seem to me that erm i can't quite understand why it's possible or it seems to be an argument that you can accommodate a bit more development squash a bit development into leeds and bradford and it doesn't matter very much
but you can not accommodate more development in north yorkshire
those two things to me don't seem to be compatible
certainly i think we're in very great danger of leeds bradford if we start pushing things a great deal more
erm it is part of our strategy of course erm that we are not er pursuing a hundred percent migration
so we are assuming a little bit more bradford and leeds but not erm la particularly large amounts
do you do you want to comment on the lowest figure
well the lowest figure erm we've already got a level of commitment we have to have three thousand de allocations if that was the case that does not seem to me to be correct
no
what happens to the housing market people if
erm that i think relates to i think there are two important points t to make here in relation to forty one thousand
erm i said some the this morning that in fact i think there would be serious affordable UNK affordable housing problems er associated with that figure
and i think also we shouldn't UNK the em employment in leeds that would be related to that
not only employment in terms of the relationship between proposed industrial allocations and housing allocations but the UNK employment er problems of the construction industry as well
it's interesting that no other than tony m p secretary of state speaking at the conference building on success said that the erm construction industry accounts for a tenth of our national g d p
er the industry is responsible for half our fixed investment and accounts for a third of our manufacturing base
it is therefore a critical component of our national economy and its good health is essential to our recovery from the UNK
i will take it from that you play with it at this stage er of a recovery
erm and erm i don't think that on the to go on about affordable housing as i did this morning i don't think that in fact the affordable housing targets which the different authorities have and although i've only quoted four authorities i think i think the other ones will be very much the same
i don't think that erm it will be possible to meet those affordable targets on the lower numbers
that simply people will miss out
they are not the only people who'll miss out there'll be people at the lower end of the housing market who could afford to buy
well if you take the figures that it depends where they are to some extent
i'm sorry
yeah
on the affordable housing front
or any other front
any UNK any other front
a on the general issue
but erm er on the figures that i've submitted erm we've already got three of those five districts have got s fairly high affordable housing percentage requirements
and with ryedale still at thirty eight percent these are on my figures
scarborough twenty one percent probably getting towards okay
and york at twenty five percent
so meeting halfway meeting that halfway house figure i think erm would only seek to push up those figures
and you would only you yes you'd meet more of the affordable requirement no doubt than you would at the lower figures but in my view you'd still be left with some fairly substantial problems in particular areas
what housing effects of the housing market
you concentrated on
well in some ways erm i've covered er some of that point by referring to the to the importance of the construction industry
we have been and some would still have us believe i think it's true we're not out of the woods yet as far as er recovery of the housing market is concerned
er we've been in the longest recession in the housing market i think in memory
i think if not ever
erm and there is still a need to supply houses to meet the needs of household formation
in the meanwhile while houses have not been built people still go on forming households
and there is out there i'm very sure a great un met demand
erm and if there is an UNK a serious UNK then sections of the market are bound to miss out
erm whether that's just affordable or whatever
and the ma market will become targeted to particular sectors and particular groups
and one effect of the recession has been i've got to say that a lot of the old that er house builders have operated on which are good for selling which sites will sell well etcetera a lot of those rules have been out of the window
there's a great air of uncertainty and erm we have to be very cautious about proposing housing numbers which mean there'll be very few new sites which will be the implication of forty one thousand two hundred
there'll be very few new sites being formed the inevitable consequence of that will be to push land prices up
land prices are already rising at the moment er in this region even though house prices are not rising at a UNK level
and so that will have its effect in the UNK of time
and certainly if you keep housing numbers in short supply the only effect will be to push land prices even higher
thank you sir stephen from
i think our view of the effects of numbers significantly lower than the ones that we've put to you is first of all that there are a number of factors which planning cannot influence and will not influence
and i would include in those the vacancy issue that we discussed this morning so there will be more vacant dwellings whether it's a percent of thirty thousand or fifty thousand
there is the improvement in mortality
i don't think planning has any influence or would wish to have any influence on that
there is the tendency towards higher UNK rates and more household formation
and i don't think planning will have much influence on that
so with one UNK i would say that households will form whatever number of dwellings you write into the structure plan those households will form in north yorkshire
so if they don't have sufficient dwellings to meet the requirements two things and i would expect them both two things would happen
first of all and i put this purely in order of er semantics rather than priority
first of all i don't think local needs would be fully met as you know i think very often the migrants are able to UNK local households in the market so i don't think local needs will be fully met
and indeed in terms of the low figure of thirty one thousand it it's UNK that no local needs would be met
but i think the way that would occur would be first of all i would expect to see an increase a UNK increase than is already project i should say in concealed households
i would also expect to see as a result of local UNK more sharing of dwellings by households who have formed not the same of concealed households who haven't succeeded in
and i should say on that topic that we looked prior to this e i p at the implications for sharing of the paper that er miss put before you in her personal capacity
and our best interpretation as far as we could tell from that of course that was that the implied increase in sharing because sh assumes that households with dwelling was about between four and five times the present sorry nineteen ninety one level share in the county
and to give you a measure of what that would mean it would be a return to the conditions of the late forties early fifties as regards sharing in north yorkshire is concerned
so there is a very considerable backward step
and that will be one of the implication lower figures
but that local needs heading is one heading the other heading which i think would be UNK is erm on migration
i would expect to see the lower figures resulting in as indeed they themselves imply lower migration movements to north yorkshire and indeed i think the figures from er might end up by the end of the period as net outward movement from north yorkshire to be achieved given the level of commitments we have up front
and if we look at the implications er west yorkshire which were touched on in the beginning of this part of the debate
it seems to me UNK that one of the consequences would be to take more greenbelt land in west yorkshire
and in that sense the choice at this e i p is whether to use greenbelt in west yorkshire or non greenbelt in north yorkshire
and i think to an extent those two are two ends of the UNK and is a straight er choice that has to be made
you'll not be surprised to find that in terms of national policy i would have thought that was very clear if you were given that choice what the policy should be
i'm not aware that it's national policy that greenbelt should be used for the sake of urban regeneration
i think that i would see the consequences of the lower figures as being UNK
severe impact on local need and also substantial impact on migration with particular in west yorkshire
erm s several points i'd like to make
er it's been suggested by mr from the h b f that as i understand his suggestion that a lower provision of housing land in some way affects UNK or affects the er access to housing for the lower se lower ends of the lower income households
erm there is no evidence well i've seen no evidence first of all to UNK that claim and in my opinion all the evidence suggests that the key UNK of house prices and therefore land prices is the ration of income to the price of the property
and in fact housing is more affordable now than it has been for twenty five or thirty years
when we are in as mr himself agrees the worst housing recession probably this century
so i would seriously question that you can make the sort of relationship that is suggested here between UNK and increasing the numbers
i don't think the link is proven and i would certainly like to see evidence to UNK that suggestion
getting back to the numbers mr says that if the number suggested by ourselves through our client of thirty one k were er UNK to that it may well reduce the ability completely of locals to gain access to the housing market
well i think the figures agree that the requirement for local need is sixteen thousand five hundred about half the thirty one k suggestion
and again there is a suggestion put forward to support this theory that local people won't have access to housing and the suggestion is that ou that migrants have the ability to UNK locals
well i have no see no evidence for that suggestion and i think if the panel are going to accept this suggestion then evidence or some sort of information should be put forward to back it because i don't accept that it's necessarily the case
erm the beginning and the end of this argument is about migration
there is enough land to provide for local needs more than twice enough
it's about pr p provision for migration and what the policy should be for that
and that brings me to the point that was made er by mr and others on the other side of the table that the structure plan does have a policy of a continued reduction in migration
that is a policy of the approved structure plan
we're not talking about reviewing the structure plan we're talking about an alteration to it
and there is no s support round the table so far for the h b f figure of fifty three k
as i understand the leeds position they want what they call a UNK a level playing field or to be aiming at the same UNK that they've been aiming at for the last number of years
but that would only support forty six thousand two hundred
which is the north yorkshire structure plan UNK figure
so with those erm policy points and those questions about the ab ability of migrants to UNK locals and the ac housing access issue i would erm suggest that if they're to be accepted by the panel then more information is
what do you feel indicates the county council's proposals
erm the figure the county council have proposed in my opinion doesn't achieve a sufficient level of reduction
it goes in the right direction in so far as it does aim to re to continue to reduction in migration but it doesn't go far enough
and i take the view that the unity development plans for leeds and bradford do tend to me to suggest that there is the ability to meet an increasing amount of need in within their own areas and that should be reflected in a continually reducing er export if i can call it that to north yorkshire and this morning we heard from cleveland that cleveland are making UNK efforts to er to er retain their economic er viability by retaining their population
so i would say that the north yorkshire er figure in summary goes in the right direction but not far enough
what is it that happens on the ground that in your view makes it not far enough
the release of green fields in yorkshire for UNK when that l that housing could be provided by urban regeneration in the adjoining metropolitan areas
and to my mind that is a fundamentally UNK planning strategy
the release the release of green fields should only happen when there is no other solution
and here we have a county which is taking sixty percent of its housing requirement from outside its boundaries
when i am not convinced that those er the areas outside those boundaries which are in dire need of urban regeneration could not accommodate a greater proportion over the planned period
bearing in mind bearing in mind mr 's assessment of how do you assess the realistic chance of actually
i don't think you i don't think you will be able to stop at that figure i think that the allocation should stop at that figure but there will be windfalls and there will be other er recycling of land that will take place that isn't already allocated
and it comes back to my point about the allocation of green fields and the there should be no more of that because there's already enough allocated
but i wouldn't for one moment suggest to the panel that windfalls and recycling of land shouldn't continue to take place
but if you UNK land already used by housing you don't necessarily get any more or any fewer dwellings
yes but you tend not to get recycling of housing land of housing you tend to get recycling of housing land new housing land from UNK industries UNK use that type of erm recycling is just what i had in mind
and that's what tends to happen
it's unusual these days bearing in mind the government advice on planning policies for existing housing to be UNK
unless of course it's er high rise housing in urban areas and of course in that in those UNK you do get a big reductions in the number of
pitched at twenty one thousand could
means that provision has to be
no because section fifty four a and all section fifty four a says is that a decision should be made on a planning application in accordance with the development plan
if the development plan said thou UNK not develop that green field if it was not allocated in the development plan then section fifty four a would er would work very well
erm and of course section fifty four a does admit or taking into UNK taking into account other material considerations
erm for example i have been involved in a site in north yorkshire er where it is proposed to build a hundred and sixty houses in tadcaster
and the provision for the county is well over the allocations in the structure plan already but the county council sent observations to the district council to say we're not going to object to this particular er windfall site coming forward for a hundred and sixty houses because it's recycling existing urban land and in that case we can set the policy to one side
so there is the ability to set policy to one side of the circumstances dictate
sorry could you that again
what do you think that does for
i think the credibility of the planning system is enhanced by the fact that decisions can be made on individual circumstances
that policy isn't a UNK
it's UNK i planning is now policy led yes but er planning isn't a UNK to policy
if policy can be set to one side then it is set to one side and i think it UNK the reputation of the system
michael and partners
i think my first point is that the answer to your question depends to some extent on what population what demographic forecasts prove to be most likely
because the f the county's forty one thousand figure i i'll give you a different answer on th on the effect of that if the h b UNK forecasts are the most accurate
so it's i'm taking the question in that light
if the bottom end of the population projections are implemented in terms of planning requirement
if the planning if the requirements fall much below the demographic requirements the implication is that migration could be controlled but it may be controlled by a mechanism which i don't think anybody really wants and that's by UNK out migration in north yorkshire
because you are talking about net migration flows
to increase out migration will UNK erm encourage those people least able to compete probably the younger section the seventeen to twenty ei twenty four year age group which we already know are there's a net out migration flow
we'd encourage those to leave the county
obviously the housing requirements should not be such as to generate harm to environmental interests
we've heard in introduction mr say that the county council would not like to see housing requirements any lower than they have proposed
i take i take that to be that is the bottom end of a of a range
cos i think there must be a range
the question of the relationship with other areas in the adjoining counties
i think that is more a question of distribution within districts than overall district levels
harrogate and hambleton for instance are large districts they extend many miles from north to south development concentrated around the metropolitan areas will draw out UNK
but there is a strict limit to the distance well not a strict limit but commuting is sensitive to distance
so UNK in central and southern hambleton would not have an effect on cleveland
the in fact looking at UNK figures one can see that it's only really it's only really the top north west i'm sorry the top north east
erm UNK rugby area that does prove attractive to communities
and i don't think the i don't think the overall scale of that issue is one which needs to reduce the strategic requirement on hambleton
that can be dealt with at a local plan level by distribution within the district
the same applies much to harrogate as well
you're effectively saying that
yes
mr
yes thank you sir
er just a points er i think it you probably had this point clear in your mind anyway but there are different rules that apply as between west yorkshire and cleveland
north yorkshire
one area's in need of urban regeneration and pressing for growth and one area's subject to a policy of restraint
so i don't think it's a case of UNK and UNK i think it's a case of UNK between the different strategic policies that apply
erm i think this whole issue is going to boil down to the your assumptions on migration
if one goes to answer your question to the top end of the range being put before you the effect will be to release probably more than a thousand acres of UNK land er for housing development purposes
and that i would suggest is not a policy that's consistent er for that with UNK restraint
erm you will also in going for the higher end of the range er be UNK the urban regeneration objectives of those neighbouring districts
erm there are two further points that commit discussion just taking place
and one is about the effect of the reduction of a s the migration assumptions
it clearly will not take immediate effect there is a lot of housing allocations and UNK in the pipeline as it were so it will take some while for it to wash through the system
er my final point sir is concern with perhaps a few emotional points being made to my right about the old and the UNK and the young not being able to afford houses
erm this county council is proposing to allocate significantly more housing for in migrants than for local needs
er which in my view is quite a UNK
erm there are other policies in any event which one can use at local and structure plan level to secure social housing provision if it's required
but i would also like to pick up the point that mr said there is no evidence to suggest there's a massive problem of the local residents of north yorkshire er not being able to compete with people in other counties to the north and to the west
er there's with no evidence of an UNK my suggestion is that the decision you must be taking is to what degree do you assume er to what degree do you er recommend a reduction in migration rates
and i would suggest sir that somewhere between the lower end of the figures cooked on my left here and the county council's figures
so i feel the county council haven't sufficient reflected in their assumption on migration rates the degree of reductions required to obtain that balance between er preserving their strategic policies of restraint and UNK erm the urban regeneration policies in neighbouring areas
can i the h b f
h b UNK assessment that there are about thirty one thousand dwellings already committed in one way or another in the system
i haven't looked at the details of those figures but are there predominantly be provided in the first ten years of the structure plan
the implication of any figure indeed the county council's figure for the last five years of the structure plan could be UNK as putting the brakes on so hard that the passengers all fall off the train
i'm being UNK
mr is that not the case
i think probably the county council are in a better position than me er to advise you as to whether that thirty one thousand commitment figure is true of not but if it were the case then i think yes i would agree that erm the train would stop very quickly and in view of the situation that we're now in there would have to be a degree of future flexibility to allow for UNK reduction in development over future years
but i do not believe that one goes as far as going to the figure that the county council is proposing
i would like to have a check of that commitments figure
er the county council's given us a figure of roughly about twenty five twenty six thousand
well i mean
that still puts the brakes on pretty hard doesn't it if you stick it in a figure less than thirty one thousand in the last five years
well it's a question of balance i the forty one thousand figure in my view should come down by a few thousand to reflect constraints in specific areas i won't go into that now cos it's a separate discussion later on
but i believe the figure should be erm a few thousand below erm the forty one thousand and to that extent i would agree with you that in practical terms erm it's going to be very difficult even if the figure is twenty five twenty six thousand to stick to thirty one
but there is a question there is a p another point here that having got to the position we're in erm does it how much are we going to be affected by the extent of the commitments
how much are we going to e judging what the true policy should be and how much are we going to be affected by those commitments figures
erm if the if the figure were for example forty one thousand er would you still say that there should we'd be putting the brakes on the train on too hard
i let's say there are forty five thousand yet the figures are forty one thousand well where does one stop
how far are we going to be driven by commitments
i interpret commitments as being UNK and therefore they're going to happen
i think the question remains or that my doubts remain that there will be a level of there will that one can assume a level of commitments which would be it would be sensible to try and draw back from or phase over a longer period of time
it may not be possible to phase
mm
well i have taken your point i think thirty one UNK too is too small
mr do you want to come in at this stage
peter north yorkshire county council
i think the position on residential land supply in the county is set out in er n y four paragraphs thirty five to thirty seven
and in general terms they're something of the order of twenty five and a half thousand UNK committed to development in the county together with three and a half thousand erm in draft local plans
our experience generally in north UNK been over the last ten years that overall there have been exceptions but generally overall there's not been a problem about local plans drying up and then allocations drying up over the period generally
there have been problems with one or two areas but it hasn't been a general problem
in paragraph thirty five er three the sites allocated in adopted local plans and of course a number of those will be with us and available UNK the back end erm of the local plan er program
so we're talking there for about something of the order of twenty nine thousand develop erm dwellings committed in one form or other er in north yorkshire
mr i think suggested that er on the basis of the level of commitment in north yorkshire when he looked at the county council's forty one thousand that no new sites will come forward well quite clearly that's not going to be the case there is a substantial residue er which are going to come forward
can i make some general comments on the three UNK that you that you put to us
well i was just wondering whether i could reserve that for sort of summing up
right
certainly that that's fine
but can i can i just come back to the point that if you were taking the lowest figure i mean how realistic is it to assume that you could actually hold to that
well if you're asking
my interpretations on the
mm
on the light of the commitments of which a substantial amount are act actually planning permission and some four thousand odd will actually have been built since ninety one
mm
then you it'll be extremely difficult
the county council
you don't have to do it now
yeah
the county council if we're talking about mr 's erm strategy the county council would have severe reservations about going down towards thirty one thousand dwellings we've got twenty nine thousand dwellings erm already committed er i think it would create difficulties over the period that the structure plan er would run would create undue tension certainly in er in settlements across north yorkshire on the basis of seeing an absence of land being allocated
er i don't think thirty one thousand is a practical proposition for north yorkshire
though i have no instruction on that but almost certainly that would be the view of my council
yeah thank you
mr do you want to come back on that
er yes roy house UNK federation
i'd just like to pick up the point that's been made twice that there's no such thing as an affordable housing problem
what was p g three revised all about if it wasn't about er the issue of affordable housing
and no less a light than sir george young actually said that the provision of affordable housing is one of the challenges of the nineties and we are serious about rising to this challenge
and very much more recently lord UNK who is the chairman of the rural development commission and this he said actually on the sixteenth of november this year said there is a severe lack of affordable housing in the countryside which obviously doesn't improve the situation
the biggest problem tends to be with young people they will either go to live with someone else or move from the countryside altogether
now there we have some fairly UNK people recognizing that there is such a thing as an affordable housing problem
yes houses have never been so affordable but confidence equally has never been so low
and in this particular county one has only got to look to ryedale who s i so far as i know is the only authority to have carried out a comprehensive survey of local housing needs
and there they have identified after commitments some five hundred affordable housing requirements
that's taking away all the commitments
now it seems to me obvious that there is such a problem er and to deny it seems to me to be to be denying the obvious
erm the planning system as now conceived works it's intended as far as i am aware to work on the basis of certainty
if we have such a low requirement that it can be met from windfalls small sites and recycling land above commitments then that is not certainty that is uncertainty and that is not in my UNK the basis on which the planning system is meant to operate on so that people can invest with confidence
mr
yes thanks stephen
brief comment
it seems to me from what mr in particular said that the bottom as it were has dropped out of the market to this extent that it seems that the policy that he's advocating is not thirty one thousand any more but thirty one thousand plus any amount of windfalls and recycling
and a somewhat open ended number
but i would caution you UNK you be tempted to take that up against putting forward any number whatever it be and saying that er windfalls and recycling shouldn't count against that number but should be regarded as a bonus
i and i UNK others round this table have experience of other counties who've adopted that approach or other panels who've adopted that approach and it creates endless problems and endless appeals debating what is a windfall and what should be in the plan and what should be not
but if mr 's argument is that windfalls and recycled land are as it were free of any environmental UNK and can be added to his thirty one thousand then i think that er the way to treat that is to come to a higher number which takes them properly into account
mr
erm to deal with mr 's point about denying a problem of affordable housing i think er he mustn't have heard what i said properly because i've never sought to deny that there's a ho a problem of access to housing
there is a problem of access to affordable housing all i'm saying is that you don't solve it by wholesale allocation of land
you don't solve one problem by creating another
the as mr er said the way to solve the access to housing problem is through the planning er through local plans and through affordable housing policies which are now UNK in p g three and can deal with that problem quite satisfactorily
so i don't deny a an access to UNK or an affordable housing problem quite the contrary but i say it is a policy which is a it is a problem capable of solution by local plan policy not by wholesale allocation of land as he UNK
miss
if i could just make a point about affordable housing chairman of course the department recognizes that there is a problem of affordable housing as UNK by minister's statements but the view of my policy colleagues in headquarters is that this is most appropriately addresses in district wide plans and not necessarily at structure plan level
sorry
can i go back to what miss has just said
surely that's in terms of where and how it is provided
whereas what we're talking about in the structure plan is how much housing in total of which affordable housing will form a greater or lesser part
that's right but we would expect it to be UNK in the numbers of overall requirements for housing
yeah
do you want to comment on what five thousand less than your figure would do for affordable housing
i think as i said before it would UNK the erm the measure of flexibility
exactly which way it would affect it whether it would be affordable housing or any other sort of housing is a matter for debate
mr sorry i you may want to comment in fact about the relationship of these figures and the emerging policy in cleveland
mr chairman i feel a bit like an aircraft that's to come down to leeds er bradford airport rather than UNK at the present moment
er i think most of the problem is probably in the leeds bradford er harrogate area rather than our own area of cleveland
erm we have er approved regional planning guidance published september nineteen ninety three which takes the allocations for cleveland area through till two thousand and six at er fourteen thousand
we have er sufficient land available for development in cleveland er for eighteen thousand two hundred and thirteen dwellings
er we have er inherited a problem of over UNK perhaps in the seventies with our first structure plans in the sense that the er employment was forecast to be much higher at that time
we have experienced quite considerable out migration er in the period since and we do build in perhaps slightly optimistic erm migration net migration figures compared to the er o p c s er and d o e figures but they are nevertheless accepted as part of this forecast the regional guidance on the basis that we have a major regeneration problem in the area to reiterate what i said this morning
erm we are in the current process of reviewing our own or altering our own structure plan the first alter alteration is going through consultation at the present moment and we're UNK a need within that period of actually fifteen thousand which is marginally above the regional planning guidance
erm looking at the figures of migration between cleveland and north yorkshire i received yesterday some figures which are quite interesting in this respect
erm perhaps if you've got a pencil handy here
erm the n the net movements between cleveland and north yorkshire as a whole have been respectively for nineteen eighty eight four hundred and fifty five persons for nineteen eighty nine two hundred and twenty nine persons er for nineteen ninety two hundred and forty persons nineteen ninety one three hundred and thirty seven persons and for nineteen ninety three because i missed the figures for ninety two for some reason they're not there er five hundred and ninety nine
erm this gives an average over say a five year period of about a hundred and forty nine dwellings per annum if you if you divide that by the household er estimate of something like two point five household size which is the current sort of level in cleveland
erm looking interestingly enough at the hambleton figures of i understand these are new purchases which is a bit surprising perhaps but over a two year period there erm this is table three in UNK submission there's a reference to the number of erm the origin of house purchases from cleveland in hambleton and it would be seen from there that cleveland erm produced a hundred and fourteen dwellings that's purchases of cleveland residents in the hambleton area erm in nineteen ninety one to ninety three
that's over a two year period
and er a hundred and seventy one overall in hambleton
er sorry a hundred and fourteen in UNK a hundred and seventy one overall in hambleton
which is quite an interesting comparison to make with our own out migration figures
erm we have er land in the sort of places which compete with UNK although we don't have quite the rural environment except as was mentioned at UNK
erm we aim to get as much development in our area as possible and coming back to your first question this afternoon i don't really se any problem with the north yorkshire proposals that's the middle range
erm i do see there would be problems if there's a lot of land released in the northern part of north yorkshire and hambleton in terms of our meeting our own objectives
much of the growth that you see reflected in these figures is probably old commitments
and hambleton are being more UNK as i said earlier is appropriate to our own policy
er our only problem is that some of our housing is concentrated in rather large blocks and that does put pressure looking for v UNK variety of sites in the county and we are erm getting a lot of objection for some potential development sites in our area at the present moment
but i don't see any problem from the figures i've given you in handling any of those forecasts really when you're talking about a very small proportion in our part of the world compared to the probably the figures that you're talking about around er leeds bradford harrogate
i think i'll leave it at that for the moment
yeah
er i know you're submission was very clear in the sense that you said that you said that the figure proposed by north yorkshire was would create no problems
yes
mr
just a very brief comment perhaps summing up the and commenting on the various contributions that we've heard so far
erm i won't really comment on in any detail on the forty one thousand figure because it's ours and i think we put sufficient justification in for it
other than to say i've already mentioned er in respect of mr 's point about his view that no new sites would come forward at forty one thousand well quite clearly a substantial number of new sites in the residue will come forward these will be new sites
a more general point on the forty one thousand again from mr and mr is one i will describe as the er the UNK scenario which is usually UNK out at er at debates such as this erm the effects on affordable housing er and low cost housing
we heard it in nineteen eighty and we heard it again in nineteen eighty seven in UNK of the house builders UNK er views
it wasn't accepted then er and we hope er that it won't be accepted now because the county council thinks that with the level of provision for migration development er there is sufficient flexibility within its policy
commenting on the thirty one thousand er mr 's erm er scenario that the county council would clearly think this to be erm unreasonable it would clearly have regional implications er as i said earlier er in my opening remarks er the county council would accept that it wouldn't be meeting its regional commitments erm er it would be difficult in practice bearing in mind the level erm of commitment we've got and there may well be local problems in local housing markets with the level of er of growth er at that level
as far as the h b UNK concerned this would probably lead to an increase in the building rates above the approved plan of around about fifteen percent
erm i think that in the same way as if we went down too low could be considered to be er a change of strategy and i think what we're about is to try and reflect the currently er approved structure plan strategy
erm i think there would be environmental problems i think there would be major problems of sustainability because quite clearly er scale migration into north yorkshire would be UNK in significant past by back out er of north yorkshire particularly to cleveland er and to west yorkshire
mobility in north yorkshire is increasing dramatically has increased dramatically over the last ten years and i think there are sustainability arguments against a level erm of provision at fifty er around that level
erm and a i think quite clearly there would be a conflict with what appears to be currently extent government policy to UNK er the metropolitan areas of cleveland erm and west yorkshire
we think the forty one thousand dwellings give sufficient flexibility erm i it will ensure a substantial continuing house building sector in north yorkshire and i think it UNK environmental requirements with er the with our wider responsibilities
thank you very much
mr
yeah my point is a brief one and i it's coming back to the question of commitments that was discussed earlier
er and er the point was r raised in relation to erm the thirty one thousand figure that w er you're virtually at that erm commitment level already
that seems to me to be slightly back to front as a justification for increasing the figures
erm in that er surely the response to that should be well one should m more adequately er control phasing
erm and a point was raised in our evidence given the existing UNK of structure plan figures erm the county wide the figures have UNK the agreed structure plan figures that should focus attention surely on the need to more closely control the release of the committed land erm er that is currently without planning permission through the development control process
i think w what i'd urge the panel to consider is perhaps looking at it from that perspective to encourage the county council to review the phasing provision of policy h one erm in terms of er how the committed land is going to be released for development
mr
sorry
sorry pick it up
can i ask mr to clarify points that you're making is you would like h one to be UNK
the there is in policy h one as proposed at the moment a the last sentence refers to the issue of phasing
erm but the point i'm making is that existing figures erm for the existing sorry the figures for the existing structure plan indicate that there's been an UNK on agreed figures
and that to me is indicative albeit er in a small way of a failure to adequately phase the release of land albeit that the figures i accept are relatively small
erm logic suggests surely that erm one should concentrate on the UNK of the phasing er the existing phasing mechanism and the words within policy h one and the guidance that the county is giving to the to the district authorities in how they should phase the release of the committed land
erm and i think that is i think you'll agree that's looking at the problem from s from the other side
er and not saying that well because erm twenty nine thousand er dwellings are already committed we've therefore got to we've therefore got to provide more because that will be eaten up fairly quickly
er that to me suggests that one should focus attention on the phasing mechanisms for the release of that land
i understand that's the point you're making
what i'm not clear about is whether you are suggesting that the panel make some strong comments in their report to the county council on the need for appropriate phasing or whether the panel should recommend that policy h one be divided into phasing periods
erm i think i think what i'm suggesting is that the that the panel should er advise the county council as to how they should address the phasing issue
whether that is done erm well i don't have an immediate solution as to what the way in which you may wish to advise the county council on how to do that
what i'm suggesting is that is perhaps something that the panel should dwell on in their deliberations and their advice to the county
so i think it is an issue that perhaps hasn't been addressed in our discussions erm UNK and seems to me from past evidence to UNK to be an issue that does need to be to be looked at
i see my UNK miss to pick up her name
not to wave it about
erm can i ask miss your view on phasing the structure plan
as i'm sure you probably know better than me miss the department UNK hot and cold
on phasing
phasing is currently an in word
again my personal view is that i think phasing has got a lot a lot going for it but i do not know how you could phase current commitments because after all those are on the table now
the wind is warm this week
mr
thank you
roy house builders federation
erm a few comments i'd like to start with cleveland and the erm the idea that there's no problem whatsoever in UNK erm the UNK if i can put it that way or the retention within cleveland
as i understand it the cleveland structure plan proposes the same number of dwellings for erm its next period which happens to be fourteen years as it did for the last fourteen of the of the previous structure plan fifteen thousand seven hundred
but it's interesting that the distribution of those dwellings is very different
and on the new proposal the distribution favours UNK as opposed to UNK on UNK
and erm i would suggest that additional UNK of UNK will do nothing whatsoever for the relationship with north yorkshire
and in fact UNK is much more related to durham than it is to er north yorkshire
erm mr mentioned the issue of building rates and that the proposal by the h b f would be in excess of the building rates
well yes of course it would i submit to you that building rates are in that context are an UNK because erm all that building rates tell you is what's been built in the past
they don't tell you anything about what's needed in the future
i'll come back to the issue of sustainability i think under one b when we get to individual districts but it does seem to me it's rather UNK
and then mr then erm dismissed my concerns for affordable supply in that it had all been said before
i wasn't aware that in nineteen eighty and nineteen eighty seven the government had the same policies it does now
and one of the features of the current policy is that affordable supply is partly a matter to be negotiated and it's very important that it's negotiated out of the general er supply made by private sector builders
the point that i've been making with the various percentages is that those negotiations will become unrealistic if on average you're talking about forty some percent of sites having to go for affordable housing on a negotiated basis
it simply would not happen
and there will be a shortfall of that amount
obviously some supply would occur because housing associations will build wholly on some sites
but as a general rule there w because it has to be negotiated it would not be er supplied
and erm so i don't think the issues of affordable supply are quite the same as they have been in the past and i think it's a very relevant consideration for this particular structure plan
thank you mr
and mr has been waiting UNK
something you want to go back on
yes chair
dave leeds city
er i wanted to come back on the question of regeneration and the opportunities in leeds
a number of speakers have suggested that er there are vast areas of brown field sites in leeds just waiting to have houses UNK on them
which would relieve the need to use er so called green field sites in north yorkshire
that's not the case
we've UNK leeds time and again to find these erm so called brown field sites which our own residents suggest are there
and there just there are just not enough in suitable locations for housing to meet the needs of leeds
that's why we ourselves have had to take our own greenbelt land
thank you
mr are you going to say much the same
just to erm reiterate the comments for bradford to point out that er in the deposit u d p we've been only able to allocate er approximately ten percent of our new allocations in the existing urban area
thank you
mr do you want to tell us about the UNK of UNK
no i just want to UNK the point that was made there chairman because er it isn't er it isn't accurate
er out of the eighteen thousand two hundred and thirteen dwellings three hundred and er three thousand one hundred and sixty nine are in UNK adjoining UNK er north yorkshire three thousand two hundred and thirty three dwellings are in middlesbrough adjoining north yorkshire and seven thousand eight hundred and thirty four dwellings are in UNK of which four thousand three hundred are at UNK which d directly also UNK the north yorkshire boundary so i think that i must make that quite clear that the majority of these dwellings provided for in the cleveland structure plan are erm comparable in terms of er the that area
the only difference is that i suppose er at we have er which is development in north UNK we have er erm permission for four hundred erm executive dwellings which is the sort of er market which you could have been looking for at in the past
and we are making provision for executive housing in our area as well as erm er outside the area
in a sense
so effectively what you're saying is a UNK proportion of your proposals are south of the UNK
that's correct
right
and talking of tea
can we resume at three thirty please
sentence please
now unless anybody's got a burning desire to pursue the question which i posed at two o'clock and from my point of view i think we tested it to destruction
er i'd like to go for some little light relief at this time of the day and look at sources of supply
now i think i would like to ask the county to come in and deal with this question of how much of their forty one thousand two hundred is new build and how much is gonna be taken up or provided by the conversion
mr
malcolm county council
i think i'd refer to our paper n y four in particular the paragraphs thirty five to and including thirty seven
which does indicate that something of the order of twenty five and a half thousand dwellings already committed through UNK outstanding planning UNK and local plan alteration in adopted local plans
right
and that in addition some three and a half thousand dwellings are contained in draft local plans which have yet to be tested through the local plan process
of the remainder which is what simon er twelve thousand dwellings the county council has made no specific on what proportion will be provided through conversions or through windfall sites or small sites
and in the county council's view this is a matter to be resolved by the district councils in their own plans
the county council does not have sufficient detailed information on the situation at the local level to be able to comment specifically on individual districts
on the situation erm in relation to these factors
can i pursue that mr please
and you referred to two sorts of allocations one those in adopted local plans and the figure was if you could remind me please
fifteen hundred dwellings
the time scale of those local plans is what please
to ninety six
none of them go beyond nineteen ninety six
no because the structure plan itself as approved only goes to nineteen ninety six
and the time scale of the three point five k
mostly again to ninety six although erm some do go beyond
so that in total you're saying twenty nine thousand dwellings one way or another are committed before nineteen ninety six
well in so far as they have planning permission or allocated local plans
exactly what extent they could be taken up in the period to ninety six is not necessarily erm clear because we don't know exactly when those are going to be taken up
that is true but if somebody applied for planning permission tomorrow or a or a renewal of planning permission it would be difficult if not impossible to refuse permission for those to be committed
absolutely but that isn't quite the same as actually having been taken up and developed up to ninety six
and in fact the evidence suggests i that in the three years remaining till ninety six it is most unlikely that those twenty five thousand dwellings will be developed given the alteration at the present time
indeed
thank you
well as i as i read it the co you haven't made any allowance for conversions you've made an assumption that part of the housing figure will be met by conversions
that is correct sir
but you don't wish to put a figure on it
no because i think that is a matter for the local planning authorities in their local district wide local plans to look at the way in which they wish to meet the particular totals for their individual districts
they will have a better understanding within their district of the supply of site property that can be is available for conversion
and local factors which may affect future conversion rates
we do have information on the extent to which net conversions have been provided over the past well during the eighty one ninety
yes i mean i acknowledge that is rightly a matter for investigation establishment through the local plan system
but nevertheless how far can you go along towards giving certainty to for example the building industry on the amount of new housing which would come from green field sites for sorry from the non conversion element
well i think the overall housing figures which were contained in the approved structure plan made up of a range of sites and allocations
they're made up of small sites they're made up of windfall sites
the approved structure plan doesn't provide any indication of the way in which that can be broken down
erm by including conversions this time round i don't see there's any particular difference we are giving the district a global figure for their districts which they will then need to look at in the light of local circumstances
i don't see any necessarily any difference by including conversions this time round
if we look at the summary table p s o two and sticking column two gives us annual average building rates for nineteen eighty one ninety three
our interpretations of that figure UNK any dwellings provided by conversions
but you said a moment ago that you had some evidence on this
do you have any idea what the average annual rate is for this
of conversions
yeah
well it is included in my form
it's part of the appendices
erm appendix
what does it come out at please
appendix five the average is three hundred dwellings a year or thereabouts
and is that three hundred included within that figure of two thousand eight hundred and eighty two
erm
those are those are new build dwellings
right i'll have to check back against all the figures if you can just give me a moment
i'll just have to check back i've seen the table in this particular format
it is your figure
is it
yes
the two eight two yes
where is the figure taken from
er the most column g n y four appendix three column average building rates
it UNK conversions
yes that UNK conversions
thank you
so that the annual average rate of provision of dwellings in north yorkshire is something like three thousand one hundred and eighty two dwellings
including conversions
including conversions
thank you
and you wouldn't wish to hazard a guess at all on the likely contributions co conversions between now and the year two thousand and six
this is something just to absolutely specific about it which will actually arise out of the work done by the district councils in their local plans
and come up
yes
coming up with their best estimate
yes i think they have the best information to be able to make that decision at a local level
thank you
mr
sir a small point in the same vein stephen
i have taken understanding how if the county council don't have any view on the level of conversions in the future and as i think mr said also this will extend to small sites and green field developments how they assess the environmental impact of their figure or indeed anybody's figure because clearly the environmental impact of conversions is very different from the environmental impact of either recycled urban land or green field development
and if in the county council's view they're all equally UNK and the anybody then i fail to see how they can have come to a view that the maximum acceptable environmental figure is their forty one thousand
quite malcolm county council
quite clearly while i'm not prepared to put a figure on the contribution that conversions are going to make to the period to two thousand and six i'll be most surprised if it was a long way different from what has been taking place in the past
we're not talking of a conversion of ten to fifteen thousand dwellings with erm new building being reduced considerably we are talking something in the order of UNK of what has been happening in the past
to what extent that will be modified by the changes in local circumstances i cannot say
if we pursued there erm tell me whether i get my arithmetic wrong er we assume at most three hundred a year from conversions
it's unlikely to be more than that
you don't know
but let's for the sake
it might it might be more
let's for the sake of the discussion assume it's about three hundred a year then you're looking at another three thousand nine hundred during the remainder of the plan period
for the remainder of the plan period
or three thousand six hundred
that's right
which on the basis of commitment twenty nine thousand leaves an outstanding figure of just over twelve thousand
no because the figure i quoted did include outstanding planning UNK for conversions
so how many how many how many conversions are there within that
if you just give me er a moment to check my
about two thousand nine hundred dwellings
two thousand nine hundred
yeah
so alright for the sake of again discussion we'll say that probably about another thousand might come forward
although it could be more
indeed yes it could be less
it could be more
erm and if it is more then the amount coming from new build
mm
is probably of the order of about ten thousand eleven thousand at best
well of that order yes
in addition to the sites that are already allocated or committed
yes
mr
yes thank you
just on the conversions point th there will clearly be at the end of the plan period an outstanding balance of conversion UNK erm which will not be built during the plan period just as there are two thousand nine hundred er which come back from previous to the well not automatically previous to the plan period but previous to the position we're in now
erm i can't see sir how the districts would be in a better position that the council and the county council to decide what the conversion element would be
one doesn't allocate the conversions in local plans
the best thing one could do i think is to go back to past trends
and those past trends show about three hundred a year
and i would not suggest that total of three hundred times thirteen should be reduced by the amount of the existing commitment
as i've just said
erm i think also sir you if you compare the county's n y four appendix six if you'll just look at that
with the county's n y five appendix three
there isn't an n y five
n y five is the h two issue where they
h two right
i've got it now
well it gives a schedule of housing conditions in greater york erm and i've been comparing in turn that schedule with the schedule produced by the city council on a more updated basis
and that actually gives an assumption of net conversion gains in the greater york area
so it seems to me the exercise not only must be done for the purpose of calculating where we stand in supply terms but actually has been done by the county council in respect of greater york
so i think the figures should be erm three hundred a year times thirteen
with no reductions
which is again just assuming past trends will continue
i can see no better way which to make the make the assessment
until
malcolm county council
i'm not quite sure what it is mr is asking
is mr asking for a specific figure for net conversions to be included in stage one
it does seem to me that's not entirely consistent to government guidance in p g three which simply states that the structure plan would state whether or not conversions are included within the housing figures
it does not require that they specifically be separated out
and i'm not quite sure if that would necessarily assist the district councils in the preparation of their district plans
but if you are saying that calculation of housing provision includes conversions i'm somewhat some guidance on how much provision will have to made from new built sites and somebody's going to have to make an intelligent assumption about how much is coming forward from conversions
well certainly the starting point for that must be to look at what has been happening in the past as evidence
but on top of that one must then look into the future the future supply of such properties and the future o er of a whole range of issues which may occur locally and which can only really be decided by the district councils in their local plan work
yeah i mean i got the point but er where does it take the building industry or the district
the districts obviously will do their assessments through the local plan
well absolutely i mean this is the way that things have always worked and the county council makes a global assessment of requirements for a particular district and the district council then takes it forward with assumptions on small sites windfall sites er and major allocations that they may be mad making
er conversions are simply a different factor they will have to take into account
i don't see any difference in principle simply that this is an additional point they will have to take in account in their local plan preparation
this may be also a question which you will say the districts are in a better position to answer and maybe they should be UNK that if you say that they will be asked that question
do you have a feel of how much of the total provision that you're proposing in the structure plan will be development on green field sites as opposed to development existing urban areas
er malcolm county council
no i don't w we've never attempted to define development in those terms
erm strictly in those terms by district mainly because much of the development across north yorkshire is on very small sites er within urban areas within villages the extent to which you define them as green field or brown field sites becomes a very subjective one and i think it's a very difficult line to draw
erm and we have never attempted to define it in quite those terms
mm
but this if i may pick up on the point mr made how then do you assess the environmental impact of what you're proposing if you don't actually know where it's going to go
but the environment
the environment in north yorkshire is not just confined to the green field sites it is also confined to the small villages the market towns
and the character of those towns is also erm subject to pressure from development on what might be described as brown field sites and could UNK affect the character of those settlements themselves
just as readily as by gr er green field sites
i'm still lost for what in effect is the answer to mr 's question
how did the county council assess the environmental impact of forty one point two k new dwellings
the county council took into account a wide range of considerations in including the information that came through from the local plan authorities in the preparation of their local plans over the past ten years or more
on the problems and opportunities that they faced allocating land throughout the county
erm the county council is well aware of the problems they faced and the issues that have arisen out of those local plans and took those into account in the preparation of the structure plan alterations
but the essence of your answer to the questions that have been asked over the last twenty minutes or so is we haven't done it that way
mm
with which i'm left with an impression that you don't actually know where the dwellings are going to go in general terms
how many are coming from conversions how many are coming from green field as opposed to brown field sites
what basis what did you have therefore for your assessment that forty one thousand two hundred was okay
well i don't think you can expect the county council and the structure plan authority to have an idea of where the allocations are going because that would be taking on the role of the local plan preparation authority
er the county council cannot look at an individual building and say this is a particular piece of land which is going to be developed and this is going to have this particular impact on the environment
but
no i didn't expect you that you would have the answer to those questions at the level of villages however i think it might be reasonable to expect that in reaching your view primarily on environmental grounds which is the major UNK of your argument for UNK past migration trends
as part of that appraisal you would have taken some view
the alternative is that and i'm being UNK quite deliberately i am left with an impression that what the county council have done is add together input from district councils to prepare its structure plan
well there's certainly been one element of the input to the preparation of the structure plan but there has also been some independent view on the capacity and the environmental problems that individual districts across north yorkshire and west yorkshire have in their ability to accommodate development and on the pressure and the problems that those pressures of development will have on those individual districts bearing in mind the environmental constraints identified both in national and in the secretary of state's previous approval of the structure plan
what were those environmental parameters
i think the county council looked at government guidance in relation to the need to protect and safeguard national parks greenbelt high quality agricultural land to the need to protect the countryside for its own sake
er there is a range of government advice on the sort of areas which need to be protected
er it also takes into account the government's advice on the need to protect the environment and the
did you make any UNK
not in the sense that the county council went out and did a measured assessment which said right this particular district can accommodate x thousand dwellings in areas which aren't greenbelt or which are greenbelt or individual factors
it was based on their general experience and their general local knowledge of the problems and opportunities and constraints on particular areas
mr
yeah going to seek to fill in the spaces in your columns j and k since if you find that helpful
and to explain them
er
scarborough
is that right
er dealing first of all with conversions er j
we've got a figure there of six ninety and for the windfall sites five seventy
if i can just erm refer to our previous experience of er conversions which i think is probably a little peculiar given the nature of a UNK
erm for instance in the period eighty nine to ninety two we were running at an annual average of about a hundred and seventy four conversions a year
however the average seventy seven to ninety two er gives you a figure of eighty five
now given the nature of the coastal economy and what has happened to us in the last ten years or so we have calculated our conversions through to two thousand and six on a reducing level
on the basis that a lot of the big houses that were doing holiday accommodation and so on er have already been converted and this is our experience so on that basis we have taken a reduced figure for conversions and that is basically the reasoning behind it
now er thereafter you say well why six ninety and not seven ten
er clearly the we have to you have to make a judgement on this
but that is the reasoning behind it
similarly er we have actually er taken something of the same attitudes towards windfall sites within the urban areas
because a great many have developed in recent years
and taking up points about town UNK
so er i'm giving you that as an example but i think that scarborough will be UNK of the county as a whole because of the nature of the victorian property and the holiday industry
thank you
mr
er could i just return to the line of questioning very briefly that the senior inspector was pursuing a moment ago with the county council in terms of the assessment of the environmental impact that the forty one thousand figure
i mentioned in my first contribution this morning a concern about that those considerations that environmental considerations even if they have been fully considered er are not there's not an explanation provided anywhere in the structure plan supporting material as to how that's actually been achieved
however there is there is i think some re there are relevant sections in the county council document n y eleven which follows on which is the county's as i understand it UNK to the h b UNK assumptions on erm the environmental constraints and how they should apply across the county
erm the impression i'm left with i must admit is that the cart has followed the horse if that's right in that erm the environmental justification for the figures has been retrospective
erm i think c p r e we feel we say this in our opening statement to our evidence that it should be the other way round
er and in indeed government guidance is states exactly that
i don't know if it's something through the panel it's the been put to the county council as to whether i my interpretation of the process is correct
well perhaps peter north yorkshire
perhaps i could er develop erm the position a little bit further
erm any suggestion that erm the figures that we're putting before this e i p have appeared out of the blue er we would wish to er UNK quite UNK
i you look at the county council the county council is the national park authority
that covers about half of the erm of the county
erm local plan progress is well advanced erm er in the national parks and that has been the subject of continued discussion erm between the county and its national park committee the county planning committee and its national park committee
there have been numerous meetings er between the district the county and the national park committee on the problems of environmental capacity within those areas
the county council also manages work on er a u m bs the two main a u m bs in the county
and the county's well UNK in the problems within the a u m bs
the county council er together with its district council colleagues er has also spent five years looking at the problems in greater york
there's another area a substantial chunk of the county which has been explored ad UNK in terms of er environment
when you then look at the bits that are left over erm we've got hambleton district council which has er had the er earliest i think local running down the centre of the county
there's been close liaison between er the county and hambleton
we've an adopted local plan for that p part of selby district outside the greater york area so already we've covered ad UNK by various assessments
quite clearly the county's spent a lot of time assessing environmental capacity and environmental problems within north yorkshire
and you can add to that the fact that a number of districts er have said that they've been consulted five times by the county council er on various erm population projections
quite clearly there's been full well perhaps too much too much discussion consultation assessment and implications right the way through the preparation of this operation
the county council is UNK based in pursuing a figure er of forty one thousand dwellings
mr
and partners
it seems to me there's a very circular argument that that's been applied to this question of environmental constraint
we heard just now from the county council that they have looked at UNK district wide local plan looked at the constraints in that back to hambleton effectively as housing requirement
rather than establishing at a strategic level housing requirements so that local plans being UNK can weigh those housing requirements against environmental constraints
because at the end of the day it is essential that a balance is struck between meeting housing needs and UNK environment
that can be illustrated by a complete lack of information in front of us on the that actually applies any consistency to er the environmental discount applying in different parts of the county
i'm looking at the helpful assessment provided by selby in a seven double o four
their appendix three
and that sets out for each district in the county a few areas of different environmental constraints
national parks greenbelt and so on
there is absolutely no correlation between those figures and the degree of constraint that has been applied on districts
for instance if you look at selby at forty two percent of its area constrained and a high housing value requirement
if you with hambleton forty four percent with a very constrained housing requirement a seventy percent constraint
i think you may say they're different districts and selby is constraint is all greenbelt
you can compare ryedale and hambleton which are not very different
ryedale has more a higher proportion of national park a o m b local landscape designation and greenbelt than hambleton but is UNK
i just do not see that any logic can be applied in this process at all
yes mr
yeah samuel UNK brewery tadcaster
erm to echo the point that mr has made i also regard this erm the environmental assessment as unsatisfactory with its particular interest in selby
and er i note that selby has accepted or resolved to accept the increased allocation from ten thousand to eleven thousand five hundred subject to the district council satisfying itself that the level of growth envisaged can be achieved without UNK the established structure plan strategy or the environment of the district
and it seems to me as mr said it's putting the cart before the horse really
the it's no use accepting a level of housing and saying we'll accept that subject it not damaging the environment
what should be done is the level of housing allocated to selby should be assessed in terms of whether it can be satisfactorily accommodated and if it can't then it shouldn't be allocated
if it can it should be allocated
but this the way it's er accepted here is completely unacceptable in my view
mr
stephen from
sir i very much share the best i think doubts that were evident in miss 's questions about whether there is any real environmental assessment on which the county UNK based
either a county or indeed at a rational comparative district level
i prior to this e i p read through n y four very closely looking for this
and i counted the word environment and environmental forty five times and not one UNK thousand and
comment
perhaps mr can confirm whether he was present when the county planning committee considered on i think three or four occasions the er the various range of projections
were you present mr
my colleagues were present sir and have informed me that the comment that i made is actually accurate
i wouldn't accept that
there were a range of meetings some private meetings with district councils when they've given the opportunity to discuss issues erm themselves and quite clearly our members did in fact look at a whole range of projections before coming to a final view
quite clearly it was a thorough examination and members had before them at both county and district level the implications er of the various projections
and er they took the decision erm to erm pursue the policies er as set out in this e i p
mr do you want to throw some light on this
yes er yes thanks chairman
nice to get into that even if it is almost as er night UNK
terry selby district council
you can continue your UNK tomorrow you know
well i hope that won't be necessary
erm reference has been made er a couple of times to the appendix which i attached to my submission that's the map and the schedule of strategic constraints i feel i ought not to let it pass without some comment
er and basically that's i'm beginning to feel that i've thrown in a bit of a red herring here
erm the only purpose of the information presented is to establish the differences in strategic terms between the districts in the county
i feel that is an appropriate er investigation which is being done by the county and the district jointly
and i think it does demonstrate that in comparison with other parts of north yorkshire selby is in fact much less constrained
er and i really wouldn't like more to be read into it than that
er mr also commented UNK the er consideration of the er emerging alteration and increase in selby UNK allocation from ten thousand to eleven and a half thousand dwellings erm and i would like to assure him now that we have completed out local plan studies we are in the process of fine UNK them and i'm quite confident that we will be able to accommodate the eleven and a half thousand dwellings
i wonder given UNK recent experience with their local plan whether they can UNK us as to how they have reached a view that the structure plan provision in right in environmental terms for their district
well g er going back to my starting point that the relative environment of selby the vis a vis the rest of north yorkshire erm it's a point which i'm sure i'll repeat in the coming days and it's basically that selby in comparison with other districts in north yorkshire is significantly different
we don't have the same er national nationally
and like you just do ordinary skipping and you jump in the middle and it's h p w r
then h p w r and if it lands on p you have to go really fast
the first person has to start skipping in the middle and everybody says h p w r and if it landed on p the next person would have to skip fast
and what if it lands on any of the others
you just have to do what it means like
h you can do higher UNK and p fast and r round you gotta turn around with a skipping rope and w UNK
and hot chocolate
what's hot chocolate
well somebody sa and they stand facing the wall and they shut their eyes and there're people at the end and they have to try and get to the other side without the other person seeing them
and them erm when everybody's been caught by the person who's at the person sat saying things like hot bananas hot milk and then when they say hot chocolate the you've got to run back
and they've got to try and catch nobody
and if nobody's caught the person who was it is it again
and we do UNK taylor
how much money they're gonna have and how much presents you're gonna get at the wedding and how many guests you're gonna get
and when the UNK gonna be and what you're gonna wear and what you're going to go there in and how many children you're gonna have and how many years you're gonna be married
and like a lot like the guests you're gonna have at the wedding and the presents and the money and the children there's just numbers
like the children i think it's something like two four six eight two four six eight just keep going like that
and what about where you're gonna live
big house little house UNK barn
there isn't very many soldiers that grew up at this school any more
we went a trip and there was two UNK and the class heather and they were playing soldiers on the way back
well it was like the two soldiers and the one person just holds it the other person just tried and knock the head off
we do that at me UNK cos there's lots of soldiers there
soldiers was a game played with grass where each was armed with a stem and little head of the plant and by heading one's UNK soldier try to knock off his head
there were two kinds of soldiers
the brown headed ones were tough and could stand any amount of UNK and the head would hang on quite a while by a mere thread
sometimes when it got worn like that it would UNK round the other soldier so that his head could be pulled off
they other kind of soldier was black with little white UNK growing out from the head
the stem of this one was easily broken and often the head would fly off at the first stroke
i wonder if they're counting out UNK of our school UNK are still remembered like
UNK penny pie UNK
wood stands though there by
or another where the leader UNK as i went through a chinese town i met a chinese lady
players then asked what colour was she dressed in
UNK the leader decided on a colour for example brown
the UNK went on then b r o w n spells brown and o u t spells out
till the one we called the UNK was selected
the UNK of UNK tails with their UNK were UNK to provide a little guessing game as to which joint was the broken one
the UNK leaves of UNK planting were pulled apart to reveal the green leaf UNK
by the number of leaf UNK revealed it was discovered how many lies a friend had told that day and a long UNK indicated a big lie
for all i know these little games may have had their origins hidden in long tradition
the UNK taylor soldier game was played by UNK the parts from UNK grass UNK
further lines we had were as to where future homes would be UNK a big house a UNK house a UNK a barn
or with regard to the wedding plays silk UNK cotton UNK or even if the offspring would be boy UNK twins UNK or what these babies were to be UNK in
a UNK a UNK a pot supply your own UNK or a pen
sustainability viability as in a UNK sense and i would also like to suggest that in pushing this discussion forward we ought to bear in mind the how shall i say it the principles as UNK by the department of the environment in their planning policy guidance note three er and in particular those spelt out in paragraph thirty three
and those if you would for those who have not got them available erm we can have them copied and obtain them for you but i suspect all of all of you sitting round the table will have p g with you
anyone short of a copy of p g three paragraph thirty three particularly
it's the one prepared for the submission
for those tha who are not to familiar with the initials p g it stands for planning policy guidance and there are a whole series of these guidance notes produced by the department of the environment for the er advice guidance of well not only the local planning authorities but anyone else who is interested in the development business and they are expressions of i suppose government policy er and their attitudes towards various aspects whether it's countryside housing trans or transport and they do pro provide a useful UNK in fact an extremely valuable UNK to the way in which er this matter should be considered erm i know from the submission which north yorkshire county council have used they would say that the fact they haven't had regard to all this er but i would like to carry on the discussion against that background and could you direct your thinking at this stage about the need for a new settlement in the light of the principles spelt out in p g three and particularly paragraph thirty three
now then can we proceed to mr brighton
sorry mr donson first
yes thank you
roy donson house UNK federation
i think i'd like to start by making a few general points er and then er it will be a matter for others to be somewhat more specific i think i can say that the issue of a new settlement of a new settlement in greater york is a fairly unique situation because we have agreement between the development industry and the county council and that's something of a UNK but also we have mild support from the department of the environment and as mr davis has already said that is backed by public support
i think it should be remembered that public support actually was against a requirement of one thousand nine hundred dwellings which is not quite the proposal being put forward by the county at the moment but it is clear that there seems to me n not to be any public or great strength of public objection to the sort of proposals that are now before you in this enquiry and it also seems to me that the reasons behind erm that public support are essentially because it meets the first requirement of paragraph p g thirty three that the alternative expansion of existing towns or villages will represent a less satisfactory method of providing land for new housing that is needed i think that is the essence of the public support and so first of i think you can say that that's that means that first criteria and certainly it seems to meet the second automatically because it an expression of public preference
from the UNK point of view er i have substantially difficult a difficulty in UNK you as to where the new settlement ought to be because in effect i would be choosing between members and that is a certain route to my unemployment if i were to do that and i don't wish to be unemployed
therefore i am not able to suggest to you and haven't been able to in my evidence which district even a new settlement er ought to go in but i have to say that if it were part of your deliberations that you should choose a particular district er then it is not part of my submission that you should not choose a particular district but my bottom line is that the policy wording should at least ensure that there is commitment to a new settlement and it is UNK on behalf of the district planning authorities the last thing that we would want is the possibility of going round the districts and the last one to produce a district wide plan is the one that has to get the new settlement that seems to be a gen fairly unsatisfactory way of proceeding and each one should have to consider that as part of their certification process
if i can then turn to er some of the issues that were w were raised this morning york and others and other others in their submission laid great store on p g thirteen
can i remind you that it is a draft and it is a consultation draft it is not government policy
and UNK statements have actually indicated that it's not likely to appear as a final version until next year at the earliest and so it would seem to me that there's a great deal of thought to be gone into the precise wording of that p g yet and to rely on quotes from it wou is at best er misleading and i think we ought to bear in mind something that mr curtis mentioned this morning that in fact the change that happened between draft p g three and the final version it is quite possible that the final version of p g thirteen could be substantially different from the
can i can i interrupt at that stage
and say do you find nothing of p g draft revision in p g twelve
yes i do find that there's a general thread an and one would expect that what i'm what i'm guarding against is taking too much notice of precise quotes from p g thirteen
i think also we ought to be UNK about too much detailed discussion of travel distances we are talking here at most of travel distances of between six and ten miles in keeping with the policy erm it seems to me that erm if we spend too much time on trying to determine whether six or ten miles distant is there any great significance in terms of the global environment it would be at least an UNK case one way or the other but also there seems to me to be a clear conflict in those who are trying to say that the new settlement proposal falls because not large enough of a site is being proposed one way and another
it would seem to me that if you've got to prove a case that there that it is the place of last resort and that place of last resort has got to be at least five thousand dwellings you are in a place where there is absolute massive growth of demand and UNK no one has been able to meet a five year supply of housing land if you are to meet it in the term if y if those are the criteria to meeting the terms of th of this sort of plan and in fact what i would submit is that a new settlement solution is very much a part and parcel of a long term solution and that's where essentially the county strategy is quite right in proposing a new settlement in the context of the greenbelt because also greenbelt is a long term solution
we've got to look at it in those terms and so it is not necessary in my submission for anyone to prove at the moment there is at least five thousand dwellings short erm that is something which ought to be considered over a much longer time period
i think that what we have to decide today or one of the things that needs to be decided is the new settlement in the longer term a sensible answer given that all the all the various considerations and that erm arguing about residual numbers here or there has to be taken in the much longer context i think that's what all i would like the to say at the moment on new settlement erm because of the situation i am in of not being able to er say too much in detail about it i shan't be making very many contributions to this particular debate
can i come back mr donson or will that and i take it alright i understand the point you are making about the long term solution and size but if the panel were to be persuaded that to be a viable solution the settlement had in the end and i'm not going to define where the end is almost certainly beyond two thousand and six that the settlement would need to be of the order of five thousand dwellings
do you consider it important that we take that into account now not least because of the although it's well beyond the plan in its entirety where the new settlement might go and its UNK in environmental terms depends in part on how big it is there may be some places which could easily take fifteen hundred dwellings but could not take five thousand
that seems to me to be a consideration which may be able to address in general terms by yourselves but depends very much on the individual proposals and erm is a matter of detail of the individual proposals i'm sure that you don't want presented here the fine detail of individual proposals
indeed not
but it but it maybe it would seem to me if that is a consideration of yours that might be something that you reflect upon in y in your report but it is it is not a necessary er requirement that er that be part and parcel of this particular e i p
thank you
mr brighton
paul brighton barton willmore planning partnership
can i say first of all that er i support the general approach which has been adopted by yorkshire county council and the other local authorities in the greater york area on the way in which they've UNK their proposals for the york greenbelt after a fairly long erm and UNK process the question to which i want to address my comments first of all is whether the new settlement is an appropriate and justified planning response and what i would like to do if i may is look at some of the reasons that have been raised erm in objection to the new settlement as a strategy erm these issues have been raised by hambledon district york city council the c p r e UNK evans in their written submissions to the examination of the
first of all erm if we c could erm the question of need
the first element of need is erm the various estimates of commitments of potential land erm and the argument is erm that the additional requirement can actually be met within the inner area now we covered that at some length this morning and refer to what we've had said on that in a bit i don't propose to repeat it
likewise part of the argument also UNK around possibility that in additional land within the inner greenbelt boundary and again you've heard our argument on that this morning and i don't propose to repeat that
a new point that i would make however in many of those arguments which relate to the impossible or alleged availability of additional windfall sites and land on the inner greenbelt boundary but i think the analysis which is er carried out is a UNK one because it solely relates to residential land requirements there is no erm attempt to erm bring into the equation whether there is land available for the related employment necessary for that additional residential development whether there is land available for schools shops and mr UNK recreation uses and so on and all those will very considerably increase the amount of land required to be released to support residential development wherever it is located and that is something which i believe has not been properly taken into account
the second major issue which i believe had been used against the new settlement as a an appropriate greater york area is that it's inconsistent with erm current recent central government planning advice and basically the argument is that the proposals for the new settlement are contrary to er planning policy guidance notes three and twelve and draft er p g thirteen if i can deal with p g thirteen first of all and the observation of mr curtis that the new settlement is a last resort erm now i could find no reference to that at all erm in p g three or even a UNK that at planning policy er that a new settlement should be regarded erm as a policy of last resort
my believe is what p g is inviting local authorities to do is be cautious in proposing them they should not be regarded as a first option or an easy option they should be cautious in proposing them
special circumstances are required to justify the er proposing the new settlement through the local plan structure planning process and i believe that is exactly what has occurred over the last five years and if i could just quickly run through paragraph thirty three of p g three and the your invitation for us to comment on the criteria set out there first of all the first element the ex the alternative must be erm seen to be a less satisfactory method of providing land for the new housing that is needed that is the essence of what has occurred in the process which the county council has undertaken over the last couple of years all of the policy options available have been examined in great detail have been subject to public consultation public participation d i believe clear view was that there were erm constraints operating on york which meant that not all of that additional development accommodated in the adjacent to the existing er york city villages surrounding york
the second requirement is that it should be a clear expression of local preference afforded by the local planning authorities my i think the fact that it has been promoted by the greater york authorities albeit some of them have erm taken a slightly different view of late i think that is clear expression that the local that the new settlement proposal does have a substantial local support
the third element and the fourth element erm i think relate more to location questions to do with the new settlement and i propose to deal with those under the legal heading of two c the next item is that the proposal can be considered alongside policies of restraint and that is exactly how the proposal for the new settlement has emerged it is a response to the er proposed greenbelt around york city and obviously we can put in the greenbelt that there is severe erm policies of restraint operating at er on the terms of new development
finally the last consideration again i believe that to be a location question which i propose to deal with under the heading two c
so the new settlement is one element of a comprehensive approach to development UNK in greater york
i would make the point that it has taken thirty five years for us to reach this point where we have comprehensive strategy for york we have UNK with er various greenbelt boundaries in the past i think there has never been erm a total review development plan requirements for the greater york area no more of its implications on possible greenbelt boundaries we now have that and the greenbelt local plan southern ryedale local plans are being progressed on the basis of that strategy and there are other plans in the pipeline
and i think the special character and position of the york as one of this country's most important historic towns fully justifies the exceptional step of new settlement
the second planning policy guidance note which erm the new settlement UNK as was the policy guidance note number twelve and i wonder if i can UNK for a moment with the s word sustainable
it's a word which everyone is using and it's almost like UNK
i i'm not sure that we've had a very helpful description of what sustainable means erm i suspect people use it in different ways and ther there is no er common usage established of what it means here there is no dictionary definition
i've UNK the technical professional press to find out if there is some general statement which sums up what sustainability means and the one which i've seen most commonly referred to i think and the government has used it in this way is a requirement to ensure the needs of the present generation are met in a way which does not prejudice future generations now i do not believe that a properly conceived and located new settlement is any less sustainable in the long term that other forms of urban growth and by properly conceived i've got to say i believe that to mean properly balanced er form of development for the new settlement and i think i would say that new settlements have usually been proposed because continued UNK like the normal forms of UNK further development requirements UNK and peripheral development have been determined in york context not to be sustainable the sorts of issues which arise as a result erm of additional development in or on the edge of york and the surrounding villages problems of additional congestion loss of green space in towns loss of employment opportunities and so on
and finally i can just look at erm draft planning policy guidance thirteen it is very easy to lift one or two sentences out of either the draft planning policy note or indeed the UNK report which UNK it erm i think if a full reading is made of that what comes across strongly in the research is that there is a very complex relationship between urban forms and transport patterns and indeed erm i think the advice in p g er draft p g thirteen is UNK with a note that erm transport issues are will be erm there are very few general principles if any and local er considerations will influence the er the importance of this UNK issue very considerably what i think draft p g thirteen does invite us to do is to more UNK look the transportation implications of alternative settlement patterns and that's all
and at the end of the day transport matters are only one consideration which need to be taken into account in considering alternative er locations and it may not be the most important
and finally if we can look at erm i think the c p r e have raised this that erm the new settlement i er would be inconsistent with erm regional sub regional planning strategy
first of all if one looks at the draft advice on the erm regional plan guidance prepared by the yorkshire and humberside local planning authorities they in fact advocate new settlement as an appropriate circumstances there is not a policy which says that they are not appropriate or are inconsistent with other policy objectives and i note in that respect that the d o e as mr donson said are UNK supportive of the new settlement in the greater york area
there is some comment has been made that a new settlement to the south or the south west of york would in some way undermine the urban regeneration erm of leeds city council now i find this a surprising comment given that though people who are making that comment are also at the same time advocating much increased development allocations to for example harrogate district the main centre for which is erm nearer than most UNK new settlement locations to the south and south west of york
in addition i think there's some UNK because within selby district for example a lot of development which has been UNK in the past and is likely to be allocated in the future is in places like selby or UNK in UNK which again are much nearer to leeds erm than potential new settlement sites to the south and south west of york and yet objection has been raised to er that particular erm element in the planning strategy for selby and i can't see the reason why a new settlement should be treated in any different way to any other form of development in that sense
now you've also invited comments on er the question of whether one settlement is appropriate and the size of the settlement do you want would you like to take my comment
well i was trying to stick with the size as an expression of whether the concept is one that should be pursued and whether that influences the pursuing of the concept can we can we leave the number of settlements till later on
right
i think erm there is some dispute as to erm what size the new settlement must be to become what's termed an integrated and balanced community and given the importance of this issue and it has been with us for the last three years ever since the new settlement was first proposed erm i find it very surprising that north yorkshire county council have not undertaken any work of their own on this subject area and have relied instead on a residual approach to find the new settlement size and i must say i find that very unsatisfactory what north yorkshire county council are inviting you erm to accept is whatever size the residual for greater york is you know has been in the past i should say proposals from the public from the private sector have come forward an and the county council have used those proposals as confirmation that the new settlement of that particular size was viable it's a sort of self fulfilling UNK now i think that's unacceptable what they haven't done is the second part of the technical exercise which is to look at the UNK of the various services and facilities required in the new settlement
now i am able to say that barton willmore has done this work and it has submitted as part of our submission to the e i p and in summary what i would say is that i believe that work demonstrates that the new settlement has to be in the order of two thousand to two thousand five hundred dwellings to begin to achieve the environmental objectives set for the new settlement and also social objectives which would also be important to the residents of that new settlement
now north yorkshire county council er i think in their statement look to erm to existing market towns to provide what little evidence they can up to justify fourteen hundred dwellings er i think that's again a UNK approach because by definition the market now can seal them up wider catchment area many of them are some distance from york and the settlements concerned provide a service base for a number of surrounding villages and therefore the actual UNK and services found within that particular settlement are greater than one would achieve if it did not have a large catchment area
but finally i would like to make one comment about the er the residual approach used to define the new settlement size
i think there is a tendency erm for local authority planners to have UNK set by the end date of the current plan period and work try and work in that sort of around the real world i think where nothing happens or nothing is UNK beyond that time period erm this particular approach er does not work in the case of new settlements there is no need when having established your design size for a new settlement that it necessarily all has to be built within current plan period and i think this sort of approach is recognized in UNK where in case of the a forty five new settlement a view was taken at an early stage that a new settlement of three thousand dwellings was needed to meet long term development needs in UNK an area where the planning issues and problems where very similar to those of york and the approved structure plan in policy proposed that new settlement to be designated as three thousand of which two thousand portion would be built within the current plan period so it seems to me that the question of size need not be an UNK to erm designation of a new settlement if the existing requirement and need are UNK not to require the sort of new settlement size that we are creating
thank you
thank you very much
mr brighton erm before i turn to another speaker your comment about the location of a new settlement and the likely effect it would have on the west yorkshire conurbation er i presume from what you've said is that effectively the new settlement if you have one its location should be such as to serve the needs of york and greater york and therefore the further it is away from the west yorkshire conurbation or the west side of north yorkshire the more likely it is to fulfil that function
i think that the new settlement erm should be as close to york erm city as can be achieved the erm question of the detailed location er i think is a matter for erm discussion on the basis of the other planning policy guidance erm criteria which i haven't explored terms of the locational criteria what i was seeking to do in my comments was erm to counter a point which has been made er by the c p r e which refers to new settlements as an engine of growth now that's not the purpose of this new settlement it is a response to the needs of meeting greater york and i don't see any reason why that's less likely to be achieved if it's south west of york than anywhere else around the UNK of york
given that planning cannot dictate that people live near to where they work i'm not sure i've yet UNK why it is that the need to greater york need to be met near to york the these needs to rise from a complex pattern of people moving in and people moving out individual decisions as to where people live in relation to where they work what's the magic of having the new settlement near to york
and perhaps this is this goes to a wider point of what's the magic of the definition of greater york area
that not just a question to yourself mr brighton others may wish to comment later
may i answer first
paul brighton barton willmore
i think it is erm greater york that has been seen as an area with special problems because of its er historic character erm which we spent many hours debating at the york greenbelt local plan inquiry and i think most participants there accepted that the er what was being protected was not just the historic core but also the setting of york and its surrounding ring of villages and the way which it is proposed to protect that setting and character is by a greenbelt now it follows that if you are imposing extremely severe restrictions on new development in an area around a settlement then you have to meet the legitimate development needs for that settlement in another location the further away that new settlement or other policy response is located it seems to me the less likely it is to meet the er needs of that settlement and that will give rise to erm you know additional pressures on the settlement you are proposing to protect and maybe those pressures could not be UNK and i think that's why there is this requirement that erm the development which might otherwise be built on the edge of york but which is not proposed to be so built because of the greenbelt needs to be located close as close to york as is consistent with the original environmental objectives greenbelt objectives for the greenbelt
can i carry on throwing UNK into the pool
thank you
planning theory about the right size for towns is not good
isn't there an argument which says if you're trying to protect york and its setting that the further you actually move the development away from it the greater the protection you afford it
i think erm there is a erm a size issue that enters into that particular consideration erm clearly erm if you build a small new settlement very close to an existing large settlement then the prospects for that being reasonably self contained are much reduced to that of a larger new settlement in the same location and i would agree that the further in general the further you move away from an existing centre then the likelihood is that settlement will become more self contained
can we ca
but sorry
go on
there is an additional aspect that erm we must look also i think at the viability of the services and facilities er within the new settlement if the new settlement is for the sake of argument five hundred houses then my submission is that really offers no long term viability for any facility or service erm clearly you might get a primary school if the new settlement size was of the order of eight hundred to a thousand dwellings but you would not get any UNK retail element and so however far that settlement was located from the main centre they would still become dependant on that centre and that's why i think it's important to recognize that if you are to achieve the erm if you like the balance of requirements of achieving erm a reasonable degree of self containment within the new settlement but also meet the needs of york it has to be a reasonable size but located as close to york as possible
thank you mr brighton i'll leave my point until later
mr timothy and then mr brook
paragraph thirty three
can you introduce yourself mr timothy please
yes
this is for the sake of record the record
right this is UNK christopher timothy from wood UNK
starting off with paragraph thirty three of p g three erm you'll see in my statement that i've actually in seeking to address point a dealt with each of the conditions that p g three er refers to for which a new settlement should be UNK and you will see that i've reached a conclusion that having regarded the unique circumstances of york the greater york new settlement does represent an appropriate and justified policy response you'll se also see my statement i've taken some comfort from the fact that the good practice guide that has been published by the department of the environment has endorsed the approach that north yorkshire county council has taken towards the special circumstances of the greater york area
i don't know if this means that the north yorkshire structure plan now has the equivalent of an UNK recommendation
the particular point that i wish to pick up on though was from m mr curtis and his reference to erm the draft p g thirteen and whilst i'd say that the point of the h b f that it's only a draft publication at this stage there's in my view been too mu much over UNK on the reference in there to self containment you see if we look at that particular paragraph two point one two it actually says avoid the development of small new settlements which are not to sorry i'll start that again avoid the development of small new settlements which are not be likely to be well served by public transport or which will not be largely self contained
it's not an and situation it's an ei it's an either or situation
so by implication if you c if the new settlement is capable of being well served by public UNK then that is se a satisfactory situation
i take in my opinion the size scale of settlement that is being pursued by erm north yorkshire is of sufficient size erm my experience erm are twelve fifty to fifteen hundred new settlement is sort of a size that can sustain a reasonable balance of community facilities i think in looking at the new village and in the context of p g thirteen its highway implications we see from table one of er mr UNK supplementary statement that public transport i e bus and train in terms of journeys to work to the greater york area amounts to about eight percent of all journeys made now i think if we were to follow mr UNK view through and put all development on the UNK of york if we put two hundred to the north two hundred to the east two hundred to the south and so on and so forth the contribution that those that new housing can make to improving the public transport system will be very small if you concentrate your developments in a new settlement or maybe two new settlements which is another point erm you have a better opportunity to provide a public transport system which would not only serve that new village but also settlements in the UNK and i think you will find that the percentage of people in the new village who are UNK on public transport as a means of getting to work is greater that what you find in the greater york area at the present time
aha
any other comment
the only other comment i had in terms of the scale of settlement which i think is just touching upon the next point is that i mean depending on the conclusions you reach as to the amount of housing to be provided for in a new settlement i take the point that mr brighton made that you've got to have a longer term perspective i think that he f that in the ten year period ninety six to two thousand and six that the new settlements to be brought forward during erm i think it's really unrealistic to achieve more than twelve fifty fourteen hundred houses in that period if you say reach a conclusion there should be two thousand houses in that period in a new settlement there might be some benefit in having two settlements each of a capacity of say twelve fifty f for erm twelve fifty to fifteen hundred that can have capacity for the next plan period and in other words to assist in meeting the constraints that exist on york that are likely to exist into the future
mhm
thank you
mr brook and then mr UNK
thank you sir
UNK brook UNK brook associates
i think it would be appropriate to very briefly sir UNK erm not by name obviously who i represent the interests i represent because otherwise my comments may be UNK erm by certain parties who know me well i represent certain peripheral land owner and developer interests around york i also represent a developer who is proposing a n new village UNK fifteen hundred dwellings in the leeds metropolitan district er to the east of UNK that is relevant when i come to the location and a migration aspects er i would UNK the rest of my comments by saying i consider it is vitally important sir that this enquiry takes a sub regional view this is why my colleague from leeds city council i'm UNK been invited it's why the department of the environment regional office are here very important indeed
in terms of greater york and its th the york greenbelt i think it's true to say that er some time ago when david UNK of manchester did research on UNK he came to the view or he came up with the conclusions from his questionnaires that he sent round and that study was done must be ten fifteen years ago or more that UNK should UNK unchanged for at least twenty years and probably in excess of thirty and those were the responses of county planning and other major planning authorities at that time that view if anything has UNK the public view would be way beyond thirty years
for a city the nature of york it is vital in my view that public confidence in the greenbelt it's got to UNK for beyond thirty years that is the case i would share the views to some extent of the york city in that and which i certainly read into ma'am your two of your questions what happens beyond two thousand and six
the responses i heard to that question were most unsatisfactory the county council's response was ah well we'll have to get together again with the group of authorities now if you look back over how long it has taken to produce this particular strategy that's UNK worrying that means they'll have to get together again even if it takes half the time or a third of the time they'll have to get together again towards nineteen ninety seven ninety eight to be considering the strategy post two thousand and six
i put it to you that this proposal has to be considered any new settlement proposal has to be considered within the light of a post two thousand and six strategy in that light this new settlement proposal will not at around fourteen hundred satisfy the situation
if you then say ah well it might expand to double that number or to five thousand as was UNK that then UNK an even larger question because in my submission you would then go back and revisit the alternatives of for example should you expand tadcaster which has not the best facilities in its town centre er to quote but one example of er viability and sustainability of towns
you would look at tadcaster versus a settlement of four five thousand in the greater york area
it is a so it's a complex set of UNK we're looking at er on a sub regional basis i do believe that there is capacity some capacity around the inner area of york and to what extent the greenbelt enquiry er inspector will retain what i and others and certainly york city council would believe is sufficient capacity remains to be seen and though similar UNK were made at that enquiry i think they have to be UNK here
so my answer to the question a is i am not against a new settlement of the right scale in the right location but it is not a UNK it is not an answer to all the questions now it's being offered in terms of a balanced strategy i say that balanced strategy as put forward does not work certainly beyond two thousand and six and may grind to a halt well before two thousand and six if rates of development proceed er as they have done in certain years in the past so it's very important to look at that can we just revisit the public acceptance of the new settlement of course the public have accepted it and welcomed it has certain attractions i support those attractions however it's easy for the public to accept that when measured against certain sites specific proposals that were put to them when they did not know where the new settlement would be and still do not know when new settlement locations are put forward it will be quite a different scenario
the question of er p g thirteen and transportation i think is vitally important york will come into the position that UNK er where i was just at a transportation enquiry recently it's a very similar sort of city it's not quite the same as cambridge where cambridge is UNK ahead on quite some would say UNK transportation measures york in the UNK future will have to look at specialist transportation measures that's important in terms of the planning policy guidance that is out it's also in the white paper it may be in draft p g thirteen it's also in i think it's p g twenty two UNK energy that we should now be looking at developments which is closer to work that links then to the question of sustainability and viability of a new settlement i am not aware and i put it UNK in those terms of any significant employment existing or proposed in any of the new settlement proposals
i believe it is very important to judge a new settlement in terms of viability and sustainability on the availability of some significant element of jobs of course it will never be self contained erm but that is a very important factor i don't see that in the list of criteria
so i'm not opposed to a new settlement but let's have a very sensible approach to the question of sustainability and viability journeys to work er okay six to ten miles is not too much but we can do better than that
i think i'll reserve my other comments sir when we get on to some of the later points
thank you very much
mr UNK
tony UNK
er my start point is p g twelve which in er paragraph six point four sets out the reconciliation of the er development er economic social and environmental er priorities in UNK two strategies for a structure plan
these development strategies should seek to preserve an acceptable balance of the various priorities now in my position statement i set out the role and general advantages of new settlements as part of a development strategy in satisfying housing and employment needs of an area
in particular i think that the new settlement strategy proposed in the structure plan is of particular relevance er to the needs of greater york focused as it is on the historic city
given the lack of a capacity within the city and in the settlements surrounding to absorb significant elements of major development it seems to me that it is inevitable that green fields er will have to be taken to satisfy the future development needs
the choice therefore arises between peripheral development of the urban area and the villages surrounding or alternatively the new settlement itself the effect of peripheral development on the city has already been discussed and i support those who consider that it would be harmful to the character and indeed to the setting of york
equally to i consider that significant peripheral development of the villages would be harmful to their character as well
it therefore follows that in my view that it is UNK with the requirements of p g three particularly paragraph thirty three that a new settlement should be part of the housing and employment strategy of the greater york area that it does not conflict in my view with the consultation draft of p g thirteen which really UNK much of what has already been said in p g three and twelve with regard to travel issues
dealing with one or two specific points that have been raised particularly with regard to size in my view the balanced community which can be envisaged within a new settlement will provide for housing employment community services and UNK opportunities it will not simply be a peripheral housing estate transferred to the open countryside in my submission i have already stated that i do believe a new settlement of up to fourteen hundred dwellings should indeed be viable and UNK attractive to the development industry
i think a settlement of this size would be compatible with the general pattern of village development that exists in the york area if a new settlement were significantly larger than this pattern i think there would be a high degree of risk of coalescence with the existing er communities and would certainly threaten their identity
the other point i would make is the further that the new settlement is from york itself then the greater would be the UNK upon the motor car this has been born out by the paper that has been submitted by york city council in table one where one can see that within the urban area within the o r the travel to work by car is forty six point four percent travel to work in the greater york area at the moment is sixty seven point five percent further than that i do believe it would be even greater
as there is indeed a need to reduce car UNK it therefore follows that the nearer to york that the new settlement is then the greater the benefits could result equally to the further that the new settlement is from york then i think the less it will have an effect in reducing the pressures for development upon york
i think those pressures will still be there and that another solution will have to be found albeit in the middle term to reduce the further demands continuing demands for peripheral expansion of the city
thank you sir
thank you
mr jewitt
sorry
sorry
sorry
a couple of questions if i may please mr UNK
first of all you started off with a reference to p g twelve and i fear my pen wasn't fast enough to note down the paragraph number perhaps you could remind me
er certainly senior inspector erm paragraphs six point four and continuing into six point five
thank you
second point erm you argue that a settlement of more than say fifteen hundred dwellings would increase the risk of coalescence with existing settlements but surely that depends on where it is doesn't it
yes i readily accept that er my general proposition is in er connection with the settlement pattern of york and it is necessary clearly to have er careful regard to that existing settlement pattern erm if i may refer to the helpful plan that has in fact been produced i believe by the county council it is in fact an appendix to b two zero four er this plan does actually indicate the general extent of the settlements outside the outer ring road of york
clearly the settlement pattern at the moment does vary many of the settlements are linear in form many others are UNK
but they are fairly UNK spread fairly closely to each other it is my view that quite frankly the existing settlements should be protected to the extent of no new settlement being within w one mile of the UNK existing village centre
if one took that as a parameter and applied that to the existing settlement pattern there is indeed a high degree of risk of coalescence if in fact a new settlement were of a significant significantly larger than fourteen hundred dwellings
i understand thank you
michael jewitt
michael jewitt hambledon district council
i think at the outset i need to erm clarify UNK position erm UNK position is that it objects erm to the new settlement on the basis that it's not needed and cannot be justified and i wouldn't wish erm for the er council's position to be interpreted as anything less than that
turning to erm the reasons erm for the council's erm objection with particular reference to er paragraph erm thirty three of p g three erm i think it's first of all and it should be UNK obvious to all present now that since the county council UNK and the greater york authorities embarked upon this strategy government guidance has changed we believe erm government guidance now UNK serious doubts erm on the erm new settlement strategy for greater york
it's certainly true that government guidance is far more UNK erm in its support for new settlements erm the guidance has of course been touched on but i would UNK emphasize the dates of this guidance er p g three housing march nineteen ninety two p g twelve development plans and regional planning guidance february nineteen ninety two and draft p g thirteen may nineteen ninety three just looking briefly at p g three erm p g and i think it's fair to say that p g three takes up far less welcoming stance than did the previous erm p g erm it recognizes that new settlements are controversial and that the scope is likely to be limited
hambledon district council believes that insufficient regard has been payed erm to these issues erm in the structure plan alteration in paragraph thirty three the p g sets down a list of criteria erm to which local authorities er should refer erm i'll erm refer specifically to er to three of them and i and UNK to them as i go through erm what i want to say erm the first one i draw that i would draw the panel's attention to is erm that the alternative of the expansion of existing towns or villages should represent a less satisfactory method at providing the land for housing that is needed and it's a UNK question really here erm and w we would ask that erm if there hasn't been a comparative appraisal erm of the two options and how could there be there's no erm district or areas been identified how can we be certain that one option is better than another under the terms of that er criterion erm the oth second point we would draw the panel's attention is that the proposal is a clear expression of local preference supported by the local planning authorities and again i would emphasize there that hambledon district council objects and the third one is the option of a new settlement in preference to the alternative would result in positive environmental improvements and i'll return to that erm briefly in relation to er to hambledon p g twelve erm paragraph six one four that's been referred to it includes a check list of issues against which areas in for new development in general er need to be er considered with particular reference for reducing the need for travel erm amongst these issues that the p g asked the councils to take into account erm are that development should make full and effective use of land within existing urban areas that developments er should consider development patterns that are closely related to public transport net networks and in relation to housing and that housing is located in such a way as to minimize car use for journeys to work school and other local facilities p g thirteen and i would expect erm i would agree with what mr donson has said here is that it it's draft and obviously one has to put the appropriate weight on it but erm this UNK and UNK upon erm established government policy reducing the need for travel erm i don't think it's necessary for me to go into er the quotes in detail i think that those have been er been touched on erm however i would say erm that hambledon district council believes that the advice in draft p g thirteen is much less supportive of new settlements it suggests that greater weight must be given to the environmental implications of the additional traffic generated by new settlements erm this is erm we believe particularly important in view of the fact that a new settlement for york is unlikely to be self contained and by its nature many of the residents will still look to york for essential services social links and employment turning to the residual requirement erm we have a concern over this erm clearly a new settlement is intended to UNK up any residual requirement which the er policy sets at fourteen hundred dwellings we've heard evidence from york today that er the city can accommodate erm more erm houses than was originally envisaged which brings the residual requirement to erm about the minimum size specified by the county council as being erm about the right level erm to make a s a new settlement self supporting however we would point out that there is still the possibility of erm further peripheral development around york the greenbelt local plan and southern ryedale local plan er have not yet been statutory adopted the inspector hasn't reported on those we don't know what he's going to say about sites er which were at issue or on the need for flexibility between the inner erm boundary of the greenbelt and the city irrespective of course of what the inspector says erm being not yet statutory adopted the county and ryedale will still have the opportunity to consider UNK there policies there but putting that aside for the present erm even if it is established that er the requirement for nine thousand seven hundred houses erm can't a occupied by er can be accommodated by er peripheral development erm this doesn't it doesn't necessarily follow that the answer has to be a new settlement we heard yesterday in erm great detail that erm environmental considerations have justified a reduction in the rate of development in other districts erm in the county i would point out that a relatively modest reduction erm in the inward migration to ryedale selby and york could UNK up the residual requirement if one looks at erm the reasons for the greenbelt it is perhaps surprising that given the importance attached to maintaining its historic form and character that this is not an issue erm that's been considered
