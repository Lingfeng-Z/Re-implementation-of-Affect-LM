looking specifically at our concerns with regard to erm hambledon erm in hambledon the area search would erm extend to about eighty two kilometres that's square kilometres erm and contain six this contains six villages er with populations ranging from a hundred and fourteen to nine hundred and seventy one erm proposed new settlement of fourteen hundred UNK erm dwellings er would be four times erm greater than the largest settlement in this area easingwold is the nearest small town that's about the equivalent erm equivalent size in terms of number of dwellings erm we believe that it would er dominate the existing settlement pattern in the area and would introduce erm a UNK erm into er a settlement pattern
and we think that it would be an excessive size er for that particular locality and it wouldn't really fit in erm with er the path of the settlement pattern
we also have concerns about how it could erm fit in to er the countryside erm of the area er with particular reference to erm paragraph thirty three of p g three which states that erm the net effect of any new settlement will be to enhance the environmental cause only modest environmental impact the area in hambledon as mr UNK outlined yesterday erm is occupied essentially by the vale of york it's an essentially flat and rolling landscape er the UNK of UNK produced a very open landscape erm in that area erm there are few erm landscape elements to reduce into UNK erm there are no significant areas of derelict land which could be which would be UNK or enhanced erm by a new settlement erm and the council believes that it would be very difficult to UNK a new settlement into this landscape and it would be er visible over extensive areas to touch on erm the point raised by erm the panel about self sufficiency and self containment erm i think it's recognized in the explanatory memorandum erm to policy h two that a new settlement will need to maintain social and economic links with a city erm perhaps from some this statement is explicit that erm york will continue to UNK considerable influence in terms of employment social and community links erm and it's unlikely that facilities which have provided a new settlement will divert much if an if er any erm of this er demand for travel
we think that the er residents of a new settlement will still look to york as the natural centre for employment for er provision of most employment UNK and entertainment and if you compare it with something like er easingwold erm which is of a similar size erm this has achieved a degree a degree of self containment and balance but this has occurred through erm a long period of development and a gradual growth of erm social UNK and economic UNK however even with such erm a gradual growth erm it's not got a high degree of self containment erm recent developments in er transport and changes in lifestyle have reduced this even further and it's difficult to believe that er a proposal such as a new settlement er which is explicitly intended to cater for the development needs of york located only ten miles from york can achieve the same level of self containment
that's all i have to say
thank you
er y your use of the phrase self containment leads me to ask the question which is that well in my book it doesn't necessarily mean the same thing as an integrated and balanced community but i'll put mr davis on notice to define what is meant by those UNK
er mr girt can we have erm a leeds view
yes i'd like to come back er to mr brighton on the question of regeneration in west yorkshire and er settlement south west of york some people here today would not have heard the views of leeds and bradford on the h one discussions yet about er why we are UNK to the UNK in three north yorkshire districts harrogate craven and er to less extent perhaps hambledon on migration levels erm we argued there
sorry
we argued there that erm scale of migration was not necessary to be contained within leeds and bradford to promote regeneration because we're s we're now we have now exhausted all our brown field sites to the extent that we've had to take land out of our greenbelt but there we were looking at something in the order of four thousand dwellings in three UNK districts spread over fifteen years and we might reasonably assume that they'd come forward in a dispersed manner on a site by site basis er and be relatively small scale certainly we would be looking at the local plans which flow from this alteration to make sure that will be the case now a new UNK a completely different animal you would have to come forward quickly otherwise it would not be regarded as a success it would it would need wide publicity perhaps across the whole region maybe even beyond it would be a major attraction to anybody thinking of moving house er from leeds to a location which would be accessible to them to retain their employment in leeds so i think we were talking about two different things entirely more than that mr UNK su suggested that fifteen hundred would not be an adequate scale it would have to be i think two thousand five hundred was his figure er mr UNK suggested th the same sort of thinking and mr brook to that the settlement would have to get bigger erm which only compounds our problem any settlement which grew larger and larger and inevitably would contain more employment as well as housing would become more of a threat to the regeneration of leeds and perhaps to a lesser extent bradford and it's on
thank you
i'm conscious of the time and we may like to have a break for tea but there are also three people who wish to contribute to the discussion
would you like to have a break for tea now
i mean i ask that in the sense that ha are your contributions going to fairly lengthy
and mine
right can we take mr cunnane and then mr thomas and we'll do you after tea
joe cunnane er there are five points which i want to make
first one er relates to the point made by the barton willmore representative that no account has been taken of additional land that would be needed er for the settlement for shops er community facilities and other infrastructure er and of course that land is not available well in fact the opposite is the case if the new settlement is not provided because the infrastructure is available within york city and the york city document er a eight double o nine paragraph six makes it very clear that the city is capable of UNK the needs within its city boundaries where that fr infrastructure is available er to that extent there is a further argument against the settlement and that is that the settlement would be UNK the provision of resources outside of the city where those resources can actually accommodate it within the city
second point is that barton willmore say again a settlement of two and a half thousand is needed in order to be viable well a settlement of two and a half thousand cannot possibly be justified under the statistics that we have heard to date and it is ni it is UNK that barton willmore representative did not actually promote a need argument therefore the settlement at two and a half thousand is n well the settlement at two and a half thousand is not necessary and anything less than that is UNK so therefore in my in my view that is a further reason why it should not be UNK as a solution
my third point is coming back to chairman your point about the paragraph the criterion paragraph of thirty three of p g three and the settlement in my view fails the first the first test since the very city which it is supposed to relieve says that the need can be met and i quote within and on the edge of the urban area and villages
my fourth point is that again dealing with paragraph thirty three it fails the second test where it should be a clear and i would like to underline clear expression of local preference supported by the local planning authorities now mr jewitt has already made the point so i'll be very se very brief about this but i my clients simon UNK brewery in tadcaster two off fifty seven
thank you
mr thomas
yes richard thomas UNK evans
er most of my points have actually dried up now sir in view of what mr cunnane has said and also mr jewitt erm i do actually i would try to emphasize a point that the people who are proposing new settlements in this location have UNK avoided the question of need this afternoon well i think we almost came to the point this morning that the shortfall was nine hundred and reducing almost on a month by month basis er one or two quick points i would like to pick up er in view of the erm small nature or the shortfall in housing supply that we see over the next fifteen years i cannot accept that to avoid the new settlement option would be UNK to greenbelt objectives erm the housing land supply allocations are almost there are plans to run through which will un almost inevitably allocate additional sites inside the inner edge of the greenbelt boundary and outside the outer edge of the greenbelt boundary but both within greater york which are bound to assist in making up the shortfall of provision and probably if i suspect rightly would actually exceed it erm i agree with mr cunnane on the question of the alternative expansion of existing towns or settlements the same point really we're almost there anyway the op that option is already there it's not that it might be there it is it is there at the moment er it's not a clear expression of local preference and i would also point out the option of the environmental improvements under the p g criteria you asked us to look at erm whether it's a thousand houses two thousand two and a half thousand whether it has a bowling UNK or a ten pin bowling UNK and a b and q and a probably a UNK as well this form of development will not sit UNK in open countryside almost wherever it's put within the greater york area i UNK anyone to produce a site where one can satisfactorily put er such a massive form of urban development and suggest it's a positive environmental improvement
another point which hasn't been taken up despite us being invited to is why is the greater york area the size that it is and this is a point that the senior inspector raised er in other towns and cities i'm thinking particularly of exeter for example the districts have looked at supplying their city based land supply problems on a journey to work area now that area would be significantly greater than we're looking at here and it seems to me in this location er where we see a potential UNK of supply beyond the strict UNK of the greater york area is a very UNK question to ask why is the greater york area the area that it is
why are we relying so heavily on this arbitrary boundary
because the result of what we're trying to achieve particularly if one goes for the new settle settlement option is to squeeze as we said this morning a UNK into a pint pot and it would be interesting to hear from the county why the greater york boundary is what it is
thank you
thank you very much
well mr davis can UNK over that while he's having his cup of tea and then we'll come straight to mr sedgewick and mr donson after tea
can we UNK at twenty to four please
yes could i erm i just want to take up some points raised by the panel
erm indeed the first one was why should why should the new settlement be located close to greater york i think the main UNK the answer to that is of course that york is the main centre in population and employment in the county by far
it's also the main area of housing demand it's also the main area where employers want to locate around north yorkshire and i think most importantly if its development needs are not met these can won't be satisfactorily diverted elsewhere they will continue UNK which would be continual pressure on the edge of the urban area and on the greenbelt and if that holds the effect would of course be that the tight greenbelt would mean that economic growth in the county would be frustrated because york is the main centre where employment growth is concentrated and i would think i would consider that solution of a tight greenbelt plus not making sufficient provision for development needs elsewhere in york would be contrary to p g three paragraph three which i'm sure you're aware of
well if i could just read that a well planned strategy for UNK for land for UNK sorry a well planned strategy for land for housing which ensures that housing is available in the areas where jobs are being created can make a valuable UNK contribution to national prosperity and economic growth so i say i don't think we would have that erm valuable contribution if the new settlement were located away from greater york
now in terms of the UNK the need for development i'm sure the panel will have read all the evidence which has been put in about the long history of the varying impact studies o on development on around greater york and those date back of course to the february eighty nine report which i think you'll have seen copies of
now my conclusion from that and i think is a conclusion which has been supported by the public on con during the consultation exercise on the greater york study was that peripheral development around greater york would have an undue impact on the historic character of the city and that of course is the fundamental the protection of which is of course a fundamental aim of planning around greater york
and i think that the alternative of the new settlement is by far the best solution provided it is mixed with some peripheral development one can't go into a position where there is all peripheral development or all new settlement it has to be in perfect balance because some needs cannot of course be met by the new settlement
in terms of UNK to york i take the general review view and i support the county council that it is generally better if the new settlement is located closer close to york because that under UNK that it is well located for public and private transport
if further away the new settlement would be from york the less likely it would be to meet the needs of greater york more likely to meet the needs of other areas such as leeds
i think the worst of all locations would be a would be one where the new settlement would be catering for the needs of leeds if it were located along the a sixty four corridor south of york
in terms of sustainability we have done UNK undertaken the same exercise which barton willmore have done and looked at all the various sources i mean from there you should be including those published by the rural development corporation commission i should say
we come to the different conclusion and we think that a settlement between from those sources that a new settlement between fifteen hundred to two thousand could support a reasonable range of services and we when we look at barton UNK evidence we don't see the support for their conclusion if one reads each individual service one fi comes to the view that a new settlement between fifteen hundred two thousand would support a reasonable range of services
now in terms of whether it should be five thousand plus that of course is a matter of whether there is demand now my conclusion from my fairly extensive knowledge of greater york is that you just could not fit a new settlement that size satisfactorily into the settlement and landscape pattern of greater york or its immediate UNK i just cannot identify a location where that could be where the roads the public transport the landscape or indeed the agricultural land quality from now onto five an area suitably large for that type of what would be a new town
and could i just say that i think that the issue of sustainability does also touch upon the need for the new settlement to be located on a public transport corridor preferably an existing public transport corridor and i think again that argument for s for somewhere where a rail link preferably could be provided and that of course would tend to support all those factors tend to support a location on the northern side of york rather than the southern side of york
that's it
can i pursue one point you've made mr courcier you say there is nowhere in the york area where a settlement of say five thousand
five thousand dwellings
dwellings could be accommodated given that the world is not going to stop in two thousand and six
and an assumption and it is only an assumption at this stage that york has a tight greenbelt by that time statutory
isn't it a bit short sighted to th to plan to come up against what if you're right would be a brick wall
it won't be us at the next e i p but aren't you UNK the same problem
well i
for the next panel
i think there are two points there firstly i think that the york greenbelt should not be drawn UNK tightly it should allow for some provision for peripheral post two thousand and six because there will be inevitably demands arising in that period which cannot be met in the new settlement and i disagree with the county council on their approach on that matter
would also be wise for any new settlement which you chief specify that any new settlement you may recommend should also include some provision for expansion land and my point i think is that you could not divide a settlement as big as five thousand i think it would be reasonable to say a new settlement make with a an UNK capacity of say three and a half thousand that might be appropriate around greater york
you couldn't
find that could you
i think one could find something of that order
i think five thousand is just too large and if there were a need post two thousand and six for a larger for a for further development and tadcaster two of the UNK
so are you saying then effectively that looking towards the post two thousand and six scenario and bearing in mind that review will not be let will is likely to take place at the most within the next five years
yes
erm then it may well be for the benefit of greater york that you might be looking at more than one settlement
well certainly i don't think at this point there is a need for more than one settlement
no
mm there may be a need post two thousand and six for a further settlement we won't know until we see we don't know the strategic policy context in which that decision will be taken nor of course exactly what sort of demographic requirements may be arising in that period
mhm
most certainly at this point i don't see any need for a second new settlement
no
thank you
mr brighton
i just wanted er paul brighton barton willmore planning partnership
i just wanted to erm pick up on a couple of points that er people have made in the course of a and responses i think to my er opening statement
i'm sorry people can't hear you at the back
i'm sorry i just wanted to make a couple of points in response to erm things that people have said in relation to my opening statement erm mr brook er mentioned the fact that er none of the UNK none of the new settlement proposals of which he was aware erm included an employment element erm i just wanted to place on record the fact that our suggested UNK of policy h two does provide for an explicit land er amount of land for employment purposes erm as part of the new settlement location i wanted to say that because i i'm not invited to appear on your employment day and i do feel that this is an important component of the h two strategy and clearly that employment component will be drawn from the greater york allocation the second point mr UNK erm i believe said that in his view you could not find a site for a larger new settlement er within the or outside the greater york er greenbelt erm which would not result in physical coalescence with the existing villages in the area now i'm not sure whether he was referring to any particular size of larger new settlement but i invite you to look at the er land range at one to fifty thousand er map of the area and you will see that the area outside the greenbelt is UNK by erm a very rural area with UNK villages and my believe is that there are erm sites available within that area which could accommodate a larger new settlement the planning point is of course the larger the new settlement becomes i think the less that the reduced number of sites you will have available to accommodate erm that proposal because of its scale and the third aspect i want to comment on mr cunnane and mr thomas erm said that barton willmore had not made a need argument for the new settlement well if i'm not UNK that's what we spent most of this morning discussing under policy h one and i don't erm i don't wish and i don't suppose that i'd be invited to repeat the comments made by mr grigson this morning i don't think there's any need for that but that UNK in our mind very clearly there is a need for a new settlement in the range of two thousand to two thousand five hundred dwellings erm in the period up to two thousand and six and i won't say anything more on that
thank you
yes i mean i took your need figure to be on the basis of the suggested figure of twelve thousand seven hundred for the greater york area
thank you correct
mr whip
i'm not i don't think you're a resident of one of these UNK villages but can we have UNK is it
flaxton
no flaxton parish council george whip
the views of flaxton parish council are supported by flaxton village trust
most of my comment will be related to the methodology of selection of the site of any new settlement and not to the question of need which we're now addressing ourselves to
but i don't think reference has been made to a document that is referred to in p g one namely the doc the white paper this common inheritance er d o e document and in that there's a clear indication that this question of a new settlement erm should be considered paragraph six point four eight reads however well urban land is used there will continue to be a need for building on UNK sites it is important that new housing on such sites is carefully placed to preserve the open countryside and respects the quality of the landscape
here again there are local choices to be made one option is the creation of new villages or larger settlements which could offer opportunities for high quality design and also relieve pressures on existing towns and villages
the government believes that this is an option which should be considered by planning authorities and local communities in the preparation of their plans
in my opinion that supports the line taken in the revised version of p g three which i don't think UNK the enthusiasm of central government for a new settlement consideration as compared with its predecessor p g three
the view of flaxton is that the greenbelt should be kept tight round the urban area of york city and it is because of that view that we think whether there is a need for a new settlement depends basically on the numbers game into which we cannot go
mhm
could we have a copy of that er quote from common inheritance
if you'd arrange with the er erm secretary later
thank you
er mr UNK
ken UNK d o e
i'm sure sir you're not expecting me to make a major contribution to this particular debate but i felt that your the various comments have been made around the table which would make it exactly clear where the department stands on this issue
as we say in our paper we use the phrase UNK supportive of the concept
those words were carefully chosen as i'm sure you'd expect them to be
our UNK st with this project started way back in nineteen eighty nine went into a series of meetings which most recent i attended at the greater york authorities we learnt the full scale and extent of the housing land problems in the greater york area we of course have no part in the decisions which have been made by the greater york authorities nor in the plans they subsequently made for the york greenbelt but clearly we remain closely interested in the outcome
we heard what mr er davis had to say this morning and at one point was very important we are expecting to be in possession of reports on the greenbelt local enquiry and your report er round about the same time and indeed since they are in control of proceedings thereafter they are in a position to make sure that they don't have to reach decisions on one until they are in possession of the other
in relation to the concept of a new settlement the department very firmly has an open mind at a time we've heard many statements drawing on the various p g s and from some of them you might have been UNK for thinking that the department had indeed turned it turned its back on the idea of a n new settlements knowing that sort of situation we felt it appropriate before the start of this examination to sound out the residents of two UNK street
which we did and i'm pleased to say that they endorsed that general position in other words their not going to come to a conclusion whether or not they should take any part in the proceedings whether they should intervene or seek to stop the project until much later in the day
we see we see this forum as very much the right sort of forum for either making or breaking the case for a new settlement the one thing i do have to say however is that the department wants to see this particular issue settled in the context of the alteration and full significance of that isn't immediately apparent it what we don't want to see is what was envisaged in the h b f statement where they thought that we might end up with a decision to have a new settlement in principle and then leave it open to the local plans all four of them around the city to then explore the possible alternative locations
that's not how we see it sir we see the issue of the location of the new settlement as very much a strategic issue which should be settled in the structure plan context and not left to local plans to decide
the words are there in the bi in the relevant p g but i'm sure you're familiar with them er this is very much an issue which falls to be decided at the strategic level
that does of course pose one or two problems as far as the locational aspects of the new settlement are concerned as i understand it neither the county council nor the relevant district councils have UNK on the question of location they've not yet embarked on the detailed exercise which will be necessary to identify a preferred location
but in our eyes that exercise needs to be conducted before the plan reaches its final approval
just how that's going to be UNK we don't know we're not party to the discussions we understand that the greater york authorities do plan to meet shortly after the end of this examination but just what further work is necessary before they then get onto the location aspects we don't know about that all i would say is that we would expect final plan to have the general location of a new settlement embodied in that plan before it is approved
it's obviously too early for me to judge whether in the absence of such a definition the department seek to intervene but in the word in the light of what is said in the current p g i think that must be a possibility but for the moment sir we have very much have an open mind and we obviously like everyone else are looking forward to your conclusions on this issue
thank you
thank you for putting the ball in my court
you'd better take it back again
i'm not sure whether to bat it back to you but no i won't
mr grantham
er john grantham c p r e erm just coming back to the to the general questions you asked earlier about erm consistency with guidance and p g three in particular erm in the written evidence we we've addressed that and i don't wish to go over that ground short of saying that i feel the contribution from er mr jewitt which was UNK particularly helpful in that regard in i think explaining erm how government guidance is different now to when to how it was er at the earlier deliberations of the greater york authorities and i feel that that's very important consideration erm i'd like to restrict my comments just to two points and they both really refer to things that were introduced by the representative from barton willmore
erm mr brighton was critical of the county council in just using the residual method to determine the size of the new settlement er and then in backing up that justification erm referred to work that is included in barton UNK proof i've i have read this survey work quite carefully and my understanding of it is that erm by un undertaking a survey of settlements in the county they have established albeit f for information purposes only a population UNK for a particular type of service erm in the north yorkshire context erm the implication i understand from that is that is being used to justify a fourteen hundred figure or whatever it is to achieve the level of services that would be required for a balanced integrated community to use the words for the guidance
i think the b w the barton willmore analysis appears to UNK the fact and again mr jewitt referred to this when he referred to easingwold that settlement UNK over time and nobody seems to be addressing the point that fourteen hundred fifteen hundred two thousand houses however many it is won't appear over night erm er th it would take some time for that to be to be realized erm and as part of that there's no clear view as to when the services will come along that are that are necessary to give that community the balance it said it requires erm mr timothy from wood UNK referred i think to a figure of twelve fifty dwellings for a viable new settlement and there were plenty ex of examples quote erm that one could look at to see that was the case erm i i'd be interested to know where those examples are an and what there make up erm is
just as an aside thi this is an issue that's currently being UNK with by UNK city council where the circumstances are erm albeit on a slightly smaller scale similar with the historic city and they are commissioning research on this very subject of service pro provision in new settlements
my second point and it refers to again er something that barton willmore referred to and that's the question er an engine of growth and it seems to me that such a settlement would become an en engine of growth in the countryside not least because of the it would become self fulfilling er and it would be the obvious sort of sink hole as mr thomas said for subsequent land allocations i think erm this point has been touched upon by both the representatives from leeds city councils and from cleveland leeds city council appear not to want it in the leeds york corridor for just that reason the representative from cleveland who unfortunately isn't here today erm doesn't want it in the north of the county for what i understand to be to be that same reason erm and the inspector at the stone UNK erm enquiry in UNK and i do refer th to this in my evidence he drew a very similar conclusion about this when he said and i quote once UNK once established the new town would generate a momentum of growth that would be difficult to contain such growth if allowed could further harm the rural character of the countryside and the villages in this part of UNK i think that conclusion can be applied to north yorkshire and i certainly haven't heard anything that would convince me that such growth once it started could be controlled and indeed the record of controlling growth against erm projected requirements in the structure plan to date has not been good witness earlier comments on the structure plan UNK
i think just to conclude the engine of growth argument erm has obviously been raised in relation to other new settlements UNK cambridge and this has been referred to already erm the situation in cambridge is different to york in that the level of growth that's anticipated for that city is significantly higher and the new settlement erm proposals there have been considered in that regard and just for the record c p r e have supported the new settlement in that particular location but it does seem to me that the returning to your basic point that erm if one applies those circumstances in nor north yorkshire it does fly in the face of established policy in the structure plan and the overriding er policy is one of restraint in what is considered to be one of the country's most sensitive environmental areas thank you
thank you
er mr brook and then mr curtis
UNK brook UNK brook associates
er i'd just like to come back on three fairly brief points that er one of which was mentioned by michael courcier two of which er relate to that and were UNK in discussion during the tea break erm michael courcier i think if i got him right said he did say we can't produce demographic forecasts for post two thousand and six but i think he was fairly UNK in saying it wouldn't be wise or whatever erm i would suggest in this context and in the context of and i use the word emerging and i look for advice as to when emerging regional planning guidance and when will be the end date of that regional planning guidance i say we should be looking beyond two thousand and six i say we can look beyond two thousand and six and i would suggest we do it in the way of arrange which would be highly appropriate way of doing it not too UNK to road traffic forecasts low medium and high growth and if to put the point UNK if we have arrived at a requirement figure of nine seven for greater york for a specific period if we were to either project that forward by five or ten years obviously we couldn't just simply go UNK but if you took a low figure and you UNK it on the basis of the make up the demographic make up of how the nine seven had been arrived at it would be possible to produce a range that then relates to the question of a new settlement and the alternatives during the period to two thousand and six and beyond of that new settlement and i go back again to the greenbelt it is vitally important to do that in the terms of a long term defined greenbelt therefore again in that context i would say it is highly desirable if not necessary to revisit the UNK of york it has not been examined in a local plan it has not been examined in terms of environmental impact with all due respect to the greater york working party their the level of analysis of those peripheral blocks of land was fairly UNK on a limited number of planning criteria if a new settlement is to be assessed alongside expansion of greater york we have to revisit it in much greater detail
the final point is in terms of UNK when could any new settlement actually produce housing
a number of criteria would relate to that and we simply it isn't appropriate i know sir to go into the detail of that but i UNK briefly certain questions
assuming a fair wind on major infrastructure access and drainage it is unlikely that a new settlement would be producing a significant group of UNK until somewhere around at the very best end ninety six into the of ninety seven period in that context what is happening in that short intervening period assuming certain planning guidance comes forward to help that intervening period and will that new settlement actually be built out prior to two prior to two thousand and six will the fourteen hundred dwellings be built in that period question mark probably not it will lap over therefore in that context of a gap at the beginning and a potential overlap at the end it is very important again to revisit the peripheral land issue
i'll point those latter questions in the direction of mr davis to pick up in his UNK remarks on this discussion
as to r p g er and its birth mid december mr UNK
UNK d o e
perhaps
and the end date is two thousand and six as i remember it
that's the idea sir
yes thank you
there's two points in answer for you mr brook
er mr timothy and then mr brighton
there's mr curtis
sorry mr curtis i'll forget
thank you chair
david curtis york city council
erm two er three points would i like erm picking up a couple of comments earlier and coming back to a i think if we use a UNK analogy a long hop i'd like to bowl at you chair and you may hit it in mr UNK direction
comment was made this morning er earlier on by mr timothy about the fact that the new settlement would be likely to generate a higher usage of transport than is the norm for greater york if i understood him correctly erm knowing the public transport system in greater york erm i fail to see how he could possibly come to that conclusion because bus services in the rural part of greater york are very poor clearly that's partly because of the distribution of the rural population and i fail to see that a settlement of the size being suggested would actually generate a level of usage of public transport any higher than that which ex already exists in the york in flat and certainly no higher than exists within the UNK existing urban area
the second point i is this issue about self containment er mr davis accused me this morning of using some somewhat UNK words i think erm i did obviously refer to the er my vision of what a new settlement of this size proposed would be and i didn't in that mean to imply that i didn't in that mean to imply that i didn't expect that with the right planning that it couldn't have clearly local facilities local school library etcetera but it seemed to me quite clear that the scale proposed it would not have the higher order functions which as we've heard earlier greater york has been defined based on UNK planning assumptions clearly the major shopping educational and social facilities will continue to be provided in the city and it will produce what is in effect UNK settlement
the point made by mr bishop about employment shopping and other land i also wish to respond to i think one of the other participants did mention the issue of existing provision it's been quite clear from the work of the greater york authorities that certainly shopping terms there is an UNK of shopping companies in and around the edge of the urban area at the present time we have a number of major outstanding UNK which have not yet been taken up
there is actually more than enough land already available to within the main urban area to provide the types of facilities that mr bishop was saying were not currently available
and the long hop as it were sir it maybe er not an appropriate time to ask about but i think it's important to understand certainly i would like to understand that if this panel this enquiry doesn't establish the location for the new settlement mr UNK is implying that should be agreed before the plan is adopted by the county council
at what point after this panel finishes sitting then will the issue be discussed in a public forum of this type or is mr UNK saying the county council can of itself determine that issue without further public examination
thank you
that's not a long hop that's a UNK
i think what mr UNK was saying at the end of the day is that the inspector's report and the conclusions on the greenbelt local plan will go back to the parent authority the UNK authority which is north yorkshire equally my UNK report out recommendations on this alteration go back to north yorkshire they have to take regard to whatever we recommend ultimately they will take a decision on that erm depending on the decision other things may flow from it and i can't really speculate on what those are at the moment but effectively the final decision as to what they accept or reject will rest with north yorkshire
can i suggest though that there is using the cricket UNK again a long stop role UNK by the secretary of state
alright
mr timothy
jus just three brief points
firstly responding to mr grantham and his reference to UNK a city where i work and live erm
the UNK perhaps it's worth UNK how UNK came to look at the new settlement option because it has some relevance to york
c can i just stop you there and say is it relevant
it's absolutely relevant
to anything we're going to consider about a new settlement around york
absolutely because in york in sorry in UNK you have a confirmed greenbelt right up to the boundary they were pursuing a local plan for the li the city of UNK in isolation from the rest of the district and there they were promoting seven hundred and fifty houses to be taken out of the greenbelt
the inspector who reported on that UNK city local plan said go away leave your UNK city plan and look at the options beyond the greenbelt including erm the possibility of a new village and i think that's the point here instead of rolling back the greenbelt you should be looking beyond you know what is the general extent of the greenbelt to see what options are available just coming on then to the size point again that mr grantham raised i have through erm experience both in the cambridge situation which i referred to extensively erm in my statement and in east UNK where we are promoting a plan er a site for a new village which is included in the deposited plan we've looked in both the cambridge and the er east UNK situation bo at service provision both from speaking to the providers of those services and whether or not they need a specific facility in the settlement and from the developers point of view that if you've got a pot of money what can you afford to erm provide within a settlement of that size and the conclusions we are UNK er sort of reaching are a du a settlement of the order of twelve fifty dwellings can support your primary school community centre erm a range of shops and so on and so forth so what i'm saying in my submission that the an appropriate size is in the thousand fifteen hundred mark is that were you can get a reasonable co balance of community facilities and provide the relevant infrastructure in terms of services
and it's going back to the point that mr curtis i think misunderstood me that's basically that if you concentrate new growth in one location you have the ability to plan to serve that development by public transport whereas if you spread it out to all the points of the UNK you know two hundred houses in one direction of york two hundred in the opposite direction would become very mor more difficult to serve than would a concentrated er chunk of development and that's as simple as that
not so simple but never mind
yes
mr brighton
paul brighton barton willmore paul brighton barton willmore planning partnership
you asked sir a little earlier for a definition of integrated and balanced community and erm i'm disappointed that er you didn't recall my paragraph three fifteen of my submission to you were i set out erm i thought erm
my senses are UNK having read all this material
erm where i set out my interpretation of what that means and i don't think it's very helpful to read that out to you but i think you will find that it's er erm a very broad er description of what the new settlement should be seeking to achieve now mr erm i think has misunderstood our position on this question of erm the appropriate size for the new settlement and i think if i'm correct he suggested that we were promoting a size of fourteen hundred the point i think i would make is that the larger the new settlement erm the greater the range and the quality of services and facilities that can be provided and i think you have to distinguish between what developers say they are prepared to provide on the one hand in a new settlement whatever the size the quality of the retail or UNK social facility that UNK that physical provision and also its long term viability and i would suggest that a larger new settlement of the size that we are suggesting is much more likely to er attract a range of quality providers of services and facilities than a smaller new settlement and also mr grantham er raised the issue of the question of the development program and what might be expected in terms of services and erm during the development program and of course i think that would be a matter for any specific proposal or a ma a matter of discussion between the local planning authority concerned and the developer and i would expect it to be something erm that was included within a section one o six agreement
finally erm various terms have been erm thrown around about new settlements being an engine of growth and a UNK for future growth erm the only point i want to make there is that any future growth beyond the present structure plan period of two thousand and six would of course be subject to the planning system there is no automatic erm growth erm of any new settlement that is proposed or may be proposed beyond two thousand and six and mr davis has indicated that at that time a new study will be carried out on the relative merits of the alternative options that were seen at that time
thank you
thank you
it's alright thank you
er yes chairman thank you
terry heselton selby district
erm won't take up much time chairman because i think most of the points i want to cover have already been covered by previous speakers
erm simply to remind you of the position of selby district in that our interest in a new settlement emerged out of concern for the quality of life in existing villages in selby district and concerns for the impact of future peripheral development in those villages and not just peripheral development on the edge of york although of course we acknowledge that as an important consideration and it is for that reason that we fully supported the county council's proposals in relation to greenbelt erm you asked the question earlier in relation to the p g advice and the six criteria erm in fact i've already UNK that argument in my submission so i won't repeat it now erm the fact that you chose to phrase the question that way i'll take as a good UNK as to the way i presented my submission but it it's there for you to read again the main point that i want to address is something that was raised by mr UNK yesterday and that was the difference or not as between selby district and hambledon district er m mr UNK made reference earlier to his opposition to the new settlement and in doing so he mentioned the settlement pattern in hambledon district he'll correct me if i'm wrong but one of small dispersed villages well in selby district we do have villages of that nature but the northern part of selby district is significantly UNK to hambledon it's UNK by much larger villages and in fact the establishment of a new settlement wouldn't conflict with the settlement pattern at all
i can well understand m mr UNK concerns erm i think the simple fact of the matter is that not a great deal of greater york new housing demand is likely to be generated in hambledon district whereas in selby district a significant amount of er demand is likely to be generated so really by way of conclusion i would like through you to ask mr jewitt if his opposition to the new settlement is as a matter of principle or whether he's really stating the case for hambledon district in other words would he object to a new settlement in selby district
i leave mr jewitt to answer that question
mr jewitt
michael jewitt hambledon district council
erm i think i answered this question this morning in response to erm miss UNK erm er question to me erm UNK objection to the principle of a new settlement is based upon erm our interpretation of p g three we feel that as i said it would be UNK of us to support the principle at this stage knowing that we were UNK to accept a new settlement in hambledon
erm we wouldn't want the policy to progress so far erm as to get to the stage of looking for a specific site and for us to pull the rug underneath the county and for other authorities to pull the rug from underneath the county at that stage erm to answer to mr UNK specific question of course we wouldn't object to a new settlement er in selby but erm it doesn't erm it doesn't UNK from our objection to erm the principle of the policy the way the UNK expressed
so putting it another way you don't agree with the principle of a new settlement but if it happened to be found elsewhere other than hambledon you'd let it ride
that's correct chairman
thank you
satisfied mr heselton
erm to a degree
that's the most you can hope for
thank you very much
erm pursuing now i'm going to ask whether there are any more comments on this particular part of this issue
because i would like to move on but i have got i have got some outstanding questions to ask er mainly directed at the districts and the county of course
but does anyone else want to make a contribution
or do you think we've covered enough ground
can i can i then come back to p g three
there
which one
here
yes it's alright
expansion of existing towns and
why not
well that's in the
yes
for the county
relevant to everybody else
aha
it's not specifically for the county
mhm
we come back to in fact it's the first par again it's the first part of thirty three that you have looked at the question or the possibility of expanding existing towns and villages and as i read it you have rejected that er and therefore you see the only satisfactory method of providing land to meet the figures for the greater york would be by a new settlement this is the outstanding balance
why
why have you done that
are you satisfied that you've done enough examination of your existing towns and villages to come to that conclusion
mr jewitt
erm thank you chairman
er michael jewitt hambledon district
erm i cannot speak for other districts and they are a far
no i only want you to speak for yourself
yes
okay
and they have a far greater proportion of the greater york area than we do erm as i outlined we just have three relatively modest villages erm our we do have a concern erm on this in that we don't ac given there's a district and an area have not be identified we don't feel that there has been a comparative assessment of the two options we don't dispute that they may well be harm er from peripheral development around other UNK around settlements in other districts we acknowledged other district council's concerns and indeed these are arguments we have used ourselves on the scale of development in hambledon er but we don't feel that there has been a properly balanced assessment of the two options
it occurs to me for example that given that all we've heard this afternoon about the fact that a new settlement and again i'm playing UNK advocate that if it were possible to build onto an existing settlement the quality of life of those who lived in the new settlement might in fact be better than if they were to put it UNK finding themselves in the middle of a field
what i'm really searching for is a bit more evidence from the c all participants as to why the principle of expanding an UNK existing settlement has been rejected i well appreciate that those who lived in the settlement that was chosen would not like it but that's not the point i'm getting at is there nothing in this principle of building on what's there
mr courcier
mr courcier
michael courcier
i think that's a very good question i think though that has been looked at very thoroughly by the county council and certainly there are only a very limited number of options available around york which would actually meet the needs of york
and one looks at the two most likely existing settlements on which you could do that to are of course easingwold to the nor to the UNK and tadcaster to the south
in terms of easingwold i have a client who owns about forty acres who would be delighted with that solution but erm i don't think that easingwold could support that level of development if we're talking a around about two thousand dwellings without very substantial harm to its character and setting
this is a historic town i disagree with mr jewitt upon the emphasis he gives to that but i do agree with him that a limit the type the scale of growth which that solution would imply would be UNK would be very extremely harmful to the town
it also must be remembered er that the transport links to easingwold would not be good enough to support that level of development it does not have a rail station and it does it and the a nineteen is only a single carriageway road and would need UNK need UNK with mr jewitt upon re 1
now wouldn't necessarily suggesting that the existing settlement would have to sustain all of the addition given only what it's got at the moment
i'm sorry
it could have it could have some more shopping it could have another primary school it could have a rail link or some other public transport link
michael courcier
i fully i fully accept that er you would obviously build in the facilities which are necessary but the most of the settlements are limited by existing physical and other constraints and those cannot be overcome you cannot UNK the a nineteen as far as easingwold without very substantial harm for example to the open countryside even if it were physically possible and economically possible to expand easingwold sorry to expand tadcaster to the required size we'd need to roll back greenbelt boundaries again contrary to p g two
it er it we certainly the expansion of tadcaster has been looked at quite thoroughly though not only by the local authorities but by the private sector and the and i think the agreement has been that it is not possible at the scale which is required to meet the needs of greater york
thank you
would mr cunnane and the district planning officer for the tadcaster area that's selby concur with the views expressed by mr courcier
do you want to add anything to it mr cunnane
i do wish to add one point
yes
er joe cunnane er actually sorry two points erm
i represent ha that's not i hope that's UNK
i represent erm the er the brewery which is located in tadcaster and erm i can i can er say without hesitation to this panel that erm the brewery object most strongly or would object most strongly to any suggestion that a level of population growth suggested UNK should be accommodated
tadcaster is a UNK has a population of around six thousand at the moment and if the s the level of increase that is proposed were su were imposed upon tadcaster you would be talking about a fifty percent increase in the size of the town
that would be impossible to accommodate without major adverse effect up what is a historic town almost entirely er located within a conservation area and as mr curtis said erm constrained by the greenbelt the final point is er it is located within the a sixty four corridor and it is inevitable that it would serve the needs of leeds rather than the needs of york if it were expanded in that way
okay
terry heselton selby district
this is perhaps one of those rare occasions where i almost agree with mr cunnane
perhaps not quite to the level of the development that may be appropriate but yes of the three market towns in selby district it's acknowledged that tadcaster would have a less significant role than the other two market towns if i can put it that way and yes there are a number of constraints in tadcaster not the least of which i is an ownership constraint
thank you
mr jewitt while we pose the question about easingwold
michael jewitt hambledon district council
erm i find myself agreeing with what mr courcier said er about hambledon i don't think it realistic to expect existing UNK villages within the area of search to form a nucleus for a new settlement they're simply too small and would be UNK by any development and also the er i stand by the statements made yesterday about the environmental quality of the settlements about there form UNK and characters and i really don't think that they could form the nucleus of a new settlement
with regard to easingwold well of course easingwold is at present outside the area of search erm but again i do agree with what mr courcier has said it would be a doubling the size of easingwold is a small market town of high environmental quality the existing form and pattern of development within easingwold erm exercise constraints over the scale of future development the central area is of a certain size of a certain quality it's got a certain amount of capacity to accept further development and i don't believe that a erm UNK a fur further fourteen hundred houses could be fitted in to that existing infrastructure without serious harm
thank you very much yes thank you
mr curtis
david curtis york city council
i thank you chair i mean clearly i have to ask for a little bit of license on this one in that i have to comment on things outside of my own district erm but you will not be surprised to hear given my evidence earlier that the city council's view is quite clearly that there is sufficient land with on the edge of york the main urban area which could accommodate this type of level of development and UNK the need for a new settlement in the structure plan period i accept however of course that is dependant upon the definition of the inner boundary of the greenbelt if the city council's view on that is er acceptable then inspector i believe there will be sufficient sites to UNK the need for a new settlement clearly if the inspector takes a UNK view on the greenbelt then there will be little land opportunity within the main urban area for this
well i mean you know just forget your admin boundary at the moment i mean would you concur with the views expressed about tadcaster and easingwold
i
just as a planner never mind where you're working
i would be surprised if either of those settlements could accommodate the level of development being suggested in a satisfactory way
thank you very much
now mr smith ryedale
ian smith ryedale
erm on the question of whether or not we're satisfied that we've done enough examination to reach our conclusion we've examined our greenbelt boundaries on two occasions firstly as part of the greater york study and secondly as part of the work on the southern ryedale local plan
the district council has accommodated the highest proportion of greater york growth of all the districts surrounding york over the last ten years and therefore i think it likely that it would expected to accommodate the largest proportion of the fourteen hundred dwellings that would be accommodated in the new settlement erm i do not think that any of the settlements or that there is sufficient land within the southern ryedale area to accommodate that level of development without UNK affecting character of the settlements or UNK greenbelt objectives as i mentioned this morning and also i question whether or not erm whether th most of the settlements in the southern ryedale area have only a minimal s minimal service base anyway on which to tack any large housing UNK and i don't necessarily UNK any subsequent rise in the service base of those settlements as a result of the housing being added on to them
and thinking about your district i mean places like UNK and UNK are too far away to be satisfactorily considered are they
ian smith ryedale district
yes they're erm i mean there erm UNK what thirty minutes drive from york UNK probably forty five up to an hour
yes
thank you
yes
but he hasn't said whether he accepts the settlement
he doesn't
alright okay
come back to that one
okay
mr frost
UNK frost er harrogate borough council
just to complete the picture on the districts around york erm and in answer to the issue raised by er miss UNK i think the villages in erm the harrogate sector of greater york are all far too small to erm act as a nucleus for the size of development we're talking about here er the largest of them upper UNK probably has about seven hundred to eight hundred houses and that i think would be UNK and lose its character and also possibly suffer from coalescence with the nearby york urban area if er large amounts of additional development were UNK onto it
er i'm also concerned that the services in er even a village that size would be erm overwhelmed by the demands of erm large scale development but that's the largest there are a range of other settlements which are mostly much smaller and even much less able to accommodate or act as a nucleus for large scale development
i would like to emphasize that erm the greater york authorities haven't lightly arrived at erm the strategy for a new settlement er we have been driven to it by a very careful examination of the development possibilities firstly around the edge of york and secondly around the various villages we know these areas erm UNK from our day to day planning work and on two occasions once in connection with the greater york study and secondly in connection with drawing detailed greenbelt boundaries we have UNK around the edges of all these settlements and looked very carefully at the possibilities for development erm the possibilities have been taken up in the development equation which the county council has put in front of you which does still include er some development around villages and around the edge of the city without UNK greenbelt but we don't really think we can go much further and that's what has driven us to the conclusion that er a new settlement must play a part in the longer term development equation for greater york
thank you
thank you
mr cunnane
joe cunnane i'm sorry but er chairman but i did actually miss probably the most important point i should have made about tadcaster
and that is that it is
it's never too late
never no and that is that it is constrained by a very tight village envelope which has actually just been defined and UNK approved as an alteration to the rural areas local plan erm and th the effect of that village envelope is to limit the possible amount of development to i would say no more than three or four hundred house
thank you
chairman
er terry heselton UNK selby district
just er for clarification that is indeed the case as mr cunnane says but the erm the village envelopes were brought forward by way of an alteration to the adopted rural areas local plan which will take us up to nineteen ninety six erm we will possibly have to look and review some of those envelopes in connection with the emerging local plan
thank you very much
sorry to sound a little UNK on that issue but i we really wanted to have a clear indication of what you felt as district planning officers er an and indeed we'll hear what the county feel and in fact have pursued through this alteration but can i again just for clarification and in fact it's a sort of final head count er and again i raise this in the context of p g three paragraph thirty three and that is the degree of UNK or otherwise by the local planning authorities erm and i only need a nod from you or otherwise for the record
york i take it are not in favour of a new settlement
you don't have to go over the arguments i've heard that
ha selby are in favour
correct
ryedale are in favour in principle
hambledon not in favour
either in principle or in detailed allocation but wouldn't object if it went somewhere else
i'm not being rude
and harrogate in favour
thank you
mr cunnane is that up for some reason that flag of yours
no
now UNK now unless there are any participants that want really burning to make a comment er i feel that we have settled well we've had enough discussion on little a i've got enough well i've got enough from you in terms of your views about size of settlement and mr brighton has pointed me again in the direction of his submission about er the definition of an integrated and balanced community i would like to know er from mr davis whether he UNK with that sort of interpretation and i have a feeling that we have also had an expression generally that at the moment one settlement is probably appropriate if you have to have a new settlement
fair
is that a fair conclusion
i did add that rider just
mr davis can you would you like to sum up and pick up these points and before i'm going to bowl you a UNK here erm you have talked about fourteen hundred as the size for the new settlement erm is that the top figure or is that a figure to which you might aim by the year two thousand and six but may have potential for growth beyond it
can i add that to my list
er peter
yes
davis er north yorkshire
i want at the end erm chairman to give you my views of what is meant by er an integrated and balanced community because i think that's quite important but before i do that i'd like to UNK up one or two er points right at the end in response to some of the contributions that have been made and i'll deal with them UNK curtis brook er and thomas if that's acceptable er to you and really as far as mr UNK is concerned he's quite properly raised the issue of procedural issues about how the greater york authorities is going to address moving towards er an agreed location and quite clearly i've got to UNK again that the county council will want to look at both the greenbelt local plan report and your panel report before er it moves erm er forward or looks at any conclusions it may be moving to in the light of those er in the light of those reports and quite clearly as we all know there are a number of options
er and i as mr curtis has suggested if mr shepherd who conducted the greenbelt local plan enquiry decided on massive relaxation or substantial relaxation on the inner boundary er of the greenbelt er and the implication being that er some of that land could be made available for housing then yes as a matter of principal that would cast doubt on the new settlement er strategy in terms of the in terms of the numbers UNK if you look at another option if you for example confirmed the new settlement strategy but thought that the development requirement for greater york really was er needed to be larger than nine thousand seven hundred dwellings twelve thousand thirteen thousand and i hope not then the county council would need to have a look at the issue of one as opposed to two new settlements and again we will do that and we will not take any decisions on the basis of having one report er but not another and i hope er that is helpful i can confirm that er at the end of this month the greater york authorities will be meeting erm and er they will be urgently looking towards erm progress erm on this issue
so that's really a very important UNK of what i said earlier
moving on to mr curtis i don't want to dwell and re er UNK the difference i had with mr curtis this morning but again he did start a little bit of a red herring running by talking about the major commitment for UNK facilities er there is a major commitment for UNK facilities in greater york er a degree of all provision
but the level of all provision of course is in terms of comparison goods and in terms of large shopping UNK
erm now i don't think anybody's suggesting that in er the greater york new settlement we would be likely to achieve a large shopping UNK at both ends one by marks and spencers er and the other by UNK or any o or bins or any other department store so he must really understand the process and really what we talking about er in north yorkshire
moving onto er to mr brook erm and really this leads into mr thomas mr brook er erm er advised us advised you that there was a very UNK look at er at sites during this five year exercise
well i can tell you sir that is incorrect there has not been a UNK look at sites as mr frost has already UNK
er the forty fifty sites in and around the urban area and in villages were looked at in detail as mr frost said by UNK around in terms of i think er twelve UNK although the part of er york city council's erm er evidence
as for long term projections er another issue raised by erm er mr brook er i think if we were to go beyond two thousand and six the debate we've had erm yesterday er what day is thursday er tuesday
and wednesday erm and to small degree today would pale into UNK and really er it might UNK to think about it to try and erm er to draw some sense out of er demographic data for the post two thousand and six er scenario the uncertainty would be so great that erm that er we certainly wouldn't er advice it
er and then finally on mr thomas er mr thomas erm a number of occasions has er has referred to these sites in and around the er urban area if mr thomas would like us to show us a list of those sites er we will look at them we've been through it on a number of occasions square inch almost by square inch but i'd be very interested for mr UNK list of sites in and around the urban area
now that does bring me on to another important issue and this is the definition of integrated er and balanced community
what does the county council mean by an integrated er and balanced community
i wouldn't define integrated and balanced individually i'd link them together because to me they appear to be er a concept that you move towards and the concept to me is shall we say to provide a balanced population structure which isn't biased to any one sector shall we say it's not an elderly it's not a retirement village there like perhaps you have in er certain parts of er north america and the second element of the concept is that it should provide a range of services compatible with its size but i qualify that by saying but not all the services that the people in that settlement require and this brings me back to my discussion debate with mr curtis
if the issue today in some people's eyes is the need for this community in greater york to be one hundred percent self sufficient then perhaps we really ought to go pack up and er go home er because there's no way that er a settlement that one could envisage in greater york or perhaps anywhere else can be a hundred percent self sufficiency self sufficient you're not going to get a shopping UNK you'd be unlikely to get a major UNK theatre so you cannot aim for a hundred percent self sufficiency you aim for what is appropriate for the size of the community and particularly its relationship to existing settlements er in the general area
you aim for a reasonable provision of jobs bearing in mind the job requirement er within that settlement and you aim for an appropriate range of social recreation and education uses erm er within the village so that on the basis of our proposal as we say in n y five you will expect to have a primary school
now i cannot say whether you will have a secondary school and the reason i cannot say that er is because the education authority will quite properly and quite reasonably look at the existing pattern of secondary education er in the area and will bear in mind that secondary school children not UNK as they do now can be expected erm to travel er some distance er to a school facility that is the real world you cannot expect a local education authority to spend vast amounts of money erm on er a high range of facilities which are not justified by the size er of the community and all these social recreation er an and education facilities appropriate to the size erm of the community need to be expressed in a pattern of land use which is well integrated and well designed in other words it's a good design concept er and how do you do that
well we think you do it through negotiation with developers on an agreed location and you do it through a brief
now that is the accepted way of doing it and i cannot see any reason why that cannot be done erm in greater york once the location for the new settlement is erm er is identified erm so that's my definition of erm integrated and balanced community it's a concept you can't define i don't think integrated and balanced separately you need to bind them together er into some erm er or all er erm concept erm now the erm the question you did pose me sir which er i did take a note of but i wonder if you'd be kind enough to repeat it so i've a i've a got it quite clear before i respond
well it the question was do you see the fourteen hundred dwellings for the new settlement as being the maximum size maximum desirable size or do you see that being possibly continued beyond two thousand and six
i don't have any view erm er on that if i understand your question because i think it realistic to assume that post two thousand and six one of the options that we could be reasonably expected to consider together with the district council is the possibility of a further shall we say how addition to a further phase er onto the new settlement erm so that the new settlement erm would UNK if that was the chosen option and as it evolved it may well be that more of mr david UNK higher level facilities er would be added
but it is an option that i certainly wouldn't want to discount at this particular er stage erm because it depends on so many er factors it depends for example whether er the site that er has been identified for up to two thousand and six and which is developed up to two thousand and six has the physical capacity to expand beyond two thousand and six and i think that ought to be one of the considerations perhaps that we ought to look at as we move towards the identification erm er of the new settlement UNK it could well be that ought to be looking at a second new settlement in a different location erm i can't give an answer a definitive answer what i can say is coming back again er to mr brook this sort of issue er will not be picked up in nineteen eighty eight or nineteen eighty nine er if we are all alive and kicking in north yorkshire and the district councils we will be looking at it regularly we'll be looking at it in two years time one years time erm that's the way we work in greater york and it's basically worked very successfully
thank you chairman
there was the outstanding question about the greater york area
yes
do you want to pick that one up now
yes indeed that
good
i think was er erm mr thomas and i think perhaps UNK on by the senior inspector as well er what is what is greater york to do with UNK erm
indeed
erm i think if you look back and again we could put a another paper in on this n y one which was erm sort of a background to the history of planning in greater york which er we did which i think malcolm UNK wrote for the for the greenbelt enquiry erm and that showed that in the well before nineteen seventy four of course there were four authorities involved in greater york
they were the north riding authority er the east riding authority the west riding authority all of which UNK on the on the city of york and as you read through the files er you will see that even then the d o e were trying to get erm those er those predecessor authorities in the late fifties early sixties er to come to some view about what ought to be better for greater york so for many years the idea of greater york ha has been current er in one UNK or another
what i see as being greater york is an area outside the city it's the city and an area outside the city which is socially and economically linked erm with the main urban area which is primarily in terms of employment er and other services the city now as mr thomas quite reasonably suggested erm things change
we defined the greater york area erm initially in the in the late seventies erm when we first ran a greater york exercise we UNK the area marginally in the middle late eighties erm and the definition that we have used for the greater york study since then er is the one that we are talking about now
now could argue that greater york could be bigger or smaller the local government commission erm er there report is a very interesting read i mean a number of the options that they've looked at would be a UNK er a city of york going out to the ring road erm that might be one option there's a there idea of greater york they did UNK they did see some merit in a greater york unitary authority based on the greater york planning study i think erm whether that is going to come to pass only mr UNK presumably er knows so my idea of greater york is that it's an area which is tied socially and economically to the city you could argue as mobility increases as the a ni nineteen is improved up through the county that really northallerton now is perhaps more within the sphere of influence of york than it was ten years ago erm e it was probably to a degree influenced by york even twenty years ago erm i don't think er there is much to be gained by debating where greater york ought to be the secretary of state previously hasn't been bothered about er UNK it er it seems to us to be the reasonable area and it's a combination of five districts erm who hopefully should be working together towards sorting out the er other problems of greater york
i understood its historical evolution what i was looking for i think and not an answer tonight tomorrow may be a better day was how does the area which you have defined for example now relate to journey to work patterns
hmm
erm what other rational is there behind this definition the reason this matters is th you will remember the chairman's opening remarks when we started on matter two that it seemed from the debate we had yesterday there was room within the county for the county council's proposed level of housing provision
mm
and therefore the question of the new settlement is UNK bound up with where that provision is in relation to you br definition of greater york
mm
erm i
i don't want to press for an answer tonight
yes
that may be something you want to think about can i also remind particularly the district councils those who request this morning for a different version of the h b f commitments statement
i think we'll get together peter davis with the districts on that particular point as far as the previous point erm madam erm then you can rest assured that er the county surveyor will be UNK out of his dinner tonight er erm when i get back with a view to er providing the information that you require
not necessary tuesday will do if it's that serious
yes don't spoil the county surveyors dinner please he might stop UNK
thank you mr davis

erm mr davis referred to n y one erm in his er statement there in the interests of saving paper i just wanted to er to state that it is included as appendix one
yes
this morning in our statement
i read that as well
well unless there are any other issues that people want to UNK any other items people want to raise on this issue i propose we close now resume at ten o'clock in the morning and we will go straight into matters well matter two c to look at the di criteria
thank you
can i remind you we will not be sitting after lunch tomorrow but what i would hope is we could probably deal with c and e in the morning b by one o'clock
we have got a flexibility factor on tuesday morning but if i can avoid that i would like to do it and i'm sure some others would as well
see you tomorrow
the question that most of today's youngsters seem to ask is what was life like in orkney when you were my age
well looking back on it now it seems almost a life time away but it's amazing just how well you can remember those far off days
i don't think that i shall every forget the day when sugar came off the ration and at last we could make UNK
prior to that the only way that you could get sweets was if you had the necessary ration UNK
and to this day i shall never be able to understand why so many of my generation by the time they were in their teens had a UNK of UNK because it was not due to eating sweets
and despite the wartime rationing the general health of the country by the end of world war two had never been better
however the one dark shadow on our lives in those days was the UNK growth of the number of people with tuberculosis which affected the lungs
the hospitals were UNK full of the flower of UNK youth and many UNK and UNK their way to an early death
however the arrival on the scene of wonder drugs developed in britain and america at long last UNK this disease which for decades had struck down young and old
one of the main carriers of the disease was found to be in milk and that's why today UNK tested dairy provide us with our daily UNK
by the nineteen fifties kirkwall had a new power station at the p d c and already the distribution lines were UNK out from kirkwall to bring mains electricity to the UNK areas of the mainland
but for many parts of orkney this new service would be years away in reaching them and so the familiar UNK of that diesel UNK generator filled the air
hundreds of these lighting plants were bought to light homes and UNK in the mainland and in the islands
agriculture was beginning to change dramatically as well and after two UNK which almost wiped out the UNK egg industry many farms built more substantial hen houses out of concrete blocks and the poultry were kept inside all the time in what was known as deep litter houses
it was also discovered that egg production could be UNK by leaving lights on in the houses all night to fool the hens into thinking that it was still daylight
the biggest UNK in the farm came with the arrival on the scene of a small grey tractor called a UNK and it seemed as though almost everybody had at least one and it became the jack of all trades on the farm and UNK which had previously been pulled by horses had their UNK removed and UNK were made to fit them behind the tractor
and when it wasn't working on the farm a transport on the back and a bag of straw to sit on and it became the family's personal transport
a new motor car was for many a luxury that would have to wait for another day
because already there was great interest in a new method of growing food for the farm cattle
it eliminated the need to grow acres of turnips or grain to feed the animals during the long winter months
apparently this new method had been tried out down south and it seemed ideal for the UNK orkney climate because you UNK when it was green and then you put it in a pit and packed it with a tractor and then you left it until it turned black and UNK and then you cut it up in UNK and fed it to the cattle
it was called UNK and to the careful orkney farmer it seemed all too good to be true
however a few were UNK with this UNK innovation and looking around the orkney countryside today well there's hardly a farm that doesn't have a covered UNK pit or a grain UNK and today the fields are full of barley and UNK rape and a field of turnips is something of a rare sight these days
the only horrible memory of the nineteen fifties that even today makes me UNK was that UNK of UNK liver oil followed by the concentrated orange juice that was UNK on us before leaving for the school in the morning and off you went with your UNK of tea and your sandwiches in your school bag
school meals were only to begin some four years later
at break time we would all UNK down to the village shop for a bottle of UNK of a bag of what was all the rage in those days potato UNK
none of your UNK in those days and the salt i remember came in a small piece of blue paper in the bag
by the mid nineteen fifties many UNK had begun the task of UNK their homes by building new ones a process which over the past three decades seems to have gone on with ever increasing UNK
in those days a new house was usually constructed out of wooden hut sections of which there was a UNK supply as most of the troops stationed here in the war lived in wooden UNK buildings and when they left orkney the buildings were UNK and then sold
and even today hut sections can still be bought and despite the fact that they're forty years old the quality of the wood in them is often better than what you can buy today
once the new house had been built is was often blocked in with a single course of concrete blocks and UNK enough today thirty five years later the modern method of building houses is to construct them all of wood and then UNK them with a single course of concrete blocks
so were we in fact years ahead of our time in house building i wonder
by the end of the nineteen fifties life in orkney had come full circle and like everyone else we had acquired a taste for the material things in life
and then on the twenty second of december nineteen fifty eight twentieth century technology arrived with the opening of the b c television UNK at UNK in ham and this electronic window in the world was to influence and change our lives beyond our UNK dreams
it's quite a while now since i've bored you with a few observations about our friends the dumb animals who share their lives with us on the planet and the more you observe them the more convinced you become that they're anything but dumb
i recently had an interesting encounter with the UNK and it only served to point out that regardless of size the degree of intelligence is quite extraordinary
one bright sunny morning recently i set about painting the front of the house with its yearly coat of white paint to UNK it up
and i decided to paint one part of the wall which had not been painted before
unknown to me a UNK had made a UNK in this part of the wall and not long afterwards i became aware of an angry UNK searching UNK for the entrance to its UNK
the sudden change of colour on the wall had upset its sense of direction and it UNK about UNK and eventually it came into the porch where i was sitting and it stayed there for a few minutes and then went outside searching the wall again for the entrance
and after failing to find it once again it came into the porch and complained UNK and so i went outside and with a paint brush i marked the entrance to the UNK with three UNK of paint of a different colour and then with a piece of cardboard i guided the tiny UNK towards the marks on the wall and it went inside
a few minutes later it emerged and flew off and then when it returned it looked at the wall and saw the marks and went inside
ample proof indeed that it had recognized them and it realized that it was the entrance to its home
another day i observed the UNK of a sea bird who had found a small UNK in one of those rock UNK on the beach below the house
and after several attempts to break the shell open by picking it up and dropping it onto the rocks well that didn't work so the bird picked it up and then from a about a height of twenty feet it dropped it onto the rocks below
well it must have been a tough old UNK because this didn't work either
and eventually in UNK the bird flew a short way down the beach and picked up a small stone in its UNK and then it returned and it UNK the shell repeatedly until it cracked it open and it was able to get at the contents inside
so you see human beings are not the only animals capable of using tools to get at their food
now sheep are animals that we tend to regard as being pretty stupid and most of the time they're UNK creatures who will run away at the slightest sound or sight of something strange in their midst
but at UNK time they take on a total change of character and they can sometimes become very aggressive
a mother UNK with two UNK in the field behind the house one morning demonstrated her strong UNK when she successful saw off a two year old steer with a series of savage head UNK
eventually this great UNK of a UNK turned UNK and UNK
human beings it seems are not the only animals who go in for UNK
the farm cattle have their gods too and anyone who leaves a car or a tractor and trailer parked in a field of cattle can observe that when such a vehicle appears it produces the most unusual reactions amongst the UNK
and that old theory that animals can't see colours is just not true because any vehicle which is black or red in colour appears to get more attention that any other
at first it will be surrounded and UNK and if it appears friendly then a good UNK follows and if this is accepted by the stranger then it's usually used for a good old scratch
and that's why you can expect to find the car in the morning with the windows all covered in UNK and the wing UNK all bent and the UNK strips on the doors are often with UNK of cow hair
and if the stranger has pleased the local cattle they will show their UNK by UNK the sides of the vehicle with a generous UNK of fresh UNK before they depart
a field of cattle are normally quiet UNK creatures and most of the time it's fairly safe to walk through their midst and they will observe your passing with that quiet UNK
however the one thing that you must never do is to go between a cow and her calf and i made this mistake one morning and i had to take to my UNK and run
and this started a UNK amongst the rest of the UNK and as i advanced down the field with them all in close pursuit i somehow managed to clear a four UNK wire fence like an UNK champion
so be warned
like human families the animal and the bird life have a order of UNK or what they call the UNK order and usually the more dominant member of the UNK is the oldest
and at UNK we have brigadier sydney the UNK and everybody else is kept firmly in place
but like most families while father appears to be the boss more often than not it's mother who usually has the last word
this morning i observed all of them returning home in single file after their dawn patrol around the valley and as usual mother was leading the way with father in the middle keeping the UNK youngsters in hand
when they reached their favourite bathing spot in the burn below the house they began the slow decent of the steep bank
however one of the youngsters at the back in his enthusiasm to reach the water UNK and fell over the one in front and this started a chain reaction in the column and the entire UNK landed at the bottom in a UNK of UNK feet and flapping wings
this UNK arrival at the bathing spot started off the most dreadful family UNK and several minutes were to UNK before order was restored
the more you observe the bird and the animal life you begin to realize that they're not so dump after all and if anything they begin to look and behave more like human beings every day
well good evening and welcome to central weekend our audience come from birmingham
thank you
we begin with the government agency which UNK to become poll tax
when the child support agency was set up it was UNK with almost universal approval making UNK pay seemed the order of the day
but an UNK of complaints has almost overwhelmed the c s a and it comes from UNK already paying out agreed sums for their kids
so what's gone wrong
tony you've been married before you have three children you know want to marry UNK there
what's stopping you
i was getting married till the c s a stepped in
now i can't afford to get married
i can't afford to work and i can't afford to see my children
what are you paying now for your children
er thirty pound a week
how much do they want
hundred and twelve
thirty to a hundred and twelve
yeah
in one UNK
yeah
and you can't afford to get married
no
UNK how does it feel for you to be told by civil servants how to conduct your life
well i actually rang them up to say why are you taking my wages into consideration i didn't break up this marriage i met him a long time afterwards an i was told by a c s a agent or clerk or whatever that my wedding was UNK spending
when i said i've got a wedding to pay for they said to me well can you think about cancelling it because it's UNK spending and i said
your wedding hang on your wedding was UNK spending
you were told that
yes i was
UNK spending
mhm
theresa UNK that's UNK
a girl's wedding is UNK spending
in my mind while you're talking is about these three children who presumably er this gentleman's wife was supposed to be looking after on thirty pounds a week
i think that's ridiculous
he didn't tell us how much money he UNK and he didn't tell us how much money he gave his wife when he was married to her and was looking after his own children
that's the kind of information which i think is relevant not whether he wishes to get married again that is a separate issue
but has a clerk got the right to tell a couple that their wedding is UNK spending
i rather think that they are concentrating on the main task which is to see that the children are properly provided for
well but you
what you want to do er what you want after that including UNK again is a separate matter his primary responsibility and i'm sure he would agree with this is to the UNK of those children
yes but the
and that is what matters
l let UNK respond er
in saying that at the end of the month if we do pay this amount of money i only earn five hundred pounds a month that's four hundred and forty eight pounds a month
now like i said before i didn't break up this marriage so this is a UNK hunt against people like myself second wives second partners
i can't even afford to have my own children
at the end of the month with our UNK and our UNK we're going to be in UNK of fifty seven pounds a month
and that doesn't include clothes or anything else
that is just the gas bill
theresa
the money
tell me how
tell me how to pay for my wedding
the UNK responsibility is to see that those children are properly paid for
no it's not it's not
rubbish
and out of the money it's your
their responsibility is to get five hundred and fifty million pounds that's their responsibility
no bu but do
alright let me ask UNK
but you asked me do you believe that your wife can look after children
ex wife
on thirty pounds
i pay thirty pounds
three children
but i also i also buy school UNK
three children
i also pay for school trips i take them out every weekend i give them pocket money
pocket money
it costs me fifty five pounds
but who do you think should pay to look after your children
pardon
if not yourself and your wife
not on thirty pounds
i do look after them i do look after them
what you're doing you're just UNK
a hundred a twelve pounds let let's get it right then
so this is the fifty per cent relationship
so that's a hundred and twelve he's expected to pay
is she taking in a hundred and twelve somewhere
is she
no
i'm earning it for her
i'm earning it for her that's not fair
let me ask UNK here UNK how's your marriage going
what marriage
well tell me about it
it's not worth a marriage no more because the c s a and because of people like them sat there that think they know it all
well tell us erm tell us about the payment and tell us what's happening to you and what you're gonna have to do
well my UNK have to leave so i'll claim income support and be as well off as his ex wife
and if he can't manage then it's up to him what he does
so my marriage has fallen apart because of these people sat here that think they know everything
own kids have grown up so it doesn't matter to them just live back in days and make you spend your money the way they tell you and live how you they tell you
are you two talking about splitting up
yeah
there's no other choice
or at least UNK the marriage
well th we'll have to split
up legally and then we'll still carry on seeing one another
but he we'll have to live apart we'll have to make us try and make our marriage work by living apart
is it really as dramatic as that
it is
because what they left me i cannot look after my wife and support my other two kids
plus i can't buy my kids t the first wife i can't buy them stuff now
christmas presents
sir UNK is this is this sort of thing UNK
well it's very sad when people have unhappy relationships as we've had described to us
i quite agree
but it wasn't
but why should why should millions
everything was okay till this happened this c s a
why should millions of UNK pay for your happiness
why should they have to pay
we pay our taxes as well
why should millions of UNK pay for your pay rise
for your wedding
yeah
why should the millions of UNK
this gentleman thinks that he can bring up a child
on a ten pounds a week it's nonsense
lot of money
you can bring them on
to bring up
everybody thought he must think first about the bringing up of the children
that's all i think about
and this couple over there must think first about the children
what about my children
there is no reason why i or
anybody else as UNK should pay five thousand million pounds that's every family in this country about three hundred pounds a year for lone parents who are not looking af being pa having the parents the father looking
that's just rubbish
after the children
we're gonna have far more lone parents
ex excuse me
hang on for a second please
one minute
everybody thought sir UNK
that's where the disgrace is that's where the disgrace is
sir UNK please
nobody the conservative
we
government that's implementing this child support act
that's right
there's nothing wrong with the child support act
everybody thought
look can we do one show here we're doing two at the moment
let's just do one
sir UNK
everybody thought please everybody thought
is the programme is f to hear you or to hear me
you asked me a question i gave an answer
it would be very it would be very UNK if you did try and answer a little bit UNK alright
a moment or two to answer a question not just five seconds
well it's only half an hour
everybody thought that this agency was for UNK
exactly
it appears that the UNK who are already paying are the one's who are paying and nobody seems to chasing after the others
now that's not true
six per cent are UNK fathers
there are te
six per cent are UNK fathers
th
now you tell me how that can be fair
well let him answer the question
there are two kinds of non payers
there are those who haven't been found and they are being chased and more of them will be chased
rubbish
two and a half thousand of them were chased and found last month alone so there are something like twenty thousand fathers who were UNK and haven't been chased
and what about the other eighty thousand who are paying it and you're making them pay more
and then there are thousands of other fathers who are paying
ten pounds like this gentleman for a child which costs thirty or forty pounds a week to bring up
now
i hope that everybody here who has a relationship a UNK relationship is happy
if it costs thirty or forty pounds why do you only fifteen pounds on income support for them
but they can't expect me
could you answer the question
or the tens of millions of other UNK
can i ask you please andrew how well has he worked out for you
it isn't working out for me i've been told i've gotta increase my payments to a hundred and one pounds fifty two a week for my two children from my previous marriage and i've been told by social security that the hundred and one pound fifty two a week will take my ex wife and her husband off income support so i will be keeping her family and their child
not just my children
you will be keeping your children
i would not
no that's not true
no that is rubbish
i have been told by social security would let me er excuse me talking to me
just wait your
child support agency does not help does not help husbands
it helps children
turn right
i was told a hundred and one pound fifty two would be to keep my two children my ex wife her husband and their child by a social security expert
well they were wrong
that is not
well they were not wrong
because they told me that the assessment will be made by the child support agency who would then pass it over to the income support agency who would then take them off income support
i'm going to councillor lines here who's a conservative councillor hang on theresa we have a conservative councillor let him answer the question
er john it looks less UNK every time every time a real person opens their mouths john it becomes less and less UNK
well who are the ones that are UNK and UNK about it
the ones that are ac actually having to pay for their children
they're not my children they're their children
what a load of rubbish
now the UNK the child support agency is
now can i speak please
talking rubbish
the child support agency is probably one of the few agency organizations within this country that actually
that don't know what they're doing
tells people what their responsibilities are not just what their rights are
and i am not willing and the majority of the people are no
in this country are not willing to pay for other people's children
well why don't
i'm sorry about the individual circumstances i don't know about the individual circumstances
no you never
and my children who go to work now have grown up i've brought them up
i don't want them paying for someone else's children
sitting in front of you is a gentleman who was paying what about a hundred pound a week sir
er a hundred pound a week or a month a hundred pound a month
it's almost UNK to three hundred and fifty a month
that's right
how are you coping with that
er i can't
basically i'm er going to lose my job because i can't afford to go there
erm this is gonna cost this government a fortune because i am a crown officer i'm a crown UNK
how many children
two by my first marriage
erm that er that marriage failed
like most of these have erm what i want to know is er why when i was UNK of as you like as a useless article why i am suddenly called upon by this government to be one hundred per cent not fifty per cent responsible but one hundred per cent responsible not only for my children which i'm quite happy to do but one hundred per cent responsible to keep my wife off of benefit and one hundred per cent responsible if she should ever want one t for her partner
this is happening in over ten per cent of all the cases that are coming up before your agency or your government's agency whereby a working parent so called absent according to you is supporting not only his children his ex wife or his e if it's if it's the husband supporting
mm
the other way round supporting an ex wife and supporting a partner th as well
just the same as andrew here is doing
that's a fact
it actually sounds it actually sounds can i put this to you it sounds less like a child support agency and more like a treasury support agency every day doesn't it
theresa
you can get a cheap UNK for a remark like that
i'd like to hear what the mothers i would like to hear
thank you mr thank you
i would like to hear
thank you for the cheap put down but would you answer the question
i would but i would like to hear from some of the women the mothers who have been struggling to raise children with relatively small amounts of money whilst the husband
and they still are
has having enough opportunity to go off and make a second marriage which i don't deny them but they must accept their responsibilities
all the
but the point is what are you gonna do when you get ten million
shouting in this country in this country
hey one at a time one at a time i want to go to UNK wise in a second
seventy per cent of more of fathers whose UNK broke up were not supporting their children
either at all or
yeah well you should be chasing
adequately and that is what the agency was set up to do to correct that situation
please may i go to UNK wise
UNK wise shouldn't fathers pay their
it's essential that parents are responsible
share
let's pick out what's been said by our conservative m ps
shouldn't fathers pay their share and not UNK er expect the state to provide for their children
that's what's being said
well yes fathers should sh er shoulder their responsibility but don't forget
no UNK for that
children are also of concern to all of us
they're not just the children of the parents we depend on those children in our old age who will nurse us who will look after us it's wrong to p behave as if children are simply the personal possession of the parents personal possession of the parents
responsibility my dear responsibility
responsibility
and if they were concerned about the children the children would get the benefit the income support is removed pound for pound
the women who bring up their children in poverty still bring up their children in poverty
and so
hear
so all they're doing is adding more families living in poverty
quite right quite right
exactly
i believe i believe in two parent families there's nobody in my family that's in this situation
but we're lucky
are they to make er second UNK a crime
they're getting fined more for UNK again er than they would if they'd committed a crime
and not to benefit the first marriage and not to benefit any of the children
theresa
can't we hear from some of the women in this audience who have benefited from this system
well let's go to kate
balanced view
kate you have benefited haven't you
yes my h my ex husband was paying maintenance through a court order and his maintenance payments have increased er enormously under the child support agency the reason being erm under the old court system all his debts were taken into account
every time we went to court he would erm take out a new loan he took out a loan to take his wife to UNK that was taken into account
he took out a life insurance policy for a hundred and twelve pounds three weeks before the last court appearance
i never had any money erm that would help me to get off benefit i was caught in the benefit trap and now i've been able to get a part time job my UNK ex husband's paying a reasonable amount and my children are better off
i'm better off
everyone's saying
how's your husband living
and how is your husband how is your husband coping with all that
well i don't know really
his children by his second wife the ones that i would like to have this lady would like to have what happening to them
can i say please
why not let the lady answer
l let her answer
my ex husband if he can afford holidays in UNK i'm sure he can afford children
he's well paid
my children came second
i wish i wish i could afford a holiday in UNK
yes well my husband
scotland would do me
let me ask er let me ask robert over here now robert er i see here it tells me that you were separated from alison your first wife er let me get this microphone right you were separated from your first wife this is your second wife you were separated from your first wife er and i understand it was a clean break it was a clean break with a court settlement
yes i did
so what's happened now with the c s a
well the c s a have raised my er maintenance er from sixty seven pounds a month for one child to two hundred and eight pounds a month now
erm i signed over i signed over a number of thousands of pounds erm n nine years ago eight or nine years ago with regard to the UNK home which alison still lives in with my son ben today
that suited her at the time it suited the law courts at the time who were the UNK in the case
it also suited me
i started then from floor level
from nothing
nothing absolutely nothing
and i met my wife present wife three months afterwards and we have worked UNK hard to raise a family and a and a good family basis for two lovely children
now le let me ask alison
and you people are destroying that situation by taking away from us true family values
you're not only UNK me and my present wife and my two children you are also UNK my ex wife and my son
well let me go to your ex wife alison there was an UNK court settlement
oh yes
yes
why did you change it
i didn't
i didn't
what happened i had a booklet from the d s as i get an income support benefit
you're on income support are you
yes i am
yes
yes
her choice not mine
her choice we're nine years' on now
let it go
erm i was sent a booklet from the d s asking for various financial details with the instructions that if i didn't complete the booklet and send it back to them to the d s my benefits would stop
so obviously i sent it back pretty quickly
the next i heard was when i had a complete breakdown of robert and UNK income erm with the breakdown of how a new settlement was brought about
yes
my argument is yes the maintenance has been increased my income support hasn't been increased by a penny
and my son has received none of the two hundred and eight
nothing
pounds that i'm pay
he doesn't even receive any of the sixty seven pounds that i'm paying
so the money you're paying is not going to your son it's going to the treasury is that right
i'm here the money you're paying is going to the treasury not to your son
absolutely yes
theresa just how do we justify that and then i want to hear from a lawyer about this
theresa
because you see the treasury it is who actually tries to see that other people don't have to pay for someone else's responsibilities if they're not justified
if this gentleman if this gentleman
has children which he has by his first wife in my view and in the view of the great majority of people in this country
i don't think it's the majority you're wrong there
he should accept the responsibility for the cost of raising them
if his first wife cannot afford to live without benefit support from the rest of us which is what state benefit is the government has no money it takes money out of other families who are struggling to bring their children up to give it to you
but your husband can afford to help you some more for the benefit agency
theresa let me go
that's the whole point
theresa
i've got commitments now i've got commitments
russell we've had a good run
i want to go across to susan how can court decisions be UNK like this
well they can
the child support er act says that when a child support assessment is carried out it UNK an existing court order
now i think that is a basic injustice that i'd like to hear you two address
mm
what do you say to the fathers and i have had dozens from up and down the country contacting me what do you say to the fathers like that chap over there in th in the front row who has handed over sometimes tens of thousands of pounds he's done his bit he's had it rubber UNK by the court he's gone ahead in good faith and made his future and then the child support agency comes along and just without so much as a by your leave pulls the rug
don't you think that's a basic injustice
i can say that er that gentleman has been UNK by his lawyers who called the arrangement
who called the arrangement a clean break
but nine years ago they didn't know
but don't you think it would be fair
now a spouse can make a clean break agreement with a spouse
yeah
er and that agreement is to look after the spouse there is never and there has never been in our law and there isn't now a clean break as far as children are concerned
but don't you think it would be fair
as children grow up they become more expensive as children as children
don't you think it would be fair
the costs which the father has to pay rise and our law says that
yeah
there is no clean break as far as children are concerned
but don't you think it would be fair
and for anybody to have told that gentleman that it was a clean break agreement
no
and that would look after children for ever
le let susan come in
is nonsense
i don't see why
excuse me
right well let's not do a UNK let i le let susan come in
don't you think it would
you were asking a question
yes i know but you we susan please
don't you think it would be fair if the assessment which the child support agency carries out took into account at the very least the fact that capital settlements have been made
don't you think that they should at least nod in the direction
n not at all because the capital settlement
not at all
is nothing to do with the child
its a capital settlement it's an arrangement with the spouse
no
of course it is it puts a roof over the child's head
not at all
what do you mean not at all of course it does
and if that gentleman wants to go off and have and marry again and raise more children he should still not leave his
what do you mean it's s wha what do you mean not at all
first wife on income support for tax payers
aren't there other way
some of whom who are not very wealthy people there are an awful lot of UNK who
thanks to you
would like some of the benefits
it
we have a man we have a man in the audience
and they've got no right to do it
we have a man in the audience gary where are you gary give me a wave gary was actually told to default on his mortgage and pay up
default on his mortgage he was told that by an officer
that's right
yeah
th they told me to default on the mortgage that i'm paying for the property that my wife lives in because the assessment doesn't take into account that i
that's right
already pay four hundred pounds a month to my wife
yes you only g
they expect me to pay another three hundred pounds a month out of seven hundred and twenty pounds net income leaving me with twenty pounds a month to live on
you only get an allowance for the house you're living in
UNK can i ask you
UNK can i can i just ask you to make this point about this
why on earth should people here who do not have families pay for people who do have families
because children are the future for all of us
and it's and it's
well then shouldn't fathers think about it before they produce the children
you would think you would think from this that tory mps were all UNK of virtue
and they're not they're not
but the point is what we're being told is effectively that only the rich can have second UNK that's what this child support act brings about
only the rich not the poor they're increasing poverty
and if it was anything to do with children and if it was reasonable they would take into account things like the water rates legal aid cost of access
i can tell you of er of a man who's been told that he should see his children less
mm
because he won't be able to afford the access so the child support officer said see them less
they don't want you to see your children
theresa are we not are we not missing out with this legislation are we not missing out on a little thing called compassion
you see if you're
let her talk
if you're a member of parliament
let her talk
the kind of people that come to my surgery are genuinely and almost entirely women who are struggling to keep their children
that's right
because their husbands have made these settlements often at very emotional times when the women were not really in a position to really make sure they
and they come to mps like me to try and find some way of helping themselves out of the dilemma
usually what they come for is can you have my children looked after
right
in some way so i can go to work
yes why don't you
theresa can i ask can i ask can i ask susan
susan
and that strain should not be put on them
can we talk a little bit about numbers
mm
how many cases do you as one barrister have to deal with at the moment
i have had dozens of people from up and down the country getting in touch with me
it's just astonishing
and that represents not one family but two family each one represents a number of children the misery that this is causing absolutely immense
but the misery which UNK this act was also immense and it was quiet and covered up because these women had nowhere to turn to before and they UNK
i think it would be i don't think there would be trouble
can we make can we just please make a final point
this was really sold to us
this was sold to us please this was sold to us on the basis that it was going to bring in the UNK and sort out the UNK and we'd all live happily ever after
it was sold to us on a false premise
mm
because it's not the UNK we're getting at we're getting at a lot of the UNK and we're UNK them
yes but you're getting at a you're going to get a lot of the UNK who've missed it you are getting a lot of the UNK now
sh
lot of the people who are complaining here are people who are complaining that their an assessment has been made which was very much lower than is necessary for bringing up children
this was an act of parliament you'd never think
twenty per cent
so from UNK wise but it was an act of parliament which had the support the labour party as well because the purpose of it is to help wives to help mothers
yes except you didn't except parliament didn't see half of the effects of it thatcher
who have been receiving UNK from their husbands when the courts maintenance agreements
would you have the courtesy to let him finish
sorry
and i agree with theresa all of my surgery cases in this matter have been from wives saying i cannot live on the maintenance which my husband is not paying me
i don't believe you i don't believe you
he is breaking the court orders
i don't believe you
the amount of money i'm getting is inadequate i'm not getting it made up in income support please help
and that's why we brought in the child support agency with the support of the labour party
you must be the only mp in the country that hasn't had fathers coming to you
excuse me
susan
fascist
i think i think the problem with this act in my view is that it would've been one thing to say to people right from here on in we're going to do it like this
but where the UNK has come from is from people who have thought that they had got binding court agreements
if you're gonna do something radical and change the way that we're going to look after children you've got to take the people with you
never had binding never had binding court agreements because mothers could always go back to court and say this fifteen pounds isn't enough
i'm now having to buy more uniform for my child and so there was never a binding court order
but don't you think that th don't you think that the fact that the father i'm speaking don't you think that the fact that the father has made a capital settlement
but susan the people that the people that are coming to you now
that he's
if we don't go one at a time UNK be heard
now finish what you're saying
don't you think that the fact that the father has made a capital settlement that he has sometimes to travel to the other end of the country to see his child don't you think that should be taken into account
don't you think children
theresa briefly let her answer it theresa briefly
need more than money
hard cases do make bad law
but we had the situation where seventy per cent of not just fathers who were unemployed but fathers that were well off were not adequately and in some cases not supporting
that's an enforcement not an assessment
seventy per cent of all women on their
theresa the prime minister has promised
own were not receiving support from their UNK
the prime minister has promised a review of this
the prime minister has promised a review
yes
is it going to make a difference is it going to change what is essentially not a particularly satisfactory law
well i think what we want to do is to find out the truth from the UNK and the emotion that is what we want to establish and i'm sure we will correct it if there is any injustice
can i just ask a question here
but all of the injustice until now has been with women UNK supported and husbands
and the inadequate levels of support
and husbands who relied on the state to take over
can i just say something to you
responsibility
let us see
theresa i'm going to have to stop you and i'm going to have stop you as well sue and can i say that we're going to need to wait and see what the prime minister has to say
can i thank you most sincerely it's been a very UNK debate a lot of people feel very strongly about this and of course they do
it affects their lives their children their existence their relationships
and their pockets
but can i thank you all for taking part thank you
right well here are the phone calls you'll be interested in these er ann from birmingham says my husband pays nothing but the child support agency didn't want to know
tony from UNK says the m UNK pay rise should be classed as UNK spending
stewart from UNK says i'm on the dole and have to pay maintenance prince charles should be doing the same
mrs from UNK says they are UNK the men who are working erm need to chase those men who are doing nothing for their families
paul from UNK says er i'm a single man looking after my children and i don't get a penny from my ex wife
stewart from UNK says the c s a are men UNK who try to get as much as possible out of them
other ones here an anonymous call from birmingham i have been beaten up weekly by my ex husband because he's been told to pay more
and finally er a shropshire caller says if you have children then you should pay for them not the state
so a range of views there
but still to come should men wear UNK
are they worth it
can you spot the old irish UNK a mile off
should there should men get hung up about their hair loss
well here's one man who is very definitely erm upside down about the whole thing if i can just er tip him over a little bit there could you no i'll try that one again will i
it's er a very delicate er UNK exercise
and this man would you believe it this man was er one of britain's greatest ever UNK gold UNK winner for the u k david UNK in the UNK games ladies and gentlemen
if i can er i can just UNK in he won some gold UNK for scotland as well but we'll just er
but of course
of course david what on earth are you doing
well i'm hanging down like this to increase the circulation to my head
to hopefully er grow my hair back
are you UNK or what
well one could say that yes
b er seriously is it working
it is working my hair is beginning to grow back and er i'm a happy man
right well let's er have your friend on who's er david
david erm now i know your treatment er UNK a range of things and hanging upside down is er is one particular treatment here now for UNK
does it work
it does work
it's part of a programme
it
it takes
one at a time one hair at a time even
t two minutes in the morning two minutes in the evening that all will help grow one's hair back as part of a programme
if you believe that well we'll have er more on that later on
don't miss it
that is later
but after the break is the army doing enough to keep the bully boy out of its ranks
some horror stories coming up
that's next on central weekend
it's very much worth it d'ya know
i think television would be as much to blame as any you know the UNK the children's programmes are all in english and so on you can
it UNK me i hear orkney children in orkney and they'll be playing and talking to one another in english you know
they'll be UNK and things they're just UNK that they've heard i think on television
yes i know that with mine it was american
they used all these UNK because a lot of the problems were american
yes
and the they used to when they would speak orcadian among their UNK and then when they when they were playing games all the kids the orcadian ones whether they were orcadian or not would adopt this american UNK and they all spoke like that
yes of course maybe play acting when they're doing that they're more conscious of the way they're speaking and they probably want to make it right with what they think it should be
and as i say i don't know what sort of things children watch on t v but it's all in english
did you find at school that your dialect was UNK
yes
er when i was young erm you know you didn't have to use dialect at all
er we got leave to use it in the playground as far as i can imagine but we made an awful division or if we didn't it pretty quickly in the class
i can't remember which teacher it was referred to anything orcadian we used as UNK
and if you were used UNK you were a very poor UNK indeed
i remember a wee boy in the class i was in the primary school and he got a row he i remember him getting a row from the teacher and he s the teacher said what did you do wrong and he said oh i've gone and UNK where i should've UNK put
yes
what was UNK was that was that east mainland
no that's west mainland too
UNK and while am i UNK nothing
a UNK something somewhere
yes
instead of put it somewhere
yes and we'd never use put
are there a lot of differences between the east and the west mainland
er quite a lot i think maybe
most would you know be in UNK and pronunciation
to anybody who's used to listening to dialect the east and the west are very different
all the parishes used to be different and it used to be possible at one time to know approximately where in orkney somebody came from
and this is still the case with older folk
many of the older folk if you get them really going in their own dialect you can just say roughly where they come from
one of the common differences between east and west is the words like table and table in west we'd say table and east they'd say table
and the west UNK comes appeal and the UNK heard becomes a heard and the one sort of difference that's still there and it may take quite while to go is that the east mainland when they're saying a sentence they tend to go up at the end of the sentence the voice rises
whereas the west mainland never goes really up at the end of the sentence or at least not to the same extent
i can't make the east mainland very well
i would like to go to the town today and she's awfully she's no the day and they tend to go up at the end
and there's other wee things too
something that the east mainland folk find awfully funny is the west mainland call potatoes
we don't go out to gather potatoes we go to hunt UNK and the east mainland don't say that at all they would call them more UNK or UNK
i thought UNK was north isles
that's UNK on north isles right enough
well UNK maybe has as UNK a dialect as any apart from north ronaldsay of course
north ronaldsay is in a class by it's own and easily UNK
but er i believe that at one time people from the islands settled in some of the farms for the east mainland whether there's a similarity in the matter of table or heard and all these sort of things
there is a similarity UNK in there whether that came with islands or whether it was there before i just don't know
because they table and heat instead of table and
yes
it sound far more proper in the west mainland then
well you could say that and yet we're awfully broad
i would say in just a general accent the way we talk you know
UNK folk are always considered very broad and so are the UNK folk
maybe more so than say UNK and i find like UNK folk you could tell some of them even yet
i always think they have a very UNK pronunciation
they seem to talk quite a lot up high in the in their UNK
and UNK of course well UNK great for sort of old fashioned UNK you know
they're great for that sort of thing
and that's a good old orkney word too
just as an UNK and UNK folk would take it into their conversation i think even yet the older ones of them
i've got a granny who comes from the south isles and she says and that's
if you say something and she's surprised she'll say oh
yes
that's a thing i find that we're losing very much is all these UNK and of course a lot of UNK were calling on a divine hand of god to look after you
i mean there's a whole range of UNK that bless me or bless me as we would say
and god and mercy me that was just have mercy on me
and mine UNK and UNK be about me that was quite a long UNK but it was something surprise them terribly oh UNK be about me just sort of oh god come to me help sort of thing
and the blessings on me that was the thing that sort of for anybody who helped them
it wasn't oh thank you very much i'm much obliged or anything like that
it was be blessings on thee i mean and may god bless you for the help you've given me
and that's a common enough one yet
granny she says my
yes
was a very common one too
you see you don't hear them any more
oh yes
what was that supposed to mean
was it just
oh just the same thing
just an UNK
and
i think would be more scottish
was it UNK
oh yes UNK
i could not say it wasn't fairly common too but no maybe yes is a good one
doing dialect there's still a things like the wireless and the weather things like that sometimes give it a personality as a
my mother when she wanted anybody to turn off the wireless used to say
much to the UNK of two american girls who stayed with us because they didn't know what this phrase was i mean they couldn't have sort it out in the first place of what it meant
when they had sort it out they just didn't know but they would go you know UNK around saying to one another saying then
a lot of orkney a lot of i'm going to UNK now a lot of orkney men use the word she
mhm
when they're referring to the tractor or the horse or the car
mhm
is that an orkney way of doing it or is that just a sort of male thing
erm i've never really thought about it i think it's a male thing probably isn't it
i think maybe english men would refer to their car as she or so on if they get to think you know they make things have personalities you start to give them personal pronoun there
or their boat you know boy she's
yes
boy she's no running right
that's right
the UNK a she right enough very often
and there's another sort of things now that we don't hear is when you sit down at the table to eat erm they're probably the most the UNK would say now would be help yourself
but er there was a whole range of things like put in the hand and erm they thought you weren't eating plenty or told to and supper
yes that's just an orkney way of saying fall too
yes
and put in the hand just literally put your hand in and get something to eat
cos it makes for a lot of you know if you don't have and say well i'm not going to put in my feet anyway
yeah another thing that old folk use i know that my granny used to say she'll say she'll turn things round she'll say i'm having nothing with it to do instead of i'm no having anything to do with it
is that common
yes it's fairly common among older folk still
we s tend to move the sentences around more and they lines sort of you know do you know where my shovel is where my shovel is and erm who's the day asking how are you
that's from shetland who's the day
i know who's the day yes just a similar UNK
the thou and the thee and the UNK
you've just said thou who's thou the day
there are a lot of old folks still use that
oh yes it's quite common and common in middle aged folk even yet among people you're familiar with
i mean even when i was small you wouldn't use thee and thou to an older person
it was somehow thought of as being UNK but to members of your own family and people your own age or somebody younger than you would use thee and thou
but if it was perhaps even a little one your own age if you didn't know them very well it would be you
thee and thou were s a term implied UNK and affection and UNK the thee and thou as far as i always understood it
and another sort of very close phrase that disappeared is a phrase awfully much used
orcadian dialect it's often said has no words of UNK no UNK or UNK but i think perhaps came as near to it as any word
it was said to small children and maybe a young man would say it to his UNK but always implied affection of something young and tender
yes i'd forgotten that
yes
you said about west mainland folk
well just the different words it's really a matter of pronunciation
like in UNK we would say up to go up and er the UNK folk then would say up or something like that up
and erm
it's just to go up
up yes mhm
up and up and er in UNK we'd say wee that's just for us you know we
and i think the UNK folk say UNK and we would call a young UNK a
whereas the UNK people would call it a
just very similar the difference is there in the pronunciation
but a completely different word would be the word for what's behind the cattle in the west mainland it's a and in the east mainland it's an or an
i think that varies too from parishes to islands
there is this just this slight difference in the words
i think i'm really sorry now is to see all the old words really going
i don't think they'll be any left once the generation who were born before the war see are gone
but we still have the dialect and the sort of tone of it and UNK of it but so much of the old vocabulary is just disappearing altogether
i sometimes find myself using them yet long years you know when i thought i'd forgotten them and any younger person just looks at me in UNK and has no idea what i'm talking about
yes i remember my granny coming out with the word
mhm
and i hadn't a clue what that was
sort of called a lot of things it was a UNK or a flapping around or a UNK or a what did what did granny UNK
mm we don't get enough she said
yeah that's right aha
well i went into the shop in UNK very short ago
i used to go to orkney for to go and asked for some cardboard boxes only we call them UNK boxes
and when the girl came with them i says i think i'll take them all if you can them
and she looked at me and UNK her eyes i says you what means
no she said
and i says well it is two different meanings the one i'm using is just if you can spare it if you can it
and a of course is also what they used to get when you wanted to make UNK you made them with the UNK of an animal and that's also called a
well that's two that's a word with two meanings that's now just completely out of use more or less
i haven't heard of that one either
mhm
oh you wouldn't
no
yep
something i did think of when you mentioned about the cattle UNK that the word that we remember was
ah yes
well it can be inside but it's really outside and UNK
UNK wet cattle UNK it's no fresh cattle UNK never
it's when you get this black really UNK rotten hole that you call it
and that's what came out of the was the
that's right
what UNK out of the and mixed with some air from there would have been a little UNK in it to it stood half the summer and got to be really high
that was
and heaven help you if you fell in the
yes that's how i remember it
i did
yeah there's a whole lot of others that were in me head that i meant to write down before you came in
mhm
oh you know it's all right
there's erm
it's just that i like it you know
yeah
mhm
so long as they understand that there's this also the erm you know er said to me oh it's just english sort of said differently
i said well no really at all there's the whole vocabulary as well
which is the vocabulary is disappearing first and then i think maybe the actual UNK and phrases will disappear then too
but it'll take quite a long time for them to go though
but i do think the vocabulary will be lost very shortly now
something that i noticed is in the towns like kirkwall and stromness there's a kind of UNK way of speaking orcadian where they go butter water
yes that's very much kirkwall i would say particularly
there is a slight difference between kirkwall and UNK so UNK another place you the accent of a UNK born UNK unless you say the butter and water and things like that
and stromness accents no quite so easily picked out as kirkwall but you know that they're from one of the two towns anyway usually
i don't know if it's progressed into the villages
i haven't noticed
no that's very much well very much kirkwall i would say
has kirkwall always been like that then
yes
oh yes
i wondered about that
yeah i suppose in the country too there kirkwall would have been the first kirkwall or stromness probably kirkwall would have been the first place where the accents would have been going to go
i would think so and the particularly the folk living in the towns consciously tended to use less orcadian you know they they'd more dealings with folk from outside the islands for one thing and folk come on in off ships and so on
and part of the reason of course the dialect is gone is that we UNK sort of translate what we're going to say into good english so that we're understood
because there are so many english folk now in every community and we do tend to sort of doctor up the language a bit you know when we talk to them
otherwise they just wouldn't understand us
and some places that erm i know that in some places they have their own local way of speaking and then they speak a different way to other folk
but then they lapse back into the local way of speaking when they're on their own
but they don't seem to do that here
er not in kirkwall you mean
yeah they don't seem to like i know that in UNK a lot of the folk in UNK have two se they've got their own dialect and they've got english
and in fact in some of the schools was here i know that mrs UNK erm from wyre her idea at the school was to make orcadian children UNK
mhm
and that they would have the language that they spoke at home and the language that they spoke at school
and that they found it easier when they that english was english and orcadian was orcadian
yes
yes i see what you mean probably thou thought UNK a strange dialect to you they relax it some more too
you see it's really what happens to the older folk like me
i never talk to anybody as i'm talking now even
er to me friends you know
no it's a it's a totally different when
it's a
you're relax you speak in a totally different way
ye yes totally different way
aha
do you find that the school used to make you very inhibited about the way you spoke
oh yes when i went to stronsay UNK first we were very much kids for the country being all this country ones and often we'd sometimes be and said some terribly wild and UNK awfully UNK phrase you know until pride sort of came to our rescue when we got out of it as much as ever we could
the orkney word for what we were doing is UNK
you know that of course if you UNK
UNK when you're talking to other UNK in your best english when there's really no need for it when you just want to show off that you're
here ago you see it implied that you were so much more learned and UNK and clever if you could talk english
and if you spoke english to a fellow orcadian you were UNK
which was their sort of way of making fun of you because you were showing off which is what a UNK orcadian thinks any of his UNK talking in english to anyone other than an english person
they they're showing off
or did do mind you i wouldn't think it now not for younger folk that's not the case but for the older folk it very much worse
do you think they're being UNK down over dialect
erm i must have gonna put yeah do you think they're being UNK down over dialect at school
made UNK very reluctant to speak up in public
oh certainly
in fact you couldn't adequately express yourself in english you were just better to shut up
do you think that's still UNK
oh no
i think young folk now are much more ready to express themselves and express themselves in public
we were erm not given many opportunities to do that only through things well local clubs like the w r i and which er and in that way all UNK just trying to do our best together you know
and the young UNK clubs were quite good for they encouraged speech making and how to express yourself UNK and er how to speak nicely
that was quite good
but you see there was always this thought that it was always to better yourself that you were doing this that your orcadian was just for home about and among yourselves and what it didn't really matter
but if you really wanted to make an impression you had to get rid of this orcadian fast
for visitors coming to orkney do you think it that there's a happy medium come to orkney
is there a way of talking in your natural dialect that they can understand you and yet without losing it
i don't really think there is
i know some folk won't change for anybody they just go UNK on in their dialect and er well this fellow said some visitors just don't understand him i always find myself UNK in a situation like that
they can't even pick up just the words that are english words only pronounced in the orcadian way
like i'm
i'm gone to the shop
well just the UNK and the and the way you would say that they can't pick it up
the UNK don't seem to do that to the same extent they don't seem to change their dialect
no they're much better at keeping it and they seem to manage quite well too
and yet doesn't shetland doesn't seem so difficult to un maybe it's because we're orcadian but shetland doesn't seem to be so difficult to understand for somebody outside than orcadian is i wonder why
i think that's maybe because we're orcadian for no matter how good we're feeling if we go you know that yourself if you go south anywhere and you meet up with just anybody that's ever heard an orcadian
well my you come from orkney
you think that's especially true and like say aberdeen if you go in a shop there and at least it used to be the case and asked for something you be thought you were speaking fine but they would just say oh my you down from orkney for a holiday
you know right away picked you up right away
did folk often used to UNK you of being welsh
qui quite frequently welsh and once german
yes i often used to be accused of being welsh but it is different
it's different but erm if you really get an orkney UNK just talking to one another and er drawing out the words sometimes and so on it can get to be the same UNK as welsh
and probably to a you know to an UNK ear it would sound reasonably similar
chairman appointed to e i p and to the north yorkshire number three
can i say that the purpose of the e i p is to examine the various issues that have been id identified for discussion
and the panel's role is to report on those issues
er we are not required or intending to look at objections which have been submitted on other aspects of the structure plan
we are simply concerned with those issues which we will be discussing over the next erm eight days or so
the er other aspect i think erm for the purpose of those who were not at the er pre meeting is to introduce the other panel member and that miss UNK who is a senior inspector with the planning inspectorate on my right
on my left is the panel secretary mrs clare
and of course you will already be aware of the er program office which is outside just off the corridor
now can i get some of the mechanics out of the way first of all before we before i ask north yorkshire to make a start with their presentation
firstly i presume that those who want lunch sandwiches here have already er taken care of their order
i would also like to add that the small meeting room which is off the corridor opposite the program office is UNK available for you to er relax during the lunch break and eat your sandwiches in there rather than bring them into the hall
the other thing i would like to make sure and this applies also to the members of the public as well as those people who are participating in the discussion could you please make sure that you have registered for the day
er you can do that during the coffee break if you haven't already done so
now some of you will also have seen a form being circulated asking you to agree that the recordings that are being made of the discussions can be used as part of a research project
certainly i was asked about this er well before the er e i p er and we agreed that there w well certainly i agreed that i could see nothing wrong with that since it is a cl closed research project and nothing will be UNK at all er publicly
apart from which of course that everything we say is being held in public session in any event
the recordings are available for you if you wish or will be available for you if you wish to er improve your memory on what has been said during the discussion periods
i must add that we will not be producing daily UNK er i think it's a task which is a fairly UNK on and quite frankly er they will not be produced in the sense at the end that they would not be available at the end of each day
erm as i say the recordings will be available if you wish to UNK your memory
they will be held during the course of the e i p here otherwise they will be help by the county council
now i was about to make a comment that er well most of you know who you are and where you're sitting er those that have already done that have turned their name tags round so we can see
er one or two others i would welcome that
we can identify you more readily that way
in terms of progressing or taking part in the discussion can i suggest that if you want to come in on a particular item you put your name board up like that so that we can readily observe it er and equally our friend who is looking after the UNK can make sure that the UNK the volume of your microphone is turned up at the appropriate time
i don't think you wish us to UNK with the UNK at all do you
no fine
now if i can move on to today's session we are going to UNK concerned UNK obviously with housing land applications and primarily with matter one a
but before i ask north yorkshire to introduce the matter can i put h b f on notice that i would like them to follow on from north yorkshire when they have made their contribution
i would also like to say that er whilst we are going to talk about the housing allocations in the sort of strategic sense across the county first of all there are as you will remember er the matters of some UNK differences of opinion on demographic issues
i raised this at the pre meeting and asked that the various participants should have a look at those issues where they had areas of disagreement to see whether or not er they could UNK those
and i would like that to be touched on as well
er by north yorkshire
i think s the differences in some cases ar are so large that it's UNK er that we have a discussion on
the other thing and this is a case of where the panel UNK back as it were
we have laid on the table two tables p s o one and p s o two
erm and what we have done in UNK these tables and this has been done by the panel secretary is to take from the various submissions of the participants the various housing figures the various projections of likely need of the housing requirement and the effective summary really is in p s o one but when you look at p s o two er there's a little more detailed work gone into that
now could i ask if there are any erm matters on there where you have found and error and it's an error of fact can i just stress that at this stage
erm could you let the panel secretary know er about that this mo sometime this morning but certainly er in time for our start of the afternoon session
but we felt the tables themselves could provide a useful background er and in having had them compiled they point up some rather interesting issues which we would return to eventually
now if i can pass on and ask mr from north yorkshire who first of all is going to give you an introduction which in effect which effectively will set the context of alteration number three
and then i presume mr you'll go on to deal with matter a one a
yes that's correct mr er it will be brief
well ladies and gentlemen at the beginning of this examination in public it would probably be helpful to all present and participating if the county council explained why this alteration is necessary and the relationship of its content to regional and national guidance
well now in case anyone present is uncertain erm of the geography of the county there is a plan displayed er on the board er at the back of the room which w should help er in that circumstance
the county is the largest by area in england it borders two UNK to the north and south it's unique environmentally both in its natural and built form
having two national parks two and half areas of outstanding natural beauty a heritage coast and a wealth of historic towns er and villages
the county council believes that north yorkshire the character of it er is a national asset but there is a view that because the county is large and relatively UNK there should be almost what appears to be an open door policy for development
we for our part are unaware of any statement of national policy that requires UNK counties to be earmarked for development
well now the starting position today is that the north yorkshire county structure plan was approved by the secretary of state in november nineteen eighty
together with subsequent alterations in january nineteen eighty seven and august nineteen eighty nine
i think it's fair to say that the secretary of state has accepted that the special character of north yorkshire require a balance to be struck between environmental protection and development in the county
and we consider that this approach enjoys widespread support in north yorkshire
now district councils and national park committees have approach in pursuit of their own plan making activities and although statutory local planning coverage in the county is still UNK the planning process at both county and district level generally aims to meet the secretary of state's wishes for north yorkshire
as during the examination in public into the first alteration this e i p will demonstrate again the wide measure of agreement between county and district councils
and we for our part think that this counts for a lot
as to the reasons why this alteration is necessary the county council thinks there are three reasons the first is to reflect the wish of government that the development planning system er is up to date second and more practically to provide a context for district wide development plan and third the urgent need to resolve the future strategic planning direction of greater york
as far as up to date development plans is concerned this is supported by all sections of the community and need not be UNK upon
an appropriate UNK for context for district wide plans is necessary because the approved structure plan only UNK to nineteen ninety six
quite clearly the time horizon needs to be extended to allow structure plan UNK policies to provide clear guidance not least in respect of a supply of land for housing in the county
district councils are presently making good progress on the development plans and UNK and an approved alteration is clearly essential for that process
well now the third factor greater york has probably been the single most important planning issue for the county council and the greater york districts over the past ten years
the ingredients i think we well know
a greenbelt agreed in principle by the secretary of state but yet to be defined UNK a general absence of consensus on where future development in greater york should be located and increasing intervention by the secretary of state on planning applications in greater york
the county council and the five greater york district councils began to address the issue in nineteen eighty eight and have spent five years in moving UNK this examination in public
that might seem like a long time but the issues have clearly been complex and have been progressed as quickly as possible not least through UNK by the d o e keen to see approval of a long term development strategy for greater york and more importantly a statutory definition of the york UNK greenbelt
well we think that the d o e would probably be quite pleased with the position that we reached today
during the period since nineteen eighty eight the greater york authorities have agreed a long term development strategy involving a new settlement contribution
this enabled progress on a york greenbelt local plan which in april nineteen ninety three completed a seven month public enquiry
the county council further accepted that an alteration to the approved structure plan was necessary to UNK the strategy as the approved structure plan made no provision for it
that has also been progressed as UNK as possible with the greenbelt local plan
so here we are today almost at the end of a very long process having experienced a wide ranging debate about the future of greater york and numerous consultation exercises
the e i p today is probably one of the last pieces in the UNK
the completion of which will at long last resolve strategic planning issues in greater york
well of course this process pr could just as easily have been progressed through a full scale review of the structure plan rather than an alteration
as far as a full scale review of the structure plan is concerned there is no doubt in the county council's mind that such a full scale review would have significantly extended the process when all the players wish to see rapid progress particularly to deal with the problems of greater york
in nineteen ninety the county council did consider the merits of a full scale review as against an alteration
it accepted that while there were arguments for a full scale review the priority had to progress on an alteration which as quickly as possible established the principle of a greater york new settlement and progress on the greenbelt local plan
this approach was supported by the regional office of the department of the environment
it is an alteration therefore that is t to be debated at this e i p and its coverage is relatively straightforward though its content controversial
policy h one provides the UNK provision for dwellings in the county after two thousand and six
policy h two is a new policy which makes provision for a new settlement to help meet the development needs of the greater york area
policies i five and i twelve provide for land for employment in the period up to two thousand and six while in the t policies the opportunity is taken to update road schemes in the county
finally with the support of our district council the dis the county council seeks to correct a serious UNK of strategic planning policies for north yorkshire the inclusion of policy e two of a policy to control development in the countryside
all the policies have been the subject of consultation but in the case of policy h two we've experienced almost five years of continued discussion and debate first of all through the greater york study and then through this alteration
the county council believes that policy h two is essential for the future of the greater york area
the policy even has the distinction of attracting from the regional office of the department of the environment in the paper to be considered at this e i p a phrase of mild support
all these efforts do need of course to be assessed against their compliance or otherwise with national and regional guidance
the former in large part embodied in p g the latter in regional planning guidance for york and humberside yet to be issued by the secretary of state
as far as the former is concerned planning policy guidance we will have different views
certainly this alteration will ensure the strategic policy in north yorkshire is up to date
and the alteration will address issues clearly UNK appropriate to structure plans
the policies will be much debated with quotes from various p gs probably selective being used by both the county council and objectors to justify their position
in any event p gs are carefully drafted to ensure that few options are closed off
the county council does feel comfortable about the compliance of its alteration with national planning guidance
as far as regional planning guidance is concerned there is none
it's quite clear the needs of sensible planning require progress on development plans
nowhere has this been more evident than in greater york
while p g twelve provides for a UNK of planning policy i suggest that only a UNK would delay a resolution of the needs of greater york through the development plan process in order to UNK regional planning guidance
in any event the draft regional advice which has recently been the subject of consultation does not conflict with this alteration though leeds and bradford have reservations on the level of housing provision in north yorkshire
we think the secretary of state's present wish for ordered planning will benefit from the discussions at this e i p
there are i suspect few organizations represented around this table public or private that would wish a delay in decision
finally panel the county council considers that the issues raised in this alteration require early decision and not in two or three years time
it is the county council's responsibility to bring forward proposals to enable progress to be made
the county council has taken those decisions and we think they ought to be debated vigorously and following that discussion the panel will come to its conclusion
the county council therefore UNK this alteration to the panel
that's all i would like to say
you don't wish to pursue in slightly more detail in terms of your introduction th the issue one a which is the is the housing provision reasonable
ye yes indeed i do
i was taking a step at a time and
yeah well i'm quite happy
okay
can i can i just say before you start
mhm
er i should have reminded everybody at the beginning when you wish when you start to speak would you please introduce yourself give your name and who you represent
so we can make absolutely certain on the recording
that's each time
sorry mr
before we start chairman i wonder whether we can make sure that peter north yorkshire county council that all round the table have got the relevant north yorkshire paperwork
and i think the documents that we have put in are n y one UNK various positions er statements paper n y two described as population household economic activity rate projections assumptions and methodology
n y three is a county council commentary on the regional census study funded by the local authorities and the d o e
n y four is a paper entitled housing growth provision
and then we miss a number erm er and move to n y eleven which is a paper which we have put in which attempts to look at the differences between certainly between the n y c projections and the h b f projections
and that in fact is headed by erm a summary table erm which attempts to set down on p one piece of paper where the differences erm lie
and i wonder erm we specifically er identified erm the wish to address that particular issue
erm and what i would like to do that paper was written by mr erm our research officer and perhaps after i've made one or two general remarks he could give you the flavour erm of the difference as we as we see if that would be acceptable to you
that that's quite acceptable
so first so if i peter north yorkshire
if i continue then with some introductory remarks erm on policy h one a and one a perhaps that would set the scene er for the discussion then mr will very briefly erm look at the differences as he sees them between the two sets erm of projections
well policy h one addresses the number of dwellings to be provided in the county and the districts and in greater york
and quite clearly there's a disagreement on the number of dwellings that the county council proposes
the this happened before it happened in nineteen eighty seven erm on the first alteration when review er when they were a w wide range er of suggestions er made as to the appropriate level of provision
and to an extent we ran through this same debate erm at the greenbelt local plan enquiry for two days during september er nineteen ninety two
it seems to be a relatively simple debate there is either too much development in the views of some participants erm or there is er too little
others suggest that the county council er is about right
the county council would appear to be somewhere in the middle based on the range of views that have been submitted to this e i p
at the top of the range we have the house builders federation with and excess of fif fifty thousand dwellings
at the bottom we have j c with a figure in excess of thirty one thousand dwellings
the county council appear to be somewhere in the middle er at around forty one thousand er two hundred dwellings
i think i need to say on that should not be taken as the county council sitting on the fence between two opposing er extremes
the county council thinks that its proposed provision is the right approach and it's a balanced approach in line erm with secretary of state's previously e stated wishes
the approach of the county council is based on certain principles first of all it reflects the decision of the secretary of state on the originally approved structure plan and particularly on the first alteration to the structure plans er in nineteen er eighty seven
and we've summarized in n y four paragraph twenty one to twenty seven the main issues erm as we see them er there
and the conclusions appear to be that migration into the county needs to be modified and secondly that government policy was then and still is to pursue policies leading to the regeneration of urban areas e around north yorkshire particularly west yorkshire er and cleveland
in cleveland to the north we have a deprived area er by any standard which is making UNK efforts to make provisions to retain er its own population as part of UNK county cleveland
in west yorkshire to the south we have similar problems of inner city decline and there as we understand it the authorities wish to cater for their housing needs
the county council accepts the problems and is keen to do all it can to support those authorities er to north and south
but the county council does accept that trends for migration into the county are there and the county council cannot turn off the top to turn off the tap to UNK to UNK any further migration into the county
as a result the county council accepts the need for a substantial element of development which is the response to inward migration in the county
and around about sixty percent of the overall provision as we calculate it is to accommodate migration led development in north yorkshire
as far as the debate with leeds and bradford is concerned there are three districts adjacent to west yorkshire selby harrogate and craven
and the difference between us and the west yorkshire authorities appears to be eighteen hundred dwellings
that doesn't appear to be much erm in terms of quantity in our UNK in terms of the level of provision that leeds and bradford er are providing but it would create a major problem er in north yorkshire
at the other extreme there are arguments for reduction in the at the other end of the spectrum there are arguments for reduction in the level er of housing provision proposed er in north yorkshire
the county council does not accept that there should be any further reduction in the amount of housing that is proposed to be UNK accommodated in the county
the county council quite clearly accepts its regional responsibilities to accommodate a significant degree er of migration led er development
we believe to further reduce erm the level of migration led development in north yorkshire er would not be in the best interest of the region as a whole and more importantly would not be in accord with the general provisions o of the structure plan to accommodate a significant level er of development
as we see it therefore the county council is not turning the tap off in respect of migration led development and it is not being e too generous
we believe that the balanced approach e of the county council e is right it reflects the views of the secretary of state er in nineteen eighty seven and we think it's the appropriate way for north yorkshire to develop bearing in mind the clear environmental constraints er within north yorkshire
well chairman that gives a flavour of the documentation the various documentation that we put in
you did ask erm for us to try and help this examination by giving some indication of the differences between shall we say the two sides of the debate
er we put in n y eleven which is our attempt er to identify first in a summary page er and then in a more UNK paper with appendices where the differences lie and the reasons that er that we pursue one course as opposed to another
erm this has been prepared by mr erm and perhaps it would be helpful if he gave you the flavour of it
stuart north yorkshire
well sir er we have as mr has said in n y eleven the commentary er of our o opinions on the situation put forward by the house builders federation
whereas our own er UNK commentary is in n y two
er n y two paragraph nine er gives us the background to our approach in population projections
we have er UNK them to take account of the most recent information available subject to limitations that staff time limits causes
we have sir
excuse me mr
can you all hear
it shouldn't be necessary either to adjust the UNK to switch them on or to move them actually
alright carry on
wherever possible sir we have tested the validity of the individual assumptions against alternative sources of data
er we have looked to supplement national e information by our local knowledge specifically i might instance one er where we have made a survey of the institutions which is one source of er possible difference between er people looking at the situation locally and those from further UNK
we have UNK i think in several instances to try and give a margin of flexibility er i think if we'd really tried hard to follow a policy of restraint within the assumptions of this model we could have produced even lower figures than we have
i think we've tried to UNK being reasonable
so that was the general approach
er the particular methodology we've used is a population projection model produced by the institute
the housing and population model
er this is quite commonly accepted as er in use in many places and i think my our colleagues on the other side of the table have been using the same basic modelling methodology
it starts by taking the present population a as the population of the base year and proceeds to age the population er adding births and UNK deaths to get a population in the projection years
er it begins by UNK the institutional population from the total population in order to get the private household population
once the population levels are calculated in the model the population is converted in to households using UNK status and rates
and once the households are calculated the final process is to convert the households into dwellings
and to summarize the methodology that we've used we've set out our in the single sheet in the front of n y eleven various assumption areas that UNK the use of the model and our choice of the appropriate assumption for each of these areas
so that for instance er starting with a base population we've used the UNK nineteen ninety one provisional estimates
er this was because er at the time the UNK that the calculations were made and reported to the committee these were the most recently available
er other have been able to use more recently er released information n er namely the UNK nineteen ninety one final revised estimates
as you will see from the sheet small difference in the total population
had the county council been able to use the final figures the dwelling requirements at the end of the projection period would have been somewhat lower than the figure that we have produced
the conversion of the rate of population to private household population has been accepted that er we use as everybody has used the county council's estimate of the institutional population
so this does not appear as a technical difference
sorry would you re would you repeat that
you say there is no difference of opinion on that one now
on the level of the institutional
yeah
population
there is a difference of opinion in the effect on the number of households produced by the way that the military
yeah
population in married quarters is treated
yes i appreciate that
yes
but you haven't highlighted that
i haven't highlighted that as an area of difference
n no
cou co could i ask you and try to short circuit actually the presentation if you if you if you don't mind to actually concentrate on those issue items where there are these significant differences which you which you mentioned
well the largest difference er from the sheet is in the death statistics
and er we will maintain that we've used the appropriate statistics from the office of population UNK and surveys and the UNK er and erm our colleagues have made an error is our opinion on er the er death statistics that they've used in their calculations of the model in our opinion
in that they have not taken the correct figures
i can't explain the reasons why
our figures we maintain are the correct ones
yeah i mean i would assume that there must be agreed death rates which everybody would accept as being applicable in UNK population
we would have said we would have thought that too sir but er it appears that er
well i think i'll wait for h b f to come back on that one
but yo the figure the figure which you mentioned yeah
can i just add sir o one point i in my in my UNK i said that we were sometimes able from a local point of view to take into account information locally that perhaps you wouldn't have got from further UNK
er within the model there is the provision to er not take the date which is issued with the model but to allow for local correction factors and it er maybe that we've got the locally correct death statistics in and our colleagues haven't got the local UNK
well we'll come back to that one later one but if you just carry on talking through the various er items where there is these there are these significant differences
well that is the er most significant difference sir
er a difference has er appeared in concealed households at three thousand
the county council UNK that er the project methodology takes account of all classes of households er within the methodology itself
and so there does not need to be a separate provision made for numbers of concealed households
er our understanding is that er our colleagues the other side of the table wish to reduce the number of consumer households from the level it was at the nineteen ninety one census which is the figure here three one seven to zero
UNK the numbers of concealed households and therefore the number of dwellings to be provided to cater for that
er and we feel that would be er unrealistic but within the modelling context we don't think that it needs to be separately taken into account
there are households concealed households at the beginning of the period in our projections there are households at the end of the period which are also concealed
this we feel matches the real world situation where er the poor being always with us there will always be people who while wishing to have accommodation
so that is an area of er significant difference
the next er most important er in terms of erm numbers is er migration levels
h here we have two categories of areas of difference
there is the technical basis on the one hand and there is a policy er area
i think then there's a UNK environmental discounts
and i think these phrases appear in the text
as far as the technical points are concerned er there is the question which source of data should be used to quantify migration
and over how long a period should the migration be taken
the county council has used the national health UNK central record of patient re UNK as its principle source of for migration data and has chosen an eight year period to measure the trend
er our colleagues i think have chosen a different period trend
i think it's a ten year period they've taken and th the er source is as much the a sort of a residual figure that comes from the UNK mid year estimates nineteen ninety one
as against the nineteen eighty one estimates
UNK actual change and ending up with
we maintain that this balance not only includes migration but includes other adjustments
so the figures for migration are not necessarily purely migration figures and we are er we don't dispute the length of the trend to take the ten years
ten years as it happens is not a lot different to eight years
the choice of the time period for migration is very important
if we had taken the most recent trend it would have been over the last three years
this is shown er in the appendix to n y two
appendix five
which is a table showing annual average migration figures for the years nineteen eighty five to nineteen ninety two
appendix five of n y two
there you'll see there is an eight year trend the mean of which is just under five thousand
from which we make a deduction and i'll come back to that deduction in a moment if i may sir
if one took just the last three years the annual average migration figure would be a little under three thousand three hundred
had we used this three thousand three hundred figure as the annual migration then the housing requirement figures come out of the projection rather then two thousand and six would have been some ten thousand fewer
so the choice of the length of the trend is er very important
the source is important and er how you deal with the source
er i mentioned that we have made an allowance for students in this migration
er this is not to say i must emphasize that we have discounted students in this migration assessment
what we have done is to discount excess students
er there is a technical report that has examined this sort of information erm for the year nineteen eighty one nineteen eighty one specifically for this county
er the research found that there were three hundred or so students who registered with the health service but didn't re register or didn't leave
so that was a fact that er
yeah
does this make a significant difference to the UNK household requirement
yes one o one of the elements that goes towards the four thousand four hundred
yeah
difference in migration
er i don't think i couldn't at this moment in time give you the components
no
of which of these four thousand four hundred is d due to the time period which is due to the source which is due to the er student er excess student discount
so that is a significant er difference sir between e our UNK of the model and others
yeah
other differences are smaller in scale as you will see there is a difference in er vacant dwellings the county council er takes the view that er
yes i yeah sorry to interrupt i mean i follow the arguments you've used within the document but i the figure which the h b f have UNK to vacant dwellings for example is just under two thousand five hundred
or is this th is this an adjusted figure now
having had the discussion between the two parties
is it six hundred
er we have had er recent correspondence with the h b f and er my e colleague mrs long can give you the detail of that
we would we would er revise the difference figure on the basis of that conversation
so d the six thousand the six hundred does not really apply any more
well no well i i'll come back to that issue with h b f
but
er but it is not simple as in any of these matters er in that the change in the vacant dwellings difference here also has a UNK figure for dwellings different at the end
because of what the er effect is in the calculations and again we could go into that in some detail if wanted to
no i'm trying to avoid too much detail if i can
what i'm trying to establish in a fairly UNK form actually are the areas of difference and whether some of those are still capable of being UNK because of the way in which you a you know the different parties may have made different approaches but in fact you might come to an agreement about that
but there are other ar areas where in fact you may simply agree to disagree
for various reasons
mm
well i think having had a meeting with the er house builders er representatives earlier on this table of differences now represents the differences that there are still remaining
yeah right
before the h b f respond and i appreciate they want to respond to what mr said
can i say in relation to what mr has said
mr
sorry i'm er
mr has er our aim must be to identify what really matters
technical experts will always disagree erm there was a time when i too would claim to be one of them
but i'm not here to play that role
we must please be clear about those factors which actually matter always bearing in mind that it is for the county council in the first instance and perhaps for the panel in the second instance to take a decision about the UNK of past migration trends
in other words not to provide for a continuing level of migration as it has been in the past
in that context it seems to me that some of the differences between the technical experts pale into UNK and therefore do net deserve our spending any great time upon them
there are other matters however which seem to me to be much more significant in statistical terms and in relation to the total level of provision
mm
which the county propose
can we please concentrate on those that are truly significant
mr i hope that hasn't cleared anything of what you wanted to say
thank you
right thank you very much
er roy house builders federation
i'll try my best to respond to most of what we've already heard this morning
erm the basic stance of the er of the federation is that we erm make use of the latest information
we regard that as being consistent with government policy as set out in p g twelve
but it is in our view government policy to provide for development needs
consistent within a framework of regional guidance
we have as mr said already this morning we have no regional guidance
erm and his claim that in fact the regional draft regional guidance er that has emerged is consistent with this alteration is not really surprising since the same parties drew up the same document
so our purpose here and i would echo er what miss has just said is essentially to take a view about migration
that is the essential component erm which er will determine e effectively the strategic policy which will apply to this county
it's interesting that despite all that's been said about migration and i'll come back to it but we actually start the county and ourselves from the same point more or less within about four dwelling i think
erm and but it's after that we differ a bit
however as far as the basic strategy is concerned of this particular alteration it includes for the first time conversions
and that is a fundamental change to the previous strategy
and it amounts to in effect a twelve point five percent decrease in housing provision
at a time when household formation rates suggest we should be going in the opposite direction simply to stand still
this is a fundamental change of strategy without doubt
i don't want to hold up this alteration and i like mr don't want to wait three years for a decision
but i would say to you that such a fundamental change of strategy would normally have its proper place in a replacement plan rather than an alteration
so how do some of our differences come about
we have a number of technical differences which are essentially differences about the composition of the population and its natural change
and we would say that difference amounts to sixteen hundred dwellings
we have a base dwelling difference although in view of your remarks that may well pale into UNK
but nevertheless it is a matter of fact that there is a difference of seven hundred and fifty dwellings in the base dwellings that we've used
we do have a difference in vacancies
er whereas the county council have sought to re to er keep vacancies constant we have said that it is reasonable to seek to plan to keep second homes etcetera as a constant number but what i would term normal vacancies can be reasonably be expected to go up to maintain the same proportion
that does i think form a significant element because it makes a difference of nearly two and a half thousand dwellings
perhaps i could intervene and try to establish a view on vacancies so at least we can get one element of out
mm
of the debate out of the way
and perhaps miss and d o e may have a view to contribute too
but if i can put my thinking erm on the floor first it seems to me that vacant normal vacancies as mr has described them are a function of people moving from one house to another
and it seems to me there is no reason to suppose that because there are more houses the UNK to move from one house to another UNK
perhaps before gentleman of the county council whose name i still can't see
comes in miss may wish to say something
i think in this day and age there is probably a greater UNK to move and consequently there may well be an increased erm amount of vacancies occurring and that was why in our statement we actually increased the number of vacancies but i think that is a function of the number of houses on offer at the time
mm
h how in that context does the county council defend its position mr you're not mrs you're mr thank you
mr will
yes malcolm county council
i think our concern is that the vacancy rate erm in the census indicates that some seven point one percent of the properties in the county are vacant at er at that time
we are very concerned that in making provision for housing through to the year two thousand and six we should not be making provision for that level of vacancy rate which seems to us to be artificially high when compared with the national figures
and indeed we hear from the d o e that they have a figure in their paper of something like five and a half percent
the figure that we have come up with in fact is derived by holding constant the numbers rather than the rate of vacant dwellings through to the year two thousand and six which implies that by the year two thousand six we'd have would have a vacancy rate of six point two percent or thereabouts
which is still substantially higher than the national figure and substantially higher than the figure being proposed by the department of the environment for north yorkshire
can you split that six point two percent between the second homes etcetera and the normal vacancies
erm i don't have the figures off hand but i er we could provide those figures
because it UNK if one a assumes that the second homes etcetera remain constant
it UNK a reduction in the rate of normal vacancies
i th would prefer to look at the vacant dwellings as a single entity rather than necessarily splitting them down between the various types
my question still remains the same then
does it not UNK a reduction in the rate of all vacancies
that's right yes from seven point one to six point two percent over the period through to two thousand and six
if you accept that UNK from the UNK to move is it sensible to make that assumption
but that is only one of the factors in north yorkshire that is influencing the vacancy rate
we do have a very large proportion of holiday accommodation and second homes which are concentrated in certain parts of the county
and we're concerned that this figure of seven point one percent is in fact artificially UNK the housing requirement through to two thousand and six
i had hoped this would be a short point
could i ask
mhm
our figure discounted second homes
our figure of the vacancy assumptions is the number of vacant dwellings
yes your rate was something like five and a half percent if i remember rightly yes
yes
no whereas
that's right yes but it has takes no takes no account of second homes
h b f have gone for four point four five percent
yes
but leaving the second homes as a constant figure and separate from is that right
i can't quite see the reason for UNK second homes altogether as the d o e have done
they are a factor in the housing market in north yorkshire and i think that we have to take those into account when we are looking at vacancy rates through to two thousand and six
and i think the overall figure that we've had produced which is around the six point two percent is still a very substantial level of vacant dwellings within the county
and i'm in no doubt that will allow for the operation of a housing market through movements er population and so forth
what can the county council do first of all to stop people moving house and secondly to stop people stop d to prevent any change in the number and distribution of second homes
the county council isn't actually trying to control who UNK houses and what purpose they occupy them
what we're concerned with is the amount of land that or the UNK number of dwellings that we are providing through the structure plan through local plans for the future
er we're not seeking to control individual occupancy that is not possible through the planning system
but the implication of a declining rate of vacancies is that something will stop people moving house
no i i'm not sure it necessarily will stop people moving house what we're talking about is a level of provision for vacancy rates which is still well above national rates
is that including your second homes though
that is including second homes yes
yes
but it
mr i'd hoped it would be a short point
obviously we're not going to reach agreement on that but do you want to come back on vacancies
or indeed does mr want to come in on vacancies
i could
steven from
i think UNK mr has slightly UNK the waters by UNK second homes
i think that discussion is more UNK conducted in terms of what you called normal vacancies
and this is the basis on which the d o e have put in their figure it's the basis on which we have put in a figure for vacant dwellings and also the h b f
and all of us as it were set aside as a block all the second homes as holiday homes and say those are as it were outside this enquiry we'll leave them there
they don't even enter into the projections we have done at all
because they're a constant number it doesn't arise
i think the issue as you rightly as miss rightly put it is the normal vacancy rate and is there any reason to suppose as the county council must be supposing that this UNK to a degree
and when i say the vacancy rate i mean a percentage rather than a number
and i don't see any mechanism whereby that production can be UNK or indeed any intention by the county council to engineer such a reduction
in which case i would see that the sensible thing to do which is what we have done is to assume that the current vacancy rate stays the same as a percentage and that with a larger dwelling stock results in some additional vacant dwellings
i can't say any more than that
erm that is exactly our point of view
sorry can i just come back to mr 's point where you say that the current rate of vacancy
are you talking about the current rate as it UNK or we're told it UNK ion north yorkshire or are you looking at a figure which is somewhat nearer the national average or the figure which mr 's organization have chosen
steven
we have sought to use the rate for the percentage for north yorkshire as at the nineteen ninety one census
i UNK mr
right er thank you very much
roy house builders federation
erm so moving on apart from the difference in vacancies we then have erm a difference related to concealed households
erm mr has explained the view which is taken been taken by north yorkshire
our view is that we should seek to accommodate concealed households
concealed households are people who exist currently within the county
whether or not further concealed households are formed over the next fifteen years seems to me to be an UNK
it should be the purpose of the planning authorities to seek to house its people
by ignoring concealed households it is in fact not seeking to house its people and is in fact not doing what in fact it says it should be doing within the explanatory memorandum
i suspect after the prime minister's speech last night it's no longer political correct to talk about single parents
if he's back to basics but is it realistic to suggest that there will that all concealed households will disappear
i am er it may or may not be realistic to suggest that all concealed households will disappear
i did say that it's UNK that concealed households will be formed over the fifteen year period
so they will continue to arise but i think that it is right to plan to accommodate the ones that you know about
and the ones that we know about at the moment are the ones revealed from the census
the information from the department of the UNK nineteen eight nine based household projections suggests that in fact there is a slightly larger number possibly erm in the round and that is five thousand dwellings as opposed to the three thousand one hundred and seventy we're seeking to include
and so to take what we would describe as a reasonable view on this we say that if you know from evidence there are a number of concealed households you should seek to accommodate them
and it is that is essentially the bottom line
erm one could plan to accommodate more on the chance that they will arise but we're not putting that forward
erm the then the seems to us the final er difference between ourselves and the er county council is the issue of migration and what's already been referred to as environmental discounts
i'm sure we'll come on to discuss the nature and extent of those environmental discounts later
erm but what we would say at this stage is that there doesn't seem any rationale behind the discounts that have been applied by the county council indeed we have a situation in hambleton district where there is a seventy percent discount erm which doesn't seem to us to have been explained or justified
erm we have put forward an alternative er mechanism for environmental discounts and er i can say by at this stage by reference to the erm UNK that has taken place of that of those environmental discounts in n y eleven that erm while we wouldn't go along with making anywhere near the additions that are suggested there erm it may be that it would be sensible to make a further discount in respect of the heritage coast
so long as that does not include whitby and scarborough and er any settlements to the west of the what is essentially the coast road
erm it may be that it is sensible to make that discount and would only UNK apply to scarborough dis district but as for the rest of the additional elements of er environmental discount that should be applied i can't see why you should apply a discount in relation to agricultural land
i'm not aware we've got people living physically on agricultural land at the moment they are fields as far as i know
er and it would be just as sensible to make a discount for industrial land on that basis
i don't see why you should make a discount in respect of UNK
it is a matter of fact that UNK simply UNK people around
indeed the york greenbelt is entirely designed to do that
UNK people from york to er according to this structure plan alteration partly to a new settlement on the outside of the greenbelt
and indeed within the greenbelt there are a number of settlements which we are sitting in one at the moment
er which er have housing proposals within them and er to just make an average for the discount for the whole of the relevant parish would be to UNK that particular case
erm so we have we have er a major difference there
erm but our summary really would be that if one followed the county councils proposals this county would end up with a severe housing shortage
and that will actually drive people away from north yorkshire
it won't actually stop people coming in to north yorkshire
we don't have UNK in this country although as a long standing UNK i've always thought we should have them with lancashire but that's another issue
erm but we don't and in fact what will happen in a housing shortage is that in migrants will be able to buy their way in
to some extent the government's policy of affordable housing will enable an element of affordable housing to be provided but it won't satisfy the needs of either people who are currently on the bottom of the housing rung and seeking to move up nor will h help people who might be seeking to afford to c to come in as first time buyers as opposed to people who are otherwise er some other arrangement through an affordable housing provider
i have circulated round this morning three er sheets which help demonstrate that particular point
the second sheet which is headed commitments is a list which is derived from er the statements made by the different authorities er about the number of dwellings which are already permitted in one form or another
er within their area
and we can see there that there are some nearly thirty three and a half thousand dwellings already committed
and having looked at identified needs for affordable housing within again various statements made by the local authorities and compared those with the commitments that are left in other words the places where they could reasonably be found we get some fairly large percentages of affordable housing requirement le on the remaining land
and on the front sheet o entitled affordable housing we see there that in the case of hambleton we'd be looking at forty one percent of the remaining dwellings being UNK being affordable houses down to york where it goes up to ninety percent
that is on the basis of the proposals put forward by the county council
on the other hand if the panel were to accept the figures which we are putting forward you can see from the s the t table at the bottom of the page those UNK come back to down to much more reasonable amounts
and we would say that is much more likely to be achieved
in short we are the people who are looking after the interests of the north yorkshire people
and providing for their needs
similarly i have also circulated a table entitled environmental capacity where i have looked at what is the difference in percentage land take terms between the proposals of the county council and the proposals of the federation
we can see from that table that even on UNK land we are talking about a difference of point one nine percent of land take
i would suggest to you that this must be an UNK environmentally sensitive county if it cannot afford over fifteen years to take an extra point one nine percent of its UNK land into development
and if by doing so it was to ensure that people who are already resident in this area are driven this would be a totally inadequate response to the needs of the people of north yorkshire
if we convert your nought point one nine percent into hectares we're talking about roughly five hundred is that right
erm
if i if i take
yes
yes two one four o from
yes
one six four eight
yes
that
erm
sorry
just one final point if i may about er about migration
which i'll just pick up on as a as a final point
erm mr introduced the prospect that erm if they'd have taken migration over the last three years it would have been a much reduced figure
oh yes of course it was the last three years have been a recession what else would you expect
we don't think it is sensible to plan for a recession
and indeed given the number of dwellings that are proposed by the county council we see from completion rates that in fact those figures broadly compare to the sort of completion rates we've had through the recession
this then is essentially as we see it a plan for the recession
it is not a plan for the needs of the people of north yorkshire
and indeed in efforts to des to also confirm our UNK in the figure that we've put forward despite the fact that it's much higher than the counties i have included in my submission paragraph thirty nine that there are a number of factors we could have taken into account but haven't have chosen not to do so er which would have in fact UNK the dwelling requirement
and one of them to some extent has already been discussed
which was which was that we didn't take the whole of the vacant dwellings we only took a part even though we are not aware of any planning policy that will restrict occupation of dwellings as second homes
thank you
mr thank you for that er so we're still talking in terms of a difference of just over twelve thousand dwellings between yourselves and the county
indeed
er at the risk of UNK everybody again can i go back to the point which has been made by north yorkshire on this summary sheet here
to the apparent difference between yourselves and them on the death statistics
yeah
i mean is this real or is it a red herring which
well i think it's only part of the picture that is one element of er the whole make up of er of the population structure
and therefore it takes one element and er it erm it seeks to highlight that particular element
i would also say that in fact er in the paper that the number of deaths is converted into houses by UNK application of a factor of one point seven
which i understand is the pensioner h er occupancy rate
i in other words all the extra deaths are going to occur only in pensioners
that may be very good news for the people of south yorkshire who are below the age of sixty five but i don't think it's realistic
erm and so er i think that is a slightly over exaggerated figure anyway and should be more like four thousand one hundred dwellings even on this basis
but that said erm what it what the position is er i is that we have put into the model well we haven't put it into the model because it was given to us a part of the model and possibly by now north yorkshire may have the revised model no they haven't yet
but erm and essentially the difference is this if i can illustrate it by means of reference to appendix four in er n y two of o of north yorkshire
it seems to me from looking at the figures within the projections that what north yorkshire are planning is that we'll have a return to that widening black area that's part of that particular diagram
what we are saying and this is as a result of figures which are supplied by o p c s is that we are broadly saying that we will remain in this narrow band towards the end
mm
and that essentially is the difference
and erm since we're both to some extent crystal ball UNK i suggest it's a matter of choice which to believe is most likely
thank you
mr
steven
i think i can help you on the particular limited point of deaths and their effect
erm you asked some while ago whether it shouldn't be possible at least to have a an agreed view on how many people are dying as it were
but what is more difficult is to have an agreed view on how many people will die and at what rate in the year two thousand and one and beyond
erm i have laid round the table this morning and i hope you have it a single sheet of paper which sets out the component differences between the projections and the county council
i only want to speak at this UNK on the element of that which is due to lower mortality as i call it i e deaths and this is addressed in paragraph five and in the table at the bottom which shows an effect of about two thousand er extra households due to lower mortality rate assumptions in our projections
lower that is than the county council
the difference arises essentially from an improvement which is now evident in the latest national projections
and those date from a nineteen ninety one base as compared to what was being forecast from the nineteen eighty nine
thank you
any view from the county on that point
mrs
mrs north yorkshire county council
i think one point that seems to have UNK been missed by the h b f or is the fact that the population is growing
i too do have increased erm life expectancy for the very elderly in our figures the number of eighty five increased by sixty percent
we are not trying to say that the number of deaths are going to increases substantially so that the population is not growing
within the sorry within the h b f projections the populations grows by seventy thousand persons so even though we have increased death statistics mortality statistics where life expectancy is going to increase by applying those onto a higher population you're naturally going to have more deaths
i don't see how that you can possible reduce the number of deaths within the county or even maintain it at the same level
with this sort of growth
and migration is restricted to the very young we do have high levels of migration by those in retirement age groups
can i add a supplementary er c coming back er
i think it's very UNK that er h b f didn't deny that they'd made a mistake on this number and just talking about old people er the fact is that eighty five percent of deaths in the county occur to people aged over sixty five
and so er there is a very strong correlation between er age and death unfortunately
and we're not trying to er be er unduly UNK about this but recognize the facts of life
er the er narrow band that is referred to in eighty nine nineteen ninety one between births and deaths
we would be very pleased to see it continue to narrow indeed we wouldn't wish to see it revert but that again is a demographic fact
er not because of the number of deaths is going to vary UNK very significantly as mrs said we are allowing it to improve over time gradually
but it's a factor because of the births is more UNK
and the numbers of births will reduce and so there will be more deaths
er m more of a natural change
i roy house builders federation
i think i must come back with the fact that i haven't denied we made a mistake
i haven't confirmed it either
erm the simple fact is that the factors that have gone into the model that which we have used have been the nineteen ninety one based UNK mortality and infant mortality rates
and have been the nineteen ninety one based UNK local correction factors
the fact that it gives a different result from the ones that north yorkshire have used certainly they've used the UNK eight nineteen eighty nine based UNK mortality infant mortality rates
i'm not sure what local correction factor they've used
i thought from the discussion we had a month or so ago that they've used the eighty three based correction factors but it maybe something else because the description this morning was given it was some lo other local one
but nevertheless it's a different one
the fact of the matter is we've used different factors
i used ones supplied which come UNK effectively from government sources
they have used some other
they are different but they're not necessarily right or wrong
mrs north yorkshire county council
the actual local correction factors that are supplied by the institute are calculated by themselves
they do look at the statistics the government statistics for UNK and mortality but they have then the ability to amend to adjust to local erm to match up with local information
but they are supplied by the institute and not the government
i don't want to be UNK about this but i mean they are government based
it's a comparison of what's happening in the county in terms of UNK of births and deaths and what's happening nationally
so of course they're based on national figures
i have a i have a nasty suspicion that we could go on all day like this if i allowed it to happen
er i d i don't think that we as a panel are necessarily going to ever and it may not be our role in fact to do so to come to a judgement on it but i would have thought as a matter of common sense and common agreement that there should be some er way in which the various parties would come together on the basic demographic statistics and would certainly accept that certain basic projections should be used i in looking forward
but before i move on to suggest we have a break for coffee is there anyone else would like to pick up any points on the demographic matters that we've been discussing leaving aside the discussions on migration
come back to that later on
leeds
mr from leeds
yes ed from leeds city council
yes chair i i'd like to raise a question
is it legitimate for north yorkshire to include environmental discounts in their calculation
and i say that because as mr touched on in his introduction the west yorkshire districts are set a methodology for the definition of their housing requirement buy r p g two
strategic guidance for west yorkshire
now that guidance does not UNK the west yorkshire districts to introduce environmental constraints the calculation of their housing requirement
necessarily therefore if north yorkshire proceed with environmental constraints applying in their county as a whole the proper planning of the region is being frustrated because somebody is not being planned for
mr
can i just clarify er this point that the concept of environmental discounts is not one that's been pursued by the county council though the secretary of state quite clearly requires local to take into account environmental consideration
environmental discounts and our comments on those are in relation to a concept i think introduced largely by er the house builders federation
and our comments are to what you should or should not include erm as an environmental discount
so it's not our concept we're not applying environmental discounts
the county council's position is that er it has taken on board environmental considerations
i think if you look at the house UNK papers there you will see their idea of environmental discount
i think environmental discount and environmental considerations are factors which we'll come back to in looking at the migration rates so you're going to have another shot at this one
mr
yes thank you chair
erm it's really just coming back on the issue of concealed household earlier
er notice from the york city council's submission there is a difference in opinion between ourselves and the county on the calculation of housing requirement for the city of york
that what is discussing this morning a relatively minor difference in terms of numbers
now it does in fact arise from this issue of concealed households
erm i think it is one of the important that should be UNK
i think as mr did say erm the issue of affordable housing is a very real one
the government guidance er in p g three makes it very clear now that it's an issue we do have to address and if we don't for land requirement
