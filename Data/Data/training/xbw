we live in urban areas as well as rural areas
erm
and so we have considered that an additional should be made in the city of york to take account of a policy objective of reducing the level of concealed and sharing households
thank you for that
can i just finish this session with one question back to north yorkshire because i think you said within your sorry within your sorry i'll come back to you within your projections you actually take account of concealed households
they are identified
true or false
false
they are identified within the census
yes
the additional dwellings are not added on to eliminate the problem
however as the actual number of dwellings increased the proportion of those living in concealed households does actually reduce
right okay
i understand now what you're saying
mr
steven
two small points sir still on these UNK of projections
and the first is to pick up on concealed households and just to add to the points that have already been made that erm neither the house builders federation nor ourselves are assuming that all be housed but the projected number is five thousand whereas we're housing three thousand odd of them
but also to say that elsewhere in this region planning is on a basis that all consumer households will be housed
west yorkshire and south yorkshire strategic guidance housing numbers include all concealed households
so if we are to have a consistent regional planning framework that should be weighed in the balance as to whether they're taken into account in north yorkshire
i also want to actually draw your attention to one item on household rates
i hesitate to do so because that's actually a source of difference between us and the county council
but there are parties round this table who have UNK for a projections
and i've put around today a short paper which has a graph attached to it which i think adds to the explanation when i draw your attention to
it's a graph of average household size in north yorkshire and it's to that extent it's an attempt to summarize into one figure the UNK rate effect as it affects average household size
the falling line in er in a continuous line is
derived either from county council sources or actual census reports so that is as it were fact
and when you come to the lines on the right hand side you have two views of the future which are labelled eighty five based and eighty nine based
and the are these are the d o UNK projected household sizes from those two sets of household projections
and i think the point the graph makes very clearly is that the eighty nine based set up here at least in my view to fit far better to what has been happening than eighty five based set
not only had a much slower rate of fall but are actually detached nineteen ninety one from what we know has been happening
thank you
thank you
mr
yes
chairman representing
i'd like to ask a question please of mr
could he explain or clarify please what his UNK land this four hundred and ninety two hectares
is it erm the national parks and greenbelt or i'd like to understand what it means
erm the if you turn to the er selby submission on h one you'll find a table at the back of that submission and that's where that's the that's where that the basis of that
could you are you happy with that
erm
would you like it spelt out
i'd like to turn to the
selby
selby
selby h one
have a look at it while we're having
coffee mr
can we have a break now for fifteen minutes
come back at quarter to twelve
are you
no that's
yes sir the erm
mr UNK
mr grigson the positive paper this morning was er one item and also the more general question of the nineteen eighty nine projections closer than the nineteen eighty five ones
er we've used the nineteen eighty nine ones but we are reluctant to do so
we don't necessarily believe that they are all correct in what they say
sorry the nineteen eighty nine projections for what
UNK
erm they're obtained by looking at the results of the labour force survey which is a very small proportion of households UNK each year
and so there must be an element of doubt over having updated from nineteen eighty one here to nineteen eighty nine
er we are confirmed in our reservations about this by the results of the regional census study as i noted in my brief commentary n y three
erm the point about the regional census study was that it did a reasonably good job of analyzing the present situation but not a very good job of the projections
and we did compare the eighty nine based UNK rates come from that ninety one against the census in
and it showed er some doubt about the er actually levels of comparison but there was a question mark they raised specifically about north yorkshire
north yorkshire in that context was different to what they found in the rest of the region
there is n there is a doubt about whether the eighty nine UNK rates are appropriate
had we used the eighty five ones the housing provision would be some ten thousand or so fewer than it is
two thousand and six
sorry could you repeat
ten thousand
ten thousand
the second small point i just wish to UNK was er coming from what the house builders federation said earlier about the house builders being the people who are looking after the interests os north yorkshire locals
i would remind all concerned that the local needs element in the predictions is sixteen and a half thousand dwellings
this as far as i'm aware hasn't been challenged by anybody else
so any dwellings over and above sixteen and a half thousand would only be taken by people moving into the county and not by locals
and so it would not be right to say that we're not looking after the local element of the population
i don't think that was necessarily the drift of the house builders comment
but er i'll leave that
your comment about the UNK rates raise an interesting issue in fact goes back to the comment mr made about the west yorkshire and south yorkshire who've got a consistent approach in UNK
is that correct
that's correct
i'm not sure whether mrs is either able or would wish to comment necessarily at this stage but er and i but is there any possibility that in the course of the operating the r p g although i know that UNK to me certainly
is there any likelihood that consistency of approach which is being used by the south yorkshire and west yorkshire counties would er could be UNK adopted for o by other authorities in the north yorkshire county
thank you chairman
margaret d o e
the erm draft of or the advice that the local planning authorities intend to give to the secretary of state is currently out for consultation we hope that it will be submitted by the end of the year
at the moment the figures of housing provision in that draft advice are UNK are done on a rather different basis for west yorkshire as opposed to the other counties in the region
it remains to be seen what figures are included when it is submitted to the secretary of state and what view he takes on that
but certainly when we in the regional office get that advice before we put a submission to ministers we will of course try to UNK the figures so that they are on a consistent basis
as for mr 's point that not mr b steven 's point that the erm figures for the strategic guidance for west and south yorkshire were done on a different basis those figures with the exception of sheffield were erm figures that were put in by the local planning authorities the secretary of state accepted those figures they were done on the nineteen eighty five based household projections coupled with different assumptions about vacancy rates and UNK etcetera and the secretary of state accepted those figures
erm in my view the secretary of state may come to the view on the latest figures that are available for him and erm no that is what i hope he will do when it comes to erm producing regional guidance
thank you
i m i must confess i'm one of these simple folk who thought that once we got the nineteen ninety one census figures through then it would it would all start into place
me too chairman
however
can i just
carry on
i was going to add a supplementary point er on that very issue of the nineteen ninety one census
er referring to the graph in er mr 's paper which showed that er the UNK well UNK to show the nineteen eighty nine based UNK rate figures were more in line with past experience
er that very much depends on the er intervening line at nineteen ninety one
and i'm just wondering whether er the er point at nineteen ninety one is a correct v in view of the under UNK er in the census which isn't taken into account
so it could be that there were line from eighty one would come up to the eight five based starting point er a rather than the eighty nine based starting point on the graph
we can't look into it because it's only just been given to us
i would i would suspect that it needs some interpretation
has anybody or else want to make any comments on the
i'd like to move on to this er this issue of migration
chairman i wonder whether i could just make a sort of general statement from the department's view before we go on to a particular issue if i may
erm i hope it didn't take too long to read our statement
it was rather shorter than everybody else's
erm i understand that the house builders federation have written to my headquarters on expressing concern about the possible UNK of the regional office having actually put forward a suggested figure for housing provision in north yorkshire
we thought from where we sat that the department should stand up and be counted along with all the other participants around the table
i hope you will view that figure in that light
it is not necessarily the secretary of state's definitive view it is the view that erm the regional office have come to given the erm evidence presented at the time
erm secondly i'm not a UNK i am unable to comment about all the UNK of the various assumptions that go into things but some of the people sitting around this table will know that i've been in yorkshire and humberside for quite some time
i therefore have a fair amount experience of this region and also erm i have been involved in quite a lot of erm estimates of housing provision over the years
we've set out the assumptions that erm we used as a basis for our projections in the note in front of you
i hold no great UNK to those assumptions
i'm sure many people sitting around this table could drive a horse and cart through any of them
but i believe that what you should do with trying to come to estimates of housing provision is to put together the best technical assumptions that you can to then sit down and take a long hard look at the figures based on the erm the policies of the county council as approved by the secretary of state in previous structure plan approvals the current government policy
i have particularly in mind the erm regeneration initiatives of this government the experience that erm you know of an area and erm the experience of what is happening in neighbouring counties
this chairman is what we have done
our conclusions for what they are worth are set out and we come to a figure of about forty five thousand
well
thank you
yes well
mm
for the next day and a half
can i just come back to this migration question
and
but the difference between the h b f and the county council on migration is somewhere in the order of four thousand
no
now on a north yorkshire i can't remember which paper it is
it's in one of those
in one of those papers there is a figure a hundred percent migration forty six thousand
correct
yes
now very simple if i UNK forty one thousand two hundred from forty six thousand you'll probably say i'm doing the wrong sum
erm we have a difference of four thousand eight hundred
now is that difference four thousand eight hundred due to UNK or entirely to your adjustments to take account of environmental considerations
yes that is
the question is do i need
i'm chairman
i think it's impossible to explore why there is a difference it does not explain why the matters we have already discussed like vacancies households and death rates why there is a difference between what the county council say is one hundred percent and what the h b f and others are advocating which is considerably more
first of all can i check that i am right in saying that the difference between the h b UNK figures of fifty three thousand and the county council's figure of forty six thousand is explained by the vacancies concealed households death rates etcetera
yes
can i short circuit that question and say what in fact is your hundred percent
erm roy house builders federation
erm fifty five thousand e no sorry i'll have to look that up
one hundred percent migration
never mind the other factors concealed households
fi yeah
fifty five thousand seven hundred
erm steven
it would be fifty four thousand eight hundred if there was no reduction for environmental considerations
to what extent is the difference between that figure or those figures and the county council's forty six thousand not explained by what
roy house builders federation
my understanding is that there isn't any difference that is not explained by those
those figures
erm the difference between us is of the order of ten thousand i think
erm
yeah
that's a for your calculations
mhm
no i'll have to i'll i'm afraid i'll have to withdraw that comment
there is not erm i would erm i have the figures ready to hand but
i think peter north yorkshire
i think on this side there's also a degree of corporate confusion at north yorkshire about the what exactly the what exactly we we're trying to establish during this current round of er
i'm trying to establish put down a figure of forty six thousand for migration
that was taken for vacant dwellings
yes
what we are trying at this stage is the extent to which the difference between the h b UNK of fifty five thousand is explained by any technical treatment of migration as opposed to
chairman i wonder whether it would help if i quoted from the erm the study into b the census information
the and other information
their figure for north yorkshire for eighty one to ninety one from the national health service register was forty seven point two inward
the residual estimate which is from the census figures was fifty point nine
i don't know whether that helps in any way
roy house builders federation
er that they're not the figures that ei either the county or ourselves started from
i think i can answer your original question now if i may
erm i think i'm right in saying that the difference on a hundred percent migration between the house builders federation and the county council is accounted for by the technical differences that we've talked about this morning one thousand six hundred
seven hundred and forty which you may card to ignore that there are some base dwellings
yeah
two thousand four hundred and ninety on vacancies
and three thousand one hundred and seventy concealed households
and the remaining difference which i estimate to be one thousand five hundred is really the i think is the difference in the treatment of students
martin north yorkshire
i think we all agree with er mr that there is a technical element to migration figures which is our fifteen hundred dwellings
as a difference between us on technical measure
sir if i could complete the er arithmetic i think it would be helpful if you were to look again at the single page note that was handed on this morning
at the table in paragraph seven where we set out our differences from the county council
i appreciate this is not in quite the form you asked the question but you asked the question in terms of the differences apart from migration considerations
and as i'm able to do the arithmetic the difference between the county council's full migration which is forty six thousand two hundred and ours with no environmental reduction which i gave you as fifty four thousand eight hundred comes if i've done my arithmetic right to eight thousand six hundred
if that's the difference between us which are not due to migration environment
if you now look at the table you'll see that that's made out of three thousand two hundred for concealed households
two thousand one hundred for a constant vacancy proportion
a difference of one thousand one hundred in the base dwellings stock which i've not discussed and don't propose to go into
and two thousand for the lower death rates national projections which i've already mentioned
and i think that will be roughly of the order of eight thousand six hundred so those are our component differences
yeah well does anybody want to make any comment on that because i'm quite environmental considerations
yes
mr
er john of consultants on behalf of the er council for the protection of rural england
erm you you've asked er chairman for a general comment on what's been referred to as environmental discount environmental considerations and so forth
i think the c p r UNK general comments and you'll see from our evidence that we we've deliberately not entered into the debate that you you've heard to date this morning
er our general response is that the approach for the county council is to be UNK erm i in terms of i think interpreting the true spirit of government guidance in plan making that erm the discussion about figures is but one consideration
er to take into account wh when coming to agreement as to what the overall levels should be
erm i think we feel quite strongly that erm er the emphasis that should be placed on environmental considerations is considerable
erm and as such erm are concerned that perhaps i it is becoming a secondary element erm i in the debate
in that it's just being er interpreted as a percentage reduction erm as t to migration rates
erm and i think just by way of introductory comment i refer to the paper that north yorkshire put round n y eleven erm in which there there's a far UNK discussion in there of what of what the environmental constraints are and what the considerations should be
er county wide in terms of er how they should be reflected erm in the figures
and i think er w we're concerned that erm the case presented by the county has in concentrating on migration perhaps they haven't fully expanded on the points that they've raised in document n y eleven
i wonder if by way of introduction the county might wish to comment on that
do you want to
well i re peter north yorkshire
i don't wonder whether it would be helpful just step back a bit and just look at the county council's view as to how it should treat migration in the light of what the secretary of state has approved on two occasions when this issue has come up
on the issue of migration and it's relationship with adjoining counties
and our view is that whichever way you look at approved structure plan and the two decisions of the secretary of state first of all in er on the approved structure plan and secondly on the first alteration to the structure plan
quite clearly there is recognition that there should be some limit to the level of migration er inward migration in north yorkshire
and the UNK the secretary of state is quite clear that the environmental constraint in north yorkshire is a particularly important one
although we might try to decision method the overall stress of the secretary of state's decision methods as they affect north yorkshire is that there must be some limit er to migration largely for environmental considerations and indeed the panel in nineteen eighty seven were very concerned that er migration would not be UNK quickly enough er in north yorkshire
so the there is the county council we must try er and moderate migration
and it would appear to many rather UNK within that agreed by the secretary of state a matter of general principle the county council accepted past level er of migration without looking er at the implications er of that
and indeed there are some who make think that the county council has been too generous in that the reduction from the hundred percent migration in four districts er amounts only to somewhere about four and a half er thousand dwellings
now within that overall context and h b f say we have no right to do that it conflicts with
we say that it is important to the general stress erm of the structure plan
there should be some reduction er in migration er into north yorkshire
that's the basic philosophy of the county council's approach er in this plan
yes er joe representing UNK samuel UNK brewery in tadcaster
there is a technical difference that i should erm draw attention draw the panel's attention to between ourselves and erm other p other in the migration rates
we believe that the migration rates that should be used should be a three year average rather than an eight or a ten year average
our reasons for that are that the especially the eight year average used by the county council are unduly UNK by the boom of the late eighties and give in our view to high a trend t to erm to work from
er the second reason that we would suggest this to the panel is that it is actually er used by UNK the three year average is used by UNK rather than an eight year average
and as far as i can see the only reason for an eight year average is because that was accepted by the previous panel
well i don't believe that should necessarily be a reason why it should be accepted in this case in by this panel
and it would in our view give a more accurate reflection of current trends if a shorter period were used
but if you're using three year average three recent three years
that you in fact recession
well in fact we do answer that point in our submissions that in fact it does take in our three year average does take into account the tail end of the boom
so it does actually span the end of the boom the UNK of the recession
yes gentleman the problem is the shorter the period the less chance you have of getting a measurement which is necessarily representative of a general trend
yes i would accept that as a general point yes that the greater number of years the more likely you are to get a long term trend
but er there is a and i UNK inevitably er one does stray into i know want it in particular points at the moment but there is a policy consideration to be borne in mind as well which erm does suggest that past trends should not necessarily be projected into the future
and i from a technical point of view i would support my case by saying that if UNK use it it's good enough for us if it's good enough for UNK
can i know we've got two people wanting to make comments on this
mr
yes chairman er mike cleveland county council
er i'm not quite sure what er stage you want us to b be involved on this intensive policy but i can't comment on the UNK of the vacancy rates even migration rates
but erm in terms of policy erm cleveland county council supports the approach that north yorkshire and the district councils in the area are taking
er on two counts in terms of policy
er and following what er miss indicated
erm we have a major regeneration er issue in cleveland and would like to retain as much of the population within the urban area within the compact urban area that we have as possible
and secondly we do recognize the quality of the countryside south of cleveland and need to retain its character and the lit the character of its villages which erm in fact do add to the attractions of the area when you're trying to e erm bring in new industry
er undoubtedly a number of erm our res er our er employed people do live in the area immediately adjoining to the south and er the figures that hambleton have produced and our own estimates based on the national health er service records on migration do indicate that there is a strong movement er on an annual basis into the north yorkshire area and in particular the sort of area
and we do recognize there are limits on the sort of growth in that area
so erm i can give you more detailed figures on these er if you wish
i don't i don't need to
and that's er just broadly speaking we wish to support the general approach that north yorkshire and it's districts are taking in terms of changing the trend
okay
mr
thank you sir steven
keeping away fro the area of UNK on migration
i think we all need to bear in mind that as far as what mr said about what the approved strategy was and what the secretary of sta of state previously said
as i read the previous documents the strategy was to bring down the rate of development in north yorkshire and that has happened
from the late seventies to the nineteen eighties or rather from the from the seventies not just late seventies to the nineteen eighties it's come down about a thousand broad terms a thousand dwellings a year fewer being built
and we see that strategy as having succeeded
and we applaud the county council for it
it shouldn't go to their heads
and it seems to me to follow that the migration rates which go with that lower rate are the migration rates consistent with the approved strategy
and we don't see in principle any reason to divert from them
the second point i want to make is in relation to something that has changed since the approved strategy and that is the inter relationship between north yorkshire and west yorkshire
i know we're going to come on to this again later
i only want to deal with it in broad terms and that is that compared to earlier e i ps where west yorkshire authorities were saying don't take too many people into north yorkshire as you'll undermine our regeneration to UNK
we now have the west yorkshire authorities saying hang about you're loading too much onto us by not taking your share of migration out of west yorkshire
and that seems to me a fairly fundamental shift in the regional balance of argument and need
i only have one small comment in the point made by consultants for the c p r e that one should place more emphasis on the environment
i'm afraid it's a negative comment
but the c p r UNK evidence doesn't offer you anything to go on save that the figures have been approached in the wrong way cos they didn't start bottom up from the environment
and on that argument sir the figures would be wrong whatever they are whether they're half the amount the county council put forward or twice
it's a valid point but it doesn't actually help you come to a recommendation
and finally staying with UNK on migration i think it UNK us all to be a bit cautious because i see quite a lot of fantasy and fiction around in this e i p and i'd be guilty of it myself at times
we're all talking as if migration can be UNK and a share between housing for migrants and housing for local need can be er arranged by us planners according to the numbers we write down on a sheet of paper
and in my experience that usually is a UNK expectation
migration has particularly from metropolitan areas a certain tendency to keep going a certain UNK about it
and i would just caution all of us when we're discussing local needs or migration be it at the county level or at the district council level
how a little sort of warning flag that pops up in your mind to say this may actually be largely fiction and we can't control migration anyway
i appreciate that's a useful way to discuss it but let's not imagine it's necessarily going to turn out like that
what about
mr
yeah
roy house builders federation
to pick on u up a few other points that have been made
i heard mr say i think that it that the view of the h b f was that the county had no ra right to make reductions in migration
that is not the h b f evidence
the h b f evidence is that we they've no right to make any arbitrary reductions in just taking er UNK blocks
and indeed b p g twelve under the heading of environmental considerations says that a authorities should have regard to environmental considerations but recommend an environmental appraisal identifying UNK weighing up and reporting on the environmental and other cost benefits of the measures which are proposed
that doesn't form part of this alteration there is no such justification and that's our particular objection to it
in so far as a three year average is concerned point b made by mr and erm that being taken into account the tail end of the boom
i have to say that the boom of the nineteen eighties was something of a myth
yes certainly in the late nineteen eighties more houses were built in one particular year depend depending on which part of the country you're in it happens to be different years
but the at the end of the UNK nineteen eighties
compared with the average of the eighties as a whole
but the average of the eighties as a whole was low in house building terms
it was the lowest decade of house building since the second world war
and in fact on the county council's own figures which have g got UNK since nineteen seventy seven you'll find that nineteen seventy seven to nineteen seventy nine have higher house building rates than the highest rate of the nineteen e the highest year of the nineteen eighties
which rather proves a point that in fact it was a low period and therefore if you take a low period historically which is er includes a boom in inverted commas within that then overall you're going to end up with a very low figure er in total
so er it seems to me that it's particularly UNK to take the last three years
erm as far as the c p r UNK point is concerned about erm government the true spirit of government guidance being to take environmental considerations first i find no UNK support for that within any of the p gs
indeed p g one paragraph four talks about UNK development to the right places
as well as preventing development which is not acceptable
p g three e paragraph one says the planning system must provide an adequate and continuous supply of land for housing
all seems to me and i could quote other references from p gs as well to support the point seems to me that the thrust of government guidance is balance
it is a matter of providing for the right amount of development in a balanced way
it is not putting environmental considerations first last and if there's any left over in between as well
er i don't wish to pursue the point made by mi mike at this stage but i will return to it under one c
thank you
michael hambleton district council
erm i think i'd like to pick on er up on something that mr has said about the strategy underlying the er approved structure plan
and also to support er mr
erm i think that certain elements of the structure plan erm strategy have been well UNK er the environmental issues erm high priority to conservation erm protection of the county's natural resources of development restraint and relating the scale of development much more closely to local needs
however there's erm a further aspect of the original strategy which i would like specifically to draw to the panel's attention
this is that the strategy of the structure plan from the beginning was to seek a progressive reduction in the rate of house building in the county by seeking a progressive excuse me
a progressive reduction in the rate of inward migration
and i i'd refer the panel erm to the written statement of the county structure plan of nineteen seventy nine erm and the section entitled the strategic framework paragraph three nine on page ten
which states erm the strategy UNK a progressive reduction in the rate of the population growth from this source as the supply of housing land is reduced to levels more closely related to the needs arising from north yorkshire
now the original structure plan recognized that because of the substantial number of housing commitments at that time erm it wasn't possible erm to er bring down the levels immediately
and it was going to be a long term strategy
the term long term strategy in fact appears in a number of instances erm throughout those pages
and i'd refer you to paragraph three ten and also paragraph four two which i'd like to quote a short erm element from
and this states erm that its effectiveness erm must be must be considered as a long term rather than a short term objective
the structure plan can not be seen for providing for a major or sudden change in direction
it's essentially UNK in its approach
so the point erm i wish to make erm on er mr 's observations is that it's not the strategy of the structure plan was not simply erm to seek an initial reduction erm in the rate of residential development in the county and then that roll that rate forward in progressive erm amendments to the structure plan hambleton district council believes that the logical interpretation of these statements is that a progressive reduction er in house building and the rates of migration should be sought through subsequent alterations to the plan
now we would add that representations which seek to achieve a continuation of past building rates or a continuation of past migration levels are not in accord with the strategy as originally approved
finally i'd refer you to erm the secretary of state's decision letter of the twenty sixth of november nineteen eighty where in paragraph one he takes note of the recent justification and in paragraph six four he states that overall the secretary of state broadly UNK the main objective of the housing policies of the plan of reducing inward migration into the county
yes i'd j i'd just like to pick up on two points er one made by mr one made by mr
erm i think er mr said i think that c p r e hasn't actually offered a solution in this debate just raised questions
i don't think that's strictly true but i do think that the discussion we've heard so far er has fully justified erm the raising of some fundamental questions about the method of projections
er and the point about not offering a solution c p r e clearly has in erm taking to go on to talk about the subsequent parts of policy h one and h two the county council's figures and then doing an analysis of those in relation to the new settlement but i appreciate chairman that erm we'll come back to that
mr raised the point about erm the environmental appraisal of development plans erm as set out in p g twelve which is indicative of a new er a new framework in which plans should be prepared
and i would argue that er an alteration to a structure plan of this significance should fall within the remit of p g twelve
my understanding of what mr was saying was that because it's an alteration rather than a replacement structure plan that guidance no longer applies
that's not my understanding of how government guidance works
peter north yorkshire
i think mr picked up on the points that i really wanted to address in mr 's remarks
other than to say the secretary of state didn't limit his concern to reducing rates of development
right through the decision letters you get two elements
the effect of excessive development on the environment in north yorkshire and the second on is a relationship with places like cleveland and west yorkshire and the need to continue to see regeneration within those areas
it was a much broader package of for the secretary of state than i think mr er suggests
the other point which mr made on the difficulties of er UNK migration
and i think quite cl clearly there are difficulties in UNK migration
what it does require are UNK policies either side er of county boundaries
mr er about the policies of cleveland within their area to retain their population by making massive allocations of land
er adjacent er to a north yorkshire boundary
and if you go to places like erm UNK erm er and south middlesbrough there you will see a range of housing types available for range of groups in the community
if they weren't there those houses i suspect a large proportion of those people would now be living in north yorkshire
so there's a requirement of UNK policies
and the county council's consistently said to the west yorkshire authorities you must make provision for a range of sites in suitable locations to help draw er development that would UNK otherwise come to north yorkshire
now something's been said for certainly fifteen years er that i can remember
michael
several points on the question of migration as reported or a as included by the secretary of state in his decision letters
the first point i'd like to make is that the original decision letter dates from excuse me twenty sixth of november nineteen eighty
we're now thirteen years further on
i think whilst the secretary of state has clearly said what he's said in that decision letter
i think we have to remind ourselves that is thirteen years old and that circumstances have changed
not least in the neighbouring metropolitan areas where urban regeneration is thirteen years old
there's substantial improvement particularly in west yorkshire and that does need to be taken into account
i'll go on to say that on the question of progressive migration restraint i don't think anybody round this table is suggesting otherwise
the population projections that we have seen in front of us we h have discussed are based upon what has happened in the county over the past eight years
that is that is where the migration projections have come from
the these migration flows are already constrained by s existing structure plan policies
i think the close co relationship between the rate of building rate of past building and structure plan requirements shows that those policies have teeth
th that has been what's happened there has been a reduction in migration flow
or not in migration flow but in net inward migration
these population projections we have the hundred percent projections of the h b f of fifty five point k of north yorkshire of forty six point two k of fifty four point eight
none of the requests for housing requirement are at that level
that therefore assumes a continuing an i an increasingly progressive restraint on migration
mr sorry mr

erm mr referred to er put great store it seemed to me on the long term effectiveness of reducing er building
i'd just make the simple point that a sudden twelve point five percent reduction i referred to it this morning er in building is not progressively and long term it's a sudden change
erm and i think that erm the c p r e have most definitely UNK what i said
i'll repeat the point
i'm not saying that p g twelve does not apply
but i'm making the point it does apply but it has to be justified
you have to justify the UNK that you make
my criticism of the UNK that have been applied by the county council is that they have not been justified
and we would regard them as arbitrary
and i would also point out that we are not proposing excessive development in one of the papers i've put round and i repeat the point i made it earlier
we're talking about point one nine percent
point one nine percent of the remaining UNK land
as an addition
and that UNK in that calculation if you were taking the worst case that would all be UNK land
the truth of the matter is of course it probably wouldn't be all UNK land but that's the worst case that i'm talking about
s o i think that it would be a very special place if it was unable to absorb that amount of development
miss
yeah
d o e
i merely wish to reiterate government policy as reinforced by my secretary of state john UNK last week in the terms of the single bu regeneration budget
and the emphasis that government places on regeneration of the urban areas
are you going to submit that document
if you wish by all means yes
it seems to me to be important enough to be worth UNK if that can be arranged
fine
would you like would you like the press release
yes
please
yeah
mr do you want to come back on the point made on the other side of the room about your arbitrary selection of building rates
i think presumably you'll be wishing at a later stage to look at what we're proposing in erm in individual districts
and one against another
i think the quite clearly what comes out erm of reading our papers and the papers of the district is the er tremendous degree of consultation that's taken place on a number of occasions back and forth between district and making use of er of emerging working on er on local plans across the county
erm to make sure that the proposals the county council er is putting forward are UNK based
and we'd elaborate that when we talk about er individual districts
i think it might be worth UNK ask if there are any more demographic
and start again
right
i'd like to say a little bit about this table
now
mm
mhm
any more points anybody wants to make on the demographic aspects
the migration rates
environment i don't know whether that's later
well i think we'll probably deal with that this afternoon
yeah
yeah
there's a harrogate
mr
thank you er david harrogate borough council
er one or two small points i'd like to make
mr er a moment ago UNK the county council in fact on the success of the strategy in reducing migration over the last ten years or so
he then went on to say it's not actually possible to control the rate of migration and i'm sure that the s success of the policy in the past shows that is not the case
that it is possible through the appropriate use of policies to bring down levels of immigration into the county
er mr also made the point that er urban regeneration erm no longer seems to have the emphasis that it did have
er i'm sure that the er representatives from the west yorkshire authorities wi will say that their that objective is still extremely important in the in the respective u d ps
erm it seems to me that the emphasis has changed slightly in the representations being made by the west yorkshire authorities and that they're now saying that it's much more difficult for them to accommodate housing developments within their own er districts
and that therefore that growth should be UNK to north yorkshire
er another minor point er mr n erm said that e the level of UNK that we're er seeking to or that the county council is seeking to impose represents a sudden restriction on house building levels in north yorkshire
that certainly wouldn't be the case in harrogate
erm we would be allocating land through our local plan for the year two thousand and six
that restriction suddenly wouldn't be imposed in the next two or three years it would be a gradual reduction through to the year two thousand and six
and the point about erm er the extra development taking up only point one percent of the counties UNK land erm is statistical point really
it's even less taking up i er land being taken up in the region as a whole it's even less in terms of the u k
the important point is what it means for the settlement to the environment of north yorkshire
and er that level of development at five hundred hectares is an extremely large area of land in very sensitive locations particularly around the main urban areas which are restricted to a great degree
thank you
i think we'll come back to that when we start looking at the county district by district as it were
i think miss would like to make some comment about the table which was presented to her
i thought you might like an for the lunch hour
erm as the notes to this table indicate it is a UNK by the panel secretary of what we believe is before us
you will have noticed there are some pregnant gaps on this table
we're not optimistic that we will fill them all but one we can for example talk about conversions
the more numerical evidence we can have before us the better
as the chairman also said the table points up some interesting questions
one of those interesting questions is for example the relationship between column h and column i and the way in which those relationships change as we move from one district to another
thoughts for lunch time
mr
of
er this is clearly go going to become an important schedule and i think it you will inevitably run into difficulties here on different definitions of allocations for example
erm if you er if i take the greater york area for example erm if you er if i take the greater york area for example the county council erm have included in their figure of four thousand seven hundred and ten units no new allocations is my understanding
right
yes
yeah
yeah
this is the sort of thing we want to discuss as we go through each of the areas which we shall do under matter one c
or one c
but i think there must be i would suggest to you that you sh you should request a discussion between the principle parties here to agree what allocations they're taking whether in adopted plans or proposed plans or previous plans and what windfalls
one of the great problems of this schedule would be the definition of the amount of windfalls bearing in mind that many of the local plans coming forward erm are about to be produced rather than have just been produced
yeah
and i think that it is an important er qualification to this schedule that the principle parties can agree what the in UNK are
indeed and i would hope our discussion of the provision within individual districts will amend many of these figures
certainly those which are relate to the future as opposed to what has happened in the past
okay thank you
mr
martin north yorkshire county council
just a couple of quick comments er chairman just on the vacant co blank columns you have j k l and m
erm whilst the county council can provide you with some figures on vacancies at a district level we would be very UNK to make any comment on the assumptions for conversions and windfall sites
we feel that this is very much a matter for the district councils in the preparation of their local plans with their local knowledge which is something we do not have at the county level to be able to make comment on
yeah
i think we do accept that you probably not be able to fill those gaps
er some districts may have some knowledge
i mean hambleton for example having just produced their draft local plan but other districts are not quite in that position
yeah
but eventually those gaps would be filled
that's right
but certainly wherever it is possible to put a figure in then we would appreciate it
yeah could i also just quickly comment on the differences between columns h and i that you've referred to
that this does to a very large extent reflect the differences in local plan preparation across the county
you have already referred to UNK progress
mm
yeah
which is perhaps not matched with the s quite the same stage by other districts across the county
yes
yeah
i think that will be UNK or become clarified as we get into the discussion district by district
mr you want to come back on that
er richard
very briefly i think the county council must consider what they're going to do for conversions in windfalls
it's quite clear in p g three paragraph eleven that structure plans will make clear whether the housing provision figures include allowance from expected supply from conversions and changes of use as well as from new building
and for UNK and for losses from UNK
the exercise must be done and should have been done by now
mm
yeah my objective was not actually to start a debate but to give you some indication of where we were going to go this afternoon
food for thought
mr
leeds city council
i'd like to come back to policy on migration chair and i'm grateful to mr for pointing out that nineteen eighty is thirteen years ag away and things have moved on in every respect UNK
in development terms
we've even got a new planning system
and i venture to suggest we've got new guidance from the secretary of state
because we in west yorkshire have got regional planning guidance is sorry strategic planning guidance issued in nineteen eighty nine
yes
which tells us how to determine our housing requirements and doesn't ask us to take into account restraint in north yorkshire
but that s p g is about to be replaced by r p g isn't it
well we would all welcome that but in its absence i suggest that the current policy is defined by the r p g even though that's not specifically targeted at north yorkshire none the less to be consistent north yorkshire should not be entitled to a to reduce UNK it's er migration assumptions
as i understand it s p g is your s p g is not geared to the same time horizon is
d o e
UNK i just comment briefly chairman
the strategic planning guidance goes to two thousand and one
it was based on the figures that the west yorkshire authorities submitted to the secretary of state which was on a policy as i understand it of containing as much of their population they as they were possible to
erm they estimated there was going to be a continued out migration but the aim of the original west yorkshire structure plan and the p erm strategic guidance was to contain rather more of the population
regional planning guidance will go to two thousand and six
we shall have to see what that contains
yeah
i think that's all we can say at this stage
mm
thank you
i unless anybody has got a mr
erm
er
and mr second
just a just a very brief point
erm it relates to er something that mr said erm for er for leeds city council that circumstances have moved on
i would suggest that indeed they have moved on erm since erm the original er decision letter of the structure plan
one area in fact that circumstances have moved on is erm on environmental awareness
i think that erm all would agree that now there is greater er concern than ever before about environmental issues
erm planning legislation and advice in p gs erm have made the environment a far more prominent concern of planning than it was when erm the original structure plan was approved
and indeed the alterations were approved in nineteen eighty seven
erm authorities are expected to show that environmental concerns have been UNK and consistently taken into UNK erm account in their plans
erm the planning conversation act nineteen ninety one requires the development plans to include policies for the conservation and that of the natural beauty and amenity of their land
erm p g twelve UNK that policy should be in line with the concept of sustainable development
and now erm draft advice in p g thirteen UNK the need to reduce the need for travel
erm again because of the environmental con considerations
erm and we would suggest that in the light of these new environmental erm of these new requirements and advice erm it would be unrealistic to er to expect them not to be taken into account in the structure plan and give greater emphasis to the environmental originally environmental concerns of the structure plan
thank you
mr
just to er the leeds point er it is actually a stated aim of the leeds development plan to make adequate provision for the communities housing needs during the plan period by identification of sufficient land for new dwellings targeting of some provision for social housing need groups and support for renewal of the existing stock
and then further in the plan it deals with the er migration issue and it says new household t new household total still assumes that a substantial amount of housing will need to be met outside leeds as a result of net outward migration from the district
net out movement of the order of twenty seven thousand eight hundred people is assumed over the period nineteen e eighty six two thousand and one
equivalent to around eleven thousand households
the loss is a little below the strategic guidance figure of thirty thousand two hundred and also represents an improvement over the historic trend
this is consistent a more optimistic view of future economic performance that is appropriate in the light of the counties economic strategy
and that and on the economic strategy which is u d p based
there's a clear implication there that the u d p policy is moving in the dire the same direction as the cleveland policy is moving
and that is to make provision for its own population and to UNK back economic development er within the boundaries of the area
mr that was a long quotation can you submit
it's in it's in
my submission on that point is
no can you submit the doc a copy of that paper the document
yes i can
it's an extract from the leeds u d p
yes i understood that
our notes weren't that fast
i have i have read it elsewhere and not necessarily having read the doc the whole of the document of the leeds u d p but on that note since leeds leads would you like to
yeah could i just er respond to mr and say this is not the public enquiry into the leeds development plan
er obviously we will er justify our position at that public enquiry
er i'm simply talking about a level playing field
what is the framework within which we are operating at the moment
and i'm again grateful to mr for reminding the panel of the con the constraints of the environmental policies within which we all work not just north yorkshire authorities we're all required to look at environmental considerations
what's UNK for the UNK is UNK for the UNK
and er if it's appropriate for north yorkshire to apply environmental constraints within the whole of its area i'm not talking about particular districts but in the whole of its area then it is appropriate for leeds and bradford and the metropolitan districts to do exactly the same thing
and that will just lead to planning chaos because obviously somebody's going to fall between the plans
thank you for r p g
on that note can i suggest we adjourn for lunch meet back here at two o'clock prompt start
well yes since leaving college yes it's been predominantly UNK and i always take my subject matter from things that i've seen which have interested me for one reason or another
which college did you go to
i went to edinburgh college of art
is it a while since you were at school here then
yes it's in fact er i left school here in nineteen seventy six so it's eleven years since i was here
but i've been back recently as a teacher so it's i've to do a quick change act from a twin set and UNK into a UNK and er UNK to become an artist
what sort of questions have the children been asking you
well they've been very direct and they've been having to make me think a lot about what i'm doing
they asked me first of all why i paint on paper and i'm using older to paint on
and i explained to them it's because having been unemployed most of my professional life that i've always been short of money and that's what's led me to work on very cheap materials
so i explained it's mostly a practical thing
there's not the mystery around it really and i've sort of made that into one of my points about UNK my work and also erm i always thought perhaps once i became wealthy and had money i would do real UNK in oil and UNK
but er i then explained to them that i realize that it doesn't actually matter and it's the quality of the image that you produce that matters and not what it's made of or on
so i try an encourage them that their images and what they chose to make pictures of are as important as my ones
have you ever had arts council grant assistance or grants from any other source
no
i've had indirect help through the arts centre and the UNK gallery but i've never had funding paid to me directly in any way or prizes or anything like that
so it's not an easy life
no but i think you do i mean i manage
and in a way i'm quite glad to be outside that circuit because my existence as a an artist is in many ways more real than to be UNK by arts council money
it's been good i like i really like the way she's used
i think it's really relevant to the pictures i think it's really good
and i think that UNK it's awful sort of bold and bright and i'm not so keen on that
are you hoping to take up art after you leave school
well i did think about it but the careers officer advised me no cos he thought that you have to be really good before y get in and he asked me if i thought i was really good and i said that well i was not too bad but and he said that he thought it would be better to concentrate on something else
it's quite difficult to get a job afterwards too it's quite hard to make money after you have come out of college
are you going to give it a try though
i don't know made my mind up yet
jenny what have you enjoyed about watching these two at work
well i think it's been awful interesting to see the pictures develop and like they're so rough at first and they're and more developed and they're more things in them and the colours are getting more definite and everything
how much do you paint yourself apart from in school
i've just sort of painted recently so i do a bit but no much
are you going to take it up
no i don't think so
too hard a life
yes i would say so
do you like er colour work or abstract work or more UNK work which do you like best
well i think UNK awful important so i liked in UNK an awful lot
that was very good
what did you like about the work lucy
erm i like UNK because of the colours in it but i didn't i didn't really like UNK because i didn't think it was vivid enough
whereas UNK sort of it didn't tell a story like what erm UNK did but it was just it's the kind of painting i like
has it been an interesting experience then for you all seeing artists so close and at work
yes definitely
would you like to have more of it
yes
how much has it made you think then about your own painting just watching these two hard at work
maybe i'm just a bit too careful with what i do
i don't like they've both they've worked as they've gone along and haven't been scared to put colours in and things
whereas when i work i'm sort of too careful i think i'm too scared to do something
well i think like lucy said it has made you think about the really
you put the paint on thick you no to be too careful and just er do what you feel like you know just what you think you should
i agree with jenny but i don't think i am too frightened to UNK on paint cos you know since i've started doing UNK knife UNK cos it's really made me feel fair more confident
would you all say that
yes
well i'm trying anyway
the UNK business as printed in the programme and i call neil to give his national officer's report
neil
colleagues settle down please
president congress neil national office speaking to the general secretary's report pages one two five one four three
congress it has been my sad UNK to encounter some of the most hostile employers over the past year that would make the grey UNK that i've got fall out
but having said that we have tried in the ministry of defence where market testing has been the order of the day to say that it's confusing that would be being polite mr chairman
there is utter and total confusion and anything that stands still they used to say they would paint it in industry they now say market test it and they do admit to us that the end object does not necessarily mean complete UNK or privatization but at this particular moment in time
we have found that the opposite has been the situation
and within the home office and the prison service which was scheduled to become an agency on the first of april this year an appropriate date perhaps mr chairman but we are still in the UNK of getting arrangements which are suitable and protecting our people and more so the craftsmen within that particular industry
we do have the UNK report but unfortunately not for the want of effort the UNK report is turning out like the black report and others and i don't say that because there was a gentleman who done a report black and it is gathering dust the UNK report is on the same shelf i believe
but we will endeavour to represent our members and to push for their ordinary rights their just rights more than just rights they are earned rights and should be afforded to them
within royal UNK which i have UNK the responsibility for i don't know mr chairman i UNK a meeting of the UNK to introduce myself and to UNK myself with the movement and the industry only for the company to announce thirteen hundred redundancies as we were meeting
that has been further added to and we do have problems at UNK blackburn although blackburn at this particular moment in time may be UNK the particular pressure but we are all suffering from the UNK within the government industry
we will endeavour to continue to represent the members and to project their needs and UNK towards the company
but the company are saying to us like the m o d we've had the ending of the cold war things are now changing there is not a demand
i don't know if the situation in germany is as stable as people are making out i do not know if the other UNK or the other countries within the european UNK are of a stable nature when we look at what is happening in certain parts of the previous russia or the states of the u s r there is complete and utter confusion and UNK being UNK on people within those
within the car industry and the associates of it we also have the problems of the recession affecting those particular industries
we do have and i would like people who do be UNK by ford i would love to go to ford and say don't utilize this particular company
i'm prepared to do that but unfortunately colleagues i've forgotten
we cannae do it the legislation does not allow us to do it
the tory legislation does not allow us to do it
just like it does not allow us to sing an old song that was sung often show me the road and the miles to dundee perhaps that's the song we should be singing just now in these particular circumstances and be it the day maybe even in portsmouth this particular day
but portsmouth also has its problems within the f m r o and it was with interest walking round the town last night i saw that charles the second UNK this town to a greater UNK extent using
i wonder and i have grave doubts and reservations that charles the third will have a portsmouth and a naval base to UNK
i do not know i have great reservations on that as long as the policies that have been UNK by this government remain
i had with the permission of the deputy general secretary leave of conference yesterday i was in london to be told of a further nine hundred redundancies from a company that a short time ago was telling us and if you look at my report you'll have to delete the first paragraph where they had secured orders and the security of our members' employment only to be told yesterday nine hundred will go
they will be volunteered but they will be compulsory
we asked if there was any possibility due to the loyalty of these people if they
could get extra UNK pay
we also asked if we could get the same consultation period because they are breaking it up at the four sites and some sites will get thirty days' notice others will get the ninety days
and they gave us a sheet
they gave us a sheet
team one they want to put out more in the first division and i could not be party to that team one and it was an UNK to use such terminology
we do meet again with the company tomorrow to try and further progress the matter and hopefully but my big fear is that it is a two stage closure that they will go for nine hundred this time then we'll find that useful expensive equipment will be transferred to UNK
i have great fears and reservations on that particular point
so we also have within the steel industry which like all other industries is going through the UNK of redundancy and privatization
privatization what is privatization
well if you want facts and figures on it we can give you it but i'll tell you what it's meant to i'll tell you what it's meant training service i can tell you what it's meant to the royal UNK which we've got to talk about yet from thirteen thousand in some instances you're down to five
so that's what privatization is about and how do we stop the privatization how do we really represent the members by attacking the legislation that prevents us from acting in a spontaneous manner which will assist our members in their hour of need
that is where we're going
the t UNK not our enemy
the tory government and their legislation is our enemy and that's got to be attacked
so on the royal UNK there has been quite a number ah of UNK circulating this conference this morning there has also been on the television and the radio statements by one gordon
i have no later than half an hour ago contacted my office and there has been no official communication re any decision being made on the royal UNK and the capacity none whatsoever
so if someone's playing games well whatever games they are please stop it there are people human beings involved here who should not be used in the political fashion that's being used
so please come away from that particular avenue
and the local authorities also we have government policy again we have the situation that wage councils which have agreed increases for our members within the prison service don't know whether they'll be allowed to implement them because they are over the one and a half percent
the national health has told us one and a half percent if we want an extra day's holiday if we want an extra day's holiday then we would have to take three days we could take two that would leave us with half a percent
if we took three we were left with none
so i'm sorry mr chairman if the report is UNK and UNK but that is the situation that does UNK we will endeavour to work to the best of our ability or the lack of it but please remember the constraints that we are under and if we have got any views to stand and if we do want to help the people in dundee and we do want to stop the government UNK the british rail pension scheme
neil can you wind up please
to the tune of four and a half billion then look towards the legislation that's been UNK upon us by the conservative government
thank you
thanks very much neil
page one two five one two six one two seven one two eight yes
derek southern region page one two eight
this government is just playing one yard against the other and the only ones to suffer are our members and their families
we see jobs being lost every week as our employers cut back to try and UNK each other not in the interests of defence of this country but purely because of political UNK
in devonport if devonport was to close which is possible as it will become UNK with further cuts in its workload the impact on the economy would be UNK
both direct and indirect jobs would be lost some twenty eight thousand in all if the yard were to close
the south west would be an industrial desert dependent solely on tourism
any political decision that could lead to the closure of either devonport or UNK would also put the defence of this country at risk
we need a properly thought out defence policy we are a UNK nation we are in a UNK city we need a strong navy we need a strong defence
we must keep both the UNK open together with the naval base in UNK in portsmouth
on t v this morning as neil has said gordon m p was seeking a meeting with the prime minister
we must UNK those fears for both devonport and UNK and neil can we have an update and what the g m b position will be to that response
thank you
one two nine one three o one three one three two one three one three four one three yes
les midlands and east coast region
president congress neil page one three four you say in your report and i quote sadly t u p e does not cover pensions although at this time there is some grey area
neil t u p e UNK do apply as the joint g m b t g document clearly UNK
with the case of perry versus UNK and the eternal UNK general has confirmed to UNK that t u p e must protect both past and present future pension rights
also neil local authorities engineering craft workers very small number of our members but there is no mention of this section in your report
this section is in the public services section
in june ninety two the c e c recommended that local authorities manual building and civil engineering and engineering craft workers report to one forum for ninety three
as all local authority reps know this did not happen
did the c e c know it had not happened
at the engineering craft conference at congress house thirteen reps attended four of these were officers
i would like the assurance from neil and the c e c that the local authority public services section will meet in one forum for ninety four as in the c e c report
thank you
thanks very much

neil i wish to draw your attention to the ministry of the defence guard force
i drew this item to the attention of congress last year since when my branch has lost thirty four members to new UNK including one who was making good progress and had become a national delegate
i have copies of letters between yourself and john of new UNK dated the twenty fourth of february
have you been able to establish whether or not UNK has been UNK and if UNK has been what are you going to do about it to get that decision res reversed
thank you

les g m b scotland
congress neil i raised the subject last year about nuclear waste and what was the position as far as UNK was concerned
now we're in a delicate position as we all have heard this morning from our colleague at the devonport UNK
UNK is no different we stand to lose eighteen thousand plus training facilities for the whole of scotland but we've just been told of recent that a new nuclear waste dump is to be built at UNK could you tell us if this is a UNK for the subject of closing UNK down with a loss of all these jobs
thank you

president congress peter midland and east coast one four one section seventeen british steel
neil for two UNK i've come here and i spoke to your predecessor about team working and the team working concept and i told th your predecessor that the steel union was about to UNK our craftsmen and our general workers
they are now at it
i hope you and tony now in within the n treble c get a grip of this cos we're not gonna let anybody else go
one four one four two and one four three
UNK liverpool north wales irish region
neil can i ask you haven't have got on my eyes looking for it but i can't see any reference at all in your report to local authority engineering craftsmen
i've looked at report can't find anything
i believe you're the officer that's responsible for it can i ask why there was nothing in the report
can i ask is it because it was too small a group or is it because no one can make up their mind where they belong
i can say the UNK in my branch will certainly be asking questions when i get back
okay one four three neil have you finished writing those down
you've not got many this year
derek can we take on the UNK derek i did indicate the situation that half an hour before speaking to congress my office has not been told officially by m o d of any change of a decision being made
the position of the g m b is a retention of a true facility that is quite clear that was the decision of this conference some three years ago moved by your own region and seconded by scotland
i have worked towards that and will continue to work towards that policy which is our union
for page one three four and t u p e yes well we have done quite an extensive document there's been a lot done about t u p e in the public sector we've done it in the government sector and given guidelines and t u p e while it is like you rightly say a step forward it's not the total answer we need something better but it does level out the playing field that the UNK can find it difficult in and we as a union are advocating to our members where there is a transfer taking place whether there's a change to your employment challenge it and we will support that challenge with the necessary legal interpretation if so
i know your local authority craftsmen and i have as you're aware just taken over the responsibilities and that is the first meeting that i had that was why also there's nothing in the report because i thought i had a conference of people i had not spoken to the shop stewards i didn't have a f a feedback prior to the closing date of the report being concluded for print so i do and i have
spoken with mick since our conference and we will further discuss the matter i don't envisage any great problem in what you've said
i there is a small difference of course the c e c did say it but there is UNK different negotiating procedures as you're you are aware but mike and i are talking about that and i'm sure we can overcome it
i david on your guard force and the thirty four members yes you rightly mentioned the correspondence with your at this moment in time i have had no reply i have sent another letter which you have not received as yet to indicating that if they do not return those members then we will proceed to UNK
have no doubt in your mind about that because we did not take one of our representatives to negotiate with the guard force to enhance your and their membership that is not the ball game i'm not playing it and we won't do that and you can rest assured we will pursue it to UNK if need be
owen and the apprentices owen like everywhere else the apprentices and the UNK has been
the apprentices who are there under an apprentice contract unfortunately secure employment for the period that you're contracted to after that you are in the situation of dog eat dog dare i say
what we are UNK to and the company has not as yet went out and dispersed of apprentices willy UNK
hopefully we can retain that particular situation
les and the nuclear waste again les there has been no indication whatsoever in respect of being notified officially by the m o d as to UNK being used as a nuclear dump none whatsoever
people have suggested that in respect of fifty seven conference they don't know what fifty seven is but i'm quite sure you do les
so we can only concentrate our efforts and what we have been concentrating our efforts on is not turning any place into a nuclear dump then we have been concentrating on our union's policy which is the retention of all the facilities and job security for our members
so we have no knowledge on that and peter and team working and tony is in the body of the hall we had quite an extensive discussion over a period of time but perhaps UNK last friday a week last friday on the n treble c and we are calling a special lay delegates conference on the first of july in sheffield with one item on the agenda team working
we are like yourselves equally UNK with i s p c and the attitude that they are employing
but you will be receiving UNK of the said meeting taking place and my colleague from northern UNK wales northern ireland perhaps if you could have a chat with me in the corridor i may be able to do something which can help you UNK the sa situation between us
thanks very much indeed neil
colleagues before i call the mover of motion four one six on south africa i'd like to read out a message from the african UNK national congress
it's addressed to the general secretary john
dear friends UNK to your annual conference from the african national congress
over many years we have together worked towards the day when all the people of south africa are able to vote for a government of their choice and be in control of their own UNK
on this path we have seen the rise of the congress of south african trade unions and the african national congress to positions where they claim their UNK places in the future democratic non racist non sexist south africa
this new era will UNK in a period of restructuring and reconciliation when south UNK international relationships can be based on mutual advantage and not on conditions of UNK labour bred of racism
although a UNK date for the first democratic elections has been put forward we are not yet not yet there and our campaign for free and fair elections for a democratic constitution needs your urgent support
together we can lay the foundations for a new south african government of national unity led by the a n c we wish your conference a successful outcome UNK chief representative the a n c mission to u k and ireland
colleagues i now call the mover of motion four one six standing in the name of the london region south africa
president conference ed westminster touch branch london region
brothers and sisters it's only too easy er when we go through our union lives to become obsessed with the problems that we face
every day we have battles with employers to make sure that we have decent working conditions for our members in this country
however when we look UNK and see what is happening in south africa to trade unionists there the scale of our problems is put into a UNK perspective
joining a trade union in south africa and being active within that union can lead to dismissal physical violence UNK and even death
the black UNK struggle for human rights within south africa is one that this union must support we must look to support their unions in every way we can with both resources training and financial support
the changes that have been introduced into south africa forced upon the white minority government by both international pressure but also by the magnificent work at the a n c in UNK must be supported as well but we cannot treat south africa as anything but a UNK a national UNK until we see one person one vote and a black majority government in south africa
this union colleagues must support and strengthen links with south african trade unions
as we support them so in the future i am certain as they have in the past they will support us
in this way we can move forward to true international solidarity with our comrades within south africa
i urge you to support this motion
is the motion seconded
formally seconded
the c e c are recommending you to accept motion four one six all those in favour against that's carried
colleagues it's now my very great privilege on your behalf to extend an invitation to UNK the honorary secretary of the anti apartheid movement to address congress
in nineteen fifty eight UNK along with a number of his colleagues formed the anti apartheid movement we're very privileged today to have somebody of the UNK of UNK at our particular congress
a UNK worker not just in britain where he performs the task of honorary secretary of the anti apartheid movement but throughout the world throughout the world
he is indeed an international figure and is respected so and he's one of the few people to have actually addressed the security council on the question of apartheid and has indeed spoken at many united nations UNK on the question of apartheid
i can think of no other person in the anti apartheid movement who knows more and is more up to date on the current situation in south africa
colleagues it's my pleasure to welcome on your behalf UNK
UNK chair UNK secretary general of the conference and the g m b and if i my say so UNK delegates and i should explain in these changing times the use of the word UNK
i do not mean it in any ideological sense or historical sense or to be UNK but it's very it's with very deep feelings that i speak to you today because you may not understand it but for me after thirty three years in UNK i was able to return to south africa in nineteen ninety one and one of the first activities to which i was invited was the annual meeting of UNK and so when we say comrades in that sense and thank you as comrades we mean it as comrades in arms
you see we cannot always help who our brothers and sisters are but we can make UNK of people on issues of UNK and freedom that goes beyond that narrow family relationship and UNK into a very solid alliance that helps to change situations
so it's a very great honour and privilege for me to address you today because at the end it may be difficult for you to understand but when i return to south africa and forgive me for speaking personally i also realize the full meaning of the support of british trade unions and the labour movement and the churches because it was because of your political material and particularly in the case of the g m b financial and material support that it gave us the means to do what some of us wanted to do about our country and our situation and bring about change if we could UNK
so i also want to thank you very deeply from the UNK parts of my heart for having given an opportunity for some of us to work in britain to have accepted us and worked with us to build the solidarity movement that brought the apartheid regime to its knees
so i think our victory in south africa which isn't complete is also in that sense your victory and in this sense there is tremendous affection and love for all of you in the hearts of the UNK people of southern africa and africa
i don't just say it because time is valuable and i should explain what's happening in the region but i think it's also very important to convey this to you after your years and decades of solidarity with the UNK struggle
friends as we speak today about south africa we speak about transition from february nineteen ninety when de UNK said that he would change things and he did change things and they were dramatic changes and then we had apartheid with a liberal UNK
the a n c and other organizations were UNK there was free activity people can meet others across the colour line if they so wish but basically the apartheid structures are in place still
and let us remember that as de UNK himself said they changed not because as he said we wanted to but because we had to
and they had to change because apartheid was at a dead end the people of south africa were continuing with their struggle the country was UNK and there stood the prospect of more sanctions which would bring the UNK around the apartheid system
and most important of all and it is often forgotten is that in south africa the regime and the western powers were facing a real hot revolution and that hot revolution could have destroyed the country for all its people
and so when we came to the negotiation process so to say it was a UNK
the regime wasn't defeated although it had come to a dead end and the UNK movement did not UNK the situation although they made government impossible
so out of that UNK negotiations have begun and they've gone on for three years
so we have in effect a situation where the regime wants to change without changing and that often happens in power relationships
UNK is free he's out of prison he can address the british parliament the united states congress the UNK of the world he addresses the whole world through television when we held those concerts for him at
UNK and yet he still does not have the vote
meanwhile as my visits to south africa showed me in such a traumatic and depressing way the conditions of the majority have got worse there's economic recession lay UNK high inflation rate and growing violence more people have been killed in south africa in the last two years than in any previous two years that you look at
and this violence has been UNK from state structures and it's not an accident that the happen to be mainly the a n c or as recently you saw the general secretary of the communist party chris or UNK leaders or church leaders or the other pattern of violence UNK killing of people on the trains
i came on a train here today from london in south africa if you are black and you got on a train it wouldn't be as comfortable and there would be crowds in it but you wouldn't know whether you reached the other end because at some station a group of people would get on and shoot you UNK and get off again leaving that scene of UNK
to UNK like has done in UNK trained by south africa and that pattern is UNK in south africa today
the regime of course wants to keep the old order the a n c and freedom loving people want a new order and a quick change but how do you mo move to that situation when you also have the right wing and the security forces and elsewhere not wanting change
how do you friends change a structure which is still the old structure with a civil service a security and everything that goes with it and move to one of democracy and justice because if you move too rapidly and you do not make concessions and you ignore the terrible power of the right wing with all the military might at its disposal you can very easily create in south africa a UNK or indeed yes a yugoslavia
and so the a n c has to make sure that while it works for the aspirations of its people it must also protect the country and i'm afraid in this context it means it has through negotiations and other means also UNK made concessions in order to save the situation and the only organization that is now working for the national interest even losing its own supporters in the country is basically the a n c and it's quite a remarkable thing to see that leaders are prepared to l lose political support because they have to make sure that the country doesn't
we now have a general date for elections in nineteen ninety four and when that date is formally agreed many sanctions will go and we're already preparing because UNK and the south african council of churches believe that there should be a code for investments so that investments go to help UNK people and indeed tomorrow i have to go to holland for exactly such a conference called by the world council of churches and the south african churches
then after the elections the elections are to have a constituent assembly and that constituent assembly will work out our new constitution in the country and from that constituent assembly we hope also to form a national government of unity of national unity and that'll continue maybe for five years in order to give stability to the country and this of course also means a UNK because it's a UNK to the existing power structures to have some kind of stability
and when we say or the a n c and democratic organizations say that you need a five percent vote to cross the hurdle to get in to the assembly and then you you're a member of their parliament so to say and then what do we hear
we hear ian UNK say that's unfair and i'll let you into a secret UNK then UNK in these negotiations and says five
percent is too high a figure
why
because and ian UNK can only manage three percent
so democracy is a dangerous exercise when it means we UNK the majority against minority groups that have UNK on the support of the regime
then after the elections or rather during the elections we have to make sure that they are free and fair as you've just heard and we from britain and the anti apartheid movement has to be UNK to ensure that we have international UNK from the u n from the european community from the commonwealth and individuals from britain and elsewhere
we also have to provide support for the a n c for thirty years a banned organization having to start from scratch in a country where the majority is supported but having no party officers or structures in place because if we UNK support to them or reduce it will be like having no support of them all this time and just when the bird is about to fly you clip its wings
so there's no moment which is greater than this for supporting the UNK struggle
meanwhile there's growing violence as i've said and we want to end the violence but we cannot wait to end the violence before we have the elections and you can imagine at what great disadvantage the democratic forces will work when they try to have elections in a violent atmosphere which is determined by the state structure
so we have to move from old structures to new but the first new government of south africa will be a compromise in itself because it will be a united government but it will inherit not a post apartheid state as many UNK and politicians tell us it will inherit a nil apartheid state and that is a very big difference we still have to move to the post apartheid situation which could take decades
i was horrified in nineteen ninety one with my first visit to see the enormous problems in housing three and a half million people were UNK moved in the eighties in south africa the biggest peacetime movement of people anywhere in the world and there are now over seven million people in just in the UNK on the roads not even the informal housing which counts for more
no UNK water health there's no primary health care virtually the only country in the world with no primary health care
unemployment forty to fifty percent
transport virtually nil for UNK we have to spend two or three hours a day going to work and the same coming back tired exhausted and UNK their lives with
every area you look at south africa in a report i gave to the UNK government which they commissioned we pointed out every area is like a major disaster area as if you've been hit by an UNK in every area of human activity and that situation needs something like a UNK plan if we are a UNK aid plan if we're to address it but in the world we live in there's no prospect of such assistance coming to southern africa
then there are the social conditions children a whole generation brought up in violence without education and you know you survived only in south africa if you are black by breaking the law
if you respected the law you wouldn't survive
so a whole generation that has learned how to break the law how do we create them into law UNK citizens
a generation that's gone to prison more often than it's gone to schools or UNK a generation where family life is not known where the horrible UNK system destroyed any idea of family life how do we UNK
yes friends we have many problems and the neighbouring countries UNK attacked by south africa in war have even greater problems
the legacy of apartheid is not only within the borders of south africa but in the region
but we are lucky we have great people and great people in terms of the ordinary people
the struggle of UNK
and the trade union movement the UNK struggle when you look at it gives you great hope in terms of human capacity but they will need other kinds of help in order to UNK and let me say this because it is important and i don't say it with any kind of UNK we have one kind of miracle occurring in south africa that people ignore and that is that out of the hell of racism we have produced a leadership which is the strongest leadership in the world against racism
and this is quite unique when you go to south africa and you see what's happening that black leaders and UNK do not go for quick votes and quick solutions we're not trying to keep tu turn people against UNK
when you see how easy those UNK political support in europe and elsewhere you begin to understand what a great educational role the UNK movement and the churches of south africa have carried out
and in this sense when we UNK south africa we will also create we hope a state in the world which will become foremost in fighting racism all over the world and at the lower level our community based organizations our non UNK organizations that have across colour built up structures to move communities forward if our friends in eastern europe and elsewhere could see how that is done at grass roots level in the hell of racism as i say they would have a lot to learn
so in the future we also have a lot to give to the rest of the world rather than just to look for help
i want to end by saying that we need now to f go over this hurdle of UNK make sure that the vast majority of black south UNK who are deeply angry and i saw this anger because i was in south africa when chris was UNK and this anger was turning into rage and the country was on a knife edge it could have blown up the country would have burned had it not been for the UNK achievement of enormous UNK by UNK when he addressed the whole nation and in a sense UNK power informally from white and black and the country managed to survive that but if that anger turns into rage again then the country could burn and i don't say this to be dramatic but just to warn that in those moments when the media and so on don't explain the situation well don't forget our people because they have had to cope with this situation
we have to then work in the future not only to develop south africa but to develop the region UNK all the other countries
we do not want to have a future relationship of united states and latin america UNK in south africa which so many people talk about now when they talk about south africa as the engine of growth if we have that kind of growth it'll be distorted and none of the poor in south africa or the region will benefit from it
so we need then to move forward and next week archbishop and UNK the UNK of the anti apartheid movement in nineteen fifty nine are having a conference in london which we've entitled southern africa making hope a reality
and foreign ministers from africa are coming the secretary general of the o a u united nations representatives and others because we want to build a new agenda and move the anti apartheid campaign so that it UNK to handle the problems of southern africa
we in the world campaign which has so far tried to stop UNK to south africa and its nuclear build up we want to work if possible to build a common security er arrangement in the region where peace will be everywhere if we can make it everywhere because the region has got so many weapons and arms and military expenditure is very easy to increase when you have growing number of nation states where the people really need food and development
so we hope that in this last mile that we're now
walking you will continue to support the anti apartheid movement and the a n c and UNK and others in south africa that our eyes should be on the prize and that is to get democracy and the first democratic parliament in the country and after that to help in the UNK difficult task of UNK and development and it is going to be a tough battle in south africa as elsewhere and we will need to work not just for political democracy because you know so often democratic processes are misunderstood for UNK of ordinary people and what democracy should really mean is that ordinary people have the opportunity to determine their own UNK and you know from your own advanced society and others how little power individuals have as a result of power of finance capital of industry and of technology now
technology is changing our world so much that small groups of people through computers and elsewhere are able to determine vast patterns of human behaviour and so it's gonna be a long struggle but through our struggle in africa and your struggle here where we all want democracy but UNK only a process what we have to UNK with is also power because ultimately it's only when you're able to exercise that power that you can deliver for the majority of the people
africa like elsewhere
if we just win freedom that freedom will become very empty if we're not able to use the power that it gives us to create justice and peace in the region
and so we still have a common struggle and to build up our international solidarity
in conclusion then to thank you again
at this stage you know we don't have in our situation because we're very poor any kind of gifts that can give a valid expression even as a token of the tremendous support you've all given us over many years and decades in britain that has been a source of UNK
if i may take one more minute just to convey this when i was a child in south africa and we demonstrated and the police would come you know ready to fire ready to kill if necessary and you had to calculate how you can avoid that situation and then you try in your normal life after the demonstration to do something against the regime to organize people and so on and then like a UNK the state comes and UNK all the work that you and others have done for years and you just see it as a child of what your parents and others had done
and then it is extremely difficult if you are not white not to become very angry with life it's very difficult and then you hear that in UNK square someone demonstrated UNK or barbara and then you say no
there are sensible white people in the world
we continue with the struggle and forget the mad UNK here and that we have to help them and that's what our people have to do
but without your support and your demonstrations and support from UNK in other countries with the rugby demonstrations the cricket with all aspects that you've done you've also contributed to making it easier for us to be the kind of people we would like to be and i hope in that way we therefore do share as a family and then try and create one world
so as a small token of appreciation i just have two books or two copies of the same book which i would like to hand to your president and to your general secretary as a token of appreciation and it's the authorized UNK of UNK of whom we are all very proud considering what he has suffered through and what he has done and we hope that this little token will be a kind of UNK for all your support but by doing this i'm not saying that your support is over because the struggle continues
thank you very much
thank you very much indeed UNK for that marvellous excellent address
colleagues on the fourteenth of june trevor who indeed has addressed this er conference in the past will be eighty years of age
i would like to propose that we send our best wishes and congratulations to trevor to mark that marvellous achievement
would you agree to that
thank you very much
er colleagues we now move to the report and i call alan
alan national officer
president congress in the few minutes available to me this afternoon to speak to my written report i want to touch on three issues
first i want to say a little bit about the nineteen ninety three ninety four building materials pay round which is dealt with in some detail in the written report that you have
second i want to say a few words about the efforts that have been made in the last twelve months to increase the g m b's role in the building and civil engineering industries and third i want to say something about the present serious situation in the building industry pay talks
congress well i've seen from my written report that the current material building materials pay round has been an extremely tough one
redundancies short time working bonus cuts and the like have been very much the order of the day we've had the twenty percent job cuts at blue circle UNK which are mentioned specifically in the report and we've also seen significant additional job losses at british UNK in the brick industry and in many other sectors of the building materials industry
it's against that background congress that we've pressed forward usually in cooperation with the t g w u claims on behalf of our members in these industries
congress will see from the report that settlements of the in the range of one and a half to three percent have been generally speaking the order of the day
it's worth noting colleagues that it's only because of the determination of our members to ensure that their already UNK standard of living and basic rates are not further eroded that even this small achievement has been possible
i can also report to congress that at last there are some signs at long last of some kind of recovery in the building materials industry very early days yet but some companies are actually beginning to go back to full time working and in one or two cases are actually starting to take on additional er employees
the recession that we've gone through in materials and elsewhere in the economy has taught us or should have taught us i believe a very clear lesson and that is that we must end the situation that's in the building materials industry where our members rely for a reasonable standard of living on bonus earnings the problem being of course that as soon as the recession starts to bite then the bonus pay becomes very vulnerable to attack and reduction by the employers
it's for this reason that many of the shop UNK conferences that we've UNK in the last year have been pressing a policy of UNK bonus pay into the basic rates and we've achieved some small success in this in building brick and in one or two other industries
i want to turn now congress if i might to our efforts to raise the g m b's profile in the industry as a whole
we've taken a much more active role in the european federation that we belong to the building and UNK federation and as our conference will know or some colleagues in congress will know we've actually had
several shop UNK within companies on the basis of the er p potential wh council directives
i've also it's worthwhile me recording my UNK to the regions for the level of cooperation that's been extended in this programme
in addition to that we've increased the profile that we have by concentrating on the health and safety issues and it's worthwhile me recording my appreciation of the efforts of nigel in this direction because we're running very closely in UNK to ensure that the g m b is UNK union in the campaign to make the building industry a safer industry for our members to work in
last but by not means least and we've heard them mentioned a couple times already this week and it will be dealt with more extensively later in the week we have of course persuaded to enter into detailed discussions with us er which would hopefully lead to a transfer of UNK by the end of this year
it is one of the obvious benefits congress that what that will give us is a much higher profile in the construction and construction related industries
finally i want to say a little bit about the current UNK in the building industry pay talks
early this week the general secretary pointed out that the recession has thrown almost half a million building workers on the dole
this is not only a shocking waste of their UNK and skills and energy but it's a UNK weapon that's been put in the hands of the building employers and the consequence is of course that they're seeking a twelve month pay and conditions freeze in the industry
the unions are presently consulting the membership as to how we should respond to this and that process is going on at the moment inside g m b the difficulty of course being the low level of organization
i am convinced congress however that there will be UNK industrial action throughout the summer if the employers do not change their stance and it's my view that we have to UNK the talks
with this in mind er this morning i've written to george the trade union secretary of the civil engineering UNK board the negotiating machine and suggested to him that he contacts the employers to seek a further meeting to see if we can UNK the talks based on doing something about the UNK commitment by both sides of the industry to have a positive and sensible pay structure for the future this may be one way forward one way out of the UNK
president congress with these few brief remarks i commend my report to congress
thank you
thanks very much indeed alan

president congress this is gonna be a unique one i'm gonna give alan praise
alan got a message for you all the stewards and secretaries within UNK and also the a e u m s f and the t g thanks very much for the initiative you've in getting us all together and the initiative you've took in getting us part of the european set up company UNK at this present time are very negative
thank you very much

bob midlands and east coast region mutual UNK society alan
erm to congratulate you firstly on the level of settlements that have been achieved in the UNK and building UNK building products division erm secondly on one six seven the refused to make an offer and er if you could perhaps update us as to what er method we're gonna approach employers now erm to secure settlements in that industry er we think it was UNK that no offer was made and we also think it was UNK that e c building products decided to say that even if an offer had been made they wouldn't have been prepared to implement it
thank you alan
one six seven one six eight one six nine one seven o one seven one seven two alan
president i've er had lots of advice from my colleagues as to how to respond to the comments of the shop stewards er i can only respond and say thank you very much indeed for the kind things they've said particularly erm specific point that's been raised on the industry from my colleagues that are from the midlands and east coast the situation currently is that er we have decided to ballot for industrial action in e c and the t g have decided to ballot for industrial action in i think its
we've informed the employers of that decision and hopefully that will change the position
as colleagues who are involved will know is just about the only industry in the building materials sector that hasn't made some kind of pay offer in this current round it's very much bringing up the rear and we're determined to use what industrial strength we have to change the employer's stance otherwise we're very concerned that the national negotiation missionary this will be his death UNK since we'll have to resort to local pay bargaining so the short answer is e c er will be UNK as far as the g m b is concerned union and er t g are UNK in for industrial action to try to change the UNK position
thank you congress
thank you very much alan
colleagues perhaps i could explain to you er how we're gonna deal with the rest of the programme certainly in the next hour or so er i'm proposing that we take the special report health safety and the environment service review be asking nigel to move the report to be seconded by fred from the central executive council we'll then invite speakers from all the regions and then we'll put the report to the vote
th then we'll be following section on health of women workers which will take in motions two five eight composite thirty two motion two six one motion two six nine and composite six
be asking sue to respond to that debate and to put the c e c point of view
that will be followed by a number of motions on health and the environment composite five motion two six four motion two six five motion two six motion two six eight and composite seven and i'll be asking mark on behalf of the c e c to respond to that particular debate
it's now my very great pleasure congress to call nigel to move the health and safety and environment service review
thank you mr president congress nigel director of health and environment moving the special report health safety environment service review
in the time that i have to move the report i'd like to concentrate on some of the developments that have been taking place in health and safety this is not to er give the impression that environmental developments are not important but over this next year the government are going to be taking certain measures that we need to be aware of er in the health and safety area
i would start off by saying that in november last year the g m b held a major conference to UNK our health safety and environment service
at that conference john the director general of the health and safety executive gave his views on why certain regulations appear to be UNK than the actual european directives on which they were based
he said it was due to our unique anglo UNK law whereby we set out in law what is reasonable and then we enforce it
directives are based on roman law whereby absolute duties are set out in the law but it is not vigorously enforced
we have recently found out that we have now got the best of all of these or the worst of all of these in anglo UNK roman law whereby we set out was is reasonable in law and then they hear from UNK health and safety executive tell us they are not going to enforce it
this hardly seems a UNK basis for UNK directives which in themselves only establish minimum health and safety standards for workers across europe
by the end of that conference mr was left in no doubt that the g m b rejected the h UNK approach
what has happened since then
in january we were the first union to issue briefing notes on all six key health and safety regulations UNK at the beginning of the year we were the only trade union to put on a stand at the UNK ninety three exhibition which was the main exhibition of the european year of health and safety this promoted the union's approach to health and safety
we have contributed to numerous guidance notes on new regulations across a wide range of industrial service and commercial sections through steven we have submitted a draft proposal on a directive covering upper limb disorders to the european commission we'll be putting further proposals for the establishment of a european work environment fund to assist workplace activity workplace research on health and safety and environmental issues
all of these initiatives as well as the day to day work that goes on with safety representatives at the workplace supported by officials all of these initiatives are aimed at improving standards at the workplace and we are also contributing to the fourth action programme in europe where they are setting out their action programme which will take them into the next
century
so i'd like to reflect that against what the government has done since our unique november conference they have cut the health and safety UNK budget for nineteen ninety three ninety four by five percent that's a total of thirteen million pounds the department of employment have already admitted this will lead to less inspections and less UNK they have introduced a market UNK market testing exercise into the h s e in other words they're saying what parts of the health and safety executive can be UNK into no doubt their friends in industry they have made sure that health that the health and safety commission will work slower in the future by making the chair which is currently a full time post a part time post from september this year
as we are all aware they have cut the grant available to safety representatives training sorry for safety UNK training and will completely eliminate that grant by nineteen ninety five and to top it all they have just announced that a review of all health and safety legislation will be completed by april next year the objective of this review is to reduce the so called UNK health and safety legislation puts on employers
at our conference in november we had a roll call of five hundred and six g m b members who'd ha who were either killed in work or had died from work related disease since may nineteen seventy nine those who attended may recall the emotional er
feeling that this gave to the beginning of that conference and this government then has the UNK to talk about the UNK on employers what about the UNK on the families of those whose relatives have been killed or UNK through workplace injuries by the negligence of the employers that actually employ them
we have to respond to these developments and it is being made clear now in public that the health and safety executive are giving every indication to employers that they are not going to UNK enforce the law and indeed in the local authorities a leading figure there has said that they want to take a UNK approach
the g m b has rejected this approach and recognized that we have to improve health and safety standards at the workplace
in the special report specific re recommendations are made to improve the consistency of safety UNK training improving information flow and giving more uniform support to full time officers support in the workplace
however the report identifies a number of areas that need to be addressed in more detail as a result we are UNK it recommending that a major consultation exercise be d be conducted this year to ensure that the many ideas that people have to improve our health safety and environment service are considered
recommendations from that consultation exercise will be then brought back to this congress
in UNK the challenges that face us in health and safety it is not to ignore the environmental challenge however we recognize it needs to be considered much more widely so that our resources can be most effectively targeted
mr president i move this special report on behalf of the c e c on the basis that it provides us with the framework to build on the excellent record that the g m b has on improving health safety and environmental standards at the workplace
thank you
thank you very much nigel
fred c e c member seconding the special report on health safety and the environment
president in seconding the report i would like to make the following points to our safety representatives who have to bear the responsibility for improving conditions at the workplace for our members
to be successful in improving health and safety standards we must have good workplace organization good laws good inspectors and good guidance all have their place in improving health and safety standards
however if we cannot influence events where people actually work poor standards will result and this is particularly true during a recession as many of us here no doubt know
it is clearly recognized in the report that the safety UNK role is vital if workplace standards are to be consistently improved
since the first of january this year safety representatives have been given legal rights to be con consulted and i quote in good time regarding the following one any measure which substantially affects the health and safety of employees two the arrangements for appointing specialist staff three any health and safety information circulated to employees four the planning and organization of any health and safety training and five the introduction of new technologies
these important rights mean that the safety representatives must be consulted by the employer well before action is taken and when combined with the existing functions of safety representatives they provide extensive rights to organize around health and safety at the workplace
however many employers do not comply with these legal duties unless they are pressed to do so for this reason the recommendations in section five of the report are aimed at giving support to safety representatives and full time officials to improve workplace activity
this is a key priority in the report
during this year and next more european directives will be agreed
the european commission have agreed an action programme that will take us into the next century and this is despite the attitude of the present u k government
once new laws have been passed workplace action is needed to ensure that employers comply with the new legislation
the report clearly stresses the need to focus a major part of our resources on to workplace activity nigel highlighted the UNK attitude of the UNK authorities
we simply cannot re rely on the health and safety executive or anybody else it is our g m b activists who will take the lead on health and safety
president this report is the basis for developing our own action programme to improve health and safety standards at the workplace
congress with these points i am pleased to second the report
thank you president
thank you very much indeed fred
as i indicated colleagues it's my intention now to go round the regions and ask regions whether they wish to put a speaker in
first of all birmingham again colleagues it will be very helpful and will save time if intended speakers would come down to the front
sorry
bert birmingham and west midland region moving the health safety and environment service review
at our pre delegates conference earlier this year whether it was the first one or the second one i can't remember our region unanimously accepted the policy review
the terms of reference within the document are excellent with issues spreading from shop floor organization the training how to tackle legislation the right to the e c directives which hopefully will continue to new responsibilities with the employers
this document makes good and interesting reading full of fact individual references and a guidance for future action you don't need to be a solicitor to understand at consultation exercise will be then brought back to th conference in blackpool this year nigel spoke about the new european directive the importance of the new regulations
he referred to the six pack and my initial thought was well what's a six pack of newcastle brown ale gotta do with health and safety
but nigel did take the time to explain that b that basically this was the view that the new directive would take place keeping it simple
i'm glad to see environment put into the title it's all related
on a lighter note a fellow worker approached me only a couple of months ago er the new european directive almost ruined his holiday he then explained he booked up to take his family to UNK
on his first day of arrival he was told the authorities had closed UNK down and when he asked why he was told someone had reported to the authorities that a six foot mouse was walking round the day before
i didn't get that either until he said his name was mick
but seriously nigel UNK me
he impressed our sectional conference and he will impress this conference as well and this only makes me aware that the g m b not only now but in the future will be a leading force in the issues within the british and the european trades union movement
we support i move and before i go UNK thank you
south western
yes i know
president colleagues south western region speaking in support of the report
it is particularly UNK to note the amount of self criticism that appears throughout the report
it is equally UNK to note that such criticism is acknowledged and solutions are readily available to provide an answer
we as an organization must be ready to accept the sterling work carried out by our er r h s os with the very limited resources at their disposal and particular thanks must go to those r h s os who find themselves dual UNK as education and political officers
one way forward can be found in sections five and six of the report with section six providing enough material to UNK the whole forum to on just its own
it is good that this union has taken the trouble to prepare this report with so much e c legislation in the pipeline
the matters that have been highlighted in this report are as relevant now as those which UNK the UNK of the nineteen seventy eight and nineteen ninety congress resolutions
we ask that you support this report
thanks very much lancashire region
president sisters and brothers graham lancashire region speaking on health safety and environment service review
right at the start of the report we are told that the g m b should be UNK proud of our achievements in the field of occupational health safety over the past fifteen years
quite rightly so but we can't get UNK health and safety is one of the most important issues of all affecting our members
two hundred separate regulations have been introduced since nineteen seventy eight but factory inspectors have been severely cut where the average workplace now can only expect a visit once every eleven years that's why we've gotta get a backup service right for our sa safety representatives
we're told in the report that small firms with less than twenty people have a fatal and major accident rate forty percent higher than firms employing over a thousand
but it's in the small firms where the growth is and it's usually hard to get people on any courses that a small company
we welcome the creation of the g m b health and safety service specialized staff quality publications campaign and support in workplace UNK activities but as long as this government allows unscrupulous employers to explore exploit the low pay lower inspection rates the accident rate will climb and our safety reps will get increasingly frustrated
health and safety UNK training courses according to these reports these are poorly attended with a majority below forty percent but more worrying than that is that nearly half of g m b safety reps said they'd not received a copy of the safety UNK
we've got to make sure that at the very least all these reps have a kit
included in the recommendations is for a two day training course costing fifty thousand for two thousand places it's excellent except we're told in the report that we can't get people on courses however good they is es especially among er small companies
i believe we've gotta find ways of getting the information to the safety reps that can't attend courses in making sure they get the information there at the workplace
briefing sessions on the new kit for full time officials we think these should be extended to branch secretaries as well because if a person rings up and UNK asks for advice he can't get that advice it shows the union up in bad light
with these small points i've made lancashire region supports the report and looks forward for a wider discussion at regional and branch level
thanks graham
yorkshire region
john yorkshire and north derbyshire speaking in support of the health and safety environment service review
president congress we should applaud the work of the health and environment department at national office and in supporting this service report we must go UNK forward into wide ranging discussions at all levels of the g m b the publications they have produced have been of a consistent high standard and are very user friendly
consideration should be given to include in the direct journal a supplement possibly entitled health and safety direct to the membership
also industrial health and safety information such as UNK lung for the technical UNK section magazine
we should support the move for an increase in the use of new technologies for the storage and UNK of information throughout the union
i know these are increasing at a very rapid rate almost as quickly as the new UNK develop and keeping accurate paper records is becoming increasingly more difficult
the yorkshire region has for a number of years now combined the health and safety officer's job with that of the regional education officer the two have always married together very well in the principal thrust of workplace activity it involved the training of safety representatives enabling them to carry out their role effectively
in the report which played mainly on the results of the trade union studies information unit survey the survey was only taken shortly after we had commenced the new education system therefore the figures are not necessarily reflected today
the yorkshire UNK current situation ensures that new safety representatives are invited to a two day introduction course from which they are encouraged to attend a health and safety course at national college
the take up has been better than indicated by the survey we would support the views expressed regarding changes and in particular point thirteen
the changes in legislation have been dramatic since the mid eighties the majority of changes coming in at the beginning of nineteen ninety three with the e c directives
we now have a legal requirement on employers which are clearly written and which we can use to our advantage providing our safety reps have been correctly trained to implement the regulations
the environment we live in must also be protected sources of pollution must be located and stopped employers clearly held liable for their actions and dealt with as severely as allowed by law
our union is still leading the field in provision of the information and training to enable our safety representatives to deal with the UNK of the new regulations
the situation regarding the enforcement of is disgraceful too few inspectors far too much work therefore we must encourage safety representatives to be more self sufficient in the workplace leaving the g m b to carry on its campaign for an increase in the inspectorate
yorkshire north derbyshire supports
southern region
president colleagues derek southern region speaking to the document on health and safety
last year the health and safety report was supported by my region
that report had two main objectives one was to establish a clear policy for g m b health and safety the second was to set out a training programme to establish the g m b's role in health and safety
this year's report hopes to bring about a consultation exercise to establish what to UNK in the g m b health and safety service
it will be looking at the needs of the lay reps the role of full time officers the way we distribute the up to date information and one of the most vital to our organization is to look at the role of health and safety in the recruitment and retention of membership
the southern region supports the initiative but UNK caution
we have been told that finances for health and safety will be found but we were never told from where that money would come from
colleagues to promote a culture of health and safety our starting point must be to establish a network of safety reps in the workplaces and we must have proper funds for training for all of our safety reps that is a most crucial part of the report
the introduction in january ninety three of six european directives has given us a unique opportunity to raise the profile of the g m b both in places where we have membership and elsewhere when the message gets across how the g m b reps are so well trained and able to represent members on all health and safety issues
to make sure the g m b is at the head of the field we must have a reasonable health and safety officer who would ensure that our safety reps and full time officers are kept up to speed with all the changes in legislation and to provide the adequate training
this of course had to be monitored and accountable a as it is at present in the southern region where we can already see the benefits
we urge the c e c to start a consultation process as soon as possible and to put their recommendations into practice
southern region supports the document
northern region
president congress eddie northern region supporting the special report
congress the g m b's record of health and safety is the envy of the trade union movement
time and again it has been our union which has led the way on issues of health and safety whilst other unions have merely followed
it was the g m b which UNK and won the health and er safety at work act
it was the g m b which UNK for and won the regulations
and currently as steven stated in his address yesterday it is the g m b who are pressing for and winning improvements in the european health and safety directives
congress against this background the northern region UNK this report it is an impressive report which UNK the importance that the g m b UNK to issues of health and safety and it indicates that this union will continue to maintain its high standards in this crucial area
we in the northern region welcome in particular the recommendation of the health and safety officer to beef up the health and safety education and services delivered in the regions
we look forward mr president to the successful implementation of this report and to once again leading the british trade union movement in this field
president i would take this opportunity on behalf of the region to UNK sorry congratulate nigel on the excellent work that he has done since becoming the national health and safety officer
congress northern region supports
london region
president congress ray london region speaking in support of the motion er sorry the report close
but we have to identify some of the UNK of the report at the ninety f nineteen eighty five congress motion forty UNK the c e c to ensure that each region UNK an officer whose prime responsibility will be health and safety
the london region defined this as a minimum of fifty percent or more
motion forty outlined the problems with the workplace with new technology new machinery and new practices which the membership needed effective support and backup
eight years on the problems have not decreased but they have increased er even more so with the present problem of employers who tend to ignore health and safety using fear of unemployment to stop complaints
the reports still do not identify by regions which regions comply with that eighty five motion
if you look at the general secretary report under the regional sections there is an invisible service you'll be unable to find the health and safety side
the special report is meant to make sure that the health and safety s service are not the UNK service there should be a general principle of accountability and monitoring of the service in the regions
health and safety is the one area where shop stewards safety representatives have to deal with on a daily basis
we need the best backup it's one of the best services we can offer for recruitment and retention
comrades the london region supports the m the report but with the UNK i mentioned
thanks very much colleagues g m b scotland
richard g m b scotland
president colleagues supporting health and safety special report
as an organization our success and effectiveness depends on how we organize train and support all the activists and officers how we adjust to legislative change and how we progress our collective aims
the terms of reference contained in the report clearly identifies how the g m b should progress health and safety policy
it highlights the inadequate support that the health and safety executive er gives and their failing to enforce current legislation or UNK those who openly UNK their responsibilities for employee safety
the government has also failed in its responsibility for the health and sa safety executive by restricting year after year adequate resources for them to carry out the function that they were designed for
if this government UNK its resources against employers who UNK the health and safety legislation as much as it channels its energy at the trade unions through the employment act i'm sure we would see a great decrease in accidents and
UNK at work
there has been new legislation introduced in the form of the european six pack and the cost regulations but this legislation will only be effective if it is enforced
the g m b has through its health and safety reps under the safety reps and safety committee's regulations specific legal rights which should be UNK as a matter of course
the report identifies workplace health and safety organization and the need for training
yes quality training will be needed quality training which addresses the core values and the health and safety perception that will be the key to our success
we need to coordinate and further organize a better system of training we need a service that can give a quick response for those seeking guidance or information
i believe that our new computer system when it's linked to all the regions will have the potential to access detailed health and safety information and i hope we will use it er and make the information technology that is available to further our health and s safety service delivery
in doing so we will create the opportunity to deliver an individual service to our members through instant response and while improving our service to the members we will also improve our recruitment potential
the report addresses the past and current g m b policy but it is the future needs of our members that we must plan for
we must UNK our expertise and where that expertise is not evident we must create it
in parallel with our training strategy we must ensure sufficient funding for health and safety campaigns if we are to realize the objectives set out in this report
governments employers in conclusion colleagues do not have the right to deny our members a safe healthy working environment
in supporting this report we will be setting a future agenda which should go some way to extending working workers' protection for our members

midland region
president congress ken midlands and east coast region speaking to c e c special report health safety and environment
conference in speaking to this document we should all realize the importance of the subject that we are referring to today
the world of health and safety is a changing rapidly and we in the g m b are and should always be at the forefront of the reviews that are and have taken place
we the g m b have an excellent record over the last fifteen years but the g our people and more so the craftsmen within that particular g is cause for concern and a massive scope for improvement in every area of health safety and the environment
our impact on industry through our green works campaign is there for all to see and from that point of view to UNK it within the health and safety review is vitally important for all of us when we take the policy back to our members and advise them of the way in which we intend to go forward
since the decision of the nineteen seventy eight congress to appoint national and regional health and safety officers the legal and political context within which they operate has changed dramatically with more UNK legislation
since nineteen seventy four over two hundred separate regulations have been introduced

this tory government's UNK attacks on the poor of this country go on day after day
v a t on heating is the latest and now we have UNK of v a t on food
yet still they persist on the abolition of the wages councils
by stopping the wages councils this government through the employment secretary now it's david hunt and we in wales know enough of david hunt
they are turning their backs on the low paid workers
taking away the protection which the wages councils provide is the latest step in the UNK offensive against the poorest in society
it is quite clear getting rid of the wages councils would result in lower wages poor jobs and a move away from equal pay
in nineteen ninety one six thousand workplaces were found to be UNK one or more workers
in nineteen ninety one twelve thousand eight hundred and twelve workers were found to be UNK
in nineteen ninety one arrears totalling one and a half million pounds was due to those twelve thousand eight hundred and twelve workers
in nineteen ninety one of those six thousand employers found to be UNK just seventeen were prosecuted
all were found guilty
this was the highest number of convictions in one year since the present record began in nineteen forty five
the government's response
is to abolish the law that UNK the employers and gives minimum protection of low paid working people
what an appalling set of figures
but still we have an appalling government
a government that believes we are out of recession but is still making britain the UNK of europe
this union needs no convincing nor does the labour party of the need to retain the wages council
the labour party must continue to reject the tax on the low paid the young the elderly and needs to commit itself to a restoration of the wages councils an increase in the power of the wages councils and an improvement in the wages inspectorate to ensure that all employers who break the minimum wages legislation be detected and prosecuted to the UNK extent of the law
conference there are two and a half million low paid workers in britain covered by wages councils
our own clothing and textile section are an exam pardon me
we cannot allow the protection to be taken away from them
colleagues i gave you twelve thousand eight hundred and twelve reasons for you not only to support by raising your hands but by actively supporting your fellow members in their fight to retain the wages councils and to guard and protect their wages
i move

president congress
it is hardly UNK that with all the economic problems facing this country the latest tory UNK to aid recovery and keep growth is the abolition of the wages council
they wrongly believe that things can be put right by operating a framework where those on low pay can be paid even lower wages excuse me
congress we know that low pay never saves jobs and never will
the wages UNK growth as to put the unemployed back to work and have a high paid flexible work force
this government is intent on UNK britain in europe as the only country with no minimum guaranteed wages and a UNK for low cost products
in scotland a quarter of a million of the UNK workers would be affected by this UNK er sorry this tory policy mainly part time working women and ethnic groups
we must recognize this policy for what it is to turn britain into the UNK of europe
it is the duty of this congress to UNK to campaign and oppose this greedy tory government and its policies at every turn
remember trade union and public opposition forced the re think in the poll tax
we can do the same again

president congress supporting composite twenty
congress wages so councils set minimum rates of pay in some of u k's lowest paying industries
they provide over two point five million three quarters of whom are women with protection industries such as clothing and textiles shops UNK and leisure services are all protected by the councils
over the last few years the t tory government has reduced the amount of wages inspectors
each now is responsible for over thirty four thousand workers
instead of dealing with problems of low paid and increasing the number of inspectors the government is going to abolish them completely
congress as the majority of low paid workers are women the abolition of wages councils is direct discrimination
although more women are j t joining trade unions they have to continue to work in places where their bosses are opposed to union membership
it may even be impossible to gain full recognition
laws are needed to protect women's rates of pay and ensure they get a fair day's pay for a fair day's work
of course not only women are in danger of being UNK
millions of others will be openly UNK by unscrupulous employers
th the economy can only suffer UNK and low productivity as a result of poverty pay
we must support the introduction of a minimum wage and fight against the abolition of wages councils
i urge you to please support this motion
northern region
oh right what happened to the southern region
did they UNK their rights
ah you've got to have eyes in the back of your head here i'm telling ya
southern region
speaking in support of composite motion twenty
conference president
the wage councils were set up to establish legally UNK minimum wages for employees and associated trades and prevented unfair competition
the wage council provided a useful basis for pay determination especially in industries where there is little collective bargaining
the vast majority of the estimated two and a half million employees covered by the wage council work in the retail hot retail hotel and catering and textile industries
many of these employees are women often working part time
the UNK of the wage councils will mean that millions of working people will be open to exploitation by unscrupulous employers
in the near future employers will be able to pay even lower wages and employees will no will have no legal right to challenge low pay
many of our comrades in the hotel and catering industry work long and UNK hours for as little as two ninety two an hour a hundred and fourteen pound for a thirteen ho thirty nine hour week
conference who can survive on a hundred and fourteen pound a week
many hotel workers don't belong to trade unions
it has always been difficult to organize hotel workers by the very nature of their industry but the time has now come for those very workers to join the g m b so that collectively we can fight the exploitation of low paid workers
conference i ask you to support this motion that calls for a publicity campaign to name those employers and establishments that exploit th their staff so they can make a fat profit and to update the hotel list
if we really mean what we say we should UNK those es establishments that refuse to recognize trade unions
after all why we should we as trade unionists contribute to the ill UNK gains of UNK of human beings
conference please support
motion three four wages councils
lancashire to move
lancashire region moving motion two three four
october the first nineteen ninety three is almost certainly the date the wages councils will be abolished
the abolition of the wages councils will not nothing less than rob two point seven million workers mainly women workers on minimum wage protection
some employers will cease the opportunity as a chance to pay less and thereby making it even more difficult to make ends meet
hotels and catering clothing retail are three of the main wages council's industries of which we have a large membership
the g m b currently UNK at national level in industries as collective bargaining but within the scope of the wages council
one could try and argue all the wages councils are doing in effect are rubber UNK a joint motion agreed in advance between employers and unions
however if the wages councils were abolished there would be no guarantee that a negotiated minimum rate would be applied
the result could be pay UNK even pay cuts
employers must simply abandon the national agreement altogether or the employers may simply ban the national agreement altogether as has happened in other industries like cotton spinning and weaving
UNK the wages councils would be a green light to UNK a direct attack on the lowest paid
wages UNK is one of the possible results of abolition
we have already seen premium rate pay like double time for sunday working attacked after statutory controls on them were removed in nineteen eighty six
the same attack would undoubtedly be made on basic rates when the wages councils are removed altogether
employers who claim they can stand aside from com from com from competitive pressure to UNK are truly on one
the wages council's rates are currently used as a reference point in deciding what pay levels should be
without it there could be a free for all and if abolition goes through the employers may well find themselves having to resort to some form of cooperative or wages club in its place
there is a place for minimum rates of pay
if there are no minimum rates of setting arrangements then standards will slip and conditions will UNK
abolition of the wages council could seriously affect equality of pay between the sexes
a report by UNK for the t u c shows there is no case for abolition
it is UNK more than another attack aimed at the trade unions under the government's trade union reform and employment rights bill and takes absolutely no account of the additional hardship it will impose on our members
a big proportion of them are women
basic rates set by the wages councils apply equally to women and men
over four fifths that's two million of these w of those who the wages c wages are protected by the wages councils are women and as there would seem no point in abolition unless the wages were gonna fall then it is women who will suffer UNK along with another vulnerable group single parents
i urge conference to condemn this UNK cynical government's decision to abolish the wages council and call for the establishment of a national wages council
i se to set minimum rates of pay for all workers in all industries and services
i move this motion
thanks
seconding motion three four
i'm not gonna go over t what my colleague has said but what i do wanna know is when are the labour party gonna get hold of some issue and make some sort of mileage out of it because we've got a number of sponsored mps and we can't get 'em off the doorstep at election time but when it comes about doing summat for us and consider the fact that it affects many people and we talk about the links that the labour party and the trade union has i think the labour party's already UNK 'em as far as i'm concerned
support the motion
composite twenty one minimum wage lancashire region to move
lancashire region
president sisters and brothers
moving composite twenty one minimum wage
congress if a few more voters got off their UNK last year and gone out and voted and voted labour there'd be no need for this motion at all because it's labour party policy anyway
if ever the poor low paid need a decent wage it's now
the new jobs being created are mostly part time low paid UNK with no promotion prospects and few employment rights
yes you've guessed it
the rising jobs are for women
in eleven u k regions more women than we men now have jobs
jobs on the cheap
british home stores and UNK have sacked thousands of full time staff and replaced them with part UNK
what they call them is
you just wo get called in when it's busy and work between eight and sixteen hours
you've gotta be in the job five years opposed to two years to get protection against unfair UNK sick pay redundancy pay maternity leave
if you work less than these hours you have no rights at all
the tories encourage low pay
they're happy for britain to be a at the bottom of the income scale with rich rewards for those on top income
it's estimated that over ten million people now earn less than the council of UNK for wages
sixty eight percent of ad adult earnings an increase of twenty five percent since nineteen seventy nine
and at the same time the income divide between the top twenty percent of men and the bottom twenty percent is now greater than it were hundred years ago
shame
nearly one million people have now had to claim mean tested benefits in order to top up low pay
independent analysts have estimated that a minimum wage set at three pound forty an hour would add one point eight percent to the total labour costs in britain
but wages are only one element of overall costs
in reality it would mean just a rise of nought point two percent on overall costs
in france where minimum wage have ri risen dramatically a study found no si ni no effects on wage UNK inflation or unemployment
the introduction of a national mo minimum wage set at three pound forty an hour would directly benefit four point five million workers
seventy eight percent of these that's three point five million will be women
fifty nine percent of this that's four point five million will be working part time
the ex chancellor will gain a billion pounds through national insurance and reduced benefits
seventy UNK be removed off housing benefit and twenty nine thousand from rent UNK
forty thousand from family credit and two hundred thousand people will be means tested benefit
please support this composite

northern region to second
mister president congress northern region seconding composite twenty one
congress after fourteen years of power the tories have are still hell bent on UNK the lives of low paid working class
more than five million full time workers are low paid and with the significant growth in numbers of part time workers the amount of low paid employees is increasing
women in particular are concentrated at the bottom of their occupational hierarchy of the least UNK jobs
colleagues of the western economies britain is almost alone in having no legal minimum wage or equivalent
surely at a time when the u k's economy position is disastrous even the tory government should see that low wages are a drain on the UNK resources as they reduce UNK productivity potential
just as investors expect a high return for their capital we should expect working people to receive a fair return for their labour
it is well known that foreign companies such as nissan UNK all come to british all come to britain because british workers are amongst the lowest paid in europe
british labour is cheap
congress the time has come to demand change to demand that british workers enjoy the rights enjoyed by workers across the rest of europe
this demand is not unreasonable
the demand is a fair day's pay for a fair day's work
a national minimum wage
mister president i second
thank you

thanks very much
colleagues i call to put the c e c position
c e c congress the c e c is asking you to support composite twenty support motion three four with qualification and support composite twenty one
the conservatives are determined to abolish the wages council
it's absolute disgrace
they're hell belt in hell bent in removing the last statutory protection against the poverty pay for workers in the u k they will make us the only country in europe without some minimum standards
most of the two point five million workers affected are women
delegates the abolition of the wages council is an employment ch an UNK chapter to create UNK
what UNK government can really believe that the basic rate in my factory of two pounds seventy nine p per hour is too high
could they UNK feed and house a family on that kind of money
i don't think not
there's no economic justification for abolition
many small employers want to keep wages councils
what we workers need is better management not lower pay
many more workers will be forced by low pay to claim benefits to make up their income when they want to earn a decision wage
that also means we will be UNK bad employers through our taxes and the UNK factory owners will undermine the decent conditions we have fought for over the years
we must continue to campaign on this issue and support taking legal action in europe against the attack on women's pay
motion three four also deals with the abolition of the wages council and the c e c would like you to ask you to support it but with qualification that a national minimum wage rather than a national wages council is likely to be the best way to set a minimum rate of pay
to show our continuous commitment to fighting lo low pay the c e c ask you to support composite twenty motion three four and composite twenty one

okay alright
lancashire region proposing composite motion twenty two
congress this legislation is th yet another attack on the workers' rights wages and ability to organize
it is yet another attack on trade unions
it is a sick government that is proud of the fact that it's not signed up for a social chapter
it is even more UNK when official statistics show that one in four of all those suffering from poverty wages in europe live and work in britain
what does this legislation do for the low paid in britain
i'll tell you what it does comrades it kicks 'em right in the teeth
this legislation UNK the wages council
mind you not known for their generous pay awards these councils according to the government are a main UNK to economic hope and prosperity in britain
the g m b speaks for these workers and we know that UNK the wages council will not provide any hope or prosperity for millions of low paid workers all over britain
the civil UNK organization recently condemned the british government for UNK international standards on the trade union rights
this leg legislation carries out further attacks on trade union encouraging members of the public to sue strikers
even howard UNK of the c b i called this UNK
this legislation forces members to UNK on an annual basis their employer to UNK from their pay
the reason for this is very simple
it's to make it UNK difficult for unions to collect their UNK and undermine collective organization
again this legislation attracts the UNK procedures that UNK into the union membership disputes
the reason is obvious
it is it is to support unions like the u d m and encourage UNK unions
the only progressive things in this legislation are those demanded by european laws
on maternity rights the government has UNK the rights available to british workers and on they are UNK reorganization of cases
this legislation is nothing to do with employment rights
it is about UNK rights and are attacking trade unions
congress i move

president congress yorkshire north derbyshire region seconding composite twenty two
this bill follows fr on from a series of attacks on the trade union movement and working people over the last fourteen years
these new measures will do nothing to improve industrial relations in this country
it is typical of this tory government a government that has not had a constructive idea all the time it has been in office but thinks that union UNK is the only answer to the country's problems that thinks it is the only way to unite the tory troops
they honestly do not care about this country
they do not care about the unemployed
they do not care about the sick
they do not care about our future
they care about only one thing about themselves and th that's staying in power
this is hanging on to the UNK of government and they are prepared to destroy the country in the process
the legislation is not only unnecessary but it is it could set industrial relations back years in this country
at a time when more progressive countries are UNK improved levels of communications between all sides of industry this government sets out to cause UNK and to create friction
more sensible governments place the onus on solving problems through social partnership through improving standards through actually encouraging training and recognizing skills
in the midst of this terrible recession this government can think of nothing better than UNK wages councils and introducing more union UNK
these new measures will actively encourage unscrupulous employers to further exploit over two and a half million low paid in this country mostly of them women
these measures make britain an employment dumping ground a country that pays its workers low wages and offers its workers no protection
probably the largest attack is centred on the deduction from wages or check off legislation
this is not unusual these days from employees while blaming the economic situation to refuse an increase in pay
but in order to maintain the services to our members unions will probably still have to increase rates at an annual basis
imagine the situation where employers are now obliged to notify employee members of that rise in contribution and also reminding them that they have the right to withdraw their UNK
so not only do we have the challenge every three years to ensure that our members renew check off but we will have in all probability through a similar process on an annual basis
what a drain on valuable time and resources
colleagues this composite calls for the UNK of the union's many resources to campaign against the vicious and unnecessary legislation
it refers to g m g m b sponsored mps and UNK
we demand that they defend our interests both in westminster and UNK european UNK parliament but we must realize that until the electorate of this country vote in a labour government as i am sure they will do in the near future no later we will have a w workplace campaigns we'll have workplace campaigns to educate and inform our members
we are good at organizing and organizing we'll do
colleagues support this composite
composite motion twenty three to be moved by midlands
president congress midlands and east coast region moving composite twenty three
congress in moving this composite i have no intention of delivering a history lesson
we're all UNK aware of our individual employment situations have changed for the worse over the past fourteen years of tory government
as each slice of anti trade union legislation has gone onto the statute book we've become less able to effectively represent our membership
we have witnessed the massive growth in unemployment a huge increase in the number of part time and home workers many of them accepting a UNK low rate of pay
the decline in real earnings of all industrial workers is reflected in the growth of overtime in every industry
twelve members of the european community moved towards the UNK of workers' rights as contained in the social chapter of the maastricht treaty
john major's government UNK in the opposite direction
at a time when only one in five conservative voters think that there is a need for further anti union legislation the government is pushing through the trade union reform and employment rights bill
the UNK composite has focused our attention on the effects of the forthcoming legislation
it is strange to consider that were it not for the intervention of conservative UNK the proposals in this bill could have been far worse
lord prior UNK at g e c and former tory minister argued against the government's original proposal that the UNK of check off facilities should be on a yearly basis
such a proposal he concluded would be UNK from the employer's point of view
he also UNK supported the UNK agreement by stating that employers preferred single union deals
the tories have stopped short of making trade union membership illegal but is it legal to punish trade union members financially through selective redundancies and as collective agreements are cancelled through offering inferior individual contracts and UNK pay rises
the tories attempt to justify their UNK legislation by stating that industrial disputes affect economic growth
during the past twenty five years italy has had the highest strike rate in europe
during that same period of time UNK average growth in industrial production has been four percent compared to the u k's one point nine
the tories would also that UNK trade union rights is an important factor in attracting foreign investment
during the first eleven years of tory government approximately twenty thousand jobs per year were created by foreign owned companies
compare that to the millions who joined the unemployed register
congress the very least we can ask of the labour party is for a total commitment to the UNK of all anti trade union legislation UNK since nineteen seventy nine and a commitment to sign the social chapter of the maastricht treaty
only then can we begin to repair the damage caused since the tories came to power
we can then effectively return to fighting for the improved quality of life of all our members
president i move
thanks very much
g m b scotland to second g m b scotland to second
president congress g m b scotland seconding composite twenty three
in the last fifteen years we've been a country where law had little to do with labour relations
britain has become a country where almost every aspect of industrial relations are now covered by legal UNK
although we should remember this discussing this motion today that the british state has never been UNK or slow to use the law to UNK working men and women
however the reason that the contemporary attacks are different is that the UNK of trade unions was an integral part in margaret UNK economic package and if the only reason for this legislation was because it was part of a failed economic strategy then that in itself should be enough but the real effect of anti trade union legislation should be examined in the context of a wider social and industrial parameter and if we take just one act the employment act of nineteen eighty we can get some idea of the effect of tory employment legislation
six and seven of that act increased the limits for unfair dismissal from twenty six weeks to two years
section eight helped to introduce short term contracts section nine removed the minimum basic award t for compensation for unfair dismissal
section fourteen reduced the time period for entitlement of guaranteed payments and perhaps worst of all sections eleven twelve and thirteen on maternity rights affected the rights of women to return to work
of course this act was followed by those of eighty two eighty four eighty eight eighty nine ninety one ninety two and ninety three
all of them are equally vicious and UNK
but we can see from the nineteen eighty act that
despite its UNK that it speaks in the name of individuals by UNK employment protection and UNK
this government UNK each and every worker
the truth is that acting in is isolation workers simply cannot recognize their rights against the superior powers of employers and of capital
ultimately trade unions are the workers only social protection
there's a very UNK quote about law by oliver UNK and he puts it really into perspective and he says laws ground the poor and rich men rule the law
it's time to get these laws off the backs of the working class

colleagues motion three four two
labour movement media campaign
midland region to move
president congress midlands and east coast region
today we've had two examples of the media campaign
UNK in scotland
what do we know about the UNK dispute in scotland
i personally don't know a lot about it apart from the fact that arthur UNK went up there and there was a bit of excitement
but it made the national press because arthur was up there and there was a bit of shouting and UNK
john mentioned the UNK dispute
i've never heard of that one at all
but by looking at this document here it would appear there's been more violence committed there against UNK and yet that doesn't make the national press
two examples of bias in the press
the labour im ownership of the mass media tends to be concentrated in the hands of a few companies
not just not just publishing but also broadcasting in UNK
i quote from the sixth of july nineteen eighty seven
on all three UNK where mr murdoch rules his titles support businessmen governments and their ambitions
it is an UNK power which UNK our democracy
it is not simply because mr murdoch UNK with UNK policy which he does but because his staff from the moment they are employed know what is expected of them
they know what to write and how to write and if they do not they will be out the front door before they can pick up their hats and coats
end quote
UNK power indeed
labour should not get elected
UNK cannot be trusted
too many u turns
UNK too UNK and a UNK on the beach
labour would do better with john smith as a leader
labour hold victory rally in sheffield before election
the bias at times is obvious
at others more subtle
television interviews
get the politician or the industrial leader against a bi a good background own office bit of make up comfortable in his own UNK
interview the trade union leader in the street
traffic UNK angles our knows about this a very subtle way
you know what they're laughing at
you know what they're laughing at
a very subtle way of colouring people's views
indeed leading up the general election one tabloid paper said truth not propaganda and it ran a series of articles each day de doing features on the main parties to give a fair and balanced view but also running other features claiming nothing wrong with the n h s banking systems and other high profile problems
but then on the day of the election they said we have given you all the facts but on balance advise you to v vote for john major
bias
what bias
there are out there people of thirty plus who have never known a labour government who only know what they see and read
we cannot afford to wait t a few months before the next election
we need now to get our act together
unions put out newspapers many put out more than one
we need an urgent review maybe less papers but more information on rights lost and what labour policies are for the future
some of these thirty plus never had the rights so how do they know what have gone
questions need answering
what is the social charter
why huge job losses if we have a minimum wage
why would a maximum forty eight forty eight hour week lose jobs
it's up to us to inform them
fewer but better papers
bright UNK leaflets for notice boards
lord UNK once wrote god made people read so that i could fill their brain with facts and later tell them whom to love and whom to hate and what to think
well we need to make people think and we need to make them care
support motion three four two
i move
thank you
a seconder for three four two
president congress midlands and east coast region seconding motion three four two
congress as you know our union supports a free press but would like better rights of UNK
let me give you an example of the UNK of the press
the sun published a front page lead stating that a labour london borough had banned the teaching of UNK black sheep as racist
this had been replaced by UNK green sheep
this story was completely UNK and was successfully challenged in front of the press council
the correction was printed in a small two centimetre box hidden in well inside the paper
other countries such as america allow papers to have a political leaning in terms of UNK etcetera
but actual stories must be balanced and if not the correction has to be the same must have the same UNK in the original as the original article
why won't this government adopt a similar law for this country
now one of the successes that the UNK had if you can call it a success is to link socialism and losers together
the trouble is the media is able to influence the public and unfortunately influential people in the trade union and labour movements and maybe they believe the propaganda that socialism is dead and respond accordingly
that's the media the power of the media
what is needed from you congress is to fight these UNK and to take back the front page headlines and make sure that the headlines are accurate fair and UNK
i second motion three four two
three four three lancashire region to move
lancashire region speaking on motion three four three
the anti trade union laws which we face in october are just another attempt by this government to wipe out socialism and break the trade union movement
we must demand that these laws be abolished because if this government has its way the working man will have gone back one hundred years
together with the abolition of the wage councils and the minimum wage the working man will find himself at the mercy of the unscrupulous bosses
the laws have already UNK the working people throughout the u k we watched unions being taken apart and what has the leadership done
nothing
get up front
attack these laws
we will start to UNK rebuild the movement brick by brick
only by being united will we defeat this government
promised to fight for the miners
three hundred thousand marched in london hundred thousand elsewhere across britain supported by millions
the tragedy is that didn't carry the fight through
i believe what goes around comes around and our day will come
no more UNK no more UNK no more exploitation
we must start to fight back now and the g m b should be at the for forefront
i say fight the laws fight this government fight for the survival of socialism and the trade union movement
i move
mister president congress lancashire region seconding motion three four three
i believe brothers and sisters at this conference we must decide whether we're gonna take away from here back to our members any credibility
i don't UNK intend to UNK to the converted but what i do intend to say to anyone in this hall that's either UNK or UNK or just too idle to do anything than let this motion drift by them that if we don't get together on this issue to get the message over to our national officers and in turn the t u c that if we don't stand and fight for the right to UNK the basic principles of what i believe to be trade unionism that is the right to withdraw labour the right to protect our brothers and sisters from UNK employers the right to command decent conditions and fair pay without fair UNK
if we don't make a stand now then all of us in this hall will be a living breathing testament to the UNK of all those that have gone before us and we'll leave nothing for anybody coming in the future
as a works convenor i work along twenty shop stewards and i can tell this congress that the message that they've given to me from the people from the people that have elected them is that they're sick and tired of the UNK of the t u c about how they have to UNK by the laws when the only laws that are there are the laws that are bringing this movement down
there comes a time when natural justice UNK any law made by any government and that time's now
no longer the excuse of keeping low profile actions hoping for a labour government because if we haven't got the UNK to stand up and fight the government that made these laws then we've got no right to challenge a future labour government that UNK 'em
brothers and sisters i say to you that the message that must leave this conference is one that says to all trade unionists we will fight any UNK legislation used against us
all our brothers and sisters when they need us whatever the cost wherever the place we need no one to do the job for us
we won't wait any longer
we must say to our officers now today don't sit back and see the life blood squeezed out of our union
show this government something by your example that they haven't got and that's strong leadership
the leadership that the t u c have UNK us of for over ten years
and give us back the pride and the credibility that we once took for granted as trade unionists but we allowed to slip away from us and make us a force to be UNK with and send this government a message we'll never allow anyone at westminster to tell us how to run the g m b we'll never allow anyone at westminster to prevent us from protecting our brothers and sisters and we'll no never ever allow anyone at westminster to defeat the trade union movement
i second the motion
motion three four six southern region
congress mister president southern region moving motion three four six
colleagues the de recognition and non recognition of trade unions in the u k has fast become the central challenge to and for the trade union movement particularly as this government is committed to UNK the de recognition process
this creeping destruction of workers' rights has spread rapidly from journalists to printers from UNK drivers to docks telecom managers to mines and UNK to insurance staff
slowly but surely the rights of trade union reps are being eroded
in some cases incentives are being given by management to workers who UNK themselves from the unions leading to UNK and UNK within the workplace between workers who have traditionally been united in UNK industrial relations
trade union de recognition is having effect of reducing the solidarity of workers and of reducing rights built up over a hundred years of trade union movement
and the government is proud of its achievement
in fact it is so proud that it now UNK at a european level of the cheap u k labour costs and the lack of workers' rights
two months ago the british government took out advertisements in regional newspapers in germany encouraging business to come to britain to take advantage of low labour costs compared to elsewhere in the e c the advertisement UNK noted that the labour cost index for britain is one hundred compared to one seventy eight in germany
in another publication circulated by the d t i to foreign UNK the government UNK and i quote new labour laws have been introduced so that employers are now under no statutory obligation to recognize any union
colleagues if this government is so UNK prepared to sell out its own workers in such a public manner then there will surely be no limit to the steps they will be prepared to take to further reduce union power
we must fight the challenge for what it is
a direct attack on the fundamental UNK and rights of workers to organize themselves collectively
but social dumping is but one example of the way in which the european spirit has been abused by this government
unscrupulous employers have found new ways of UNK european social directives which depend on having union representatives in the workplace
by de recognizing these representatives employers can effectively ignore their obligations in europe and thereby deny workers' rights accepted as basic conditions in the eleven other member states
colleagues union de recognition strikes at the very heart of the trade union movement and in preparing to face this challenge the g m b must be at the forefront of the fight
congress i move
is there a seconder for three four six
congress i second motion three four six
the nineteen eighty employment act gives the possibility to the employers through the u k to de recognize legitimate trade unions and these trade union re representatives has to be the most damaging piece of government legislation of the last two decades
it is directed at the core of the UNK the general un er the er tee the union movement which is unity thr throughout the workplace
it has allowed employers to drive a wedge between workers making the members of thi the workforce a second class citizens within their own workplace
it has allowed unscrupulous employers to avoid e c directives such as collective redundancies transfers of undertakings a range of health and safety directives
i second this motion
thank you
colleagues i call to put the c e c position
southern region secretary responding on behalf of the c e c president congress the c e c is asking you to support composite twenty two support composite twenty three and motions three four two and three four six
we accept motion three four three with some qualifications as it UNK the question actually how do we UNK anti trade union laws
we have long sought parliamentary protection against the common law and have already accepted some state interference in our UNK
we have for example welcomed laws that allows us to merge and accept transfers of UNK from other trade unions and also laws allowing political expenditure
the g m b supports a fresh approach to industrial UNK law with a completely new legislative code which brings international standards fully into the u k president we are totally opposed to the UNK trade union laws brought in by tory governments over the last fourteen years
tory governments that have said they are the champions of the individual but have eroded the rights of individual workers over the last fourteen years
that want economic benefits of europe for the of the business world but have denied british workers the protection of european social legislation
that UNK wages councils but denies the lowest paid british workers a minimum rate of pay which the other eleven member states provide
as mentioned by the speaker of three four six about advertising in foreign newspapers they have the UNK to advertise in foreign newspapers that cheap labour is available in britain
they actually take pride in promoting britain as the UNK of europe
what kind of government is this
it's been mentioned by several speakers today
they're a sick cynical UNK government that will go to any extremes to deny individual workers their rights
this was clearly illustrated just over a week ago when by the cynical abuse of the legislative process they introduced an amendment to the trade union reform and employment rights bill at the eleventh hour in the lords
they did this to UNK the court of appeal ruling that found on behalf of a daily mail journalist and an employee of british
the judgement found that the trade unionists had been UNK for being members of a trade union
they were denied a pay rise when they refused to sign a personal contract because they wanted to be covered by the trade union collective agreement
the government's justification for this amendment was and i quote it was not in line with what the government expected
this is according to someone we've never heard of before and hopefully will never hear of again a UNK
they're actually now UNK on our civil rights
they're UNK on our basic right to be a member of a trade union
and it was mentioned by the member of motion twenty three they're actually now starting to look at membership of a trade union being illegal
the disgraceful action was described by UNK young of the guardian as a UNK saga of a politically sick society
congress what is just as worrying is apparently the parliamentary labour party was extremely reluctant to take any stand at all to respond to this UNK breach of i l o laws
perhaps they should spend more time concentrating on protecting interests of workers than promoting constitutional debate within the party
president where do we go from here
i am pleased to report to congress that following a meeting with our lawyers we're reasonably confident that there are in fact two avenues open to us to challenge the government in the courts on the social chapter
we will now be considering how best to progress this challenge
we will continue to campaign vigorously with our colleagues in the trade union and hopefully the labour movement on all aspects of employment rights not just through the media as asked for in three four two but at the workplace
despite fourteen years of trying to smash us into submission they'll fail to break the spirit of the working people of britain
our members have had enough of UNK tory employment laws that give too much power to unscrupulous employers and no protection for the workers
the british public have had enough
trade unionists are fighting back
the general secretary mentions some of them in his report and i do not apologize for mentioning it again they're fighting back at UNK they're fighting back at UNK in my own region at crawley we've twenty members who've been on strike for the last sixteen and a half weeks
they're fighting back in other workplaces throughout the u k we must fully support these workers and campaign for them
the g m b will use every UNK avenue open to us to ensure that british workers do not become the UNK labour of europe
we demand the same rights protection and civil UNK that other european workers enjoy

part time workers composite motion twenty four part time and temporary workers yorkshire region to move
g m b scotland to second
priority in debate northern region
if speakers could come down to the front please colleagues settle now please
president congress yorkshire north derbyshire region UNK moving composite moving composite on part time and temporary labour
you might find it's a little bit strange me stood up here talking to you about temporary labour part time workers when you've heard what UNK gone through and said temporary labour situations all morning
but i'm still here to ask you to support this motion on the plight of casual and temporary workers
many of us here present today have worked for our employers for over two years so we have some protection under law
well it's a bit of a joke really
in many instance not even that's a UNK
the casual workers are the perfect UNK target for the employ employers who to swing the d UNK of UNK
they'll chop your heads off when they feel like it
this is how the employers see the temporary and casual worker
they'll do any job
they'll not answer back
they can move 'em about when they feel like it
and they'll put up with any conditions
they can pay 'em what they like and if they upset anybody they're down the road
well we all know that cos that's exactly what happens to 'em
if we carry on to let 'em do as they like what'll happen is this section of the workforce will go in such a decline they'll be very profitable which as we've already heard as UNK are trying it on now
when costs are so profitable why would they need full time employees they can just have us stood at the door any d any g at the gate any week they want begging for a day's work
my granddad did
i'm sure some of yours did
in a lot of a lot of situations these er employees can't go to bank get a loan they can't get a mortgage building society won't listen to 'em nobody really cares about 'em
we need to ensure that these people get some form of equal right equal right with a s simple contract
more and more employees are using these casual workers and every one of our jobs is under threat cos if you lose your job tomorrow you're a casual the day after
as easy as that people who have to work under these conditions right in the threat of w threat of labour have real problems with the kids
you know the normal things in life
a bit of security of employment so they can sort of sort out for an holiday
instead what happens is they do thirteen weeks as some place and they're down road
it's no good at all
if their protection under agreement and under law was exactly the same as a full time worker then UNK happen is simple
there'd be no need to have 'em as UNK or temporary workers
i've heard in UNK er in my factory i've heard it in other places right when a temporary l temporary or casual worker goes down the road or a part timer work's cut short ah it's only a casual and he only expected to be here for a few weeks
who'll tell his wife and kids that cos i don't want to
and it does matter
it matter to all of us
we can't accept these conditions for our employees so sign 'em up for the g m b and fight for their rights
fight for a fair the fairness and a fair UNK quality of life
colleagues i move this motion
g m b scotland to second
g m b scotland to second
chair delegates UNK two branch clothing and textile section seconding temporary workers
the forgotten people or so it seems
the people who continue to be UNK against by employers with regard to pay holidays redundancies working conditions pensions maternity rights etcetera
congress must fully support moves by the t u c and the labour party to ensure that temporary workers are treated no less UNK than full time workers
action is essential
UNK particularly sorry in today's economic climate
increasing numbers of people are being employed on temporary basis
making life so much harder for th for the worker and so very much easier for the employers
for example if there is an unexpected budgetary UNK the labour force can UNK be reduced by simply not UNK employment contracts which is why industries are UNK to the same UNK logic
i urge you to support this motion for temporary workers and let's have equal rights for all
thank you
northern region
northern region supporting composite twenty four
president congress
how would you like to have no employment rights
this is the case with most temporary workers and some part time workers
no right to redundancy and no right to accrued holiday pay
most will be paid less than full time workers and be on short term contracts i e monthly and in some cases weekly
in my own particular section of the clothing and textiles the union fought long and hard to gain the same rights and conditions for temporary workers and so leading to permanent employment in most cases
in the present economic climate i feel we are taking a backward step to the bad old days
how many rights have we lost since the tories came to power
we now have many more temporary and part time workers with the so called in commas decent employers who will do anything to save money
isn't this a threat to the workers who feel their job is permanent
how many employee employers i e british home stores have paid off their full time staff and given them part time only employment
UNK in scotland who sacked all their workforce who now have no job at all
how many more will try this on in the future
we can no longer stand by and let this happen
when will we say enough is enough
well congress i say it's now
congress the c e c are recommending your acceptance with a statement and i call national vice president
congress president speaking on behalf of the c e c congress the c e c is UNK at the increase in the use of part time and temporary contracts by employers as a way of cost cutting
this increase UNK by the recession has meant inequality and discrimination for hundreds and thousands of workers
the growth in the labour market flexibility as employers like to call it has become another way of describing de regulation of employment conditions and UNK trade union rights
under the tories part time and temporary working all too often not all too often always ha means low pay poorer working conditions and few of the benefits enjoyed by full time workers
britain is fast becoming a UNK economy based on cheap labour and no investment and the tories have proved it
john major himself when they put adverts in every press in europe come to britain our employees have no rights and they are cheap labour
so it's not rhetoric it's truth
instead of moving forward into the twenty first century the tories are moving backward us backwards with working conditions that would be more suited to the nineteenth century
colleagues since nineteen eighty one we have stood on this platform and UNK c t UNK competitive tendering because it was the start of low paid temporary workers
lower the hours no holidays doing the same amount of work in shorter hours if you want to win the contract
most of us or most employees were threatened
well some time ago jack straw was supposed to have said that under the no new er acts or under a labour government that c t would remain because of a transfer of undertakings we didn't er need to change
this union made jack straw in no doubt and the labour party that on their election the compulsory element of c t will be removed and if they had any ideas they'd better forget 'em
congress not so long ago we had UNK and i t v and i congratulate both of 'em for highlighting to the world the problems of temporary and low paid part time workers where one agent went under cover and where UNK highlighted that temporary working conditions not of back street UNK not of the little corner shops down the road or th or the little UNK factories but of e m i one of our biggest producers in this country that they were employing labour for one year eleven months and twenty eight days and then UNK 'em
what a disgrace for a company to behave a company like e m i
and there's not only e m i there's a vast number of 'em
well a few weeks ago on your behalf i attended the national policy forum of the labour party and we made it quite plain that the labour government in its manifesto will have full employment rights for all from day one so no one can abuse workers' rights
and you'll be pleased to know that frank UNK has agreed to meet us on the fourteenth of june and we will make sure to the best of our effort that policy will be endorsed
congress the c e c is committed to negotiating full time rights and benefits for part time and temporary workers
we will ensure our bargaining agenda makes the employer's so called flexibility work for g m b part time and temporary workers and it will be full UNK employment right for all from day one

president congress
i never thought in my UNK dreams that this UNK be on an agenda
but there again i'm not bloody surprised
the leadership we've had from the trade union movement over the last fourteen years we've been picked off on everything
as the old greek said what you have you hold
now we're likely to bloody lose it
i can't for the love of me understand the leadership of all the unions that allowed we don't even get enough holidays of what they get on the continent we should be asking for more not taking them off us or putting it in october to celebrate UNK and UNK because i couldn't give a monkey for 'em
if you want your holidays you have them in the summer time and may day is a workers' day
it's nothing to do with politics with the labour party the conservative or the communist party
it's always been a workers' day and i hope it will remain so
is there a seconder
er lancashire region
president congress
in seconding the motion for keeping the may day holiday it is my opinion that th g this government is having yet another go at the unions
it seems to me that we are having to fight all over again to keep many things that we have already fought for and gained in the past
we must all fight together to keep UNK
motion three eight european legislation lancashire region to move
lancashire region moving motion three eight on european legislation
president congress
over the last few weeks certain parts of european legislation have come to the forefront of media attention
not least the ruling of a maximum working week of forty eight hours
this tory government in its infinite wisdom has decided not to introduce this ruling until at the earliest two thousand and three
what a UNK
this government should be forced to stand by its convictions not just pick and choose UNK to follow which will fill its whilst ignoring those which will benefit the ordinary working man
why should the government be allowed to get away with limiting the transfer of undertakings legislation to the private sector
are public sector UNK rights less important than those of private sector employees
i think not
i move
that seconded
thank you very much
motion three five o employment london region to move
president congress london region moving resolution three five o congress i'm sure everybody here has heard of or had experience of the changes taking place in the terms of our employment
no longer do we take it for granted as meaning that we get a job in a company or an industry with the hope and intention of learning new skills gaining experience and becoming part of an enterprise in turn passing on skills and giving others the benefit of our experience
in the past this did not mean that we would not move from company to company it most certainly did not mean that we ha that we thought we had a job for life but it did mean that we expected a degree of UNK and improvement as part of the reward for our UNK and labour
but that has all changed now
what we now see all too often is a variety of less secure UNK for full time direct employment
these come in the UNK of short term and temporary contracts agency staff and contracting out rolling contracts and extended trial periods right across the employment scene
and make no mistake although this has been introduced in a UNK and UNK manner it is in effect a well thought out policy with the strategy coming from the tory think tanks and implemented with UNK by their close friends and allies in both public and private industry
and the goals of this policy are many and varied
prime amongst them is to d to undermine nationally agreed wages and conditions to undermine rights embodied in industrial law to undermine trade union membership and organization
and the victims of this policy are often low paid and often women but it's by no means confined to these groups
it is widespread and growing to the extent that the government is currently seeking to UNK for variable contracts between trade union members and non members
but the effects and intentions of short UNK go far beyond these limits
just think what we have UNK to build up over the years for what we call job security
we've UNK to establish financial security so as to provide for the needs of our families and communities
good health good housing good education and freedom from the fear of poverty and deprivation
and we approach this in a positive manner so that hand in hand with stability we had job satisfaction fulfilment and pride
but once a job becomes a series of chances with restrictions built in all of what we UNK for becomes a thing of the past
uncertainty UNK hope
some aspects of short UNK can be dressed up to look appealing
well it's better than no job at all som i hear them say
no there can be no doubt that long term effects will be bad for organized labour and a cruel price for many a price not worth paying
colleagues short UNK must be opposed and reversed
i move
is there a seconder for three five o
thank you
motion three five two yorkshire region to move
president congress yorkshire north derbyshire region moving three five two
contracts of employment
a contract of employment can also consist of items other than those listed in employment statements
works rules custom and practice and some terms in collective agreements can all be incorporated
the law says that once the employment contracts have been accepted by the employee then the employer should not make changes without agreement
if employers try to give notice to change the contract without agreement then they are in fact giving notice to UNK the contract and offering a new one on different terms
if the employee UNK the change the employee will be in breach of contract
if they try to impose it UNK the UNK employee would then be entitled to resign and claim constructive dismissal or UNK in some circumstances take the action to a county court
this is of course is where the problem starts
the employee must leave his or her employment on the chance that their case succeed
bearing in mind that even if an employer's action amounts to constructive dismissal this does not always mean that the dismissal will automatically be unfair
the tribunal or court could well take the view that the business needs to UNK or UNK practices or indeed to cut costs
all of these can be UNK as valid reasons for changing a contract
to succeed with a er constructive dismissal case the proposed changes must be UNK as fundamental
many changes are not UNK as fundamental in today's economic climate so in theory we may seem to have the backing of the legal scheme where in practice we have to cope with the interpretation which is weighed towards the employers and their economic arguments
th that is why this motion calls for the c e c to introduce a rolling campaign aimed at introducing legislation which will bind companies to the status quo until new agreements are reached through consultation
a company breaking this agreement should give us the absolute right to seek compensation
new legislation is needed because employers can hide behind the smoke screens of reorganization for economic reasons which enables them to make changes to working people's terms conditions of employment
surely if a change is UNK imposed on employees then regardless of the su supposed economic UNK argument regardless of the employer's UNK attitude we should be able to say these proposed changes will not take effect until full negotiation and agreement have been reached
colleagues i ask for you to support to support this motion
i also ask you to monitor an any UNK decision made by your employers and document any changes
let your full time organizer have the details
we will then be in a position to support our campaign with the facts
colleagues support this motion
thanks very much colleague
is there a seconder
president congress yorkshire north derbyshire region seconding motion three five two contracts of employment
has outlined the complex UNK involved in trying to stop UNK employers imposing changes to contracts of employment against the wishes of the employee
on one hand we know that the employees cannot make changes to contacts without agreements
on the other hand we realize how difficult it is to use the law to bring these UNK employees to task
unfortunately many employees also know how difficult it is for us to stop them simply imposing changes without agreement from the people that are affected
there are of course certain alternatives to using the law
workers can refuse to accept the change and withdraw their labour
many workers are already looking over their shoulders with four million people in reality unemployment in the united kingdom
they do not see strike action as a real choice and why should they
they have they have t why should they even have to UNK taking this type of industrial action
they have kept their side of the agreement kept their part of the contract
colleagues fourteen years of tory rule has taken its toll
many employees are using the excuse of falling sales to impose changes to previously agreed conditions often using the excuse to impose changes to conditions that have been fought for many years
they will sometimes attempt to justify the situation by buying out certain conditions
the workers would rather stick to the status quo but know that an industrial tribunal would rule that the employer was forced to make the changes for supposedly sound economic reasons and UNK had sought to agree financial compensation
the motion asks the c e c to UNK a campaign aimed at changing legislation giving workers the right to refuse to accept changes to previous agreed contracts
we must start by UNK and UNK all cases all changes where imposed affecting g m b members
we should highlight and UNK these UNK pass the information to our sponsored mps ask them to raise the issues in parliament
our UNK in the trade union movement fought hard to win many of the conditions enjoyed by g m b members today
they would turn in their graves if they knew that we were allowing employees to simply give twelve weeks' notice of intent to change those conditions
we need legislation to deal with this issue but we need legislation with teeth
we need legislation that will help us retain our hard fought rights and conditions
working people need to maintain their dignity
if employers can simply change conditions without fear of the law then the law needs changing
colleagues support the motion and you will help people's dignity in work been stolen
support the motion and you will hopefully be starting the campaign for fairness a campaign for a level playing field a campaign for justice under law
colleagues i second the motion
motion three five three london region
president congress london region
the saying one law for them and another for us goes back a long way
probably nobody in congress was alive when it was first said
however the reasons for its conception are as valid today as they were whenever the saying was first UNK
it is truly amazing that in a UNK country with a government UNK committed to law and order or so they say that the tax payer you mr president you fellow delegates me and my members our members are left to pick up a bill UNK to millions of pounds as a result of actions by certain employers which are without doubt criminal but not against the law
i'm talking mr president about companies who using the mask of the recession their very best management and at the worst UNK fraud by going into UNK overnight UNK millions in UNK wages holiday pay redundancy pay p a y e national insurance pension and union contributions not to mention v a t there are provisions subject to limits for payments of these outstanding debts
we pay them
but this takes time months in fact
the distress and hardship caused to redundant workers cannot be valued
however that disc distress is greatly increased when these workers find that their ex bosses opens another business with another name just over the road or in the same premises
there are numerous examples of this UNK practice
the sewing factory in UNK where twenty five workers arrived to find the door locked and the company in UNK them a total of a hundred thousand pounds
the brand name of this factory was sold and is now being manufactured abroad but an UNK public still buys that brand after having paid in taxes the outstanding debt
the engineering factory in hertfordshire who UNK their staff into working for three weeks without pay before finally going into UNK
the loyal workers were UNK to find two months later their ex boss had bought all his ex machinery at the UNK for next to nothing and started up in business again under another name in the same premises
colleagues there are many more examples of this crime which is not a crime
go on a train without a ticket or don't get a UNK licence and the re is a substantial fine and a criminal record
rob workers and the country of millions of pounds and get off UNK free
a tax UNK for the bosses and a tax UNK for us
congress this motion UNK a change in legislation so that in the matter of UNK the employer be held liable to a much greater degree and indeed be held UNK responsible for actions involving UNK of debt liability
for the sake of all employees and re employment rights i move

motion three six five single table pay negotiations
lancashire region to move
er lancashire region moving motion three six five
th the UNK basically saying that we want to continue er our demands for UNK of conditions pe irrespective of what peop jobs people do er in terms of negotiating agreements
now the er th it the resolution does say where appropriate and i think that obviously it it's not inappropriate it's not appropriate to undermine er agreements on the basis of negotiating locally is what the resolution actually refers to so er so i can see and i would anticipate appropriate would be where it does not undermine er national agreements
er i also wanted to raise the issue of er the public service section in respect to er this because there's something UNK perhaps not actually tackled in the resolution but equally er important i think is that it's actually getting the resources into er down to the br branch level and er if we took this resolution literally er what it would actually mean would be that er in UNK with UNK of agreements we would be handing over er our majority on the manual workers public service workers to so obviously we gotta take this resolution very seriously but consider its implications and the relevance of the word appropriate because i don't think that we want to be er handed over to come july the first er single table bargaining where we are an absolute minority and where th that union merge that's taking place is obviously hostile to our union
so i move the resolution three six five
