thanks very much
seconder for three six five formally seconded
i'm calling of the c e c whilst is coming to the rostrum just make the point colleagues that it's nearly ten years since g c h q and a massive demonstration is planned when that particular date occurs and we're gonna be very much involved in it
president c e c lancashire region
congress the c e c accepts motions three fifty three five three and three six five
we mis wish to make statements on motions three eight three five two and we have a qualification to motion three two three
let me begin with the qualification
motion three two three is quite right to criticize the UNK political proposal to remove the may day holiday which would leave the u k as one of the few UNK countries without a day to acknowledge the labour movement
however we regret the use of the word UNK in the motion since it is quite out of proportion
vote against it because the future of our union and the interests of our members is at risk
let's take it and prevent a constructive relationship with the t g developing into an UNK alliance
i was gonna say UNK but i took it out i thought it was a bit strong
let's stop wasting our time and effort on going down this road to UNK
we don't need immediate reaction to unison or anyone else
what we should do is show that we're the best union by effectively representing our members and if others want to join us then they can but on our terms
i move UNK of the statement
southern region
southern region
president congress
the general secretary has told us that the UNK the special document on cooperation with the t g was carefully written
it was so carefully written that i've read it three times and i don't think it says anything
this union has got a long history of this union's got a long history of UNK some conducted more successfully than others
this is not an amalgamation we're considering it's not a merger it's an enormous undertaking
but it's something we cannot afford not to be involved in
we cannot afford to UNK around with it we cannot afford the time not to be on the move on the move because that's the only way our members are gonna dictate what they want
there will be a price to be paid but it's not to be undertaken at any price
there are many sacred cows with within this organization that must be preserved principally our regional structure our regional financial structure er is one of the main things that we have to preserve
my own personal opinion regardless of what other people think about UNK is that our sectional structure is something which was wi er built up at times with difficulty and prices have been high and pay has been high
but it's something that we need to preserve strongly
the two organizations are s er so large that you can't join 'em together with two pieces of sticking plaster and three tin UNK
there must be created a new and UNK organization to meet the challenge of the twenty first century and beyond
to our colleague from london let me say i happen to be a UNK not because i'm a UNK with me head in the past but because that happens to be the occupation that i follow and that's what i am
but let me say that in saying that i'm a UNK i have always been i am now and i will always be proud to say that i'm a UNK
but at the same time i'm proud to say that i'm a member of the t an er of the g m b
a member of the g m b i'm proud to say that i'm a trade unionist and i'm proud to say that i'm a socialist and if i'm gonna remain that and if we're gonna carry that message forward we've gotta be on the move we've gotta do it we've gotta carry it forward we can't afford to UNK our way through
we've gotta have a direction and it's not about who gets the best jobs and who gets the best power positions it's about UNK an agenda by the members for the members in the interests of our members the t g 's members and all trade unionists in this country
i support the paper
northern region
president congress northern region supporting the special motion
and we will try to be sensible in this debate
mr president since nineteen twenty four and the great amalgamation which formed the g m w it has been the ambition of many within the g m w and the t g to complete the task and bring together the UNK two great general unions to form one super union
over the years many UNK have arisen to halt these dreams yet still for many the ultimate objective remains
in recent years those ambitions of UNK the t g and the g m b have received fresh support
the decline in membership the economic recession has damaged all the trade unions and has forced us all to examine all prejudices to look above the sectional interests and wherever possible do all we can to protect our movement
congress for all these reasons the northern region support a special report
however at our pre congress meeting many reservations were expressed the most important of which was concerned at the timing of any merger and about how the new union would be controlled
many asked is it the right time for the g m b to even consider UNK with the t g particularly given the fact that over the past thirteen years the t g has lost over fifty percent of their membership and now stands in great financial crisis
these issues are far reaching and fundamental to our union
they require urgent attention by the c e c and must be addressed before any talks are conducted with the t g
by supporting this report the northern region does not support a merger at this time
instead we are asking for a frank and open debate within our own union and on that basis and on that basis alone will the northern region support the report
south western region
south western region speaking in support of the special statement
in supporting this document i believe that we have to look UNK to the future and recognize that one general union would benefit trade union members in the u k far better than continuing to be in competition
in recent years cooperation not competition has proved that the g m b and t g w u can work together for the advantage of all our members
we know that throughout the region there has been closer contact between our two unions UNK joint conferences and campaigns with distinct advantages for all
conference with unemployment on the increase and trade union membership on the decline trade unions must move forward with wider appeal with a new concept of unionism for the future
but colleagues although my region supports the document with such an important issue caution must be our by word as some regions have had more success than others
on this basis the south western region supports the c e c statement
lancashire
conference lancashire region
president conference lancashire region supports the document but with reservations
i'll talk about the reservations in a few minutes but the lancashire region supports any amalgamation initiatives with any union which is here in the country
indeed that's already our policy
but and it's but supporting the document today does not give the c e c the green light to rush into any amalgamation with the transport and general union and UNK up the g m b
now colleagues i've been a member of the g m b for twenty five years
i've been an activist for over twenty years in this organization
i've been coming to conference for the last fifteen years to help build the grand union which we've got today and i'm not gonna sit back and watch this UNK up for nobody for nobody
a lot of talks a lot of talks a lot of consultation is the order of the day
we don't want any hidden agendas
the cards have gotta be firmly put on the table
everybody's gotta be kept informed of the developments as the merger and the talks start to UNK
i'm gonna come back to the reservations because if this amalgamation with the transport and general workers goes through there's gonna be the inevitable casualties
yes casualties within this organization and nobody in this hall today can escape the possibility of the knife
long time officials lay officials staff at the organization you might as well face up to the fact colleagues a lot of you will have to go
there's gonna be mass redundancies within the organization mass UNK from the shop stewards through to the general UNK
regional
regional offices regional offices is gonna close
there's only gonna be the need for one UNK one head office
we're gonna have a surplus of national officers
some people say we've got them now
no just behave yourself
we're gonna have a surplus of UNK and dare i say it one of the general secretaries is gonna be made redundant
unless we take the cuts on board it's gonna be a waste of time discussing the possibilities of the UNK in the first place
cuts are gonna have to be made
and i want to remind you of the history of when UNK take place because a number of people have touched on that very point this morning
the larger union swallows up the smaller union and let's get it straight the t g are not taking the g m b over
we're talking about an amalgamation
yes look at a possible amalgamation recognize the many difficulties which lie ahead but remember also that the members and the activists within the g m b need to be kept fully informed of what the c e c are doing
i don't want to listen to any more of the media speculation telling me what's happening to our union
we have got to get involved
to UNK colleagues you've read the book now you can see the vision
the invasion of the body UNK
the d an the t g and the g m b
yorkshire region
president congress colleagues
thanks the UNK pinched part of me speech
this report highlights some of the changes that trade unions have already experienced over the recent years in attempts to explore a new style of trade unionism that is in tune with the needs of working people
a new style that will allow us to reach the year two thousand with a structure that is suitable for th a new century
the document details recent experiences of closer contact with the t g
it refers to exploring the scope for reducing or UNK of efforts and resources
this exploration of methods aimed at reducing expenditure while at the same time improving our service must be continued
and if these UNK point to an amalgamation with the t g or any other union then so be it
but before we consider any amalgamation with the t g we must ensure that our own house is in order
we must ensure that we know in which direction we are going
we must decide how the g m b will cope with dramatic changes that will have and will take place in the workplaces that we represent
we must examine in fine detail our own structure
how we re serve our members communicate with our members and ask ourselves the question do we give them what they want
have we coped with the very different needs demanded in small UNK of workers based in small shops or residential homes or private sports centres small offices or even individuals working on their own
our traditional recruitment base large factories are becoming a thing of the past
fourteen years of tory rule has seen to that
they have UNK our manufacturing base
to attract this new category of workers to the g m b our own of UNK servicing will have to change
quite possibly many of these people will not be represented at their workplace by a shop steward or lay representative
they will need advice direct from the nearest g m b office
the advice that they need will in all probability be a different nature to the normal required in large workplaces
to make the g m b relevant advice is going to have to be available over the telephone
with the advances in information technology answers to many questions could be delivered in minutes not just on industrial issues like how cold does it have to be before we stop work or how heavy a load should i lift but other questions not related to work that we have not always answered in the past
questions related to more social issues income tax social security etcetera could be answered using this system
g m b employees would need training enabling them to become experts in this field
perhaps eventually small drop in offices would be open in large towns or cities offering instant face to face access
of course these activities would run parallel to our existing system of servicing our more traditional workforce
i note that the c e c proposes to report back in nineteen ninety four g m b congress with an indication of what form the new union resulting from any such amalgamation might take
the report will hopefully address many of these issues that i have raised
proposed changes to the way in which we have traditionally served our members
UNK to new times UNK new concepts
this enables the g m b to say without fear of contradiction to any new partner our house is in order our structures are in place
this is the way forward
colleagues i look forward to the report to congress in nineteen ninety four
thank you
birmingham region
colleagues birmingham and west midland region
the birmingham region fully supports the c e c document and the amalgamation with the t g or any other trade union that will fit in and UNK our organization
it would be difficult indeed to argue against the t g being allowed to merge into the g m b this organization represents peoples who work in the same type of companies very often within the same workplaces that we work
the saving in officer time shop steward time and the fact that we fight one another for the same people to join our organization would be savings great indeed
the members who've joined the g m b over the past joined the g m b because in their opinion this was the best trade union in the u k and we are very proud of our heritage
and what we wanna say to the general secretary and the c e c that during the talks that there is one thing which must be maintained and that is the structure of the g m b the t g comes to join us on our terms
and if you thought you had a fight last year over bi annual UNK you wait until you try and do anything that will affect our structure in the future
i'll keep this brief
i think i've made the relevant points that others may have missed
most of what i wanted to say has already been said
the birmingham region supports
ask the general secretary to respond c conference
general secretary responding on behalf of the c e c er perhaps just the two motions first
two five the reason why the executive asked for withdrawal was because it's moving us a bit too fast along this track and it's moving us in a particular direction before we've had the time to think about whether that's the right direction to go
it may be that a UNK structure is either the best long term or the best short term structure
but we haven't got there yet and to give the answer before we've really considered the question is probably the wrong way round
we're not UNK into anything in fact all we're asking really is inviting you to agree that the c e c might go for a collective UNK with the t g to see the temperature of the water
so i hope in my remarks and i hope in the general tone of the debate there's enough to reassure london region that we need to move forward at a careful pace
we'll certainly ensure that the prospect and possibility of a UNK structure is one the matters which is considered by the c e c during the next few months and will form part of the report that comes back to congress next year
er the other motion is of course pointing to so many of the changes that are taking place in our industrial society which prompt us into building a new union
i hope that two eight can be referred so that discussion can be taken into account in determining the needs of members in the new world and therefore the design of the new union
now on the report itself and just a few quick points
the idea of course the vision is to create a better union not one that is exactly like us because er difficult for me to say so but we have got the occasional fault here and there
not one which is exactly like the t g
i won't even comment on their UNK because er it might be reported but something which is better than either
so how do we do it
well if we're going to move forward to that sort of union there are really only three unions in this country that can be used as the base for that new structure that new organization
g m b is one t g 's another and there's a third which i'm not going to name but most of you can probably guess
if they want to join us in this enterprise so much the better
it would make a better spread across the number of industries and services and if they join us it would help us all considerably
several delegates have talked about care
that's absolutely right and that's why the caution is there in the statement
the danger with all UNK is that two and two ends up by UNK three
the new union is less than the sum of the other two
our task is to try and make sure that two and two come out at five and the members get a better deal from the new union than they got from either of the UNK unions
timescale
well there've been some silly things said about this in the press and one or two by our colleagues elsewhere
this is not an enterprise that can be completed in a few months
if we were just gonna bolt together the two unions then that may be able to be done in a couple of years or so but if we're trying to build something better then we're talking about a project that takes place over several years
and that's why it's important that there needs to be an open debate both within the union and there needs to be a proper flow of information from the executive in these discussions to the branches and to the members to tell them what's going on
but of course then we get to an almost impossible task
i wish i had a pound for every time i have denied holding a meeting with the t g
those meetings haven't taken place but of course no one believes it because mis information is much more exciting than the truth
we will send regular reports
we hope the branches and members w will believe those reports because they will be the truth and not some of the more highly coloured statements which i'm sure will be put around from time to time
we're only suggesting a start on this project but the attitude of mind our mind in taking that particular step is important
several people have been er kind enough to remind me as general secretary and other people that we're all UNK
and so we are
we've really gotta start this project by thinking what is in the interests of the members
what is the best way forward for them
trade unionism has been failing in this country for the last fourteen years
there's no point in UNK it up
we've gotta change that failure round into success
so the starting point is what is best for the members
we'll come to the personalities and the positions later on along the track but first of all it's got to be the members
and there will be changes
there must be changes
but they will have to be the subject of consultation and debate and i guess that some of the debates will be really quite lively
so the beginning an important project
i hope that on the basis of the assurances given two five can be withdrawn
i hope two eight can be referred so that the content and discussion and the report it asks for can be part of these discussions
support the report and let's see if we can succeed in what must be the greatest enterprise in the trade union movement since the nineteen twenties
thank you
thank you very much indeed
could london agree to the withdrawal of the two five
london region
listen carefully to what the delegates have said on the report
i note most have got gr some reservations quite a lot of reservations o on the issue
all i can say is when you read that document carefully it's an open cheque for the c e c they can go and come back next year and give you a date for a merger
says no we're not gonna do that
but still if you read that carefully it doesn't say he ca that they can't do it the c e c so i urge you to vote for the motion two five
c e c position is therefore asking congress to oppose two five
all those in favour
against
two five is lost
motion two eight
c e c are asking for reference
midland region accept reference
thank you very much
does conference accept reference
thank you
special report
all those in favour
against
that's carried
thanks very much indeed colleagues
we now turn to a number of motions on g m b services
motion two seven shop stewards
lancashire region to move
g m b services northern region to move
two three one publicity liverpool region to move
shop stewards lancashire region motion two seven
lancashire region moving motion two seven
hang on a sec
colleagues if you are moving out move out very quietly please
congress if i asked the question is there a shop steward in the house i would've been confident to say yes but they all seem to be leaving
but i can safely say it today
but if i was to ask the same question throughout industry today the answer would be very different
a recent survey carried out by labour research shows that out of two thousand workplaces studied there was a marked decline in UNK
during the eighties the proportion of employees in union membership was down to forty eight percent in nineteen ninety from fifty eight percent in nineteen ni eighty four
this UNK story is reflected in the UNK of union representatives
our decline is widespread affecting workplaces of all types
what're we gonna do about it
well brothers and sisters i haven't got the answer
but if this motion is successful and a working party is established one of the conclusions that we might reach is that general secretaries should keep their UNK fingers off shops UNK commissions
i move
the seconder
lancashire region seconding motion two seven
colleagues i agree with everything just said
but talk about incentives
i believe the opposite is happening
there is an attack on the benefits and commissions
if some of this year's proposals are passed our members will receive less next year than they get now
three weeks ago i was invited down to a meeting of water workers
they were just dropped out of a union it just happens the one we're quite friendly with at the moment
they were UNK with the service and the benefits provided
i was asked if we join your union what will we get
i went on that morning to sell this union the benefits we provide
i recruited twenty one members that morning a few more to come i hope
i tell you colleagues am i glad that meeting was before this congress
now if i can hold on to these members depends on benefits being maintained not decreased that's not an incentive
commissions jesus colleagues can you imagine two branch secretaries eh
one on ten percent one on five i think i know who's gonna be happy
eh i don't know who comes up with these ideas i don't honest
but if that's an incentive they're not living in the real world
i often wonder if the people who come up with these proposals have any experience in recruitment
i doubt it eh
i tell you what might be the answer colleagues a UNK compulsory re recruitment campaign for these people
half five in a morning with the rain going down the back of your bleeding neck the police set upon you by the owner and the manager eh that'd UNK 'em up
eh
colleagues they wouldn't be too keen on cutting commissions then
eh i don't doubt
now sorry i've gotta laugh at that one myself
now i know they're trying to save i know they're trying to save money
yeah we know that
problem is we're trying to save this union
that's the difference
and i think they should have a vested interest in that
i really do
because if we the rank and file don't succeed we're all gonna go down the tube together
support motion two seven
thanks
motion two nine g m b services northern region to move
president congress northern region moving motion two nine
i think our union has changed dramatically over the last few years not to the point that our great history has been lost but we have UNK to the world in which we live
our education department has UNK a review which in return has produced quality materials and in turn quality stewards which meet the needs of all members
the health and safety department now known as the health and safety and environment department is UNK by other unions and has clearly responded to its own review
now congress i believe that we must adapt the considerable changes which have taken place in the last few years of tory UNK
our organization is crying out for high quality information to fulfil the demands made upon both full time and lay officials
this information is increasingly becoming of local nature c t and l m s make it difficult for our national research department to deal with local issues
at this point congress i should add that this motion is not an attack on our research department
more UNK for UNK
n h s local authorities multi UNK are all going down the road local bargaining
and what happens from district to district region to region is sometimes as far apart as john major and the british people
we know the reason local bargaining is being encouraged it's to lower wages and conditions and give rich financial benefits to the few
there is a rule for a central research point but again colleagues more is needed in the regions
our union has been without doubt the shining light in terms of what we offer to members
and we must continue to improve and better the information that is provided
the easiest way is to channel resources into the regions
a review by the c e c in my opinion would show that the agenda for the future will be local
bargaining will be local and research whatever nature or subject will have to be local to support our activists and officials
we can UNK that changes not made were not necessary but without looking ahead and of course responding we will leave our organization UNK and will lose out locally to others
please support this motion
seconder for two nine
president congress northern region seconding motion two nine
colleagues the service sub committee of the c e c has already initiated reviews of departments which offer support to national regional and lay officials
the outcome of the reviews have certainly taken into account the needs of the membership which of course means a better organization
i feel the time is now right to respond to local bargaining initiatives c t and l m s with a review of how the research department could best provide their services to the people at the sharp end
there is a need more than ever with many changes that are taking place for information to be provided quickly and effectively delivering to the point and value to our members
congress i therefore ask the c e c to immediately UNK a comprehensive review of the research department which with doubt without doubt has supplied excellent information in the past but i feel should be given the opportunity to fulfil and identify local needs of regions
our union more than ever needs a quick response service and hopefully this will be on the line if the review begins
please support this motion
i move
motion two three one publicity liverpool region
president congress liverpool north wales and irish region
colleagues in moving this motion i am seeking the c e c to give this union the credit it deserves when achieving victory for its members throughout with a wider publicity campaign through the media although if is on the television again tonight i think he's gonna have a higher rating than UNK street this week
under the section that i am a member of is the public sector the largest section of the union
we need bold headline posters in colour to identify what sections they represent so that we can give our members activist up to date information in advance of other comp competition and other unions
because of the competition we face from the new union unison we need application forms geared up to the particular industries that we require

did somebody say formally
thanks very much
colleagues the c e c wish to put a speaker in respect of motion two nine we're seeking reference i call
i hope that wasn't an UNK
midland and east coast region speaking on behalf of the c e c congress the c e c is asking you to support motions two seven and two three one but refer motion two nine
on pages one UNK six and one UNK seven of the general secretary's report reference is made to the c e c organization sub committee reviewing the work of the research department
this was done last year
the research department has followed the lines set by that review
it has shifted resources from routine servicing to policy development
investment has been made in online financial information services
this has UNK up the flow of information on companies to the regions
a great deal of progress has been made on equal rights
UNK guides on disability and harassment have also been produced as well as model agreements and other support services for officers
these have become key areas of the department's work
the department has directed much effort to european issues
the g m b's european officer has contributed a lot here and at the cutting edge in brussels
it has been recognized that the european directives are increasingly affecting what happens in the workplace
examples of this are these
acquired rights directive the health and safety and the forty eight hour week
back on the home front bargaining is shifting rapidly from the national arena to local level
it is recognized that g m b's resources need to reflect this
this especially applies to research services because they supply the raw material with which we work the information needed by the union to enable it to respond to the challenges which arise day by day
we must be constantly UNK and keep a sharp look out for new issues which need to be put on our agenda so that we can keep pace with the changes that affect our members and organization
the research department is the resource that is well placed to do this as demonstrated by the examples of equal rights and training
similarly ex the excellent output of the research department is essential to UNK effective responses to the ever more sophisticated management who constantly employ new techniques in human resource management and attacks on our members' pay and conditions
examples of this are of performance related pay
could you wind up please
yes which has sometimes been a pre cursor to de recognition
therefore the c e c is asking you to support motion two seven refer motion two nine and support motion two three one
thank you

i now call motion forty six rule twenty seven legal assistance
this is a c e c motion to be moved by
morning congress er speaking on er mm moving motion forty six on behalf of the executive
under er rule twenty seven the er central executive council UNK regional secretaries to provide legal assistance
er this usually consists of asking law firms who UNK in personal injury claims to represent our members in claiming compensation for occupational accidents and diseases
as the general secretary's report indicates last year members obtained about forty million pounds in compensation almost all of it through our regional solicitors
with the support of regional legal officers and a set of guidelines and codes of practice we ask the solicitors to UNK by regional secretaries ensuring that cases are pursued as UNK as possible with the members interests UNK at all stages
however regional secretaries despite our many wonderful skills cannot be litigation experts and run the cases
we rely on the good advice of our solicitors who advise us on the appropriate action to take
so when a solicitor recommends that a writ is issued we usually almost invariably UNK that step provided it falls within the guidelines
the same goes for medical reports and UNK reports and so on
and the same also applies when our solicitors report that having done th bes very best they can they cannot recommend that the union continues to finance the claim
try as we might we cannot win every case
with the best will in the world many cases have to be withdrawn or UNK each year
the question posed by motion forty six is this
when a regional secretary acting on the advice of the solicitor indicates that a case cannot be won and UNK legal assistance under rule twenty seven should the member be able to appeal against that decision
the c e c thinks not
decisions to UNK legal assistance under rule twenty seven are different from other decisions made within the union because they are invariably made on the express written recommendation of a specialist in law
appeals against UNK of legal assistance are unfair to regional committees to the appeals committee of the c e c and to the appeals tribunal
none of these bodies any more than a regional secretary is an expert in personal injury litigation
yet the appeal by definition asks them to second guess
could you wind up please
the advice of a barrister
they cannot do so and should not be asked to try
and what is the regional committee being asked to do
to refer the case back to the same solicitor who has reported that the case cannot now be won or refer it to a different lawyer
what happens if the new solicitor also recommends closure of the case
currently the member is able to appeal UNK
this is not sensible
president congress the c e c does not lightly bring forward a motion which limits the right of appeal but in these very special circumstances we feel it is both justified and necessary
i move motion forty six
thanks very much
is the motion seconded

could you formally pen it

colleagues i'd now like to extend a welcome to
is director general of the engineering employers federation
colleague any more UNK you can go through that door
now i'm telling you
except for a three year UNK to the ministry of defence most of his career has been spent in the motor industry
has been managing director of world wide sales for land rover and director of european group he was also a main board director with rover
joined the e f in july nineteen ninety two since when he had led the call for an industrial policy in britain
invite to address conference
president ladies and gentlemen
president thank you for that welcome
i must confess i was surprised curious and highly delighted when er you invited me to speak to you here today and er i'm very and sincerely pleased that you did
i am glad to be here
nevertheless i do feel a bit like UNK fifth or was it sixth husband on their wedding night
i'm er i'm pretty clear what's expected of me but not so certain that i know how to make it sufficiently interesting to achieve your UNK attention
now no doubt your UNK and certainly mine would be astonished to know how we can meet in this way but i wonder whether they'd approve
my guess is that they might not
indeed i'm not er sure that there aren't still members of both our organizations who believe that right now each of us is UNK with the devil
i don't see it that way at all but if they're right er i'd defend your invitation and my acceptance by quoting the old UNK better the devil you know
you must be the judges of whether or not i'm the devil or at least his representative but i hope you don't see me that way
if you do let me strike a deal with you straight away
i won't judge you by your past if you don't judge me by mine
it's time to take off the UNK suits and start talking real business
i'm here because i believe that we share many objectives and because i know that there's more that UNK us than UNK us
i'm sure that when you adopted your working together UNK you were not thinking that it included employers
but why shouldn't it
surely we all want to achieve the same objectives an end to recession low unemployment a UNK and fair economy good education training and health care
in short a stable and caring society in which everyone can live in reasonable comfort and security and to which everyone UNK according to their means
now i'm not so stupid to believe that we'll always necessarily agree on how those objectives should be met
but we should see where the common ground lies and having identified it we should build there and if we fail to do this we'll be failing both our groups of members
failing future generations and failing u k p l c and i'm sure you don't want to leave that legacy any more than i do
in this short talk i propose to concentrate just on two things
i'd like to talk about the needs for and the potential benefits of an industrial strategy and then i'd like to tell you how the employers view trades unions today
first industrial strategy
this is a topic which the e f has been promoting hard since last october
we've been doing so because we believe that without an industrial strategy u k living standards and status will sink quite quickly to those of a third world economy
we don't want that and i'm sure you don't want it either
for u k p l c to succeed in the years ahead we simply have to agree objectives UNK by the same map and aim at the same goals
now it's UNK going to be easy not least because it will require the politicians to be more cooperative and less UNK
it's simply not good enough for them to say as they have for the last forty five years elect us we'll change everything and then things will be alright
we need long term industrial policies that survive general elections and changes of government
how else will we ever have sustainable strategies for energy for transport or UNK
had we defined a UNK industrial strategy for the u k in the nineteen seventies would we be looking back now on twenty years of consistent industrial decline
had we a powerful industrial policy in the nineteen eighties would we be looking back now at a crisis of industrial investment in the nineteen nineties
if the u k is to be UNK competitive in the future we simply cannot afford to UNK such mistakes
now the chief purpose of an industrial strategy is to develop strategic thinking about our national industrial affairs and provide a common background against which the key decisions determining that future can be made
without the basic information and understanding market forces cannot be expected to function as they were intended
now we at the e f define an industrial policy as the development of a common understanding about the role of industry and the economy between industry government finance and education and about the direction of UNK and industrial progress
and by government i mean not just the government of the day but the opposition parties too
and it's this common understanding that many of our competitor countries possess and which we so sadly lack
without it the future of u k industry and of the economy as a whole will be in danger
let's take a UNK honest look at our current position
our manufacturing base is in long term decline UNK by the current recession
despite our success in improving productivity in the eighties there's an urgent need to rebuild belief and confidence in u k industry
we have a UNK trade deficit high unemployment and our productive capacity in manufacturing is simply too low
now our UNK problem is that our UNK to consume is about to exceed our total capacity to produce
despite the UNK of investment in the late nineteen eighties the long term trend is towards investing an ever smaller proportion of what we earn
our statistics show that we consume all that we're capable of producing yet we're investing less and less in new capacity to produce
in nineteen seventy two our manufacturing sector accounted for thirty two percent of gross domestic product
by nineteen ninety two it had fallen to just about twenty percent
and that matters because our existing capacity cannot maintain our national living standards and our balance of payments
and for too long we've been UNK into believing that manufacturing and industry had become UNK
in truth our future UNK and prosperity depend more than ever before on technology and industry
the potential for future economic growth depends partly on UNK in production technology to reduce costs and UNK on innovative products which create new markets in themselves
innovative products are an essential part of the process of economic growth providing new employment and not just in manufacturing
we must not forget that most economic growth even in service industries UNK from UNK innovation in the manufacturing sector
service industries are rarely able to improve their productivity service quality or UNK by their own efforts alone
they usually need new and improved or more affordable equipment and the future growth of service industries such as travel broadcasting and entertainment and increasingly in education and health care activities and environmental protection will depend upon continued technical innovation
now many people seem to think that technology means machines and equipment but machines and equipment and the software that run them are only the products of technology
technology is about the ability to produce goods and services UNK
it's therefore about people their skills their knowledge and their organization for cooperative activity
it takes time for industry to accumulate expertise to build teams and to establish a strong market position
to achieve industrial UNK normally requires decades of persistent activity not just a few years but it can be thrown away very quickly and very easily
strategic vision and consistency of policies by firms by their financial investors and by government are crucial and this cannot be achieved without a coherent sustained industrial strategy
the problem is the long term industrial strategy for prosperity is not a UNK thing
a long term industrial strategy does not produce profits tomorrow
it will not win votes tomorrow
at least that's what the politicians used to think
now i believe things are starting to change
the bad news on which i expect you'll agree with me is that across all parties the professional politicians have been letting us down for decades
they really don't know much about industry
they don't really care enough about industry and they certainly don't understand that our UNK are quite different from theirs
industry certainly needs to be high on the political agenda but like northern ireland policy the main parties must agree a mutual policy
industry is simply too important with too many people's jobs depending on it to be a party political UNK
let's build on the good news that heseltine and cook understand the need for a national industrial strategy
let's get industry out of party politics and make it a truly national priority
wouldn't that really benefit your members and mine
wouldn't that begin to ensure that the u k will be th in the UNK league in the twenty first century
now my second topic how do employers view the trade unions today
surprisingly you may find perhaps not so very differently from yourselves
we've both had to cope with two UNK and UNK immense change in that process
but it's because we accepted the challenge of change even though we may not have liked everything that went with it that we're here today
UNK yes but probably fitter too and more competitive
now trade unions have changed dramatically over the past ten years
you've down sized UNK looked at UNK and generally sought a new role just like the e f just like industry
a UNK in fact for management consultants and accountants
er speaking of accountants i must tell you that one of the UNK of my job is to be able to get out and about in the real world to real companies meeting real people
and a couple of weeks ago i was at a chemical engineering company where the managing director told me that they were now using accountants for their safety experiments instead of rats
erm you mi you might share my surprise when i heard that
so i asked him UNK on earth they were doing it and he said well there are three very simple reasons
first of all there are far more accountants around now than there are rats and er we were having great difficulty in getting hold of the rats and i thought well that sounds logical
the second er reason which he gave me of course i should have thought for myself he said but the accountants more accurately represented the human form than did the rats so that was a clear one to him but it was the third one that really UNK me when he told me that their staff had been getting really attached to the rats
now er now back to the main theme which is that you've become more business like in every sense of the word
you UNK much more readily with industry
we only have to look at some of the long term deals the single union deals and changed working practices to see that
they haven't all i accept been UNK with standing UNK and some unions have moved more quickly to accept change than others
it's the same too with some employers
but those changes were not met with the UNK and UNK attitudes of the past
that's because there's a new UNK
unions have turned professional serving their members' interests in the way that members or perhaps i should call them customers demand
you now offer a lot more than just negotiations on pay
you provide a wide range of personal services and you take a keen and active interest in important issues such as health and safety child care training and the environment
and we agree with you on many of them
many of the changes sad but true came about through recession particularly the first one
we lost a third of the workforce in my industry mainly in UNK and semi skilled posts many companies went bust and others were cut down in size dramatically
but that recession also brought about the improvements in industrial relations which we see today
the companies and the UNK that came out of it we were far UNK more committed and more aware of the need for change than their UNK had ever been
UNK took steps in a variety of forms to improve communications with employees
and unions became less sensitive about companies communicating directly with employees
unions also started to accept the kind of deals that are UNK today
in short we started to work together
now the recession that we're emerging from right now hopefully has been quite different
it hit sectors and people who largely escaped before the skilled the clerical workers the managers and the professionals who've been badly UNK this time and where last time around er the service sector was expanding to UNK up some of those who'd lost their jobs in manufacturing this time the service sector too has been in deep trouble
now it always takes a crisis to bring people here talking to you today and i'm very glad to be able to do so our people and more so the craftsmen within that particular UNK our people and more so the craftsmen within that particular UNK at their request
and we're taking a lot more time talking to the labour party and not only at their request again
the big issue is UNK and expanding our manufacturing base to ensure that we remain a UNK country
but there's another big issue one that unions and employers have got to tackle to clear the ground for greater cooperation between us and that's the still passive acceptance of the them and us syndrome
and yes it's still there in places
i'm not sure why because without realizing it we've something else very much in common
we're all employees
i'm an employee of the e f in the same way that is an employee of g m b in the same way that managers and staff are all employees of the companies they work for in the same way that your rank and file members are all employees in the same way that your full time officials are all employees
when we come to think about it there are very few owner occupiers around these days
now if we can work together on solving this one we'll find it much easier to work on some of the others
and where we've got to work together right now is to ensure that the u k stays competitive
now i know our views on this will differ somewhat but even the european commission has publicly expressed its concern just recently over the levels of unemployment across europe and about the international UNK of european industry compared with the rest of the world
and that's why the e f not alone but together with our colleagues in engineering UNK organizations throughout europe german the french the UNK the dutch argued against the working time directive in its original form
that draft er approved by the social affairs council a week ago does not allow the flexibility for companies and their employees to determine working time arrangements at local plant level but we do question the e c's involvement in this area
working time including overtime should be decided by local voluntary agreement and i do emphasize the word voluntary
president one final point
remaining competitive in this world particularly when so many countries are also in recession means keeping a tight UNK on costs
i know that many of you and your colleagues have been under great pressure during our own recession to UNK wage claims and to accept deferred or even zero settlements
but my message today is straightforward
we've got to continue that restraint even as things start to get better and that means UNK from the top to the bottom from board room to shop floor
the prize of long term success is too precious to throw away for UNK short term benefit
mr president at the beginning of my address i said that we would see where the common ground lies
let's find it and better still let's build on it
thank you for your attention and for the warmth of your welcome today
thank you very much indeed for that er address
colleagues can we now turn to recruitment a number of motions motion two three six recruitment birmingham region to move motion two three seven lancashire region to move composite four recruitment for the unemployed midland region to move motion two four two accrued membership rewards liverpool to move motion two four three recruitment procedure liverpool
i call birmingham region to move two three six and again colleagues if supporting speakers could come down to the front it will assist
birmingham and west midland region moving motion two three six on recruitment
during the seventies unions were reporting record membership
indeed our own region birmingham west midland had a membership in excess of one hundred thousand members
in the seventies life was UNK for all trade unions and everyone within the organization felt secure
every cloud had a silver lining
nothing could go wrong and all unions especially the g m b had the UNK touch
but in nineteen seventy nine things did go wrong
UNK was born and during the last decade there has been record redundancies and UNK within the u k as a whole
unfortunately many were trade union members who lost their jobs and have not retained their union membership so have been lost to our organization
we now find g m b offering nineteen seventy style benefits to a nineteen ninety style membership
the effect on us that every year our general secretary during the finance debate asks congress to approve increases in contributions
this is a situation that cannot and must not continue
it is a recipe for disaster
so what can be done to UNK the balance
two things
one retain the membership we have
two recruit new members
if the g m b could reg retain the unemployed and redundant it would give a solid base on which to work
it is no good signing up a new member and then losing two others
that's one step forward two steps back
the result of that is UNK foundations
the way forward then is to recruit and the importance of new members was never more critical than it is at this time
too many people still see union membership as belonging to a UNK organization
old images die hard
people still see unions as wage UNK and nothing else
so how does the g m b best get over the message to the UNK non members because unions have progressed a long way since our founder will UNK collected UNK in a bucket
the need to sell our organization and the services and expertise that can be offered such as legal advice and representation advice on social security benefits education
we have our own colleges and run courses on all kinds of subjects
health and safety where information on this wide ranging subject is available our own department skilled in occupational pensions advice on personal pensions through our own bank unity trust
in fact expertise in a whole range of subjects too numerous to mention
president in this motion i have tried to outline things that could be important and useful in recruiting drive
but it mustn't just be left to the activists to recruit
our national office must help by better media coverage bringing to non members attention what we have to offer and how useful it is to belong to a trade union
if the right approach is used in a positive way success will follow
president colleagues i move
is there a seconder
formally seconded thanks very much
motion two three seven lancashire region
president colleagues lancashire region moving motion two three seven
the subject of proper union organization in the taxi trade is very important to our branch and as i'm sure you will appreciate recruitment is difficult when little g m b recruitment literature UNK to the taxi trade
existing recruitment literature deals with employed persons within the workplace and the values of union organization when negotiating with the employer for proper wages workers' rights and benefits
none of the above UNK to the taxi trade as the trade is predominantly self employed
there are three hundred and sixty seven local authorities in england and wales who are authorized to licence and administer the taxi trade in their respective areas
although these authorities work within the framework of central government legislation their interpretation of this legislation is not always correct and is often UNK and to the UNK of the trade its members' income and working conditions
the treatment that is received from councils by the trade is UNK and UNK and often UNK and UNK
the taxi trade is desperately in need of organization in order to improve conditions for the workers employed UNK and therefore national recruitment is necessary in order to begin that organization
recruitment literature needs to convince the taxi trade that proper organization can and will improve their working conditions and that by being members of a recognized trade union who have expertise in dealing with local authorities the trade will benefit
recruitment will ideally contain enough information to convince the taxi trade of the benefits of strong membership when dealing with representation at local level and long term advantages of being a member of the g m b when dealing with national issues
working conditions of the taxi driver are extremely poor and could be UNK to victorian times hours worked are ra rarely less than sixty per week there is no holiday pay no pension rights no sick pay and no say in which way the trade is UNK by local authorities
how many in the g m b are working under similar conditions
i guess not many that are sat in this room
so you can see the need for proper organization and the need for increased support from the union
we must get the trade organized and on the way to improved working conditions
however before these aims can be achieved we first of all have to recruit and this as i said before cannot be done without literature required
if passed this move will be the first step on the way to mass recruitment and organization within the trade
as we have heard earlier on this week in the general secretary's report on the financial position of the union the money generated by this recruitment in the taxi trade will i am sure be greatly received
i urge conference to support this motion
thank you very much
thanks
is there a seconder
formally seconded thanks very much
composite four recruitment of the unemployed midland region to sec er move and second
is it gonna be formally seconded
president congress midlands and east coast region moving composite motion four
colleagues it is with a mixture of sadness disappointment and UNK that this motion is required to be brought before congress today
the wrong that unemployed people are not allowed to join this great union is a wrong that must be UNK today
there can be fewer more UNK experiences in life than to be thrust from a situation of regular employment with all the UNK that this UNK to becoming an enforced member of UNK the unemployed the situation with a total lack of dignity ask anyone who tries to claim benefits the situation with a loss of social standing and frustration at UNK ambitions
we hope that sooner or later the philosophy that classes people as mere units of labour will be UNK to the dustbin of history which it deserves
UNK competition of dog eat dog policies must surely give way to positive employment policies and achieve what desired a society set free from UNK
but what of today
where can a person turn to for advice support and encouragement
to its shame not certainly at the moment to the g m b we don't want you
no job no membership
that is the message
politically we cannot allow this situation to exist any longer
imagine the situation on the floor of the house of commons
the labour party in a rare attack on unemployment through john smith is confronted by the usual UNK smart UNK tory minister
his reply but mr smith even your own union does not even allow the unemployed to join
where is the compassion
where is the concern
what embarrassment
i understand that the c e c are asking for reference of this composite
i hope that they reach a decision sooner than later a decision to allow the most UNK members of our society to join us
finally you will note that the motion provides that membership at the reduced rate will not be a UNK drag on the union
i move
whilst the seconder is coming to the rostrum colleagues perhaps i could advise conference of what the position is at the moment concerning the programme
we're certainly going to UNK again at lunchtime today because i do want to get section secretary's report in and the certainly the special motion on swan hunter ship building limited so i will take the remainder of the recruitment motions report and certainly the special motion
president congress midlands and east region seconding composite motion four
i recognize that it represents a major change in policy to even consider the idea of recruiting the unemployed but i understand the c e c for looking for referral and we will be happy with that this year
what prompted the submission of thi the motion is the growing feeling of UNK and UNK among the unemployed particularly the union unemployed in this country who many never have had a job
once the labour movement offered hope and support to these people
they now have no ch no voice there is only one way to counter this
we the g m b have got to offer them that support
the long term consequences of the current do nothing policy are easy to predict
we'll have ha we will have been an UNK irrelevant to them for so long that when they do find another job or even a first job then we will have a major task to convince them of the value of trade union membership
it is in our own interests to create a profile amongst the unemployed
think about it
an unemployed member now could be a full member in the near future possibly in firms where we have previously had no members
there is another dimension to this motion that needs to be considered
if we continue to ignore these people especially the young we may be fighting them in the near fu future as they are actively being targeted by the far right british national party and other fascist organizations that are using this sense of UNK
we will have to offer an alternative to the crap that they are UNK
we have to offer support and above all we have to offer hope
UNK does not begin with the concentrations camps that's where it ends
it begins in social conditions exactly like those in britain now
let's ha let's offer the unemployed an alternative
please consider the implications of not acting on the motion very carefully
thank you
motion two four two liverpool region
formally moved
is it formally seconded
formally referred
motion two four three liverpool region
liverpool north wales and irish region
president congress the ex er we believe the executive are accepting motion two four three but we believe it should be UNK at congress today
surely it is better that new members feel that they are members of an organization which deals with them in a more personal basis and are not just another number
each member of our union is an individual and deserves the recognition of their status as an equal partner in our great union both for their own self esteem and as means of demonstrating our respect and encouragement for that person to play their role in the affairs of the union
with the establishing of sections it is vital that the members no the member knows what avenues are open to them and what facilities and rights they have and how to utilize them and contribute to the running of the union
with the facility of computers it is possible as shown by other unions as well as forward looking branches of our own to communicate with members on a personal basis
this approach is never more important than when a person first joins any organization
you only have to have w you only have one opportunity to make a first impression er make a first impression
so why not do it then
given that the member will be sent their membership card it would seem a small step away to actually send them a letter addressed to them personally welcoming them to the union and advise them at the very least on the basic facilities and benefits plus other important information and signed by the regional secretary if not by the general secretary
to inform them of who to contact if they have a problem plus benefits discounts UNK etcetera with particular emphasis on UNK benefits that may be lost if membership UNK and the possible mention of loyalty benefits that may assist them in helping to recruit and retain other members
with the system correctly set up the whole process can be completely completed automatically by the use of technology and it could be set up UNK upon receipt of a membership application
surely a massive aid to recruitment and retention
my region asks you to support motion two four three
thanks very much

thanks very much
the c e c wish to put a speaker into the debate
i call
president congress lancashire region speaking on behalf of the c e c congress the c e c are asking you to support motion two three six support motion two three seven seek a referral of composite four referral of motion two four two and ask you to support two four three
colleagues motion two three seven calls for the union to recruit within the UNK taxi trade
but whilst there's clearly a high degree of non UNK labour in the trade the union needs to assess the potential benefits of committing resources in this area given the UNK often temporary nature of the workforce
the c e c are to seek a referral of composite four
we already reviewed our position on the recruitment of unemployed people as outlined in a new concept of trade unionism prepared and specially prepared for this congress
we do not wish to pre judge this review and therefore ask for the composite to be referred
we also ask that motion two four two be referred
the motion contains several interesting ideas which the c e c would wish to examine in its review
therefore to summarize congress the c e c are asking you to support motions two three six and two three seven seek referral of composite four and motion two four two for the reasons outlined
and finally ask you to support motion two four three
thank you
thanks very much
propose to take the vote conference of motion two three six
as has indicated we are seeking acceptance

well thanks president for that welcome and thank you colleagues congress for the welcome that you've given to me
national office moving pages hundred and fourteen to hundred and twenty four including report
the engineering industry has continued in decline for the past year
the lack of an industrial policy by this government UNK on market forces and short term investment policies have undermined an industry at the heart of the british economy
the most worrying feature of this decline has been the failure of the industry to train people
that's why the unions in engineering have developed a training for engineering strategy
extensive consultations have taken place and are now complete and the document is ready for publishing
i hope that employers government and trainers themselves will treat it as a serious attempt by the trade unions to contribute to the debate on training for the industry
the ship building industry has also been in decline for a decade or more and in each year's report has UNK well that decline
a decline that's under circumstances when we're still an island nation still dependent upon shipping to UNK export and import most of our goods
it must be acknowledged there was between nineteen seventy nine and nineteen eighty four a UNK in the ship building industry followed by a UNK in world sea borne trade
however in nineteen eighty four the market began to improve until in nineteen ninety one we saw record orders placed and although that's UNK out orders still UNK production
along with these improvements in the market we see demands for UNK safety concern for the environment all oil UNK have highlighted the need to have modern ships with the right design
coupled with this an increased exploitation of marine resources fishing industry gas and oil UNK by UNK culture and UNK mining
all creating for the next decade and beyond opportunities for a ship building industry
are we the united kingdom going to be able to exploit those opportunities
has the ship building industry UNK with europe perhaps to enable it to be at the forefront
has the government got a policy to assist
has it a policy to enable the naval UNK to UNK into merchant ship building
the UNK no
instead we're seeing the cynical deliberate closure of UNK ship builders the refusal to allow camel UNK retained ship building on the UNK by re UNK them to allow the intervention and of course we've seen the employees encouraged to enter into fight to death competitions which have UNK the industry competitions that have clearly caused the UNK of swan hunters
before that contract for the helicopter support ship was awarded i think we all knew well that whoever didn't get it was in trouble and that of course is why we never took sides
but i think we were surprised of the speed of the UNK at UNK on tyneside
so the fight is on to save ship building on tyneside
firstly i must pay re tr tribute and say how proud we are at the way that our people in tyneside have responded to the crisis
hear
shop
shop stewards officials mps and the community have worked at hundred mile an hour going to wherever necessary in order to save ship building on tyneside and swan hunters
we as a union along with the s n c of the UNK do and should give UNK and total support to this campaign
and as a first step we should demand three things essential to give any chance to retain ship building on tyneside
the three UNK must be allowed to be completed by swan hunter
the government must give the necessary guarantees to enable the UNK order to be placed
the intervention fund must be available to enable swan hunters and other naval ship yards to UNK into merchant ship building
this would have saved camel UNK and it's a must to save swan hunters
colleagues i commend this report to you
thank you
turn to report page one four one five one six one seven one eight one nine one two o one two one two one two one two three and one two four
colleagues i now call the mover of the special motion swan hunter ship building limited to be moved on behalf of the c e c and seconded by
president congress northern region moving the c e c's special motion on swan hunter
if only could have stayed behind to hear this being said he could've taken a lot of messages back to his friends in government
president there are two types of UNK in our country one totally protected by our government the other faces UNK by the same government
the UNK that we are concerned about build ships on the river UNK
congress since the middle ages since the nineteenth century swan hunter has played the leading role in british UNK history
during those years it has built over two thousand seven hundred ships including four hundred war ships for the royal navy
they've developed a reputation as one of the world's leading ship builders
president since swan hunter returned to the private sector in nineteen eighty six workforce management trade unions have worked together to produce the world's UNK war ships and one of the world's UNK yards
millions of pounds have been spent on research and developing flexible working practice have been introduced
a model for any manufacturing industry
swan hunters is not as the trade and industry minister described an out of date UNK industry of yesterday
no congress swan hunter is a modern hi tech high skilled state of the art manufacturing facility
a modern ship yard built on the hard work and the dedication of tyneside workers
the same workforce mr president who during the UNK crisis worked day and night to produce the ships needed by the british navy
the same workforce mr president that today despite years of hard work dedication and commitment stand to lose all
the result of yet more tory neglect and economic UNK
congress the UNK employment consequences of tyneside should swan hunters be allowed to close would be disastrous a UNK from which i believe tyneside might never recover
some experts have already predicted that job losses could exceed six thousand
that remembering in an area that already has the worst unemployment record in mainland u k president the prospect for tyneside should UNK close is too bleak to UNK
the workforce at swan hunters have never asked for any special UNK they've always asked for a fair deal on a level playing field
but what they do ask for and what we should be calling to this government to honour the existing contracts at swan hunters to allow the workers at swan to complete the work on the three vessels already in the river
in addition the northern region calls for a full open and more importantly independent investigation into the tendering arrangements for the l p h we demand a full UNK commitment from this government that swan hunters be given a fair chance to tender for future navy work
president the whole economic af future of tyneside stands at this minute in the balance
in fourteen years the northern region alone has lost over two hundred thousand manufacturing jobs and when a fella visiting us today says that we're all workers i remember telling me that we di might eat all out the same UNK but by the hell they have bigger UNK than we have
president the northern regions a UNK future and congress our demands are simple
we call upon the government to demonstrate the same dedication and commitment as the workforce at UNK
we call upon them to demonstrate their commitment to manufacturing to quality skills to engineering excellence to demonstrate that commitment to ship building a at tyneside before it's too late and you know they can do that this week
they can do that by UNK the decision on the orders from UNK
they can do that on the decision that the UNK will be finished on the UNK
congress i urge you to support the UNK workforce support the people on tyneside and do all that's in your power to retain ship building on the UNK
support the c e c's special motion and before i move that congress i'll accept in UNK that the general secretary will double the pocket collection that we have outside the door
congress i move
thanks very much indeed
the general secretary's not here so i'll agree to it
right
c e c technical craft section seconding the c e c motion on swan hunter ship builders limited
i must start off by highlighting a sad position in my o my own region and that's the UNK of camel UNK another once great ship building company
camel UNK is now owned by b s e l who two and a half years ago announced the run down of camel UNK unless another buyer was found
next month july that run down will be complete
how UNK that b s e l are also the company that have won the order that swan hunters were hoping for to keep their workforce employed
because that order was lost UNK are now in the dire position that the motion highlights
it's a position that's only too familiar to myself as an ex member of the camel UNK workforce
two thousand six hundred direct jobs and another estimated two and a half thousand indirect jobs will have been lost in the last two and a half years by the closing of camel UNK
UNK like UNK was designated a naval yard and therefore intervention fund and for the e c with the UNK of the peace dividend those yards designated naval yards cannot compete with the merchant yards who receive the intervention fund which is basically a subsidy that allows european yards to compete on a level plain with UNK in the far east
two and a half years ago camel UNK started a campaign to gain access to the intervention funding and because of the total lack of any sort of industrial policy by this government and their refusal to support the camel UNK application to the e c next month will see the closure of camel UNK which will lead to a loss of skills that amounts almost to a criminal act on the part of this government who seem prepared to allow this country to become a skill free zone in order to drive down wages and conditions to a rate comparable with some third world countries
it would appear from investigations that this government in nineteen eighty four did a deal with the e c to close down UNK in future years for which they received millions of pounds from e c funds and they never used them for the purposes they were supposed to be used for
this led to the closure of n a s n e s l you may have seen the t v programme on this piece of industrial UNK
and for the same reason camel UNK could not gain intervention funding
for two and a half years camel UNK have UNK for intervention
now we have UNK caught in the same trap
they can't afford such a long delay or they will become like camel UNK an UNK breed
this UNK this government should support an application for all british yards to be given access to the intervention funding or shortly there will be no major ship building facilities at all in the u k and hopefully no john ma the i john major either
i therefore second this motion and ask congress to support
put the emergency motion to the vote
all those in favour
against
it's carried unanimously

bill morris
early this morning colleagues you may recall that from the south western region came to the rostrum and made a point concerning black wednesday
what he's asking for is that any references to that particular disastrous day is not referred to as black wednesday but in fact as UNK day
some pe it's given offence to some people
so if we could remember that would be appreciated
colleagues immediately after the close of this particular session there is to be a meeting in the conference hall within the UNK on the national trade union laws on national UNK alert day and there's to be a special video which will last approximately eleven minutes
colleagues you can purchase you can purchase UNK of all the various different sessions and indeed all your own speeches if you want to remind you th how good they are or how bad they are
you can purchase them in the hall
conference stands adjourned till two p m thanks very much
yes
well i was born at in nineteen eleven
so it's quite a long while ago and i've travelled round quite a bit since then
my father was a methodist minister
so we moved round every three or at the most four years and er we we've been up in scotland and er yorkshire lancashire and down east anglia
and er it wasn't until he came up to a er in the UNK circuit when i was eighteen that's when i started nursing
and erm i ca i came to in the first place because it was the best teaching hospital in the midlands at that time
and er it was near home as well so i should be able to get home for days off
that was the main thing
oh was that was nice
erm could you tell me about your father being a methodist minister
he was he just moved on from time to time or were they voluntary moves
no er in the methodist er UNK circuits they move them on they're invited for three years
least they were at that time
and then at the end of the three years you were either invited to stay an extra year or s you were you were sort of er you had an invitation from some other circuit
to go there
they used to send the stewards round and er you you'd suddenly see two new people in the congregation and they'd come to hear the minister UNK to see if he was a good preacher and then they'd go back to report
a and then he would either have an official invitation or should hear no more about it
but that was very difficult from th the children's point of view
there were there were two erm boarding schools for methodist UNK children
there was for boys and for girls
er and you could go to a boarding school but if you didn't you were moved round every three or four years at the most to a different school
er and my brother went to a boarding school but i didn't
and i've it was always a big handicap because the UNK at different schools were different
you'd go to a school where they'd been doing french or latin for two or three years and you hadn't done any at all
it was very difficult
so i can't really say my school days were the UNK days they certainly weren't
mm
was there any reason why your brother was sent to a boarding school but you weren't
well not really
boys in those days they were always given the best education
girls it wasn't nearly so important that they should be er an and also i don't think my parents thought i was really worth UNK
they didn't think i was very bright or very UNK
i was a very er quiet child and er very little self confidence
i think that was a lot of it
and they didn't expect very much of me from my school reports and i thought well if they didn't expect i you know i wasn't capable of it
and it wasn't really until i left school and er went into nursing that i thought now this is something i'm starting on ev even with everybody else
er and something i really wanted to do and really enjoyed
th that's where i really started in and sort of showed what i was made of
i could come out top in my exams then when i never did at school i never did anything much at school at all
do you think this was er special to your family that you were treated as you weren't a UNK one or do you think that was the way girls were generally treated
i think it was largely the way most girls were treated
th you know it was just the sort of it all changed after the first world war and completely changed after the second world war
before then you were sort of you were a girl
you stayed at home and helped in the home until you were old enough
then you got married then and that was sort of the sum total of it
and it wasn't really until after the first world war when things really sort of er got started and er women sort of carried on and they do take jobs and UNK er that they sort of really came into their own
and certainly during the second world war where they kept things going an and could prove that they were as good as any man
but even until ooh when i can remember my daughter when she er was going to university
there were certain subjects that they said keep off because it doesn't matter how clever you are
it doesn't matter how good a degree you get
it will go for nothing
if a man applies and he even if he hasn't got as good qualifications as y as you've got you won't have a stand an UNK
the man will always get the job
well that has changed a lot now and i think it i it is a good thing as well
do you think you were conscious as a child at the difference between the way your brother was treated and the way yourself
no
i think i just accepted it
he was younger than i was
er he was a delicate baby and i was always the UNK one and i was always expected to give in to him and sort of UNK him an he was always sort of put first
i never minded at all
no
it didn't bother me
i think most people were the same in those days
did you have to help around the house when you were a child
not a great deal
we were expected we did we were expected to keep our own rooms tidy
and make our own beds but not a great deal
you see in those days i people i servants were so you could get servants so easily ev even if you didn't have somebody living in er you you'd have a daily person
they saw to all the washing up
er and that sort of thing
but no we weren't expected to do a lot in the house
mm
so did you generally have a daily lady to come and help or
yes
we did
when we were about nine and ten and a half we had somebody living in because there were an awful lot of evening meetings that my father had to go to and usually mother went with him
which meant we'd always got somebody in the house sort of baby sitting really
that that's her main she used to sort of look after things and baby sit for us in the evenings
ha have you got any particular memories of your earliest childhood
not a great deal
i can remember we were at in lancashire
that was during the first world war i should be i suppose about five then
er we er my father was UNK to a big military hospital there
and it was always sort of open house and the nurses used to come in when they were off duty a lot
and oh the soldiers the wounded soldiers they used to come as well
you could always tell who they were
they had sort of er rather pretty blue er suits they used to wear with white shirts and red ties
you could always tell they were they were er they'd been wounded and they were i in hospital by their dress
and they used to come in a lot
an and i think of course we were made quite a fuss of too
er and i don't know whether that was where i got my first idea of being a nurse
i never wanted to be anything else but a nurse
it was the one thing i always wanted to do
i never wanted to do anything it never entered my head to do anything else
er so whether i UNK got it from there i don't really know i may have done
yes
were there any other family UNK influences at all in this line
i know on your wall here you have a lovely portrait of your grandfather and grandmother
yes
th they influenced my life a lot
my mother died when i'd be about eleven
and er course summer holidays we always used to go and spend them with granny and granddad
they had retired and they lived down at UNK so it was a lovely place to go for summer holidays
and we always used to go there
er and they did they influenced they influenced er me a lot a lot really and i suppose they did my brother as well
but er we could always ask granddad if we wanted to know anything
how babies were born or anything
we always go and ask granddad
and he'd never tell us he he'd never he'd always tell us as much as he thought we could accept
he was very modern really for his age fo for er the time he lived in really
cos in those days they didn't
i mean it just wasn't talked about
you girls used to get married in those days and they were extremely innocent they'd really no idea at all
and yo when i look back an and er and think of even when i first started nursing a lot of the girls we used to get in they thought if they UNK a man they were going to have a baby
they were very innocent
but er things have changed a lot these days
yes
what kind of job did your grandfather do
ah he was a he was a headmaster at a methodist school at in yorkshire
and er he'd worked his way up as a teacher then he was a headmaster
and even then i would have sa thought he was very up to date
he used to have very definite ideas of er how to treat children
i don't know whether the UNK would have agreed with him
but i know i could remember being taken round his school and in the main hall he'd got a glass UNK cupboard and he'd got all sorts of well really and truly they were just pretty UNK
i don't think they were anything much more than that
but they were all for certain things and i remember one er was for anybody who UNK
and he'd got a boy who did UNK and he always used to go to granddad before er he when he came to school before lessons and he'd give him this UNK and he'd say now you can put it in your pocket
but always hold it keep it and if you're holding that stone you won't UNK
and he didn't
and he got so he could gradually do without it and he never UNK again
most amazing thing
did he
probably you know lack of self confidence or something like that
but it did the trick
yes
did he have other UNK er which had other UNK
was this what the UNK were for
he may have done
i really don't know but i do remember that one
i remember him telling me about that stone
mm
you said that your grandmother played quite a part in your UNK after your mother died
yes
well she taught me to knit and she taught me to do a lot of UNK and that sort of thing
she did certainly influence me in that way
but erm i still do i still do a lot of knitting
i can't do any UNK nowadays but i do i UNK i'm never st er i've never er stopped enjoying knitting
it's always been a hobby with me
and then she did a lot of UNK
you don't hear that these days
erm and we never knew how she did it she never had told anybody how she did it died with her i'm afraid
but everything she everything she did always had some UNK on
she never did anything jus just plain
it was amazing really and even she was eighty two when she died and even then she was knitting her own UNK suits
and UNK
even the UNK cover had an UNK on it
it was amazing
she'd ge nothing everything she did she had to sort of UNK it and put some UNK on it
i take it that she didn't have a job as well
no
no
no
in those days women didn't seem to take part time jobs or jobs at all
i think if they did anything it was sort of charity work
er and they did a lot of sewing for UNK at church and that sort of thing
but er i don't really remember erm people going out to work much ex except i suppose you'd call them the lower classes or not really the working classes because er but the lower classes they would take in washing
er or they'd go out UNK and go you know work the we used to have a woman come in once a week to do the washing
she'd come in and do the washing in the morning and if it was a nice bright day she'd iron in the afternoon
for the whole family
er and other er women would you know you'd take it to them an and they'd do it in their own homes
and it would come back already done
but other than that i don't think women didn't do much i mean even in shops the men were the shop assistants nearly always
so you didn't get women going out nothing like not like they do these days
and when you went to school can you remember what wh that was like
well i was never very happy at school
i never seemed to be sort of up to the other UNK at all
but er it was the discipline was very much UNK than it is er today
er nowadays so many things are just accepted that in those days they wouldn't be
i can remember one girl i mean the great sin was to steal anything and er they'd found in her UNK somebody else's pencil
now whether it had got there by mistake we never knew but there was no question she was absolutely just dismissed on the spot
sent home and that was it
but er any UNK or anything like that ooh it was erm it just wasn't accepted at all
it was a terrible crime
whereas now i mean it's a case of if you lose anything it's your own fault for putting it down
it's a terrible state of affairs really
it's not improved at all
and of course the discipline in the classroom er it was very strict
there was UNK never any talking in class
i mean it was you were sent out of the room
did you as children think that was fair
oh yes we did
yes we went to school to learn and we were told not to talk
if we talked well we expected it
er there wasn't anything like the well not to the schools that i went to the UNK punishment that there seems to have been since
er it w i don't ever remember anyone you know getting the cane or anything like that
we did have lines hundred lines i must do not do this or something like that which was very negative really
be far better if they told us to do something sensible
but er i it took your time up when you know when you might have been enjoying yourself
but erm no we expected we accepted the discipline
we were told not to do a thing if we did it well you knew what you were up against
er i think far more than they do now
they don don't seem to take notice of what the teachers said
er and i think perhaps teaching i don't know whether it's different today but they seemed to UNK in us the love of poetry and the love of literature and that sort of thing
i've always been grateful for that they did you know create th this love of poetry
i've never lost it
and i still like a lot of the UNK an and the good the good english
but er nowadays they sort of i don't know it's different
did you have the variety of subjects that children have today
er well i suppose we did but they were different
i er we had latin and french mainly
erm then we had all the usual maths and english erm history and geography
er i think we learnt it probably in different ways we learnt it more UNK fashion than they do today
but i mean when it comes to times tables that sort of thing i've never been sorry i learnt those
i think a lot of schools do still teach the t the children their tables which i think is a good thing
you never forget them
but erm there was not the UNK
you were taught plain sewing and that sort of thing but that was about all
to UNK and an and to UNK
but erm n not the UNK that they teach them now at school
i say i should think really and truly er schooling today is more fun than it was
we'd it was very serious in our day but now it's much more fun
they enjoy it more
they do all sorts of erm projects that we never did
er were the boys taught different things from the girls in some subjects
yes
they i mean UNK they had UNK
th only boys did it and UNK only the girls that did it
er you sort of got a basic idea of UNK
and of course UNK but erm they were mainly the i suppose they were giving you a good er UNK as they'd call it in those days
mm
er can you remember when you were a small child erm what sort of things you did at UNK at school
the kind of games you played
well i suppose w we yes we used to have erm UNK th different seasons
i can't remember the seasons now the different seasons brought out different games
there was UNK er and then all of a sudden everybody would start with UNK
you couldn't do that these days the UNK too bad but we used to have wooden UNK or we'd have er iron UNK
er and then skipping ropes that was another thing
er they there were seasons for all these things and then erm balls we used to used to play balls up against the walls
er but er th oh and tops that were another thing
yes spinning tops
with UNK
we used to there used to be little wooden tops
and then we used to make UNK patterns of the top and then when they went UNK round they used to look very pretty
and we used to see how who could keep them going the longest
and did both boys and girls play these games
they UNK yes
erm th tops
girls mainly skipping i don't remember ever seeing any boys skipping
the girls usually had the wooden UNK and the boys the iron UNK
erm but other than that yes they didn't th they'd play more a sort of football the boys would
we'd play just with ordinary er sort of tennis ball size that type of ball
but other than that yes we did more or less all play the same games
and we used to have long skipping ropes too
we used to be sort of er almost like a erm a clothes line
you used to go sort of right into the road almost across the road a side road
and you'd have two turning one each end and you'd get four five or even six people all skipping in the middle
at the same time
yes
can you tell me about your brother
what did your brother go on to do later
er well he went he went er he was erm for quite a while he was er he had chow dogs
he was breeding chow dogs and then he went t on to erm er he went to a poultry farm for a time
and then when the war came he er he was one of the first bevan boys that one of the boys that went down the mines to relieve the miners
er well that didn't last very long he wasn't really cut out for that sort of thing at all
he was more of a UNK type
then he went in for er for teaching afterwards
er and then he went to UNK he was there for quite a long while after the war teaching the er the english children
they didn't mix in those days
the english were taught in a different school to the chinese
so he was teaching there and then he came back
er he's retired now but he was teaching in an english school for a while
could you tell me about when he became a bevan boy
was that something he volunteered for
well er i well yes
they were sort of given a choice er i either i think it was sort of either you go on the land or er y you go down the mines
and he decided he'd try down the mines
but it was very hard work
i it was it was alright f for people wh who were used to that sort of thing but i mean they hadn't all the UNK in the mines then that they have now
it was really very hard work and he used to come back absolutely UNK in coal dust very dirty
so i think he was down for about six months before he left
where was that
er do you know i don't know
it'd be in one of the pits
i don't remember which one it was
he was married by that time and erm living down at but i don't think it would be fairly near there
it wouldn't be too far out
can we turn now then to your own career
you'd decided to go into nursing and you've said you'd always wanted
mm
yes
to go into nursing
so how did you
mm
eventually start in nursing
well i it certainly never entered my head to do anything else and although several other things were suggested er i never er i never even considered them
er even the headmaster said he tried to put me off
he said oh you know it's very hard work
you have to clean a lot of UNK but i mean i wasn't gonna be put off
and it was er it when i was eighteen in the march
and i started at the general hospital er in on may the first nineteen twenty nine
so
why do you think people were trying to put you off
i don't think they thought i was cut out or suitable for nursing
i don't i don't know why they shouldn't
but whether they thought it was going to be too hard work and it certainly was very hard work
but if you are doing something you like and want and enjoy doing er you don't mind working hard at all
but it was very hard work
and of course it was very poorly paid
we got er we well after the first three months the first three months we were s what they call student nurses
er it was mainly lectures on erm hygiene and biology a and that type of thing
and er then we erm we went on the wards for about two or three hours a day and we just s sort of did what we were told took out drinks and that sort of thing and UNK and after er we'd been there for about six or eight weeks we were allowed to wash patients if they couldn't wash themselves
th this type of thing until the after the three months we had to pass an exam
and if we passed the exam then we became er p UNK nurses then
and started on the on the wards
we started at seven in the morning and we finished at eight at night
and we had er two hours off during the day er and twenty minutes for dinner and er about twenty minutes for tea
so we didn't get very much ti time off and by the time we got back to our rooms at night we were so terribly tired you just dropped into bed
i don't think i've ever been so tired before or since as i was just that first year when we were UNK nurses
we were on our feet the whole time
it we never sort of UNK off at all and in those days there was so much brass to be cleaned and UNK to be done and cleaning
everything was er so much more difficult than it than it is today and er things were not sort of UNK of like they are now
they were all UNK thoroughly washed and then st UNK in the UNK boiled in the UNK
and i and i don't know whether they still have the wooden UNK now but they used to be have to be all UNK out every week
the outside polished
er it was very hard work
there's no getting away from it
and when you were UNK you did you got all the UNK jobs to do as well
they always used to call us UNK little UNK
and for all for er for that er you got you well you got your keep er and i don't really think there was anything wrong with the food it was the way it was cooked
it was terribly badly cooked
and you just could not manage on the food that was provided
you either got tuck boxes from home or you had to supplement it with your own earnings which ten shillings a week
we got two pounds a month
and out of that you had to keep yourself in stockings er and shoes for the ward
er and you provided yourself with the uniform before you came as a student nurse so that was alright for the first year so you'd no uniform to provide
but er i often wonder what the nurses today would think if they if that's all they n they got
i know m money did go much farther in those days but there certainly wasn't very much to spare at all
erm
you kept so busy it seems a waste of time to ask you what your social life was like as a student nurse
it was nil
absolutely
there was never any time at all
and even when you got into your second years you did get erm two hours off one day and three hours the next which was usually five till eight
but you had to be in by eight o'clock
so er i mean it wasn't much good if you wa wanted to go out with anybody
say well i'm awfully sorry i'm off at five but i got to be back at eight
it no
it was absolutely it wasn't it was absolutely n no social life at all
if you were lucky er and you had friends in you could go out for tea and that's about all there was
and on the sunday well you'd go to church or chapel because literally there was nothing else to do
there was nothing going on in the centre of
it was absolutely dead
you couldn't get a cup of tea or a cup of coffee anywhere
of course no theatres open no pictures open no coffee bars
absolutely nothing
it was as dead as anything
were all the student nurses about the same age
yes
yo occasionally you got somebody who was a little bit older but no we were nearly always i don't think anyone much older could have stood the pace actually
er we did have one person who was in her early twenties but er she gave it up
er you know she couldn't stick it she gave it up it was too hard work
and do you think they all came from the same kind of background as yourself or were they more working people
no i think they were a real mixture
er they came from a good old cross section of life
i s i still even now occasionally see one or two that we all started together
we still keep up we hear from one another at christmas time
but erm no we there were there were all sorts er there was they used to come in of course from the country
er there was a UNK daughter there i remember
erm no we were a good old cross section i think really
in those days you know it was a UNK
you certainly didn't do it for the money
er you did it because you really wanted to and it was a satisfying job
and that's what i think it it's i'm wondering now if the nurses today get the satisfaction from the job that we got in those early days
it was very hard work but you felt well i've done a good day's work when you'd finished
because when you were on night duty which you did er i it was a twelve hour UNK right through from eight at night till eight in the morning
and course you other than the half an hour for a meal in the middle of the night er that was it you got no time off at all
so erm
where do you think your satisfaction came from in the job
well i suppose you i th the patients were very grateful for anything that you did
we did get them better a lot of them at any rate
er and i think there w there was that satisfaction that you were doing something to help people get better
and they'd come in for surgery and you know you'd nurse them back again
get them up on their feet
and there was a satisfaction about it although i always think in those days we had to work so fast that there wasn't the time to do what you'd really like to have done for the patients
it was a case of i mean we used to start and wash them at three o'clock in the morning because t you had to start then because you'd never get it all done
you had to get everything done by the day staff coming on at seven
er and if you didn't start at that early hour you'd never they used to get sit up in bed have a wash then lie down again and go to sleep
i mean i don't think they do they do that these days i hope not any rate
but you just had to do that sort of thing i we used to feel awfully sorry for the patients but you had they had do it because they wouldn't have got a wash otherwise there was so mu so much to do
i don't suppose the unions would put up with it these days but er ha there weren't such things as unions for nurses in those days
was there nothing that even the full er fully trained nurses could join
no union
well i just towards the end of my training there was the er college of nursing started
now er that really started to look into the UNK the er profession and also to sort of see if they couldn't improve the lot of nurses
and of course now a large number of nurses certainly the older ones do belong to the er college of nursing were members of that
we i was in it we i think we paid a shilling a week a five p a we er a five p a month to belong to it
erm so we didn't pay very much but they certainly had they did er they tried to UNK the nurses
because e even in those days er it wasn't there'd be good training hospitals and not so good
now nowadays a good training hospital will want at least er a number of o levels and preferably two or even three a levels before they would accept a student
er standards have gone up there's no doubt about that
but erm
did you have to have any particular qualifications when you started
they liked us to have what in those days was the UNK
and if you had the UNK yes well i it did help you to get in
er you s a lot of them people did apply but er they just didn't you know they didn't get in
they didn't what it was they didn't consider that people were suitable to become a nurse
i think that's what it was
but other than that yeah they did like you to have your UNK
i did have it and erm that was a help
the standard of exams were pretty high there's no getting away from that they were pretty high
because you'd sort of they they'd go up and then if you went any farther you'd go on to the UNK lectures you see
so they were pretty high in those days
now it was the general hospital in where you did your training
that's it yes
erm can you remember what it was like generally in terms of facilities
erm it wasn't too bad
we had our own bedrooms and that was saying quite a bit because er the nurses home had been built er for the er as a sort of war memorial for after the first world war which was one of the most sensible war UNK i think anyone could have er provided
and we all had er our own bedrooms which was nice
they weren't very big but er they'd got a wardrobe a be a single bed and er dressing table and UNK
er and then we had about ooh there'd be about ooh twenty of us to four UNK
and then we had er UNK about four or five UNK in
erm that it wasn't too bad because people were coming on duty and going off duty
er so i mean they were in use more or less all the time but er it was it wasn't it wasn't too bad better than a lot of hospitals had
er ther there we did we had a tutor sister who used to give us all our lectures
she did her best to try and in to make things a little bit more er interesting and she did start a tennis club up which was nice because there was nothing at all before then
and we managed to get er two tennis courts which was very nice and we a we all used to play tennis
and she even managed to get us er somebody who would come and coach us a bit
so we th that was er another good thing they got going but there was very little for nurses to do
i think you were sort of there to and then you see you you've got to remember that all our lectures were taken in our off duty time
we didn't have time off for lectures we had to fit them in with our wi with our off duty
er and often you'd come off duty at eight o'clock a and you'd have to go to a lecture between eight and nine at night
and even if you were on night duty you'd be on night duty for twelve hours you'd come off at eight in the morning and have to go to a lecture at nine
and it was terribly difficult cos you'd just fall asleep
and many and many a time tutor sister would UNK on the desk and say come on wake up we've nearly finished
she was very good
very
but we used to have to take notes during the lecture a and then write the lectures up afterwards
so you could always borrow somebody else's notes to write them up
but nowadays of course they have a day off for lectures
er it's much better really
but we did get terribly tired
and we had one day off a month
and if you were on night duty you'd get two nights off but when you came back you'd have to be on duty that night so you'd have to go to bed that day
but we UNK we never complained no we you know we did i suppose everybody worked harder in those days
i mean they did on the farms
i su i suppose erm things are easier now
and of course nowadays there's so much er things that er we use there are so much labour saving things now that which makes a big difference
i think they've all got their own washing machines on the ward and that sort of thing whereas we had to do it by hand and then bundle it all up and send it down to the laundry
were there things which the student nurses did complain about at all
no we didn't
we wer were there because we wanted to be there
erm and no i don't remember
we might UNK a bit amongst ourselves but we we'd never dream of making a sort of an official complaint
i don't think we had a UNK who was extremely strict and i don't think we would've UNK to say anything to her at all
she used to sit behind her desk looking very UNK and proper and er i don't i don't quite honestly think we would've UNK say anything to her at all
what sort of things was she strict about
er the way we looked
we were not allowed to look er pretty on the wards or anything like that
we had to keep our hair right under our UNK look ver very much the nurse
we were not there to look pretty at all
er and er you yes she was very particular
we were not allowed to have any UNK in our stockings or anything like that we had to look very smart
er and always clean and in those even when you were you had to behave yourself when you were not on duty when you were even if you she saw you out not looking er smart she'd soon tell you about it er no you let the hospital down when you you're like that
and we were never allowed to go out in uniform we always had to change er into UNK
but er n no she was she was she was very particular even on the wards everything had to be just so
er she used to start coming round the wards about ten o'clock
and er there were two nurses always detailed to go around about half past nine and tidy all the beds up and the patients had got to look like patients
they'd got to sit up and lean against their UNK and their sheets had got to be turned down
er very neat very tidy
and er all magazines and papers had to be put away
it was alright when she'd done the round they could they could er bring them out again then but not until then
and she'd go round and sort of s say good morning good morning
er very UNK and proper and er she'd go all the way round and she'd soon tell you if there was if the beds weren't tidy
or if any the UNK wasn't straight everything had to be very straight very correct
were the other senior nursing staff like her in their attitudes to UNK and UNK or were some of them UNK than that
they were a bit UNK but a lot of them were very strict
mind you it was their ward and yo you were there to learn and they were there t to teach
and you did the job properly
er which it wasn't a bad a bad
so sometimes the sisters would really sort of get it in for a nurse and she'd and they could make your life very unpleasant indeed
but on the whole they weren't too bad
they weren't too bad not on not on the whole
you certainly did learn you learnt to do things properly
you see
did any nurses ever get asked to leave
erm oh yes
i mean if you weren't in at whe when you were in your third and fourth year it was a four year er training er in third and fourth years you were allowed to stay out till ten o'clock at night
but if you weren't in by ten the doors were locked
so of course we used to sort of try and get in the UNK home through a ground floor window
and if you were caught letting somebody in through a ground floor window about eleven o'clock a night that was it
you was were dismissed on the spot that was it
that was the ultimate crime was it
yes
oh it was yes
and i don't know wh i mean it was ridiculous even in those days ten o'clock was very early
but er no you weren't allowed out
and even then er you had to ask for permission to stay out till ten
you weren't auto sort of automatically allowed out till ten you had to go to the office and say please may i stay out till ten
i am going to do so and so or i am going to the pictures or i i'm going to so and so's for tea
er and then you were allowed
but it er when you're looking back it seems very ridiculous these days
they really did er they UNK your entire life
you were there for four years and the they didn't just if you weren't in by ten and you didn't get your proper night's sleep then you wouldn't be any good on the wards the next morning
that was their er the their way of looking at it
er that you had to have your sleep otherwise you were you weren't er you couldn't a attend to your lectures and do your work the next day
you had you had to get your night's sleep and proper rest
do you think that was an attitude to that was erm unique to nursing at the time or do you think erm that possibly girls in other walks of life had the same kind of experience of discipline and demands on them
well i suppose probably people li like UNK and er and er what they used to call in those days UNK helps who used to sort of be a general UNK around the house and would look after the children and they were the same they had to be in i think at sort of ten o'clock at night
erm and at that ti but other than that mind you i su i suppose that if i'd been at home i should have probably been expected to be in but i don't think i should have been locked out
i should have been allowed in if i was five minutes late
yes
were boys treated in the same way do you think
i suppose they probably were
i don't sort of i mean in those days they had wh apprenticeships and that sort of thing
you were UNK
er i suppose yes they probably were expected to be in by a definite time
i don't really think it did us any harm
erm it was a bit restricting er but i don't really think the discipline did us any harm you know
i it probably gave us a good UNK
i've always grown up with the idea if i do a job i'll do it properly or else i won't bother i won't tackle it all
i think it UNK that into me
and of course if you are nursing you can't afford to make mistakes it may cost somebody's life if you do
you've got to have your UNK about you
if you're giving UNK or an and that sort of thing drugs of any sort
er if you give an UNK or forget something not to give medicine or give too much medicine it can be very serious the consequences could be serious
mm
yes
quite
and when you finished your training erm that was how long a training was it in fact
four years
four years
and then if you'd been off sick at all you had to make that time up as well so it was about four years and six months i did there altogether
mhm
and then you were a fully qualified nurse
yes i was a state registered nurse then
yes and did you stay on at the hospital then
er no i left then
for the last six months i did erm ward sister duties
she was off sick and er so for the last six months i did sister's duties which was very useful because er it gave me that little bit of independence working on my own whereas before you'd always got either the staff nurse or the sister to fall back on
you know i was completely on my own i i'd got to make my own decisions
so it really was it was quite nice having that six months
when you'd got your qualifications was there a big difference between the status of the trained nurse and the student nurses
oh yes
the they er even in the dining room you sort of there were long tables well when you came in as a student nurse you were right at the bottom of the table and as you know the second year third year fourth year you gradually moved up and then the state registered nurses they all sat together
now i think they have UNK little tables now but in those days they were long just long UNK tables
yes you did you erm you were sort of treated differently yes you were definitely
did you get er different UNK as you became the fully qualified nurse then
yes y yes you were you'd sort of passed all your exams so yo th they sort of had to make it a little bit easier
you were allowed to stay out but erm you had to get permission
you weren't sort of allowed just in and out when you wanted to you had to get permission to stay out late
they liked to keep UNK on you even then
did you stay at hospital after you'd finished your training
er about six months
just a mere six months
and then what did you do
then i er decided i'd take my midwifery
er so i went to the nursing home i don't know whether it's still there
it's a it's a training it was training school for UNK
and erm i was there for about a year
you could take if you got your general your state registered nurse you could take your midwifery in a year
and erm that first of all it was lectures and helping you did get er patients coming in
there'd be about ooh twenty beds i think
and then er after that you went on the on the district
er you were called out at night and of course in those days you went round on a bicycle and you went round with your little black bag UNK on the back
and you'd be on call and the babies nearly always come at night
er and you'd er they'd er just bang on the door and call you and you had to be downstairs in five minutes
er and cycle to where it was
when you were a student midwife you went with a proper midwife
and er when you'd got on a bit you delivered the baby but the midwife was there to see you didn't make any mistakes and really to t teach you to do it
it was the practical side of it
but erm yes sometimes you'd get there in time but you see they'd just i there weren't the telephones about in those days so you couldn't everybody didn't have a phone they couldn't ring in an and say i'm in labour
it'd mean waiting till often till the father came back from work and then he'd have to er sometimes come right up to the er to the nursing home er to tell you that they was that she was in labour and would we please come
er sometimes the police if there was a police station near they would phone a message through but er quite of quite often and then you'd get there and often you'd hear the baby was born by the time you got there
but it erm it was hard work in those days
i can remember once i think it was hill or i think it was estate it was quite a new estate in those in those days when i when i was there
erm and there was a hill out that runs up to this housing estate out of and it runs well through really through the UNK
there's a UNK on one side and well in those days it had UNK round the UNK on the other side
i expect they all went in the second world war
er but i can remember going cycling up that hill and the midwife was there as well and there was a most awful scream came from this er this UNK
it was UNK too
and i have never got up that hill so fast in all my life
and i it wasn't until afterwards i realized it was cats UNK
it looked so weird in the UNK and this scream coming up
oh yes i can remember that
you did get funny things like that er that sort of rather UNK things
but er nowadays of course you don't get babies born in the homes like we did in when i when i was training
er and often you'd go into a quite a poor home and you'd sort of er th there wasn't the money about you see in those days
nineteen twenty nine it was in the nineteen thirties when there was the depression people just had not got the money to really provide for the baby as they would do well they would do now
and you'd say well now have you got a bowl
i shall want a bowl
and they'll say well yes there's this bowl
and you'd say right and you'd go the after the baby was born you you'd go back again to what we call the UNK nursing up and you'd want the bowl again for the baby and you'd say wh where's the bowl and they'd say oh well i think it's downstairs we used it yesterday to make a pudding in
and so you'd have to go and find this bowl and UNK it again
but you just had to fit in with things
and a lot of the mothers couldn't afford to buy the proper erm maternity er UNK that they would have done nowadays
er and er you'd say well try and get on old sheet and wash it thoroughly and iron them the p cut it up and iron them with a hot iron
and that would more or less UNK it as UNK as you'd you know you could ever get anything
you see there was no erm grants in those days like they have now nothing at all
so they just had to try and save er from the man's wages and if and if they weren't in work there was very little money at all
and people did rally round
er the people helped one another far more i think then than they do now because i suppose now it just isn't it isn't necessary
people can manage
and in those days most people did have their children at home didn't they
yes the majority of them did
yes the majority of them did
unless er there was any er you know you were expecting any problems
then of course th they would come in
but nearly always at home
well i suppose th they felt it was the cheapest way of having them
rather than co coming in to hospital
and er who were the UNK employed by
er the county council
yes they were appointed by the county council so i UNK and er i rather think that they we never got paid but i rather think th they'd have to pay the council something for the UNK services
but er i don't remember that side of it at all
i didn't sort of erm i cer i certainly didn't touch you know any money at all
and when you were a student erm who was paying for your training
we had to pay for our own training in those days
yes
the county council er w would train you but you'd do your erm year's training and then you had to work for them for a year i think it was a year or eighteen months
er and er to sort of pay them back
and er you were on sort of reduced salary
they gave you enough to sort of live on
er but er y they sort of got their money back that way
yes so all this time were you still living in a nurses home
yes
we were living on the on the premises
mhm
yes
can you remember any particular births either difficult ones or funny ones
yes i can remember one i it er she was a UNK little woman too
and she came in and she had this baby and it was her thirteenth baby and it weighed fourteen pounds
and honestly it wasn't like a baby at all a new baby it was huge
and we called it the bull because it didn't cry it sort of UNK
it was louder than all the other babies all put together
and er during the course in those days you stayed in bed for ten days you were supposed to at any rate
and er all that her other twelve children all came up to see her while she was there and they were beautifully kept really well kept and well fed too
er he was a bus driver
so she'd managed alright
i don't know whether she had any more she said she hoped it was the last and i should think she did thirteen children to look after
but you know medicine was very different in those days
i can remember erm when we ever had women in from the country they'd say oh yes y my mother told me always to take UNK leaf tea
it always gives you a an easy labour
now whether there was any truth in it or not i don't know but a lot of country women always used to have UNK leaf tea during pregnancy
er and it always they always used to say oh yes you'll have a much easier labour if you do
whether there was any truth in it or not i've no idea
but there wasn't the erm UNK care that there is these days i mean there were no erm when you went round to se if you were a midwife and you went round to see the prospective mother you'd say now you are eating proper meals aren't you
well that that's as much as they ever got
you never said you know are you eating fruit or are you taking UNK
i mean nowadays everybody has UNK pills whether they need them or not
they make quite sure they are getting enough UNK
but in those days th they didn't
and er i mean there are not the UNK exercises th that they have now
i don't know whether they i suppose they really didn't have the time
see nowadays there's so much more in the way of erm labour saving devices
in those days the washing was done in a good old copper boiling on a monday and light the fire underneath it and this sort of thing
er i don't suppose they had much time for relaxing and sitting down
they used to say well i try and get my er my legs up for half an hour in the afternoon but that'd be about as much as th they'd get in the way of rest
they carried on just the same as usual
a at what point would you first erm see someone who was expecting a baby
oh about six months as a rule
they'd sort of say they'd they were supposed to book a midwife you see
and er then that midwife would po call and see them perhaps one well they call at six months just to make sure ev everything was alright
and th they'd examine the mother
and er a and then they'd go they'd if the mother was strong healthy and everything was going alright they'd probably leave it another month before they went
or if they were worried about it then they they'd go sooner
but you'd perhaps go three or four times before the baby was born and er just see everything was alright and you'd know which way the baby was lying a and which way it was going to er you know come and if you thought there was going to be any problems well you know then you would sort of let the doctor know and he'd decide then
but erm i think a midwife a good midwife is every bit as good as a doctor because she's doing it all the time
and she er she a lot of UNK were extremely clever in those days
and you didn't have the erm all the aids that they have now
i mean they put something round the mother's tummy and they can see the heart beat beating whereas we if we wanted to know if the baby was alright and er it wasn't getting UNK you'd just put a cloth on the UNK and put your ear down to it and hear it that way
there were not the aids that there were now
erm
would the er patients be seeing the doctor as well as the midwife during this few months before they were going
no
to give birth
no
not necessarily
no you'd er you'd just if provided you the midwife thought everything was going as it should that was it
you ju just left it to the midwife
the doctors didn't come into it much at all
er only if erm the mother was torn at all or if you didn't think the baby was coming as it should there was problems there then you would
you'd the er the patient would have a d her own doctor
well and you'd just send for the doctor
or if she was torn then the doctor would come er and stitch her up
but that was another thing nowadays they just don't seem to bother at all if the mother gets torn now in those days it was a terrible disgrace to g to er if you had a had a delivery and the mother was torn
er it just wasn't done and it was it was bad midwifery it was bad nursing to get a tear
er and y you know if you sent for a doctor you were almost UNK that the mother was torn
but nowadays they just don't seem to bother at all
it's just sort of a UNK conclusion
no it was erm i was going to say much more natural in those days i suppose in a way it was more natural
i don't think the babies were any worse or the mothers were any worse
you see a working well of course they do get them up nowadays but in th you were supposed t to stay in bed for at least a fortnight after the mother was born but you a lot of these mothers used to hop out of bed when the midwife had gone and i mean if they'd got two or three children and a husband coming in and they hadn't got a mother or a neighbour or somebody to come in and do the cooking i mean she'd just get up and get on with it herself
they'd have to
i mean it wasn't done and nobody knew about it and no one said anything about it but it was
were there any UNK in use during UNK
erm no they'd usually give an anaesthetic if the mother had to be UNK or if it was a UNK delivery but that was all
er it was hardly ever er a mother was just sort of given something to ease the pain
er the principle was that erm th the birth of a child is it is painful but it's not a pain too much for a mother to bear that was the id the principle that they went on
that it was erm er it was UNK
and n not many of them re really complained
they were usually glad when it was over
but other than that no
i expect the conditions in some of the houses you went into were er pretty poor
yes
th they certainly were i it er i it they were very poor th they you got into some of the poor poorer homes
er clean er th they were nearly always clean but there was just not er the things there to use
that was the trouble they just couldn't afford to provide them
and you just had to make do best way you could
do you think that this er affected the erm chances of the child living
er yes i suppose i suppose it could have done if you get a UNK baby and a UNK mother
er the baby probably wouldn't stand such a good chance
er and of course you you'd get er those days they didn't have UNK the mother had the baby in bed with her
and i can remember a mother she was a very big woman she rolled onto her baby and UNK the baby
now i can't imagine any mother doing it twice but the first time they said it was an accident
the baby of course UNK
er but the second time the police came and asked quite a lot of questions about it
when she did it the second time
but erm no it yo i think there were UNK babies
but the majority of them managed to managed to UNK
did you erm ever experience any babies born with UNK
erm no i didn't
they were er they were all fairly healthy babies
i only had one UNK
that was that was the only time
oh yes we did we did have one baby yes we did in the er in the home
erm and it didn't live very long at all
it was very badly UNK the back of the head wasn't there at all
erm the back of the UNK er and it didn't last i think it lasted two or three weeks but that was all
but that was the only one
and erm i when i was in hospital we did have UNK two of those lived alright though
but they were alright they were just erm er sort o but you see in those days babies didn't live
now if they said if a baby was under five pounds it wouldn't survive
er there were none of the UNK and this sort of thing for them like we've got today
and er th they just sort of they jus just didn't live very few of them did
and anything under five pounds well you didn't expect them to live
but er nowadays of course they do get a very much better chance
were the families much bigger then when you were nursing
yes
i mean four five six children yes
erm ver very yes they were very much er much bigger
but now er with family planning and contraception er they are you know they're far better really
er the children are getting a better chance
they're erm sort of two or three in a family
parents today are far more responsible they're they sort of say no erm we won't we'll only have the number of children we can give a good start in life to
where which probably the parents when i was doing midwifery would have said the same thing but there was nothing they could do about it
there wasn't the pill in those days and there was simply er really nothing that the woman could do to stop herself getting pregnant
er i it was alright if the man took precautions but if the woman didn't take precautions there was er i mean the man didn't there was nothing the woman could do at all about it
so it was very hard on the woman because it the they just came one after the other
it was nothing five six you know children or even like that other one thirteen children
erm but she was quite happy with her thirteen but i think a lot of the others w women no the they er it pulled them down terribly
was it any part of your job to give such UNK advice as you could to
er
families
not really
but i mean often women would say what can i do i don't want any more babies what can i do
well all you really could do was say well you'll have to ask your doctor and get him to have a talk with your husband
er that was really all the advice we could give
there was nothing very much we could do about it
now of course i mean the woman can do something which is it's a very good thing
and of course UNK er you know for a man to be UNK or a woman to be UNK er you just it just wo nobody ever even considered it
it was never th not a never even thought of
was family planning any part of your training at all
no not really no
no it wasn't
erm were you as a midwife ever approached about abortions
er n no
we were you know sort of asked is there anything i can do to get rid of the baby
but er not really seriously because you see in those days it was illegal for anything like that
th that was the hard part there was nothing they could do about it at all
did people find ways of having abortions
yes
there were there's always been the illegal er UNK
and erm there used to be shops where they would they'd sort of say we can give you pills to bring it on but i don't think they ever really did
sometimes they'd try taking a good dose of UNK salts to see if that would start things you know but er there was very little very little they could do
i wonder do did doctors erm attempt abortions at all
erm not they did a bit erm if it was you know really a medical if it was really detrimental to the mother to have another one er then they would
or if sort of they started they'd always have them in hospital and finish it off properly
erm but not very often no
you if you got yourself pregnant that's it
erm but it was very hard very hard on these families because they worked really hard and the children kept on coming
it was very difficult
after the babies were born a part of your job would be to help mothers erm train the babies
yeah yes
erm
what was the view of what a well trained baby should be
well we didn't do a lot of that er except gi giving advice wh when we just sort of er going round as a midwife
but after that i did take up private nursing
erm and then you went for a whole month which was you could do something in that time
you'd go er before the baby was born and then you'd look after the baby for the fi for a whole month
er and you then you you'd try your best and usually we could er get them to sleep the whole night through
they'd have the ten o'clock feed and then it it'd sleep through till the six o'clock the next morning for the next morning feed
that's what you'd try to train him to do
er but usually you'd have to give perhaps a drink of erm er water just warm water
er just in the middle of the night
you had to in those days you had to sort of er use your common sense because if you had a big healthy baby it's a long while to go right through ten o'clock at night till six o'clock the next morning
but usually that's what you tried to do that's what you aimed at doing
at giving the baby his last feed at ten and putting him down and hoping that he'd stay asleep till well half past five to six the next morning
so that when you left er the mother had time to get up she hadn't had any bad nights
er she'd got herself reasonably fit again er and then if she'd car take over the mo the baby you'd get you'd train her if she didn't know if she ha if it was the first baby
er you she'd take you you'd teach her to bath it and this sort of thing and look after him
er and then you'd er say right now you're on your own now er and if you'd got the baby sleeping right through the night it was so much easier for her
she'd just er put him down at ten and that was that
in those days th there was a great do about babies sleeping in a room on their own
well i and if it cried well you let it cry you just let it go on crying until it was so tired it went to sleep
erm i never did agree with that very much really
i don't think i could have stood it crying for hours on end
er usually if a baby UNK it's usually trying to tell you something er and if by the time three or four weeks is up er you find out wh you know if there is anything wrong
but er usually a baby will be UNK if it's being fed properly
erm an and it's er it's kept dry and it's UNK
usually it'll be it'll sleep from one feed to the next
could you tell me how you came to move from midwifery into private nursing
yes
well it was when i'd finished my midwifery training i certainly stayed on a little while in er in doing a bit of district work
s the only one i did do after we were married
i had my first UNK one i did do after we were married
i had my first baby UNK and there were about ooh i should about think twelve nurses in the association
and we were either on call or we were sent out very quickly
all over the place we went really not just in all round and er farther UNK as well if they were short of private nurses
and then of course i did quite a lot of children's nursing then er but also general nursing as well a bit o a bi some midwifery and er mainly ge general nursing
did you choose to move away from midwifery in that way or did er or was it just that er a job came up
no
erm i liked i liked a bit more variety
it was a i think if you really did midwifery er when you were doing it privately there was always a doctor there i sort of in charge as well
er but if not if you are just doing midwifery i think you er really need to stick at it and just do that because it's the more practise and the more babies you bring into the world the better you get at it
you know you sort of er get i think yes i th i think you were sort of better at the job the mo the more practise you got and the more you did it
but i liked er general work it brought all sorts of things in
different er different kinds of nursing
er medical and then sometimes people with a lot of money if they needed a not a particularly dangerous operation they'd have it done in their own homes
sort of fix a room up as a theatre and bring the some nursing staff in
and then you'd stop on afterwards to er nurse them back to health again
used to get all sorts
erm i liked the children's nursing i was always you know fond of children
we used to get all sorts of things
i could remember one case i had er he'd be about eight
and er they said they wanted a nurse this child had been very sick and they didn't quite know what was wrong with him
but he was very sick so er they wanted somebody to stay with him overnight at any rate so i he wasn't sleeping and i he said what i said to him what do you think made you sick
so he said well you won't tell UNK or UNK will you
i said no i won't tell them not unless you say i can
he said well you see i've been smoking
i smoked one of UNK
and that's the reason he was so sick
he soon got better again but i never told his parents
they'd no idea why they'd been so sick
was it better paid whe in private nursing than in midwifery
erm yes
but if you erm went to an ordinary general case it was three pounds a week you got UNK er for your er salary
but you did get your keep you see th you more you usually you lived with the family
but if it was a very posh place er you'd probably have your meals with the UNK which we used to enjoy better really
er and then for midwifery you got four UNK a week
and out of that we paid half a crown ou in every UNK to the association because they got the jobs for us
so it was the er miss 's nursing association that we belonged to
and it was a fairly high everybody was fully trained
it was erm i used to enjoy it
used to go for sometimes two or three weeks sometimes if it was a maternity a month but i used to enjoy it
it you used to meet a lot of different kinds of people and er not only that you travelled about quite a bit as well
it was very interesting
and you stayed in that kind of work until you got married
that's right yes i did
yes
how did you meet your husband
well i met him actually through er i was nursing erm a baby she was only three months old and she'd had she'd caught from her older sister she'd caught UNK cough
er that's why i was there
and he was friendly with them and i met him there
that's how i first met him
so er we were introduced and the first time he took me out er he proposed to me but it took me six months to make my mind up
but er that's how i met him
did you get much free time to go out at all
no very little
er very little
if er if you were on a case er well if you could get out for a for an hour in the afternoon for a walk but that was about all
you were re really on call all the time
but erm it i don't know it we ne we never seemed to think anything about it at all
we perhaps would have a week or ten days in between cases
and then of course we could go out and er as much as we liked then
we all of us had er a bed sitting room of our own which we kept on between cases cos we had to have somewhere to live and erm and then of course we we'd come back there and make up for lost time really
did you share a bed sit or flat with someone else then
no
i had i had one of my own
it wasn't a very big one
it was a put u up bed and i think i paid i think it was a UNK a week for it
it wasn't you know it wasn't very much not in those days
er and then of course you erm you shared a kitchen we shared a kitchen
there were one two three bed sitting rooms and one kitchen between us
and we used to sort of arrange it when one wasn't cooking the other one would be you know and this sort of thing
we used to have quite a good time
so were the people in the other bed sits also nurses like yourself
yes they were
they were which was well it was quite useful really because er you know you had to be you were called out to a case suddenly er there was always somebody just to make sure you hadn't left any food you know in the kitchen that was going to grow UNK until you got back
er yes it was we were all very friendly together
we were all actually on the er same association so we were alright
so then you got married then
yes i did yes
and you gave up nursing
was it immediately you got married
erm yes
i only took one case on after i was married er and that er that was a maternity case i'd been to the first baby
and they said would i go er for the second and i said yes i would
but that's the only one i did do after we were married
i had my first baby ooh about ooh fourteen or fifteen months after we were married but i lost i lost my first baby at three months
but then i had another er one within er two years and i had them both fairly quickly
so i had two now a boy and a girl
er and they're both married now so er they're quite off hand
but no in those days if you had children er young children at any rate you never expected to go out to work at all
that you looked after the home and the children
they always sort of came first they were the sort of centre of the family and everything UNK round them
whereas now of course er they seem to grow up more quickly
and even during the second world war er mothers with their children under the age of five er they weren't expected to do any war work at all
it wasn't until they were er sort of six or seven years old that er you'd took a part time job
but you were always allowed home when the children were not at school
it was far more the usual thing women didn't go out to work very much not after they were married
not even in jobs like midwifery
erm not unless there was a reason for it
you know if there were no children then probably th they would they might do then
but er ther there'd have to be a good reason for it if erm the nurses did go out er afterwards
sometimes they did when the children were grown up or at least well off hand
sort of left school
er they night go back to it then if they really wanted to or usually there was a reason for it
the husband had either died or something of that sort or the husband was unable to work then the mother would have to work to keep things going
so the reason was always that people really needed the money rather than they just wanted to work
yes i think they did
yes i think that was the main reason
it was er women in those days were quite content to s sort of stop at home
er and just be a home maker unless as i said if there was a reason for it if they needed the money
or some reason like that
another would sometimes go back to work er if their son or UNK well mainly the sons went to university and they needed the extra money for that
er they probably would go back to work then but it was usual for a married mother to stop at home
did you ever feel after having your own children that er you would have made a better midwife erm this experience than when you were single
er i think i should certainly have made a better nurse yes i think i should
er i when we were UNK we used to say that was the way to bring a child up but w when you'd had your own you sort of bent the rules a little bit more
er and i think i should have said if er la you know after i'd had my own enjoy your babies while they're young because they grow up so quickly whereas before it was a case of don't pick them up when they you know if they cry UNK let them cry
they're alright they it won't do them any harm
whereas you know when mine began to cry it was a good excuse to give them a bit of a UNK
you looked at things differently yes certainly you did
mhm
do you think that this sort of attitude is probably true today that the kind of things we learn about child UNK are not the things we put into practise when we actually have children to bring up ourselves
yes i'm sure it is
yes
i think now er having brought my own up and now they've got children of their own and i've got grandchildren er yes my attitude is quite different
i can understand them far better now than i did then
i can enjoy them far better
and i think that is a very important thing really
because i think that's where UNK are important to children specially these days when mothers do go out to work
er you you'll find that children will grandchildren will tell their grandparents thing that they won't tell their own parents
now i can remember doing that myself when i was young
i could tell my grandparents things that i wouldn't tell my father or my mother
but er i could always tell granny and granddad
and i'm finding now that my grandchildren are just the same
their attitude to me they'll tell me things because they know that you well won't repeat it you won't tell on them
unless you think it's really necessary and then you may drop a hint
but er yes i i've certainly find that
i think grandparents have a very important part in a in a growing child's life
very important
in fact my grandchildren feel very deprived because they haven't got a grandfather
they've adopted one
somebody who lives quite near they're a very nice old couple
so they said well they didn't really want another granny but they wanted to adopt a granddad
yes when was it that your husband died in fact
he died eighteen years ago so of course he never saw
he never saw them
he never saw them at all no
so they do they do miss him
what did your husband do when he was alive
well he was a photographer
er he used to do we used to have a round each morning and collect all the films from the UNK and then we developed and printed them and took them back at night
er ooh we had quite a round er in and all the all the way round the centre of
er and also he had a studio he specialized he was very fond of children he specialized in children's photos
so we were kept pretty busy
did you help him in this work
yes i did
i used to do all the UNK before i lost my sight
i did all the UNK
and er all the ordering and dealt with the auditors and the bank and that sort of thing
i did all that he hated that sort of thing
in fact he didn't understand it at all
which left him free to do all the practical work which he really liked
he also did weddings as well
now he liked doing that sort of thing
and he was very he was UNK too
but that was where the trouble came when i lost my sight he was left with both the practical side and the er UNK as well which he didn't understand at all
yes
where did you live when you first got married
did you
erm
have a place of your own
yes we did
we had a little erm er house up in grove just er on the er edge of park
er and then when the second world war started er we had to leave there and come down to the er sh to the sh shop really
it was a lock up shop
er and we lived above the shop then
well we lived there er yes the whole time all our married life
he did move away for a while er and had er UNK away from the from the house and i just ran the shop
but erm when i lost my sight then he had to close that down and come back so we were all under one roof again
mm
where was it that you had to move from during the war
well it i expected that he would have to go and i should have to manage on my own and it was quite er a way to come down to the shop
we had a shop as well
er and it was much easier to be living on the premises that's what we felt at the time
erm i think perhaps it was a good move in a in a in a way i was when the children did come along i you know i was we were al i was all together under one roof
the business was there and i was there when he went
so it was it turned out for the best
did he go into the army
no he didn't go into the army
erm he i think what he really must have had was er a sort of mild form of UNK when he was young and he'd got a shoulder not completely paralysed but it was partially paralysed
so erm they wouldn't take him in the army but he was in the more or less he was he was in the map making department
which was we well rather up his er his you know his own work UNK photography
it was all tied up together
he went down to and trained here and then he came back and they made all the maps there
they always knew where the next offensive was because they were making maps for them
and meanwhile you were still running the business during the war
that's it yes
i kept all the connections up
we couldn't do an awful lot because it was er classed as a luxury business er and so we couldn't get an awful lot of UNK paper or films or anything of that sort but we managed to keep the connections up with what we could get
er it wasn't too bad it was there when the war ended
there was something to start building on again which was a good thing
so do you mean that your husband was able to continue with this a bit as well as working for
yes
just a bit yes
he did he didn't do very much but i'd already learnt the business by then
er i could er print and do the UNK and develop the films
erm so really and truly i you know with what we'd got it was sort of carrying the business on in a very sort of low way and instead of going round collecting the work it was all done through the post
it was all postal work then
did people want any special kind of photos during the war that they hadn't asked for previously
yes
it was all er sort of er yes mainly UNK we used to get of er new babies children and this sort of thing
er you see but the men a at the front the that's what they wanted
UNK to send to the er the fathers and er UNK er at the front that's what they really wanted
er anything special you know that UNK children growing up and you know fathers not seeing them or wives having babies wh which you know they hadn't seen perhaps till they were two years old
so there was a lot of er in fact we used to try to keep the films for er young couples with children
it was sort of so few came through it was very much sort of under the counter
you kept them and you tried to sort of let people have them who you felt deserved them you know most
it was very difficult
but it was very difficult for these for young couples with the er men at the front and perhaps they'd only just got married before the war and it was very hard lines on them
i often think er and then of course you see if they er the UNK their wives used to try and get er UNK near where the UNK were so they could see their UNK
er and i always used to think it must be extremely they'd hear them going out at night and you know then count the planes coming back
i often think i wish you know we could UNK some of those again i think it would jolly well i wish government could really sort of kn know what it was like
i don't think they'd be so anxious to go to war if they did
it was the young people th that i think were hit the most
it was ver very hard on them
and er
can you remember any particular incidents that happened during the war
erm no well we were very lucky in we didn't have an awful lot of air raids we had it over the lace market and er and near
but er we didn't have any really bad air attacks at all
we were very fortunate but i do remember the guns used to go off and i when my so my son was born the guns were going off all the time from the castle
they we they had some guns on the castle and they were i suppose there must have been enemy planes over
you could always you always used to say we could tell the german planes coming over er they'd got a certain sound because they were so heavily UNK
and er you could hear them and used to say oh yes that's a german plane
but we were very lucky in we didn't really have an awful lot of erm of air raids at all
and as a mother at the time di do you remember having problems getting food and things during the war
er yes
i it wasn't easy but it was very fair
i suppose in the first world war i don't remember an awful lot about it we wer always seemed to have enough to eat but er i think the second world war whatever there was it was fairly distributed
we were all rationed but we everybody got their fair share
and er really when you sort of l look at the children who were born during the war and were brought up during the war they're all pretty strong and healthy
so th they couldn't er have done too badly
i mean bananas were only children had bananas and er orange juice you got that at the clinic and UNK liver oil terrible UNK horrible UNK liver oil
but er they did sort of th it was fairly distributed there's no eggs you'd get perhaps one egg a week on each ration book
and then they had a points system which meant that er you had so many points and you could there were certain foods that were just on points and er you could choose to spend your points on whatever you wanted
you could get er UNK jam that was i tins of UNK jam that was one of the things
and UNK jam which wasn't too bad really
but we've never heard of it since
er and not many fresh eggs but we did get dried eggs which were it wasn't a bad substitute but it wasn't the same as a fresh egg but you could UNK them and you could use them for cooking but then you see there was very little fat
erm you could get er UNK
i think we had two UNK of UNK a week on each ration book and butter i think we had an ounce of butter a week and meat was very UNK
come in

good evening
hello
hi
what can i do for you
right doctor i'm here for a er prescription for UNK l a
pink
pink capsule
well i'll tell you i was here last month and you know doctor
mhm
she said she would put on the computer or something like
mhm
that for three months
yeah
now i couldn't rem quite remember
she told me to come back to get my blood pressure checked again
right
and i couldn't remember whether she said at the end of the three months or
end of the month
just now
i'm not quite sure
e every month june
basically that's why i'm here
mhm
for the prescription and to get it checked
slip your coat off and we'll get
the pressure checked for you
ah
slip that round your arm
that's it
right
that's okay
there we are
there
just let your arm rest on there
doing very well
you're not getting any funny fits from that at all june
er no
nothing
ah
that's excellent
excellent
no problem
it did mention in the sort of packet that maybe feel cold with cold hands and what have you
but i think i could live with that
i haven't actually noticed
that there's
aye
y you'll find
no
that's really only a problem in the winter time
aye
you will be getting very cold weather
aha
during the winter here
you know a lot of UNK weather
a coincidence cos at the time i started taking them actually trying to spare my branch work in a bank
mhm
so i was trying to spare and it's really the most UNK branch i've ever been in
mhm
er the heating had broken down and i don't know whether it was because of the heating or because of the tablets or whatever but they're alright now
yes
well i think er th the time that people notice this most is definitely in the winter
aha
you know if you get maybe a week of fairly hard frost
aha
you feel the tips of your fingers
yeah
cos it'll actually take me till about half past the day to get any feeling in it but as i say
i don't know if it was the tablets
it wasn't it definitely wasn't the tablets because i if it had done that to you it would have been all day
aha
there'd have been no improvement
i see
aye
because it works all the time right
aha
through the twenty four hours
right
so you wouldn't have had any so it couldn't have been the tablets doing that to
you
if it helps my blood pressure i could live with the cold
yes
oh yes
fingers
oh aye
oh it's doing really nicely
and w we'll see you in four weeks again
that's fine
and get it checked again june
okay
okay
thanks a lot

it's right down
it's right the tips of your fingers
aye
aha
up here and right down
aye
but this is even worse i could
aye
hardly bend you know
that's right
and it went right down there
it goes right down the top bit of your leg and comes right round
and then it comes round here and
the top
that's right
aye
aye
now then
just tw okay now just keep stand here and tell me when i come to the good bit

aye
i felt it then
just in there
aha
in through that bit
not so
bad
we'll so UNK that UNK
right down
UNK you right
aha
i'm not gonna UNK about right
aha
i know what's happened
oh well that's good
this a UNK you've got
is that what it is
that's what it is
aha
that's what it is
this coming down here that's the big nerve
right
at the bottom of the back
yeah
and down into the top of the leg
aha
and a wee bit
and why it comes round here
and i thought oh i wonder what this is
it's the same with this one here
it comes right down your arm
right down to the tips of your fingers
that's right
aye
cos i thought och
i think it's about time i'm calling because
yeah
och
get
cos it was really quite bad
quite
and i don't usually
yes oh it's a
you know with
it's a very severe pain
it's like a UNK
so it is and it goes
it's right inside the nerve
isn't that
that's wh that's why it's so sore
oh
and it doesn't matter what you do it doesn't matter how you
aye or anything
powers up powers down bed
d doesn't matter
and we were and i was beginning to wonder is it something to do you know how it tells you maybe if you swallow there's
no
you know how it
and i thought now
no
no
no
no
no
it
i'd better go and see you know because i
no
no
no
it it's
take my every day
yes
aye
no it's er that's er that is it's actually quite a common thing
is it
aye
right
i mean it's painful i mean it's not that this
oh aye it is painful but i thought it's not going away so i'd better go and see about it
that's right
you're bet you're better knowing what it is
aye because i've gone on for weeks with it you
mhm
know
mhm
right
now
this whole thing
no
well i keep saying it's a muscle but i thought i'd
no
no
no
m
better
you get folk in their in their thirties and forties with this
with the same thing
aye
it's it just er i'm not sure what happens i think what happens is that the circulation into the nerve
aha
gets blocked somehow
oh
aha
and you're not getting the proper circulation down through
so
the nerve so it's sending the wrong messages back up
i didn't know that
aye
and you you're getting this
and you're getting the pain
and it feels absolutely terrible especially in the cold mornings
that's right
if you go outside in the cold mornings
aha
and it feels all as if it's UNK
it does
aye
mhm
and it it's just right up my shoulder here
just here
that's
and
right
and there and right down
and right down to my fingers
right down
mhm
with one man said i used to put in the cold mornings i used to put my other hand at the bottom to see if i could get heat but he couldn't touch his fingers because they were so tender
aye this was frozen to me
that's right
this hand you know
and he just wanted to get the heat in so he kept his other hand round about it
i couldn't
so it's i mean it's not it's not just yourself
but it is
aha
a painful thing
oh it is painful right enough
now i've given you some good tablets for this
yeah
to help to UNK the circulation and to kill the pain
aha
now they are because there're two things in them they're quite strong
never take them on an empty stomach
no even with my breakfast
mm
cup of tea with
yes
a bit of UNK
yes
aye
with a UNK
i'm the same
right
with that other one too
right
you know how it
that's
says on it
yeah
you know to take
not to take
but i never take it
aye
before my breakfast
well then you get started on that
or with water
and that'll do you the world of good
right then
thanks
okay
very much doctor

mm
her heart sounds
absolutely
i wish to god i'd i wish like that doctor
mm
mm
right
now doctor
that's fine
can you tell me
in the mornings i'm still all UNK that's the only word i could find for it doctor
i'm UNK all sorts of things
i hate UNK wonder what's happening and i'm
i don't want to stay in the house and all this
now you've given me UNK i'm not sure when i'm taking it doctor
last thing at night
the three of them
mhm
three UNK
three UNK
last thing at night
that's it
i was taking one after breakfast one after lunch and one after dinner
er
but it's not it's in the mornings
no
i think i think if you took one in the morning and then two at bedtime
that's
yeah
that yeah
that's just
will that work out to
as good
that's just as good
and will this
will this
this feeling of panic
yes
that'll disappear
what
why am i coming in the room
i went to walk on sunday evening with my daughter round the estate and i came back and couldn't get a breath when i came in UNK and it was a f it was a horrible feeling
mhm
now i'm getting that quite regularly is that because of chest
or is it a
what is
what
it's just a nervous reaction
it's just a
nervous reaction
yeah
the erm
pardon me for saying so that's a lovely pen
i'm plain daft
yes it is isn't it
are you
yeah
sorry you
no it's it is it's
it's a beautiful balanced pen
yes
it's the only one i like
yeah
i have about forty pens at home
and it's a nice i no
do you collect them by yourself or
i don't i don't collect them
people just give you them
no
i tried to find one that
well i got
clare got one for dad
a UNK what one is that doctor
i've no idea
see what i mean
i've no idea
it's
i'm sorry for being UNK
i'm terribly
no
UNK
no
it's one it's o one of the drug companies
and er
it's a beauty
like that one
feel the weight of it
feel the weight of it
right
that's a good pen that's plain doctor
mhm
mm i like that
yes
yeah
yeah
oh
no
it's er for years and
now
years and years i've tried to get a pen i was
comfortable with and
she got in UNK square and it's a it's a good one
he's like that
oh yes
he wanted one that was that was balanced
but it's not as good as that
oh i'm sure it is
UNK just slightly different
and i mean i paid a hundred odd pounds for it
aye
and it's
no help at all
but this one
i like
doctor will i be alright
i mean am i
oh you'll be alright
will this go away doctor
yes
yes
but you take your UNK that's the se that's the secret
use your UNK
last UNK is UNK attached to diet
cos really i was awfully
ill with it last night
they don't they don't really know
they don't know
some people find that if they take UNK
UNK
chocolate
some
could be anything
chocolate
sweets
red wine
well wine and i
er
are not
eggs
cheese
i've known people who have been upset by you know
yeah
b all of those
and does this thing go away or does it stay for
ah it comes and goes
thousands of
last week i was quite ill i people
ev everyone gets some spells
yes
people
everyone gets spells when th they have UNK and upset
it was just
UNK and
oh i'm going to go off my head
no
no
that's not the UNK
ah
that's not the UNK
UNK on the bowels
no it's the UNK causing the trouble with the bowels
ah
oh the other all that's up here
and goes down the way
we'll need to get a transplant in here
yeah
so it's two can i take
i couldn't take any more UNK
er
well i'll come back in weeks and
have a go
yes
aye
you could take
say two
er
if you take your morning one
the morning till night time
don't keep me in the house
don't shut me in
yeah
if you take your morning one about nine o'clock you could quite easily take one about three o'clock in the afternoon
and then two before bedtime
and then two before bedtime
give yourself six hours
can i come back and see you tomorrow
yes
yes
not at all
no
no
you come back any time
try to me
oh i'll do my i'll do my

son down there
give me
that's medical
my son has got a phone near the door and
yeah
i was confession in the remember rightly
yeah
UNK attacks
aha
he's coming up with her next time
right
the best thing to get would be er UNK
right doctor
that's an UNK
to keep
UNK
keep the all these reactions under control
she'll get you'll get a box in the chemist for about
right
one fifty
UNK
UNK
i mean it's quite serious
yes
oh yes
it is
oh aye
off her head
families are strange
families are
strange
doctor
cheerio now
right
cheerio now
what she's going to do
right
erm i'm here as a representative
of a small company from york called and what we're doing is we're working on behalf of the group who compile and publish the english dictionary
and what i'm doing here today is i'm recording this seminar as an instance of spoken english in the nineteen nineties
which will go towards making a corpus of information from which will draw the meaning and usage of words as it was in the nineteen nineties
and this information will be UNK analyzed and then used to help compile the new dictionary which will be coming out in a few years
so i thank you all very much for taking part in this and i hope you have a happy seminar
the people at the back may not be picked up on this so erm
he should be here any minute
right
good morning ladies and gentlemen
morning
sorry for coming in under the wire at er nine fourteen according to this clock
erm UNK asked me to open this morning's erm quality seminar
erm a you're in for quite a good day
i know that er the seminar which i attended UNK off quite a lot of lively er debate
and er at the end of it i think we all felt we knew where we were going and what the work that we'd put in over the last three years on the management procedures which form the foundations of our quality system
er i think we came to realize what that work was all in aid of
the management team had i'll sit down if you don't mind the management team has decided that we were going to go for quality because it was a matter of survival
the industry which we are part of is in excuse me is in er sorry about this i've UNK across here
i i'll read from UNK notes if you don't mind
erm i would like to remind you of my objectives quoted at the time in th in the quality manual
er to adopt best practices er from the various offices to help produce a better end product
to delegate decision making down as far as possible
and as far as our group's vision statement is concerned to be acknowledged as the leading consultant in the rail er in the field of railway engineering
to provide a professional service UNK i'm sorry dennis would you just excuse me
can i hand over to you
i do apologize
right
sorry about that
sorry i'm totally UNK for this
erm to start at the top and unfortunately i'll UNK notes
perhaps UNK slightly
erm it's now thr nearly three years since management procedures were introduced as the first stage of our aspirations to become quality assured
and i would like to you remind you of my objectives quoted at that time and as are stated in the er manual
that is firstly to adopt best practice from various offices which hopefully would help us to provide a better end product
and to delegate decision making er to as low a level as possible within the organization compatible with UNK er the quality of the product that we provide to our clients
the group as you are aware do have a vision statement erm which has been published er and it was er developed a couple of years ago er great effort by the er management team
and that vision statement is to be acknowledged as the leading consultant in the railway i in the fields of railway engineering
to provide a professional service satisfying our UNK needs and UNK their expectations
to be a well trained dedicated and highly motivated team and to be committed totally to safety
now that vision has not changed
that is still the group's er vision and stated objectives
erm as far as certification of er th the of a system is concerned er we are still UNK committed to getting office UNK and as many of you may be aware the UNK office has actually UNK us on the b e s side erm and they are er but hopefully we will achieve certification for the whole of our group erm prior to UNK achieving certification for their whole group
the subtle difference is tha that UNK are going function by function and getting er five certificates
er ours is a slightly more difficult task i would suggest a much more difficult task in that we're trying to go for one certificate for the whole of the group
erm we believe er if we are to demonstrate to our clients that we are as good or better than our UNK competitors then we need certification
and this is seen as a matter of survival
er fairly recently we were asked to tender for erm a new station at UNK for UNK and one of the UNK of that job er which was a ten million pound project er one of the UNK of that job was that we should either be UNK or at least have a quality assurance erm system in place
and because er we do have a quality assurance system in place although not UNK er we were able to tender for that work
otherwise we would have not been able to tender
erm i think i'll leave this up till
the basic message of quality which mike will er explain later on is if you improve quality your costs decrease
because you are continually reducing the number of mistakes that you make and continually UNK improving
erm and therefore you produce less wasted time less UNK work er and a cheaper product
erm quality could be regarded as an empty word
we need to bring it about and it can only be done through UNK
that's the point that UNK has set as one of his objectives for the next twelve months is to get the group acting as one team and not five or six separate teams
erm this is going to be extremely difficult because the british culture is one of every man for himself
people tend not to work particularly well in teams in this country
erm but it's something that we need to work at
and th the UNK actually score in this because they actually believe totally in UNK
erm we need to change our culture
erm i think really i'll just leave it there cos i'm a bit struggling a little bit to remember quite what UNK was saying
if you appreciate i was actually thrown into the very deep end
i think perhaps what's going to be said to you to the rest of the day erm will actually bring out the key points tha that UNK was trying to make
one was that quality is here
quality is here to stay
quality is improvement
and the other aspect is one of working as a team
i think those were the two main messages that UNK wished to get across today and that we will concentrate on er during the rest of this seminar
erm th that the seminar is going to be lead by mike
er mike is from associates and mike has been helping the q a team on a part time basis and putting some sensible thought into how the group should go forward
erm but before mike comes on i would just like er norman to make a few comments er on his commitment to the group's er quality system
morning
er quality
definition of quality right product at the right time at the right price
now in p way design we have no problems with that do we
or do we
erm we are the most profitable part of the s a u
no problems about that
er we've no great problems with our technical results and where they are we sort them out quite UNK with the area people
we meet our main UNK which are normally the key deadline normally the s and c
we meet it don't we
so there's no problem
or is there
just looking at it in a bit more detail
we're profitable but we normally don't compete with anyone else for getting the work
so effectively we put in what is a fair price and we get the job and we do it normally within the price or within a slight overspend
but where we have UNK accidentally in one case deliberately in another we've been UNK by our UNK and we haven't got the job
also a good UNK where we've been able to compare ourselves with civil engineering scaled fees which was on the UNK bank slip which was a job which went completely right perfect no problems
if we'd have put in a price based on a c scaled fees we would have UNK by a hundred and fifty five percent
so we thought
so perhaps there's a little bit of work we can do in er in that sphere
the right time
how many times have i had someone come and say can you sign this drawing please
it has to go to john tonight
he's taking it for the meeting tomorrow
er how many times have we said yeah we can do this job but we'll it needs the route improvement that we're doing for arthur
or er UNK in no hurry
well arthur is a very reasonable and good friends with us
but he notices it builds up he starts thinking to himself they're always late
it's no great problem but i'm not getting it on time
yet he begins to notice if we do it
think about our finished product
i said you know the minor er UNK and UNK we er tidy up quite UNK with the area people normally
but what we've got to bear in mind is that minor UNK in our design can be very serious when translated to a job on the ground which
also the person who has helped us sort out maybe come to sensible engineering conclusion on the minor problem but be saying to his chief there was a problem with the york though i just managed to sort it out
and that builds up
also what you've got to bear in mind is that UNK in any permanent way job is the capacity for something to go wrong
and when something goes wrong there's UNK and when there's UNK people will UNK for ways out
that is the time for there to be nothing wrong with our drawings
drawings can be blamed when er there is actually nothing wrong and people are looking for an excuse blame from themselves
so again for reasons like that we have to maintain the confidence of the client
and that today is what it's all about
if the client is confident that he's getting the best deal from us he will say alright birmingham ar are cheaper than york on a route improvement say but i've had one of their cheap jobs before
i'll stick with york and get value for money
erm drawing the client is he has confidence in us say well york have got their act together
if the s if the s and if the s and t give them a fair crack of the whip
there's no problems with york they always given me a good service in the past
and the er technical quality of our drawings the client if he has confidence will say who are you trying to kid
york drawings are good
just UNK you're trying to d divert attention erm disturb UNK
so it's a question of us retaining because to a certain extent we already have it due to our customer past
retaining and UNK customer confidence
and this is where b s five seven UNK five o certification or i s o nine thousand and one certification is important to us
as dennis has said from er UNK erm er statement it is a requirement nowadays
and it's valuable to us in three aspects
first of all certification is a UNK of achievement like having a degree and you need a degree or an h n c or an o n c
it's a statement in itself
more importantly it's er UNK to the client that we care about quality that we've gone to the trouble to set up procedures which make our product as good as it possibly can be
and thirdly it has a very real er value in that in going for er certification we are actually putting checks and procedures in place which will help to ensure that what we do is the right price is to the right time and is the right product
so that's basically all
er just one after thought dennis mentioned UNK now we we've been together for a few years basically but you might say we work as a team everyone gets on everyone helps each other out
we do within p way design which is probably the best office i've ever worked in for that
but what we've got to bear in mind is that we are a multi functional group
there's UNK involved works office involved to a lesser extent b e s
so that is really where a weakness is it's in UNK the needs of other parts of the group
that's something that we do have to work on and i can't emphasize it too strongly
okay
er i've said a lot
so i'll er leave you to mike to take things further
thank you very much norman that's great
have you all got a programme in the folder
so that you've got a vague idea of er what's going to UNK you for the rest of today
okay
we'd very much like you to feel free to ask any questions or comment er on the er presentations during the course of the morning
er and this afternoon
so don't hesitate to ask questions or discuss points which you feel erm have not be made very clearly or perhaps with which you don't even agree
and let's try and resolve any issues which come up like that
what we want to do this morning is erm tt talk a little bit to you about er the quality system and the i s o nine thousand procedures and er UNK er systems which have been developed so far within the whole group
er and we want to try and explain a little bit about tt how far we got in terms of achieving certification to i s o nine thousand
but we then want to er explain w what this business of quality planning is all about
because we believe very strongly wi that with an organization like yours where each piece of work that you do is slightly different from other pieces of work to have er a single m way an approach to following the work er is really not the right er thing to do at all
what we're looking for is a quality system and a set of procedures which are flexible enough to enable you to handle the UNK jobs which you haven't got a lot of fee income for
and we want you to able to handle the complex jobs which require an awful lot of checking and a lot of er a lot er detail because the fee for the job is i is higher and the job complexity is high
er and we want to be able to have a mechanism within our i s o nine thousand system which enables us to tackle different jobs of different complexity
so that's er essentially this morning's er programme and the objectives which we want to try and er look at and achieve
first and foremost though we want to go back to basics and erm get our ideas absolutely straight as regards what quality is and what we're trying to achieve with i s o nine thousand
there's a lot of misunderstanding about i s o nine thousand and i think that UNK er analogy a few seconds ago is really rather good
if you're asking a civil engineer to do some work for you i if that civil engineer has a degree does it automatically mean that the work's going to be perfect and wonderful
no
it doesn't does it
erm but there are certain civil engineering activities which e i'm thinking perhaps more about the bridge design side of things really but there are certain activities which actually demand a certain level of qualification before you can actually sign off drawings or a or agree to calculations or whatever
yes
so the fact that you've got a degree or an h n c or whatever is actually a starting point
it it's er a level from which you y you er you progress and it's the same with i s o nine thousand or five seven five o
it's really no guarantee of UNK but it's a sort of measure
it is a level a starting point and perhaps er we'll pursue this concept during the next er hour or so
let's look at what quality is in basic terms
we've got somebody from the oxford english er dictionary UNK er arena with us today and i i'm almost tempted to ask clare what wh what the definition of the word quality is actually
but do you know what the what a typical dictionary would give as the definition of quality
we s it's a word we use quite a lot
wh what's the definition of the word
i told you they'd be quiet to start with
any ideas
what do we mean when we use the word quality in normal day to day language
we use the word often enough don't we
any ideas
we've got all day yes
we started early
come on
perfect
excellent
above average
excellent
perfect
above average
this is great yes
any more ideas
the oxford dictionary UNK the word excellence or UNK with erm a piece of phraseology degree of
erm now what's the problem with this definition
if you ask two people to go away and do the same job with a degree of excellence are you to get the same result at the end of the day
from the two different people
it's not really a very clear definition is it
from a work point of view degree of excellence it's too vague
so unfortunately we're not able to manage quality if we use the dictionary definition of degree of excellence
we need to have something better or something different
so this is the first problem where w we talk about the management of quality
we have to change the definition of the word that we've grown up with over the years otherwise we really can't manage the concept
and this is where all our problems start
it would have been nice actually if somebody had said we're not going to have quality management we're going to have UNK management
or something like that then we could have of we could have UNK this new word and we wouldn't have had these awful UNK that we get
but what we have to do is completely UNK the definition of the word quality that we've grown up with over the years
but we still use the UNK word
so where do we go
well i think that a number of you might have seen that definition of quality
have you come across fitness for purpose
one o one or two UNK
thirteen blank looks
four co
one or two people completely UNK
that's not that's fair average really isn't it i think
now this definition fitness for purpose erm fits in very nicely with i s o nine thousand and the requirements in the quality systems standard
er it's a little bit vague is fitness for purpose but it fits in with i s o nine thousand quite well because of the con of another little concept
we're talking about concepts rather a lot this morning
how do we find out what the purpose is
if we're going to do er a job
right
where do get the specification from
the client
yeah
the hint behind this phrase is that it wouldn't be a bad idea to talk to the customer talk to the client
erm i know this is a bit of shock horror to some of you
i mean the client what do they know about anything
might as well go and talk to the UNK as some of your clients mightn't you
but the theory is that if we if we get to know what the purpose er o of the job or the assignment is er then we stand a slightly better chance of er getting a satisfied client at the end of the day
however it's still a vague definition and we often find it more useful to er tidy that definition up by introducing UNK with requirements
so having found what the er the purpose of the exercise is what the job is that we're trying to do we need to beef up the detail a and start to define requirements
now actually this is a very good definition of the word quality
it's a very good definition but what are the potential problems with that definition
requirements have changed
w we've got a problem i think with the word requirements er in several senses and al UNK you're absolutely right on that
er it's a bit like shifting UNK at times isn't it
and you know very well that as soon as you start to launch yourself into the world of contracting by its very nature a contract a automatically has UNK in it and the more you write in a contract the more UNK you've got
therefore it's actually quite difficult to define really accurately requirements
let me give you another example if you're going to ask people to clean a railway carriage what do you mean by clean
do you mean inside or outside
say inside
what do we mean by clean
well if you're going to ask some poor devil to clean er a carriage out isn't it fair to tell them what it is you mean by clean
what result you want at the end of the day
but what do we do in practice
we just say here's a bucket
here's a UNK
you know you know what clean is
get on with that
well that's not fair is it
really
on the individual
because it means you can always criticize the individual for either not having done the job well enough or for having not done it quite the way you thought it ought to be done
i think that's a good example of where defining requirements is quite difficult
and where defining requirements is difficult what tends to happen is that we don't bother
now this is where i think the japanese score dramatically they spend many hours defining things which we say it's not worth the effort to define
and if we put a little bit more effort into UNK requirements more tightly then there'd be less argument at the end of the day as to whether we've done a good job or a bad job
and i s o nine thousand and quality management is very much about trying because it is it is hard work and we can't necessarily succeed i in every situation
but it's about trying to define requirements to the to the best erm level and best degree
and then setting out our way of operating to meet the specifications and requirements that we've set for ourselves
and the fitness for purpose at the back of all this indicates that it's not a bad idea to talk to the client
because if you define requirements in an UNK tower and you don't talk to the client you're gonna produce something which isn't exactly what they necessarily want
now somebody very er UNK brought up the word client perception and in fact we h were given the definition earlier from UNK notes of meeting and UNK customer expectations
but if we are going to meet expectations of clients then really we have to know exactly what it is the client needs and would be happy with
and we have to specify internally to us what will meet the client needs and even just exceed the client needs
and that is what we have to do within the time and organization constraints which norman er correctly mentioned earlier
and the whole business of managing the time the resources and the meeting the specifications is very much a matter which quality management addresses
now as we go on i'd just like to bring in another er thought for you is that view graph correct
there is no high or low quality
is that correct
UNK giving us a really positive nod over there and a lot of very suspicious people round the table geoff who don't agree with you i think
what do you think
do you agree
i would think that in the terms that you want to define it in that UNK true but i wouldn't necessarily agree with it
right
sorry to be awkward
no
no
this is that's really great
thanks
thanks
thanks
thanks
but you see what we've got here is this problem of the old definition of quality still UNK there in the mind quality is a degree of excellence therefore you have high quality and low quality
but if we if we UNK that definition and then go to UNK with requirements we either conform with the requirements as geoff said or we don't
now a very important issue in relation to UNK with requirements is that we can go over the top we can go o t as we say
now then is going over the top and spending more money and producing an absolutely UNK job fabulous result is that quality
and the answer is no it isn't
because you haven't managed quality
we've got an excellent result at the end of the day but what's the point of having an excellent result if we're bankrupt next week
and what does it tell us about our management
w what we have to do with quality management is introduce the horses for courses idea
i mentioned earlier the quick UNK jobs
we can't put all the bells and UNK and all the checks and all the consultations and design reviews onto a job which gives us a fee income of er two thousand pounds
we do have you do have some small cheap jobs which have to be attended to very efficiently
that's not to say that these won't be quality jobs
it's just that the quality the UNK with requirements will be defined differently
okay
so we don't have low quality jobs and high quality jobs we have quality jobs with different standards attached to them
and i think this is perhaps a slight confusion because very often would you agree that we tend to use the quality and standard UNK
high standard high quality
low standard low quality
yeah
whereas what we're trying to do with this new definition of quality now is get the idea of UNK with requirements
er over t to ourselves
if the requirements are modest er modest requirements with modest standards it's still a quality job if we achieve what we said we're going to do
a and the key to the quality idea is that we manage job in order that we achieve the modest standards and satisfy the client at the end of the day accurately
now this is a difficult thing to take on board when we are used to idea of quality being degree of excellence
wouldn't you agree that in normal day to day language if we see a line of cars going down a road and one of them happens to be a rolls UNK we would say that's the quality car
yes
th that would be a normal use of the word
but in fact is a rolls UNK a quality car if you want to go shopping and you want to be able to park it in small UNK places and get round UNK car parks
you know all those UNK marks on UNK car parks
they're all made by big cars
so we have to accept that a car that might be fit for the purpose of shopping in a town where the parking places are small and the UNK car parks are difficult to drive round er a quality car might be a mini
as long as it doesn't break down
is that is that reasonable
so quality can be a mini it can be a rolls UNK
it is not automatically always a rolls UNK
and we hopefully are going to manage our business in such a way that we can accept that a mini is a quality result
if that is what we specified we wanted in the first place
ca can you live with that
i can see what you're trying to do i just think
great
UNK the definition
yes we are
yes we are
the UNK car park
pay his parking ticket
you'd get UNK
would you be able to afford the two hundred pounds to get it out of the parking
and
i understand exactly what you're saying it's just that erm
w we are
trying to change definition
this is why i say it's a shame that we
usage
it's a shame that we still carry on using the word quality
isn't it
t to talk about quality management
it would have been better if we'd got another word really
yeah
so we are we are UNK the definition if you like a and er UNK the word which is most
why
unfortunate
why didn't the word standard get put in the place of quality we can have standard assurance as opposed to quality assurance
i think one of the reasons for that geoff is that standard in itself is a slightly UNK word
and it tends to be used in terms of the UNK that we've got on our drawings the word quality which has been UNK into the arena where we may actually use it to describe the whole management of the operation not the management of the or the second part of the UNK of the specification
but i in theory there's no reason why we couldn't have done s sort of upset the word er standard i suppose rather than quality
but anyway w we're on board with the general
thing which is important
i'm sorry i'm sorry i've been a bit steady getting there but i think it's an important issue to tackle that quality is horses for courses and we have to accept the fact that we're gonna get prestige type jobs and quick UNK jobs especially in the beginning of march every year
right
where did quality management come from
well i think some of you may possibly have seen this view graph before
have we a got a visitor
ha
messages
what a surprise
right
if we erm look at the origins of quality
if we go back to the middle ages we had the situation of UNK where one individual was responsible for the design of what they were doing the selection of the materials regarding what they were doing
that individual was responsible for using hand skills and producing a result at the end of the day
and people lived or died by their ability to produce a competent result at the end of the day
and that was fairly literal if you think in terms of the village blacksmith making a UNK
which was about the most complex technology in those days
then a few hundred years later we had the industrial revolution what was the big step change from UNK to the industrial revolution
it was the technology wasn't it
yes
yes
it was the introduction of technology
what did that do for skill levels
it produced a small number of highly skilled
people didn't it
the tool makers and the people with their machinery and all the rest of it
b but for most of erm really UNK
there are a lot of people like that weren't there
who were brought in at a very level
now so erm UNK in er in some respects was lost although there are these points i have mentioned
and what was found was that the new technology didn't produce a hundred percent UNK
to coin a phrase
it didn't produce UNK and so people introduced inspection
they introduced inspection at the beginning of processes they introduced inspection part way through processes and they introduced inspection at the end of the th the total process
why do we have inspection part way through the process
why didn't we just check things in at the beginning and check things out at the end
so you didn't waste your time if the product that was no good half way through
yeah
it's to stop adding value to stuff that's already rubbish isn't it
stop wasting it's a matter of waste control
that's right
erm and inspection got pretty sophisticated
i've put quality control as something slightly separate from inspection
would anybody like to hazard a guess as to what we could possibly mean as the difference between these two words
well you have two different kinds of quality
one
one might
right
so you're saying that an assessment of the inspection results is quality control
well you've gotta have a definition or a standard to inspect against really i think geoff as well
otherwise you can't say it's good bad or UNK
but i am actually trying to get at is a slight development of what you've said
you we you were virtually there in terms of our standard understanding of these two words
quality control is inspection with a formal feedback to the pr process
to the production process
okay
inspection you just you just sit there and UNK things out
the good from the bad
quality control actually formally takes the results back to the production process people and tells them to adjust the process
and then we have quality assurance
this came along only in fact in the in the late nineteen fifties early sixties
quality control had become terribly sophisticated during the er war time era when i a people realized it actually took longer to inspect a bullet than it did to manufacture it
so what they did was introduce statistical techniques whereby not every bullet was UNK a sample was UNK and great conclusions were drawn from very careful examination of a small number of items
now this is all very product orientated isn't it
this quality management
well what happened was that in nine in the nineteen fifties the late nineteen fifties the americans designed and built six UNK to try and catch the russians up
and they failed
erm tt this is supposedly how they used to teach their kids how to count
erm what happened was they got three UNK to the launch pad lit the blue touch paper and they UNK in great clouds of flame and smoke six feet above the launch er area
but they'd got three left
so they UNK them all with a fine tooth UNK getting mixed UNK
they brought in a heap of people to UNK these UNK and inspectors as er examined every part of the UNK
they found nothing wrong
they UNK these three UNK back together the remaining ones
lit the blue touch paper and they all UNK in great clouds of flame and smoke six feet above the launch pad
