and they realized that all their efforts in controlling quality by inspection and so on had failed
now this particular exercise was in fact a major project in management terms it was very similar to what you do
you manage projects don't you
very small projects and some quite large ones
and some lessons were learnt from that exercise which were UNK in documents called quality systems standards
and the lessons learned were how to manage projects better than we'd been managing projects before
typically when we have problems we say ah the materials weren't quite right
or we made a little fault with the design
we didn't quite manage to construct the er item concerned adequately
we never ever have the right resources
we have people problems
and typically what we do when things go wrong is we UNK around and sort the materials out
we allow ourselves a little bit more time to get the design right cos the reason we got it wrong in the first place was because it was a quick spend project and nobody er had time to do it properly
erm construction well i don't want to cast too many UNK comments about but there is a strange habit of employing people who do not know what they're entirely supposed to be doing
erm resources is always a problem
we get paid and promoted for rushing round and solving problems wh that we've created for ourselves
don't we
there are other problems as well that we'd have to tackle
poor planning
erm i presume you're no different from other people
planning is a er it is a historical activity
isn't it
it's about reporting what you did last week
planning isn't it
yes
yes i think we've got a culture block in this country with planning
erm jus just to make you feel a little bit more comfortable about it
er occasionally i go over to erm hull and to run some training courses for
they've got an international training centre there which used to be a UNK
it's a terrible place
and erm yo you have these rooms the size of UNK you know
absolutely dreadful
anyway erm occasionally they will UNK upon the group a german person or a UNK national
and when we give the people UNK or group exercises to do the group with the UNK person or german person in it is subjected to now what is it we are supposed to be doing now
we must write down the objectives of this exercise
we must plan what we are going to do
and the dutch and the english put up with this for about fifteen seconds
and then they take their jackets off and rush down the road at five thousand miles an hour and when you say to them but you're going in the wrong direction
they say well that doesn't matter
we're having a good time
you know
we're busy
we're enjoying it
i think we have a we do a slight culture block on planning
erm UNK work
we're UNK out of pint pots
you've all got friends and relations in er other jobs and they've all been struggling for the last two or three years haven't they
under a lot of pressure trying to get UNK out of pint pots and i think y you you've suffered the same way
erm never mind the quality feel the width
you know just get the stuff out of the gate
poor plant equipment is something which is probably doesn't affect you quite directly
erm but it would affect the people you deal with
poor supervision
i don't mean poor supervisors i mean at every level of management
we don't seem to get the supervision quite right we either over do it or under do it
poor specification
we're back to this business of quality is UNK with requirements
how much effort do we put into defining the requirements
misunderstanding of contracts deliberate or otherwise
and it's a well known scientific fact that quality as a degree of excellence equals rolls UNK
equals something that's incredibly expensive and it's a jolly good idea for other people
if they can afford it
okay
so these are the sorts of problems we get
now the american space scientists asked this UNK question
they said why do we get poor materials
why do we get poor designs
why do we plan badly
why do we have poor supervision
and that was the answer
there are three possible answers
acts of god junior staff and management
now i know some of you will find d er find it rather difficult to distinguish between those two
but in all UNK what percentage of our problems are caused by UNK rain wind snow blow fire and UNK
small amount
how small
well what percentage would you say
guess
think that's reasonable
it depends if it's the wrong sort of fog again
it depends which country you're in as well
but by and large
it's less it's actually less than one percent
er what percentage of problems are caused by these terrible people
well shall i tell you what the directors of the construction company said
they said ninety five
percent
then they said we do accept some responsibility for about four percent of problems
and the reality is of course
it's the other way
it's the other way round
yes
management have to take responsibility for over ninety five percent of the problems we get whether they're safety problems quality problems or whatever problems
so what do we do about this
well we er the obvious er immediate i idea would be to sack the management and promote the junior staff
i think you're safe margaret
they didn't believe that
right
so what do we do about this
cos management are causing ninety five percent of all our problems so what are we going to do about them
UNK them
let's we've got to look at what it is that management are making a mess of
and we've gotta look at a training programme haven't we
again if we go back to the example then it's not too personal to then is it
erm we have twenty people in a group and we go around and ask then how much post school technical and professional training they've had we would come out with an average group of a total of about a hundred years of post school professional and technical training
if we go round the same group and ask them how much management training they've had we'd be lucky if we could dredge up fifty weeks
because i it is assumed management is learned by picking up the bad habits of your predecessor and their UNK for the last five hundred years
there's not very much really formal management train in fact as an employer is really rather good compared with most people we come across
in the outside world
and in fact in this area
we have some UNK from some of the older people er in the group here because they er didn't get much when they were at the UNK stages of their careers
right
what i've done now is taken you through to the point where we're asking ourselves what is it that management make a mess of
and what can we train management in to be better
well the answer is the index of i s o nine thousand and one
because what i s o nine thousand and one is the result of the investigation that the american space scientists did in nineteen fifty nine to find out what areas management are weak in
and they identified in nineteen fifty nine eighteen areas of management activity that management consistently made a mess of
and in fact it's grown to twenty areas in the intervening thirty odd years so that's not bad UNK empire building really is it thought it might have been one hundred and forty eight by now but it's not
but it's grown to twenty areas
now i s o nine thousand and one is nothing more nothing less than a list of things that management should address a little more carefully
there's nothing revolutionary in i s o nine thousand and one
there aren't any bolts out of the blue
there aren't any UNK new ideas or concepts
it's all really rather boring actually
but what it tells us is that in these twenty areas management should try and think about what it is they can do to prevent problems
with the best will in the world we're not going to be perfect first time round so we've got to have detection interaction mechanisms
but in i s o nine thousand and one there is also a thread of quality improvement in each of the areas which we're supposed to address
and the quality improvement is once we have found that we've got a problem how do we stop it recurring
how do we stop the same type of problem recurring
there's a learning curve
the theory is we do not invent the wheel every day
right
now i want to hand you over to dennis hop hopefully not too UNK dennis
and erm what i'd like is for dennis is to explain a little about how far we've actually got with the c e d g approach to the introduction of i s o nine thousand
so having introduced the idea that i s o nine thousand is about improving our management competence it's not about improving our technical competence we are technically very good
it's the management that fails us
er i'd like to r er throw it over to dennis with the er stage there so that er we explain how far we got in addressing these management UNK issues
alright dennis
right
thank you very much mike
quality in management systems
well mike has explained that quality isn't quality
erm and management doesn't
er so you can be even more confused with quality management system
erm the next session is rather hard work for you cos it's very much sort of listening and UNK a hell of a lot of facts but i trust you will bear with me
and it does get easier towards lunchtime when we allow you to play
erm the management team is committed to the group's quality system
and the management team expect all staff to be equally committed
the system UNK procedures which are designed to assist staff in carrying out their work in a planned consistent and economic manner
and procedures are intended to foster and not UNK the exercising of professional engineering judgement and creative problem solving
that's what mike has just said
the group has got two aims one is certification of the system to i s o nine thousand and one and the second very important one is the continual improvement of the system as er to make a change in working practices and business organizations and UNK
like all things these days we have a quality policy statement
erm this is bound up in the group's quality system manual which will be distributed to you on monday
er and much of what i'm going to say today in the next twenty minutes i it's bound in here so there's no need to take notes
it's there to be read and to be worked to
the group's policy is produce work of a quality UNK with the requirements of the job
rolls UNK versus the mini scenario
quality completion on time and safety are regarded as UNK and quality is of course of UNK importance in our railway environment
so how do we achieve quality
you may disagree with it but this is the management UNK stated view of achieving quality
we need to have an organization structure with defined individual responsibilities
we have established procedures for carrying out the work
we agree clear UNK with the clients
we ensure that those UNK are fully understood by the project team before work starts
we insist the UNK design and i'm UNK design is the responsibility of the function and section engineers who have bottom line responsibility for each project
we allocate specified assigned tasks to staff with the necessary skills and abilities to undertake those tasks
and this experience can be gained either by formal education and or on the job training
if you haven't got the skill you should not be asked to undertake that task until you are trained or UNK
we encourage good internal and external communications
and as we brought out first thing this morning communication within the group that is across the functions and also in some cases within the functions is poor
we act as separate cells we need to act as a team
we insist that all work leaving the office is suitably checked and i underline the word suitably checked
the degree of checking is determined by the section engineer responsible for the project
we recognize that every member of the group can contribute to the development and improvement and success of the group and we encourage every member to make their contribution to the group's success
now there's nothing new revolutionary exciting in that
that is all good sound common sense and hopefully that is what we are currently practising
if we just first look at the organization that we have or perhaps more correctly will have following consultation erm i think you will agree with me that the roles and responsibilities of those people are fairly well defined
the group engineer function heads and project team and section engineers
if we just quickly look at the role of the project coordinator
the man in the middle there
or person in the middle
sorry
all work within the group is assigned as projects and for each project a project coordinator is appointed
project coordinator will almost invariably be a section engineer
however when the complexity of the job demands it he will be a function engineer
in addition to their other responsibilities the project coordinator is responsible for a number activities
he is responsible for developing and agreeing the total c e d g remit with the client
not the function remit the total remit
he is also the formal point of contact between the group and the client and as such he is required to coordinate the group's activities on a UNK given project
he will in cooperation with section engineers and team quantity surveyors develop project quality plans and we'll explain those later today and he will also sign off the project quality plan and the client's appointment contract
UNK he will sign off client reports
and the client reports are a single report covering all the functions on a specified project
the section engineer who can also be a project coordinator a as i've explained is responsible for directing the group of project engineers and for UNK all aspects of the project within his section to ensure that they are technically adequate t to ensure they are technically adequate have quality and we are providing safe service to the client
he is also responsible for appointing the project team within his own section
and also responsible for preparing the project quality plan for his section
the project engineer is responsible for the day to day development of the project and he will undertake the requirements of a project quality plan to meet all the necessary current standards
and the project engineer will be assisted by resident engineers UNK quantity surveyors and not forgetting of course clerical support
we tend to forget the clerks
and that really is the fundamental principles behind the management procedures and the group's quality system
it's what we've been working at for the last three years
the set up i've described there UNK itself with the manner in which most consultants work
in essence the section engineer is equivalent to an associate and takes bottom line responsibility for all his projects
that is completion on time to spec and within the fee bid
let's look at the group's procedures with emphasis on the quality system
our quality system like any other has two UNK aspects
they are our clients needs and expectations and our own needs and expectation and i interests
as a service organization we must continually meet the needs and expectations of our clients and in the most economic way
to meet these aspirations we must make the best use of our human UNK material and financial resources and this must be done within the framework of a well planned and a well managed system
our clients also need the assurance and confidence that we have the ability to provide a service which consistently meets their requirements
therefore it is necessary to maintain UNK evidence that our system not only exists but is being operated as intended
and the above factors form the basis of our quality system
very much a UNK of what mike said this morning
if we just look at that system and the hierarchy of documentation that forms the system hopefully things will start to gel with you with regard to the management procedures
at the top we have i s o nine thousand and one
erm beneath i s o nine thousand and one we have the group's quality manual
and the quality manual are the white sheets contained within this red folder
beneath the quality manual we have quality systems and UNK sorry
sorry
quality system procedures which also include project quality plans
and beneath those we have the much loved management procedures
this in essence is the key for the group's system
if we look at management er procedures could ask the question but i'm the mo more cynical of you will er not answer in the right way what are management procedures
they aim to collect together the best practices from within the group
those that have been found to work
and then to communicate these to all of our staff
they're quite simply a collection of directives
or instructions which advise the staff how a particular project how a particular task is undertaken with guidance on why we do it
who is responsible for the task and who makes the decisions
which members of the organization need to be involved in that task and which don't
and they also contain the standard pr UNK used within the group
they're live documents which are subject to revision as the organization changes and as we improve
and they are there to be worked to until such time as we find a better way of doing it
they provide UNK across the group
they ensure that best practice is adopted
they cut out spanish practice and job creation which is UNK or has been UNK within some quarters of the group
in essence they are the group's instruction manual or practice notes as our UNK er colleagues prefer to call them
quite simply they are UNK work statements for specific activities which UNK and UNK the current working practice throughout the group
they can be considered under three headings
there are those which address the UNK the requirements of i s o nine thousand and one i s o nine thousand
i s o nine thousand and one through project quality plans
those which fulfil the requirements of i s o nine thousand and one erm through quality system procedures
and those which have absolutely no affect on the quality of the service that we provide to our client but they form board requirements legal and other requirements admin arrangements local instructions and policy
that is drawn to scale
seventy five percent of what is contained within the blue manual has nothing to do with the quality of the service that we provide to our clients
what we've attempted to do is to put all of our instructions into one manual so that we don't view quality as an add on or something extra
it is all part of living and breathing doing things that come naturally
does that help
begin to help
if we then look at the quality manual which is the white document contained within here
this is very much an overview document and describes the way in which the group UNK its business
it is the document which can be UNK by our existing and prospective clients to enable them to gain an insight into our quality system
it defines how our quality system relates to us and our activities
and it describes how the requirements of i s o nine thousand and one are satisfied within the group
and it forms a reference document to the full scope of a quality system
and it is the document which the quality auditors will initially use to check that the quality system exists is operating and is fit for the purpose
now because the quality manual is very much an overview document we need to introduce more detailed documents which control the day to day operation of the quality system
and these are called the quality system procedures
and again they're bound in here
there are seven quality system procedures
in essence these are stand alone management procedures except they are printed on pink paper
i'm not UNK by the way i put them in that order for a reason
we have quality system procedure number one which is the quality reference summary
this will be used almost exclusively by quality auditors at the start of the audit trail and provide a simple matrix
er and this is an extract from it provides a simple erm matrix which identifies the clause in i s o nine thousand and one and then identifies which management procedure or quality system procedure er relates to that particular clause in i s o nine thousand and one
this starts to UNK the blue book hopefully and identifies those which refer to the quality whi which are quality procedures and those which are the other procedures
q s p six er gives UNK job descriptions and sets down broad responsibility statements relating to quality and safety
q s p seven project quality plans we are going to be talking about in great detail after the after coffee and also through your UNK at lunchtime
you have to remember that all work assigned within the group is organized as projects and as a service organization no two of our projects are identical
consequently those sections of i s o nine thousand and one which deal with project specific act activities are addressed through project quality plans
quality system procedures two to five provide the mechanism by which our quality system is constantly reviewed updated and improved
and this afternoon mike is going to be talking about UNK product control UNK actions and internal quality audits
erm and this is really the mechanism by which you can ensure the continuous or continual improvement of the quality system
and it UNK the group's quality statement that recognizes that all staff have a voice and this voice should be heard
these procedures will give you the opportunity of getting your voice heard
quality system procedure two talks about how the management team pick up suggestions made by yourselves through q s p three and set about making decisions for improvement of the group's quality system the service that we provide to our clients
and that really is group's quality system
and hopefully i've ou i've hopefully you've found nothing too painful in what i've outlined there
and hopefully i've shown you the key that UNK some of the mystery of the blue book
the blue book is really our instruction manual and the red book UNK that to help us identify those procedures which affect the quality of service that we provide to our clients
erm now the other thing i mentioned at the beginning was certification of the system
and i recognize there are a few people here who are not p way people
erm works q s business manager b e s have been through the same process as you're going through today
erm and you are currently here erm and your teach ins
tomorrow the other half of the p way section will be having their teach ins and on monday the intention is that quality system procedures quality plans etcetera will be introduced within the p way office
currently working in the works office q s and the business managers and b e s
and in the middle of june the bridge office will be going through the same exercise and june the nineteenth i think it's the monday everyone within the group will be working to the group's quality systems
and we're shortly to appoint some erm consultant UNK who will assess our system and we will run our have our system in place for a period of about four months
er and i'm quite sure there'll be quite a bit of change to many of our procedures
there are currently procedures which are absent which will need to be introduced
and the intention is that by the end of this year our system will be UNK to i s o nine thousand and one
okay
and that
i'd just like to say one thing dennis
what's the difference between b s five seven five o and i s o nine thousand
i s o nine thousand is an internationally
yeah
yes
there isn't any difference
it's the same document
it's just that erm the i s o version as you quite rightly say is sort of recognized and used in other countries
and the fact that it's got a b s label means that it's the UNK one to the u k really
but the content of i s o nine thousand and b s five seven five o are the same
the same
we're using i s o nine thousand as a result of board policy
okay
coffee time
yes
we're currently running about fifteen minutes late
UNK lunch time is fixed for twelve so we must get
did you
is
yeah
tape running
i should perhaps apologize on behalf of the hotel for the temperature in the room this morning er i stayed here last night and woke up to find that not only was there no heat in the UNK but there was no heat in the hot water
there wasn't any hot water
they had a major boiler breakdown last night
two UNK failed
er so there's a distinct lack of central heating
even more remarkable lack of hot water so
if you can bear with us on that i can see we've got some out UNK who are quite happy to be sitting here without any jackets on but other people doing the opposite
for dennis
window to cool it down
yes
erm something we did UNK which we should not have done earlier was to mention the fire escape scenario and that is that if you go out of this door just the coffee table there's a large marked fire exit
so if we hear any UNK noises or bells which er don't turn off after a very short period of time we are to er make our way in an UNK fashion to the er base of the staircase of the fire escape following the fire escape er signs
something we should have mentioned earlier no doubt about that
but er i think from a comfort point of view er if you do feel the need to go to the toilet please don't er think that you've got to put your hand up and ask
if you do that you'll have everybody wanting to go
right
are we ready
to UNK
we had a very quick introduction to the idea of i s o nine thousand at the end of my little session
i s o nine thousand is nothing more nothing less than a list of management activities that need more attention
more careful attention from the average management group
dennis explained how the c e d g UNK quality system is structured
and i now want to introduce the idea of quality planning
and then in a few minutes dennis is going to join with me in explaining to you how we are going to make the quality planning procedure work for you
we've already decided that a typical organization will in fact use the same procedures and work instructions on all its work because an a typical organization manufactures ice UNK
or it makes nuts and bolts
and they do the same thing day in day out
and the way in which a hierarchy of documentation is structured in such an organization is by having policy from which procedures are developed from which working structures UNK
now it is possible to force fit this type of approach into your kind of work
but it's not very practical and it's not very sensible
because you're going to need different procedures on different projects and you're going to need different degrees of checking and different degrees of emphasis on the different types of project that you get
the prestige project the complex project or the quick UNK project
in terms of your organization i think we've got something and it won't surprise you a little bit more complicated than the normal UNK factory or whatever
and what we have are as follows one a manual which dennis mentioned in the red folder
core quality procedures which we've separated out into q s ps one to seven
the job descriptions the UNK control the management review
how to organize a quality plan
we've got the admin instructions how to go and claim your expenses
how to hire a car
we've got various procedures within the group management procedures
now what we have to do is organize for ourselves a mechanism whereby for any particular project we use the procedures that are necessary for that project
we do not UNK the use of every single management procedure and every single quality procedure on all projects
otherwise we're back to that for force fit UNK approach as UNK on the previous view graph
now the key to explaining to people doing any particular project are which procedures is the quality plan
so for any particular project we want a quality plan which will tell us what the client brief is tell us which procedures we're going to use from the suite of procedures available within c e d g and following the UNK of the quality plan which will be individual for each individual project we get an output
there is a procedure on quality planning and that's what dennis is going to er be talking about very shortly and this will explain how we generate an individual quality plan
but i want to i want you to get the idea clear in your minds about what a quality plan is
so first and foremost it's the mechanism which UNK the appropriate procedures from within the c e g e c e d g documentation to help you er run a project in a managed way
now why do we have quality plans
well they achieve quite a lot
they introduce standards for project management
a quality plan will include objectives for the project which are agreed with the client
remember when we defined quality earlier we talked about fitness for purpose
and that involved talking to the client to find out what it was they wanted
what their expectations were
perhaps even perceptions
a quality plan will explain the scale and er numbers of checks that are involved
the i s o nine thousand document actually allows quite a lot of self checking
it's very
well mr what can we do
for you today
busy today is it not
we just don't believe it
about an hour i've been out there
oh aye
i can believe it
due a line today are you
yes doctor
i've been sitting here since two o'clock my two o'clock cup of coffee
not very funny doctor
i wasn't expecting you'd be that busy just now
oh
holidays
never come at holiday weekend
mhm
always the same before the christmas before new year
it doesn't matter
i mean you can go up on the rest of the week but the day before the holiday and the day after the holiday the
closed on monday
aye
well you'll get a day off there eh
or do you
are you on call out work
no
i've just got a big case full of paperwork to do when i get
there's no rest
ah no
keeps me out of UNK
i'll just be betting horses or chasing women or something like that
oh you'd better do the last one doctor
it saves you money
if you bet on horses or drink then it cost you money
and that's not
oh i don't know
i don't know
hello sir
how you doing
not so good
what have you been up to then
oh i think my UNK breaking up
it's my ears and er my back
i w i was in and seeing the doctor
mhm
and he's given me pills and that for it but it's my ears
this is one that's been i've had appointment and for three times i'd had to cancel it
UNK in ears when i go to bed at night
mhm
i'm not getting to sleep
it's taking me oh quite a while to get to sleep and i'm not hearing too good
right
let's have a look in and see if your brains are expanding or what's happening in here
no wonder you're not hearing so good
no wonder you're getting a UNK in your ears there's a big lump of concrete in there
is there
let's have another look at this
oh my
for goodness sake
there's a wee man with a pick and shovel in
oh aye
it's solid
is it
absolutely solid
i've been putting drops in it too
aye
quite regular
aye
i'll need to give you some special stuff to UNK that
aye
because that's
because it's
right
it's caught in the UNK
mhm
in the inside here and if we try and UNK it out it'll pull UNK out
aha
and UNK the skin
aye
i'll give you some special stuff to get rid of that
cos i've been trying and trying for ages
to get that
no
it's the it's absolutely solid
the drops are not doing anything
seeing doctor the other week
my back absolutely killing me
and i'm falling asleep every time i sit down
we'll need to do something about that
that's not right
between that and my back and my knees it's
two drops of this
aha
in the morning
a wee bit of cotton wool just on the outside
same on the other side
same at bedtime before you got to bed
aha
couple drops and
mhm
cotton wool
and that'll
gradually UNK that up
come back down in about a fortnight
aha
and we'll just a wee gentle UNK and it'll all come away
smashing
no problem at
right
all
now then
thirty two
grove
grove
now is your insurance line due in about a fortnight
aye
aye
right
here we are then and they'll have to get that sorted for
great
thanks
okay
right
cheerio now
cheerio
right
yes sir
hello
hello
well now what can i do for you today
aha
er there's nothing i cannot there's nothing wrong right
er there
it's when i go to have sex
mhm
right
it's
mhm
it's sore
it's actually sore behind there
i mean
mhm
it's sore
aha
it's raw
now when you say it's sore is it sore
no
at the front
no
or is it sore down the sides
it's in the sides
it's in the sides
how can i say it you cough and then you cough and it goes up
mhm
well see like in here you know it's quite sore
right
mhm
it's quite sore as well
right
let's get that sorted for you
that's quite easy
i assume it's kind of
and of course it is
i can i can have it but it's sore if you know what i mean
i mean i
painful
i don't really
yeah
and i just
now er
i mean i've not had or no skin or nothing it's something like maybe
UNK nothing broken
aye
you see
inside you know
aye
it's th the UNK inside get stretched cos the side bits
the front bit hasn't much blood in it but the two side bits when they fill up with blood and they start to stretch it's like blowing up a balloon
aye
and it UNK all the tissue on this inside and that's what makes it sore
and if you're actually having UNK the UNK get squeezed
aye
and that's why you feel that's why you feel it catching
right
so we'll get that now you take this about er oh say ten o'clock at night
it's a UNK that's special capsule take it about ten o'clock at night
mhm
and that will relax the UNK and let it fill up that bit easier
right
right
and the other thing you'll find when you're taking this is that you'll be able to get keep your UNK for a while longer maybe three four five minutes longer
so it helps
now i've said on here take one of these at night
mhm
er that doesn't i mean don't take it about six o'clock seven o'clock at night you could have that could have worn off by the time the
aye
emotion comes on you
so keep it till maybe half nine ten o'clock
right
something like that
you take it and then enjoy it and that should be a big help to that
it'll definitely
take the UNK away for you
no bother
complaint
you sure
okay then
right

don't let her take any great amount of it
just a little with her tongue

mm
if you UNK it you'll get it all back
mm
yeah
a small amount table UNK ice cream ice UNK
anything like that
anything like that

you don't need to take i enough to have a UNK or anything
mhm
just a don't go buying UNK don't go buying
mm
anything like that
mm
cos it won't make any difference
there's nothing
in there that there isn't in straight UNK
yeah
mhm
right
er every now and again a wee sugar cube
open her mouth and just let her suck it
give her a bit of energy
yeah
build up her strength
build up her strength
but just anything cold anything goes down very easily
aha
just take it they don't have any problem with it
yeah
a small UNK of this stuff
yeah
just in the corner of her mouth
don't force it down just in the corner of her mouth
she'll swallow that down nice and gently and it'll coat her tummy and it will gradually work its way through into the UNK and UNK them down as well
is this the medicine you're giving her
yes
yes
ju as long as you don't UNK her
this is
aha
this is the one thing that
her system can't stand
it's when they UNK er
that's right
they try to empty what it is in their stomach and it
right
just comes out
that's what i was doing last night
yeah
well just out to the shop and get some ice cream or make a table UNK when you go home
mhm
and just have a little of it every half hour
every hour
if you feel like it
aha
it doesn't matter what the flavour is whether it's UNK orange anything
okay
er quite a good thing is this er UNK stuff
yeah
mhm
it's nice is that
it has a UNK so that youngsters particularly quite like the taste of it because they don't taste anything all their taste UNK
mm
if you look at her tongue
pure white
mm
her taste UNK are all covered
can't taste anything
yeah
but if you can get them with just a an orange or a lemon UNK
just a wee drop of that instead of the ice cream
mhm
they can taste it
mhm
yeah
she hasn't been eating and that's unusual
no
for her
no
aye
no
they
they don't
this UNK we've got it's causing the pains
yes
oh aye
gives her the UNK all the way across here
yeah
all the way across here
that's it
yeah
mhm
that's why there's two or three minutes and then sick
aye
that's what i had last
or we have diarrhoea
night
yeah
yeah
aye
we either have we either have sickness or we have diarrhoea or
i had both
yeah
well i'm the only one actually
i've had both
yeah
aye
we maybe jus just haven't got it severe cos you've just had that operation
i've just come out of hospital
what have you been doing
i had a UNK bad
so the UNK was worrying me a bit
well
cos i've still got stitches
you get started on the ice cream and the
i was just coming up to scotland for a holiday
i'm not coming here any more
what with the weather and this i'm going home
again
i'll tell you the weather down south is just as bad
i know
we left it didn't we
right
and
i was listening to the radio when i was out in the car this morning and it's coming down
same over it's just coming across the country isn't it
it is
if she gets any worse doctor
no she won't
no
no problem
you think it's this UNK
no problem
yeah
aye
and if you give her just stick her to small amounts for the next couple of days
yeah
and
okay
yeah
don't force her that's the big secret
yeah
because if you force them at all it doesn't work
thanks very much doctor
there's that
right
thank you very much
you'd best carry her then pete
no problem
thank you
bye
bye
bye
she's
bye
thanks a lot
okay
bye
bye now
any problems any problems the council for er two years there are and i think that she's actually provided a very significant contributions to the council
it is i think with great regret that we receive her UNK er but understand it
so perhaps we can for the contribution that she's made in sh in a short time
we have then the items listed
erm the first one is the nottingham association of local councils
remember that we sent er ten pounds to the area committee which they've said thank you very much indeed erm for and there's a meeting erm next in june which is their next meeting
where the er village care officer is going to attend and i'll er attempt to get to that meeting
well you know probably be the new chairman will attempt to go to that meeting i suppose after the annual meeting
we've had a letter from erm the UNK parlour saying that he's er going to visit the parish on the first of may to attend the UNK service
participate
we've also had a letter from southwell civic society about the church free car park
and i think it's worth s er reading out that the civic society have asked er betty in UNK to write to us in order to express their appreciation of the work that's been carried out in the church free car park
the new park planting etcetera really UNK the area so that's nice to hear from the civic society and they're also saying that er they're grateful for the newspaper collection which their office is thinking has been put to good use
and say that their members save their newspapers too
some other news
we've had a letter er from severn trent water
you'll UNK you'll recall that severn trent used to UNK their UNK maintenance to the district council
they've n now UNK that agreement and now erm UNK problems should be directed to er UNK environmental services who are now doing a UNK rather than the district council
there's a local telephone number which i've already had occasion to use UNK as it happens and i think anne you were also involved in that significant problem on er on that there is a UNK er no UNK
anne
but i think john we should point out that it was it was only unsuccessful because it turned out not to be a UNK problem
it turned out to be surface water drainage
and the this UNK company don't do anything to do with the surface drainage surface water drainage that is dealt with by the county council highways authority who don't circulate an emergency telephone number and this problem occurred over the bank holiday easter weekend
but i think we should say that UNK er what do they call it
environmental
environmental turned out immediately that we UNK them to say there was a flood in on the and they were ex extremely fast and very efficient and they came back later in the day when the highways authority still hadn't erm responded to our calls
and were prepared to do the work so long as they could get the say so from erm the highways authority
erm so
who couldn't be contacted
may we have that telephone number
yes the telephone number is er for sewage problems if you remember
and how do you spell UNK
b i f a
right
peter
talk you know there was the notts county council on the erm UNK problems that we get in is it possible to write to the county council to ask them what sort of maintenance programme they're going to give us now as regards this cos i've not seen this wagon going round so frequently as it used to
i mean you'd see it going round the town quite regularly UNK the UNK
but y you very rarely see it now and i should like to know when these UNK are being UNK and what the programme is
because we still keep getting ch the same charge for it community charge etcetera
and i believe it's a facility that's you know is now lacking in southwell
well i think we'll ask the clerk to i think it's a good point yes indeed
c can we all st
and that wouldn't have occurred that weekend on the UNK if there'd have been a proper programme of empty UNK
mhm
well yes the UNK actually was blocked completely in and
we should have a visit by the head of the notts county council highways for the UNK scheme
that was something you UNK
mhm
erm it's another item when we meet this gentleman mr can raise with him
should probably ask mr to come to one of our p c parish council full meetings
well we've asked him to meet us with regard to the footpaths so we could use it for that at the same time
i think we're walking round i think's probably more efficient than perhaps inviting him to a meeting
well i can tell you now why are constantly blocked up
a any problems if you could send them to steve the then we'll er we'll er check those out yes
yeah i'm a bit concerned because we've got a mixture of adopted and UNK in southwell haven't we
and er i know when i had experience in the past last new year the district council's come out on behalf of the residents
they've always come out but they always do then check while they're there to see whether the property concerned is on the list of private adopted or UNK and there can be a mixture
but they always do the job and worry about the UNK afterwards
which of course is what residents concerned about
now can we be assured that UNK are in fact going to do that same service not turn up and say you're not allowed this nothing to do with us
because they are a private contractor now
and i think what we should get as a parish council is an assurance from UNK that they or from the district council from severn trent really if they are the people that contracted out the work that a re any resident in southwell who is UNK by UNK problems is going to get immediate and urgent attention
whether or not the sewer is adopted
because if you've got your back garden flooded with foul water you're not really concerned about anything else other than the d than getting the UNK cleared
i'm assuming that david's suggested that
people did call the number adopted or not and i would have thought that was
well they did do it but they used to UNK residents for UNK
well sorry to interrupt but we had a man that was very UNK with i think gardens and he's a local man er always turned up
very quickly
yeah
and i think that degree of that loss of local knowledge could be very serious
yes
actually
they're taking the same men on
that's
found in
thank you chairman sorry to have UNK the point
i think that's a good point w we will raise that with UNK as well
er we also have one other item of correspondence recorded on the list er which was addressed to the lord mayor of southwell england
and it got here
well done the post office
from germany containing some er nineteen forty late fi early fi early fifties photographs from a er a doctor erm in germany
without any correspondence
but just to for our UNK
so we are going to write back and say thank you very much indeed and i suggest she sends her one of the
two up to date postcards
no two of the maps we got the maps so we can send her a map
excellent idea
mhm
mhm
aye yeah
er can we move on then
no
no
can we move then to item number seven the financial statement of the payments
chairman sorry
on correspondence there was this letter which also appeared in the that was sent to me for notice to the parish council about the erm parked cars along UNK and er church street which we wanted obviously
oh yes
sorry i thought mine was a copy but it's not
from young i think he must be about eleven saying i'm concerned about safety crossing the road at UNK because cars and lorries go very fast along there
sometimes it's so busy i go across with some of my friends with the crossing lady at the village school and then walk back down nottingham road towards the school
i'm also concerned about the safety of other er UNK mothers with babies and young children or older children and even teenagers
please could you get some crossing lights a zebra crossing or some traffic lights put in
it would make us a lot safer and cars may not go as fast
yes
that's er i know that mrs has asked er youngsters at the minster school to write in and obviously this is one of the first of those
so that's good to hear and we'll forward it on to copies of that to the relevant organization
lynn
can i you had in
i know they've been writing them
erm i'm not sure er perhaps that's just one of them rather than
it's obviously the pressure upon the county council to get something done about the traffic
do you think perhaps we ought to erm ask the school if they've got the letters ready yet rather than
mhm yes
leave it too long
i phoned mrs on erm wednesday this week er monday this week sorry and er she's yet to phone me back
thank you
i will put that on the side and just with the rest as you're going now i'll move on to the financial statements
firstly the financial statement which you received earlier are thick documents which steve circulated
this is the document which will be going for audit and er that's on the agenda a little bit later erm on the last financial year
steve can you talk
of course
us through that
you can
see from nineteen ninety two ninety three financial year our income from the whole year was a hundred and twenty one thousand pounds
just look at the first page
carried forward for this year for this year is thirty eight thousand three hundred and fifteen pounds our UNK is sixty thousand pounds and our expected income is fourteen k
so giving us a total income for the year of about a hundred and twelve thousand pounds
our planned expenditure for this year er works out at ninety one thousand one hundred and this includes the money for projects
so it gives us erm a possible carry forward to next financial year of twenty one thousand pounds
erm the account balances and it's ready to go to audit now
erm and there are no outstanding transactions at this point
peter
n no comment i think it's all fairly self explanatory
so i
can i just enquire why er we had to state getting the fourteen thousand
in total
interest
where
interest
right if you look at page number
they're not numbered
no this is
on the income sheet which i UNK
UNK sheet
yeah
you receive last year income was twelve thousand five hundred and sixty one pounds er next year it does go up slightly because we didn't receive any tennis club fees last year
six hundred pounds the pitch fees about seven hundred pounds bowls club pay us three hundred and fifty pounds the tennis club for the two years subscriptions will be twelve hundred pounds the fair three hundred and fifty pound for two visits erm one hundred and seventy five each visit and the rugby club will pay us about three hundred pounds for the use of the pitch on ground
investments two thousand five hundred
i'm hoping to get investments of two thousand five hundred obviously with interest rates coming down it's er
optimistic
the lease for southwell city football club forty five pounds our waste paper income about five hundred pounds in the calendar year er v a t refund about three thousand pounds and grants i've put down five thousand pound income for the year
i've actually put in for twenty thousand UNK worth of grants at this point however let's see whether i'm fortunate to achieve that
erm and finally w we do get one or two smaller items of income from er selling of the maps and erm other items
that comes to fourteen thousand one hundred and fifty pounds
d does the football UNK pitch fees not appear in this income
yes it does in the top the first
the pitch fees money
seven hundred pounds
the budget is the one that had been approved previously
what hasn't been approved is this full audited for the full financial statement for last financial year
this is an end of year statement if you look er giving the erm the income of a hundred and twenty five thousand and ninety nine pounds and the expenditure there on the on the back page of eighty two thousand seven hundred and eighty three pounds
so it's that we're UNK tonight
er full council so that it can go to audit and the arrangements explain later
roger
i move that we approve it and can i also er compliment the clerk on i thought this an excellent document i mean i don't know it before or not but it was well put together very concise and i could understand it myself
so i thought that was pretty good
so erm i would say
well done
hear
thank you very much indeed
yes is that approved then
agreed
thank you
we've also got the bills for payment er on your list there are a number of bills for payment are there any questions about those bills for payment
there are some verbal additions
which are
yes
the first item severn trent water
we are asking for your approval for two bills a thirty pounds sixty four and a hundred and fifty three pounds twelve
that is the annual payment and although we're seeking approval now for the whole payment we will defer one of half of those both of those payments until the six months' interval in order to gain the interest
so although we are seeking approval now for the whole total we will in fact pay half in six months' time er as is normal procedure on our water bills
there are some additions further additions please because of er urgency
right first there is from the district council and it's pond er has anybody seen pond
not recently
it looks absolutely super
it's been erm
the bill for that is three hundred and eighty six pounds and fifty three pence
and this also includes a fence
i've changed the specifications of the fence so my brother got the but i put a smaller fence in there not the huge three bar one which was er previously it doesn't really change specifications
erm my
more than it was
no it still goes it is actually
but it's cos i changed it they were going to put a large fence in
oh right
and i thought it'll be too much in that little area
er my claim for expenses for the park which is on the agenda later come back to this the UNK wages one trip to newark bill development er for mrs susan
phone calls made from home
the total claim tw is twenty nine pounds sixty
my accountant has advised me to stop claiming
there's been all sorts of problems with regard to paying UNK wages because i become her employer
so i've been advised to stop that hence it's on the agenda
so this will be my last claim ever
erm i've got four UNK tickets for waste from pond twenty f twenty pounds and four pence
erm it's just for rubbish i removed from pond
er a bill from for UNK and UNK an UNK underground cable
erm which we found on the recreation ground
the bill is for nineteen pounds and forty pence
erm we'll come again to this er item later in the in the er
harry and son UNK
paint and sign work carried out to toilets on the recreation grounds
erm if you've actually been down there are now smart plastic signs telling people what the building is and giving all the details it looks very nice
it's a lot but
it's been well UNK it looks a bit more like a public toilet now
and finally a bill for the centre of fourteen pounds fourteen pence which are just items that don draws er a UNK er a bin etcetera
it's
but there are then two sets of bills for paying there's the ones we've got written and those verbal
any q all in agreement
mhm
move on then to item number eight
er there was a notts county council liaison conference which i think anne and christine went to
i'm not sure
we did
yes we did
we did
have you got er anything to say for it
erm yes very briefly
you'll be pleased to hear
erm on the twenty
ninth of march anne and myself went to a meeting of the county council organized well to liaise with parish councils
and there were two main items on the agenda
erm one was erm an account of er care in the community and erm the implications for nottingham and how it was going to be and they were planning to implement it erm which was of general interest
er a specific on only thing that might have been i think was really erm the erm the concern that some people expect erm are for rural areas whether there was going t there were going to be con whether things were going to be spread thinner on the ground in rural areas particularly sort of transport costs and of course erm there's one but nevertheless the concern that would be underlying that and the erm the erm the rural community
the council
erm and then the second import erm major action was about erm local government and i think that's really where the point which we we've reached a take home message that we want to erm bring to this council
two things
one that erm the erm in any kind of structure it was felt very er strongly that parishes should be represented in and that they should listen to er perhaps have a much more erm important role than they have now in a unitary or erm an all purpose authority
and the county presented erm a range of options
mhm
i have to say relatively er in an erm UNK as UNK as they could be
er from the extreme option of having a single unitary c erm council for the whole of the county erm to on the other hand having erm eight unitary councils based on the existing er and it's in the document i think the UNK got and you've probably got
but that was the er th erm sorry i'm UNK myself
based on the eight erm present district councils
so and then all erm possibilities between those two
and they presented the cost of them the immediate cost of implementing them the ongoing cost or any saving that there might be because erm and erm left that for er for comment
and i think the erm the UNK got you've got this document haven't you
yeah
erm have i don't think that the that the councillors have it
but it's quite an interesting one to look at
erm and it gives you part of the range of their proposals
so i should think it's erm it is worth councillors having a look at what is proposed
erm and then the other important message was that the erm the UNK the commissioners w were looking at er erm all the councils in the in the country in england during the next five years
and coming to nottingham on beginning on june the twenty first
and it's most important that we the parish council get in our erm send our views to the commissioners
they're only coming for eleven weeks and that of course starting in june take some holidays and
erm there's so it's quite important that we should erm make our best strong erm representation to of our views erm of how we see erm our message of the main organization and i think that was erm
just on that last point it was suggested that we ought to be writing now to these commissioners saying that we as a parish council wanted to make comments to them when they were er in nottinghamshire
so and i think maybe it's a good idea that we write and say that we would like to be given an opportunity to speak to them
yes
it is
yes
because if you remember we wrote to the department of environment putting our views forward when the commission was just about to get
right
and i think it would be a good time now to point out to the to s to er to say that we'd like to have our views heard at that time
to me they're not
er UNK people have about that time it's important that and i think it is
erm th there were some complaints about er this is first liaison meeting that there'd been in the county and you know they were obviously
out there listening
er and that did underline er we feel at the moment that we're not being listened to by the how important it would be it is erm if there's to be any kind of inter village
any other point on the questions
the problem mr chairman is that after they've got them into the authority they'll forget all about us again
yes i
i think they have to this is why we have to get in at the beginning and be part of the structure
er and UNK actually being listened UNK too weak i think parish councils should be part of the structure
i think that's what we should we should ask for
local UNK things are different in different as in the smaller er region of
can i just ask mr chairman i mean the battle seems to be between the council and the district councils is there any danger that the outcome would be the abolition of parish councils
no in the in the erm the department of the environment they are actually talking about unitary authorities
now the question for parishes would th they wouldn't be abolished the question is how much additional powers and responsibilities would be UNK to the parishes and that's the question
there's no question there's no er discussion of the abolition of the parish councils at all
i it is to what extent parishes will have additional powers and responsibilities and er i think we'll get onto this one item number seventeen on our agenda
john
of putting that item next agenda chairman to consider this matter who's going to represent this parish council er as a member
we made mention that we've already submitted something in writing
has it gone to specifically to the address of the commissioners
if it hasn't is it worth our er now sending it to them because if they don't come here at least we've then submitted something in writing
and i also wondered whether there is a case i don't know to what extent the county council is listening themselves that whether the case for also UNK our views to the county council
erm if we put it on the agenda perhaps we could UNK we'll UNK the brief submission that we made which was about a side of a four if you recall to the er to the department of the environment
it probably sums up the case and we can discuss it and perhaps add to it at that time
yeah thank you it was a good idea
david
yeah we were also er notified of a liaison meeting called by the district council
erm the has gone in the past er i just wondered whether any of us were able to attend that and if so what the outcome of that was
i think if you recall we had about er three days' notice of that didn't we
i certainly had very little notice of that
mm
i'm certainly going to one this next
no this was late april it was called by erm mr wasn't it
and the er
that's right
but it was also very
can i just say that i went to the meeting to do with local planning at hall
that's the one
to represent to represent this was for voluntary services
on tuesday morning and i went to see the secretary on
but in fact there was very little apart from discussion at the end that was actually relevant to voluntary services it was about local government reorganization which was very interesting for me as a parish councillor
so erm that was quite informative actually
i think that's
that was mr
i think that's the one danger of all of this is that both the county council's and the district council's aim perhaps or now are beginning to listen to the parish councils but also just really get an eye off the ball cos they're looking for the increased responsibilities for their own purposes and i think that's one serious danger that we c have to face as a local community
but hope it doesn't happen
i think what you say is quite true chairman but i still i think the bottom line to it is at the end of the day to do away with a strategic authority such as the county council in my opinion if you look at what's happened in the metropolitan areas er in the country tyneside manchester the west midlands areas like that west yorkshire south yorkshire and er london itself the er the doing away with a strategic authority
it might save money but in terms of the environmental impact it is quite disastrous and i think that it's only now that the real problems in london for example are coming home to UNK er and i would ask that point to be borne in mind by whoever we decide should make representations to the commissioners
right thank you
we'll put this on the agenda for the next meeting
thank you
that was
interesting
can we move on then to item number nine er there's a slight alt er a slight erm change to the agenda here i this should read erm replacement nomination for the police area liaison committee
erm stuart erm sat on the police liaison committee
he wasn't an official UNK of this parish council but he er was a person who attended the meetings and in UNK with UNK from this because he found it difficult to get to because of commitments erm it's suggested that the parish council might be able to identify one of its number in order to be able to at least continue some erm represent private representation on the liaison committee
anybody
is it john can you give us any er a little idea what the police complaints authority
no it's not the police complaints authority
it's the police area liaison
area liaison
liaison
ah i'm sorry i mixed i got slight
it's the police area liaison committee that i think meets every three months
er in the southwell area erm er
this is the meeting that to which people are invited to from all over
yeah
the area in which you stand up and make points that might be of interest to the police
yes
yes
yeah
i've been to one
is there anyone who's prepared to represent southwell
it doesn't have to be someone from this parish council maybe other people are interested or prepared to attend
it's actually a member of the public from southwell that
i think that there's a is afternoons
it is
which makes it when everyone's working
yes
er stuart did phone me some months ago on this issue to say he was having increasing difficulty getting to the meetings and he asked me if er i would take it on and i said i would if you know if he were pushed
pushed
yeah
er and i believe the meetings take place in newark which is not too bad for me to get to er so i think
there we are then
a volunteer
i can't guarantee making every meetings
no
i suggest that we erm propose david as our as a southwell representative
i believe
if i don't turn up one night
don't get UNK
i think mr chairman there is a feeling of erm well there's a feeling that these meetings would be far more positive now with the change in the hierarchy of the police in
can i then move on to item number ten the southwell market refurbishment
anne you might have something to say on this
erm chairman the erm district council officer who's been erm delegated to draw up the scheme for the parish UNK for the town did meet erm here one morning some weeks ago with myself and steve the clerk and showed us some er a sketch of what was being proposed
now has he not left it with the parish council
he hasn't
i thought that was very useful
erm what is now being proposed is a somewhat less UNK plan than we had before if you remember there were lines of trees before in a very grid like pattern across the marketplace
there is still the main focus of the scheme is still UNK the surface and tree planting
the tree planting now en UNK erm i think it's four or five trees across the UNK onto king street so including the one that exists four more new ones
very big trees it it's suggested should be planted along there so that they make an immediate impact
and then coming down from a point on king street just to the left of the existing tree if you can imagine that and coming back across the marketplace
where the dropped UNK is that takes you on to the private road
going to say
a sort of little ar a UNK should be cleared there of natural york paving stones so that you UNK the marketplace but not immediately in the middle
it's more or less a third of the marketplace will then be to the right
near the UNK and then the rest is
and then this york paving stone theme would be also in a strip all the way round the UNK of the existing marketplace and so that you have two areas of natural york paving stone high quality paving
the rest of the market area would be UNK in something less expensive but still something that looked very nice but it's more UNK
i think he described them as light UNK but actually of a UNK material which is being used at the moment in nottingham on a something called a heritage walk which takes you up to the lace market in nottingham
if anybody knows that area they'll know what he's talking about
erm and then on an area of the main york paving stone UNK that UNK the thing there would be a sort of circular erm paving theme UNK in the middle of this path
and in the middle of that they thought that perhaps an UNK lighting column with sort of with lights coming out from the top of it just to make it a bit more fancy
and then there would be more trees pl oh yes and on either side of this UNK there would also be an avenue of trees
so that was the main tree planting this avenue of trees down on either side of this little path
i'm sorry that we haven't got the sketch to show you
it's really difficult
are you following
and then there would be a few more trees around the back area if you like of the erm er marketplace
it was also proposed that the piece of UNK that comes from road in front of the community centre for 's court which at the moment is lower than the marketplace the marketplace is raised and th the road is lower
it sh it's proposed the road should be raised on a level with the marketplace and possibly also UNK with this UNK type paving so that the UNK idea would continue right the way across to the 's court community centre
not so that it would stop cars getting across into the car park but it would nevertheless give the impression
so it would slow traffic down basically
it would have to rise up onto this path
erm then there would be the idea of UNK into this little er UNK circular UNK area and UNK at different parts around the edges
UNK as we've asked for across the UNK as well and the back
erm and that was about it
and it was suggested that this scheme should be presented to us i thought one of their representatives was supposed to be coming here tonight to present it to us obviously not been possible
they've also asked that i should put a drawing of this scheme which they have sent to me in the may edition of the UNK with an article from them explaining it asking for comments from the public and this will be their public consultation exercise
they'd also like comments from this parish council and it was odd that they haven't given us a sketch to look at
but really that was er the purpose of the meeting where they presented it you know in that form
and
chairman er has any money been put aside by
sorry they did tell us that the whole costing of the scheme was going to be ninety thousand pounds it was going to cost ninety thousand just to do what we've yes what i've just described to you
very expensive apparently to do paving and to do some mature semi mature tree planting
the district council has already set aside twenty thousand
i think it was twenty one thousand
twenty one thousand pounds
is that in one year or over various years
no it's been it's been over a period of two or three years
seven thousand pound a year
seven po thousand pounds a year that's right over three years a really UNK contribution by comparison to the parish council which has also put aside over five thousand
but there is in total at the moment twenty five thousand pounds available
twenty six thousand
twenty six thousand pounds available
and it was suggested by the er two officers that were present that could that money that's already there could in fact get a third of the scheme done the third which was the UNK little path the main trees across the front and the bit of the paving that takes you over to the north road
the rest would have to be done in phases
they thought they could do this first third this year during the summer over the summer months if there was general agreement for the scheme
they would move the market stalls of course
that'd be the UNK and the er set the york stone sets which continue the line of road basically from the entrance to 's court straight across towards erm towards the erm UNK
it continues that line
and the part which sides the UNK
peter
thank you chairman
well i won't give an opinion whether i agree with the scheme or not because i would like to see some of the drawings first before i gave a you know of an opinion of it like you know everybody else around this table
but what concerns me greatly again is we seem to be doing it or the district council in bits and UNK
now the district council have taken a lot of money off this town over the market stalls now for a number of years and i believe if they're going to do a scheme like this which has been going on now for over eight years it should be done all in one go
i don't think you can do a third one year and then try and raise some more money over the next few years and do another third
i would like to see the scheme be taken on and done properly
and d let's have a proper job in the town for a change
lynn
can i ask if the sum is ninety thousand
nine o
when they when they came in the summer and they said erm they planned and they said approximately how much what were those figures
they weren't anything like that were they
well they weren't york stone then were they
i don't think they quoted a figure i think
i think actually we do need to see the drawings
and i'm disappointed that the district council officers UNK ei any of the three come i understand one's ill but i mean it seems a bit disappointing cos i did actually
september last year they came september last year they came with the display
i think perhaps we'll ask them to come to our next meeting or the meeting after that
since our meeting in may is the annual meeting we're pushed for time there
but i mean as soon as we can g get them to come along and actually ask them to
to a planning meeting
to a planning meeting
to a planning meeting
yes
yeah
pat
erm i i'd like to see what peter would like to see actually i think we ought to see the whole thing done in one fell UNK
can't see it happening but it would be better
but just a minor point erm if we're going to settle for one third the job initially is that going to improve the UNK to the front and rear
because obviously it's they are going to some of the paving we don't wanting it running up a small onto the next lot
it is
it would include the UNK but not the paving up the side of road
no
two of the UNK o on both the street end and road
so it came out to be impossible to d to drive on paving that
because obviously they'll be able to get their equipment when they finish the job
mhm
mhm
one
well
would assume
yes but the main part of this as i understand the drawing you'll have to ask mr when he comes but the main part of the square which wouldn't be the third which is done in the first phase according to the phase that they're currently proposing
it wouldn't be york stone set anyway
this would be this concrete type of erm small brick
so about er erm two hundred by three hundred UNK
it wouldn't be very large but anything large or anything on a large square well if they're working on it once they put their UNK up
well some of them will be UNK because they remove them whilst they do the second phase
i it strikes me that there seems to be some really UNK thinking erm coming from the district council erm with real sort of erm er erm UNK
on one hand you're talking about or they're talking about we're talking about improving the UNK aspect of the market place wi with nice UNK and attractive features
and on the other hand the moment they they're going to stick masses and masses er o of stands the these market trader pieces on it and really i can't understand er why bother if you're going to destroy something in that sort of way
why bother to do it in the first place
i think that there's a lot of confusion going on and i don't understand it
i'm not sure just who where how people are arriving at these two decisions
it's almost as if it's a completely different team that don't even talk to one another
it's the same department
well it's a different team
that's correct
that's right
now i've got to move on please can i have one point
can i ask a does the scheme erm mention stalls and what were
not as a permanent feature no i think that the er the
but the other scheme did at least indicate where the stalls would be taken that into account
no these didn't show any stalls but they're i it was explained that one of the constraints in the design of the scheme was the brief that they had to leave space for er as many stalls as possible to be UNK
but they had
yes that's right
we'll ask mr to come along to
erm southwell centenary which is next year if you recall erm we've at a previous meeting i raised this erm the point with councillors that next year is our centenary of our formation we don't have any UNK unfortunately er they were lost in the last sort of decade
oh quite UNK
erm but it is our centenary and i just wondered other parish councils are recognizing the centenary in other ways
the i've only had only suggestion erm put to me but there may be others
the suggestion i've had is that we have got held in the budgets erm land acquisition i mean it may be that we actually pool this the new land acquisition after the centenary which might be erm a way of recognizing the centenary of the of the parish council
other parish councils are holding markets and holding events but i don't know
any comment
what do you mean other parish councils are holding
all
have other people got UNK as well
yes
er in eighteen ninety four the parish councils act was established by the UNK government it was erm which created the network of for the first time of local community representation
and so in nottinghamshire erm other councils such as UNK and UNK also established UNK
so there will be national events but er i'm thinking particularly in southwell
bob er i take it that you know the suggestion that we perhaps name the er thing this particular thing you know the centenary fields or something like that you know is a very good suggestion but i think perhaps the council ought to do something
perhaps we ought to have a service at the minster or er something to you know er remember the service of many given to the parish council over a hundred years and er and it's something simple and i think it would be quite nice to er to do something like that
what we incorporate
erm i agree with that
in fact i mean you can buy or i mean you've got the record of erm how far back you could invite all the existing living parish councillors so far as we could and that would be i think that would be fascinating
perhaps a reception in the great hall
well i don't want
it's not something peculiar to us is it
erm it's a hundred years of parish government really and er i would have thought probably we'll find out that the national association of local councils will probably be organizing something we can erm you know UNK to
if some project comes up during the course of the year i would have thought that it might be appropriate to erm er UNK the name of centenary onto it but i don't really think that this year we just commit ourselves to something just because there's a hundred years of parish government coming up
sorry but er i don't think i don't really think it's peculiar to us
i disagree entirely
they ought to
so the two suggestions which we'll put forward then is naming one of capital projects in this financial year of the centenary and possibly looking at er erm joining into a service or establishing a service with the minster and i'll look into that with the provost as well and the association
yeah
i'll
we've got a proposed wood here a centenary wood
oh yes can i
can you all try to as we're getting a bit late
erm this is a rewrite which i suggest we er refer to the general purposes committee but there is a problem in terms of the access to the recreation area and the nature reserve that's er on the bridge adjoining the ponds right across the sp across the UNK of road
the UNK is stopped up and res erm children particularly are UNK over the bridge in order to use the footpath which actually does end at the UNK which has been stopped up erm through the nature reserve
it does appear that there there's problems on that corner of the road bridge with there could be UNK of that bridge erm it could be erm UNK
also the bank is UNK where children are climbing over and we need to do something about it
lynn
yes UNK er it's a bit of a dilemma really because the area that is being used to walk and then UNK over this bridge is actually within the nature reserve as you rightly describe it
and what's happening is the children weren't walking from the school street site to the road site
instead of walking around the children's play area and then down road and joining the road site footpath are using that as a foot as a UNK
and that's why they're sort of UNK over the bridge in order to get onto the UNK
and it would seem as though it's a logical thing to UNK a bit of the fence so they can instead of UNK over the bridge just come straight through
however if you do that you're going to encourage these hundreds of children who make this crossing between the sites crossing every day to walk through the er the nature reserve
which will have two effects
one it will UNK because of the numbers of children and the numbers that they walk UNK it'll UNK the grass areas on either side of the nature reserve UNK
they won't stick to the UNK because they don't do it in the school
and er it's because of er their numbers
therefore by encouraging more of them to use this route you'll UNK your planting in the nature reserve
and secondly you'll get a greater obviously a greater amount of litter because they do eat as they walk across the sites
and they drop their UNK packets and their tins
and they you know they're no worse than children anywhere else in the country and i don't wish to make a big song and dance about it
it's just a fact of modern life when children eat out in the street you get litter
that means all the kids are UNK
so i both the both those disadvantages lead me to think that we ought not to UNK this area
i think that they you know i if there is da damage being done to the bridge then we've got to somehow address that in a different way
i would be reluctant to see this er this fence removed to allow them to use that
sorry
you
i've raised this these points that we've raised when we went and met donald down at the park and the school have said they will not erm allow the children to go that way
when there's a school teacher down there it should happen at all break times and meal times erm er
they they're not going to be allowed to go down there
m my concern is one of safety
i must be honest having seen the children leap off that bridge it's not going to be long before somebody falls and hurts themselves
so i accept the point that lynn made but i feel that it's a somebody's eventually going to fall into that water
and we were down there lynn on
mm
and what were the kids doing
just UNK over it
they were jumping over
and it's dried up now
can i just say then that i think either it's got to be blocked completely so they can't jump over the bridge or it's got to be UNK
and i'd say it was better to UNK because the kids all walk over that bridge now they're UNK away the bank the
you'd have to fence right along the bridge and completely block it
but the daft thing is really that there is a an access into the little play area from there
if you don't go through that way to the little play area you've got to walk all the way round
the other thing is if the school children walk round and through where they're supposed to go it still goes past wide pond and they've eroded all the grass where they've made their own little footpaths through i don't think going that going the other way would make it any different
they're still going through that nature reserve area
and the other thing is that the river along there is full of litter anyway and it just flows along
i don't think
can i can i
i think personally it would be better to open it up properly
can i suggest we actually have a look at this in general purposes
cos i think that what we will need to do is refer it to general purposes committee for and people to go and have a look at it
erm there are a number of suggestions one of which is to open it
one of which is not to open it
the other is to put a fence alongside the river er there in a similar way to the southern end of the bridge
so people of general p members of the general purposes committee go down and have a look at the bridge have a look at the southern end where there is a wooden plank which actually prevents this sort of activity on the southern end but not on the northern end
so perhaps we can have a look there and this will appear on the ne and i suggest we look at it on the next general purposes committee
last point peter
just before you know you make your final decision at the general purposes would you please consider the small children on the playground area there please
because the reason that er UNK was blocked off in the first instance was there was a case where a child ran across that road
now whatever you do by opening up this
it's got to be done for safety purposes please for the infants
and i think if you're going to open it up you must consider probably a UNK gate or something s so that a child cannot run onto road
i think you'll have a fatal accident eventually if you do
thank you
can i can i move on or is this a
i ju just one point to make that the children can't run out of this area onto there's already a UNK out of the play area for that path before you get to the road
it's it was done that's why did block it up with a in the first instance
but it's about two or three
yeah but it did it has happened it has happened
but i mean
but if we're going to co if we're going to open it up we need to consider the sort of gate perhaps a UNK gate might be the one to put in rather than a UNK
shall we defer this to the general purposes committee meeting
thank you
erm right number thirteen
get through this by nine o'clock
er you'll be aware from the letter which was circulated to you by steve that we had a significant problem with water UNK down the our pipe which joins the mains water supply at the memorial war memorial
after that meter all of that water usage is our responsibility
and we were using er about a cubic meter every three hours
in other words it was costing us about a pound an hour in water
so as an emergency without any budgetary provision er we decided erm on consultation with a number of councillors that the only thing we could do was actually locate the water UNK and replace it
but having had some estimates for that it became inappropriate to it became more cost effective to replace the entire pipe with a wider diameter pipe
because you'll know that we have water pi pressure problems on that particular er water line
it doesn't mean to say the water po pressure will be increased at the moment because the final connection to the fifty UNK water main is still the narrow gauge
but what we decided to do was to replace the entire water main erm with erm a double a double capacity pipeline
and at the same time improve the water supply situation there by providing some UNK so that our UNK can water a number of the er various facilities down there
and we had an er an estimate erm er which was circulated which we accepted
we've had to increase the cost of that estimate by for three things
firstly we came across electric UNK that were only three inches below the surface of the ground
this was clearly significantly dangerous and so whilst we w had the j c b j c b down there we asked the contractor to dig er to remove those electric UNK and actually replace them at an appropriate depth
the second the second point was that while the j c b was down there we er erm in consultation erm the chairman of those committees we removed the old concrete base which UNK whilst we were digging the erm the t the UNK for the water pipeline it was actually UNK away
and so it was actually becoming dangerous at the same time
the next point w the an additional point was in discussion with the cathedral council the cathedral council have always been interested and the church commissioners have always been interested in having a water supply to the UNK
and so we took advantage of the tender and the contractor being in th in the area to extend the water pipeline from its current location at the football UNK erm er UNK through to the UNK
and install a cattle UNK which is as far as we ho as far as we believe UNK proof in that it'll be a self filling c er UNK filled cattle UNK which the erm the ball float is actually contained in a erm a metal box so you can't get access to it
we have found the UNK and we have connected all we have UNK all of the er supplies including a supply to the cathedral field which has never been UNK in the past er because of erm damage to their meter it's only used twenty seven gallons but twenty seven litres but whilst i've been here it's a water UNK from the result of the water that we've been supplying to that particular field
and we've also extended the as a new measure the water supply along the side of the football and rugby pitches so that don can water the UNK erm of both the goal of both the football and the rugby pitches which is a considerable improvement
that increased our tender price significantly as you can imagine
about one thousand pounds
but as a consequence of all that work we've actually gained an additional five hundred and seventy pounds grant from the church commissioners from the scouts and from the cathedral council for this new additional work
so we've actually got a bill of three thousand one hundred and four pounds to replace this water main
it is a replacement we were losing that money erm because the water meter was going round at a pound an hour
but we've increased the capacity of that pipe so that if we have some more money eventually we can er replace the final five yards from our meter to the severn trent water main er in some future years to improve the pressure problems down the whole pipeline
so i th i hope that's a full report to you
it's a problem that we had to face and we had to take it because otherwise we were going to be faced with an enormous bill erm for ourselves because it was down to us
we have found all the UNK there were about five UNK i think down that
the major UNK erm was at the UNK hut where erm the building was actually putting pressure upon the water main and er causing a UNK
directly into a drain so we never s that's why we didn't see it because the water was actually pouring down a drain so of course we didn't see the water UNK up the UNK ground otherwise we'd have spotted it earlier
so that's i hope a r report on the activity there
what will now happen is that er the contractor will UNK the land erm but we will grass seed it erm with don er our UNK will look after and maintain that er so that it'll be UNK er over the next er six months
do you want retrospective approval
i'm merely seeking that budget commitment
i approve it
well yes i no i would endorse that and hopefully perhaps you know the comments that have been made will be picked up by the press
because i had a number of people who've been on to me talking about the mess on the on the recreation ground and asking what it's for and as soon as you explain why you know it's been accepted
but it caused an initial UNK but it's only because people didn't know
and if it's in the press
well we didn't have a discussion about it because as you can imagine the three
weeks that we've since this UNK arisen before easter we'd have actually lost another thousand pounds in terms of water costs
yeah i think we should minute erm our appreciation of the action taken by yourself and the clerk in UNK this matter because we did approve work erm and it became obvious after work was commenced that there was additional work that needed to be got on with
and that it was er obviously going to be a cost effective exercise to do it there and then and er you both er UNK as many councillors as you could at the time all the committee UNK were involved i don't see that you could have done any more in the circumstances
and er i think you ought to be UNK on the actions taken
yeah
mhm
can we have approval for that er expenditure then
thank you
i think peter declare an interest in this one
yes to me
erm thank you for that
erm item fourteen trees for the war memorial recreation ground
we had a number of erm er items on this
we have significant expenditure erm in line on this
we budgeted a thousand pounds it looks as if we're going to have to spend more on urgent work
we've now had a letter from simon as you asked us to get on the trees and recreation ground saying that yes indeed he says he now points out that there are dangers in the UNK tree and also the dead UNK erm behind the children's play area and also some of the dead wood which we've already identified
so we're going to have to proceed with some of this expenditure probably twice the budgeted b budgeted erm monies
we're going to see if we can actually do all of that work for two thousand pounds rather than the three thousand pounds which we we're
which is
the one that where the bridge is at the far end
yes
yes
cos that's been in UNK er condition all my life
and if you look at
they're all the same
going to do anything or are suggest that they you know do the bare UNK the bare necessity of work
rather
we've got difficulty here because we've now got letters saying that you know it's down to us and that the er tree UNK er from the county council believe that they are a danger to a danger to the public
it's a question of safety it got to be
is it the ones
i mean all good trees are being and over the years they all go don't they
and they they're an ideal UNK for UNK and sometimes i think unnecessary
that's my opinion
yes but they
when th they're in a public park as these are i think public safety has to take priority over the UNK consideration
i it's not all of them there's a one particular one which is actually causing s concern to the erm to the p i think perhaps what we need to do s is v people who are interested in this work actually speak to steve as he starts to contract the work out
erm because the there are quite detailed reports here which i'm not able to go into
we've had a number of quotations and a number of reports here
what i'm saying to you is that we actually need to find additional money for this because this is over our budgeted amount if we are to proceed and i the clerk is suggesting to us that we do proceed because he's concerned on our UNK
so
there is an item late on the agenda which will i if it's agreed by council will release a little bit of money that would we could put perhaps to er towards this thousand pounds
oh i'm sorry appear but er i'd have thought this UNK g er g erm UNK trees make cricket UNK and cricket bat manufacturers will purchase UNK trees
only certain types of UNK tree
that's what we call
chairman don't we have a number er the hold over or balances to cover this expenditure
yes we do
and that the main problem is those councillors who are concerned about it and
i think that you've made the point that those who are concerned must go and speak to the clerk and look at the er specifications
detailed specifications before the work is commenced
yes
mm
and then not UNK and sort of get UNK afterwards because they didn't realize what was happening
i think i think i'm actually seeking your approval then to spend additional thousand pounds from our balances for this safety work which we may well be able to top up later in the discussion this evening
john
seconded that
agreed
any against
item fifteen
erm we're pleased to announce that we've appointed a new UNK
erm er mr dennis who's accepted the appointment
he starts next week
and er he was interviewed by the appointments committee and erm i think he'll be a very good appointment
he was interviewed as you know by the clerk by our UNK and a councillor
so thank you very much er for your work on that and i think you made a good appointment
so
does he live in southwell
yes he lives at
is he a young man
er
university graduate
a well a well qualified
candidate
yes
yeah
can i move on to item number sixteen the UNK trading charter
on your table er you were given a copy of the draft the english draft of the charter er which i've had a look at it was given to me
by the er trading association it seems to me to be quite a sensible charter and er i propose that we write to the association saying this is very good and can we get it
in UNK
er we're going to er get it drafted up and er we have some money in the we have some money in our budget for a gift and it seems to me appropriate erm that the gift that we might make to UNK is the s trading charter which we can get for the money that we've budgeted er written by a UNK who i've already contacted who said that they can do it erm well for that sort of price in both english and UNK
that's
how much
i think it's a hundred
hundred and fifty
hundred and fifty pounds
but we can actually get it UNK and i mean we'll get it for well under that
so you're proposing that from the chair
i'm proposing that we accept this er trading charter draft and that the parish council erm looks to provide once the UNK version as being er provided for us from UNK er from the UNK republic rather that erm we'll accept
and it will be ready for the for the visit in may
it will be ready for the visit in may
oh lovely
agreed
agreed
agreed
agreed
thank you
th i mean there is th you have a charter here as well presumably
we have two copies of the charter
that's right
alright
mm
but the er but the one's currently hanging up in the library
version
er item number seventeen
this really refers back and i think the time refers back to the discussion that we had under the er liaison conference
in order to help us i think in our discussions it seems to me that i think we ought to write formally to the county council and to the district council actually asking them for more details of their consideration for what they intend to do about parishes
now we've been to these meetings and there's a lot of UNK fairy words about yes we support parishes
i think in order to support our response to the royal commission which is UNK the county council and the district council must now have had firm ideas on what they intend to do with parishes
so what i'm proposing is that we write to er mick and erm richard asking what powers and responsibilities that they propose at the moment to UNK to southwell
seconded
well hope to have that typed by next meeting
any against that
no
number eighteen
peter do you want to talk about this one
yes i think
he knows nothing about it
same with finance committee
steve
as i mentioned previously my accountant said drop this because it's going to put me in all sorts of problems with my taxation and things
so i would ask nicely that i have petty cash of say thirty pounds which out of i would buy or pay the UNK wages and any minor expenses that come my way
it would be an interest account
it would be an interest account
er thirty pound maximum i would keep the money at home so there's no risk to any money of being left in the office erm and i would be obviously responsible of returning thirty pounds
and the bills will come anyway in the normal way to the it's got pushed into the UNK and it's gone down UNK it's got pushed into the UNK and it's gone down UNK y thirty pounds maximum are we agreed
yeah
thank you
move on to the refurbishment of the toilet block
now you'll have heard that we painted the toilet block and it does look very smart
we haven't opened the toilet block as yet because if you remember that the recreation ground committee we're opening it in the er after the school has started and shutting it before the school ends so that we don't have the problems of vandalism which we've had in the past hopefully
so we'll o er don our UNK has agreed to it erm during the daytime
steve
if you er go down and visit the toilet block you will see above the doors there are a number of bricks that have come loose on both sides
this is due to the fact that no UNK was placed in there when the building was UNK
and there's actually cracks appearing
UNK
UNK yeah
i'm very concerned that if we don't get some urgent UNK action to do this brickwork that we're UNK to have a major problem down there
also the roof is UNK in several places there are cracks appearing on the UNK which need even to my eyes need to be filled
erm what i've done is i've asked for quotes from three companies er to see how much work how much it'll cost us to take this action
i feel that we must take it almost immediately because if those bricks do go we're going to have a major
i think you'll find that all on the back side and those bricks will be into the UNK at the back
tied it
what they just sort of
yeah
yeah
what UNK happened is that there's a concrete span right at the back and they've the inner course off it but the external bit built off the door frame
UNK job
it is yes
it sounds like it
no that's how all places was built up until about nineteen seventy eight
oh well
well the door frame i mean the UNK be alright but they'll maybe just t UNK down and that that's what's happened the door frame has taken the weight it's UNK but is also UNK
in
in particular the UNK side
but in the sixties and seventies that's where all the kids used to jump up onto the flat roof that was the area where they jumped up so this could be a result of what has happened from there i mean that's why the
you weren't one of them were you
job to
what you used to do you see years ago was turn the off the lights inside the toilets and go in there at night and sleep
oh
who did
ooh
kids
and that's why we've got
so it's not a new thing this
UNK this side of the toilets now
it's not a new phenomenon
metal bricks which stops the kids getting in
and that's what they did they used to with that the steps the brickwork
fifty percent
we do have some we do have some grant applications on this because of it being public toilet and also improving the environment
mm
including one from british telecom which it seems to be being done quite well so it'll be improving the environment week
and it seems to me that it was an improvement of the environment to have some decent public toilets
very good
just one point it's rather a shame they can't be open at weekends
because there are quite a lot of adults in the park with younger children during the weekend
and i don't think there'd be a problem at four o'clock UNK as such i mean we did
i think that's maybe the recreation ground committee who's really looking after this on our behalf could actually investigate
you'd still have the problem of small children
yes
a and also that the erm UNK
we can't have them till this work's done
no
we have the problem though of getting them donald said he wasn't prepared to
oh well perhaps the new UNK was more
y what about the possibilities eventually
i mean the chaps in the tennis club are saying put it down
erm because it's an UNK
what about having some sort of one of these UNK or some UNK proof toilet there you know if er people actually pay to go in it wouldn't be so bad
well i know
those cost ninety thousand pounds
shall we get a grant for
can we suggest that the recreation ground look at the opening of the toilets and ask them to consider this at their next meeting
erm but we do need an approval to go out and for quotations and sorry UNK on this on this work which is actually urgent
erm
well can the clerk er ask about getting three UNK and take the lowest and get on with the job
yes
i think actually it would be a good idea if i met steve we er did a er a list of what wants doing exactly what wants doing
yes it really
a full specification
good idea
but with regard to the erm the of it you need more than ninety thousand
so there are three things that we've talked about then
an i an immediate going out to work on this re UNK the brickwork problem which is getting the UNK is significant and potentially dangerous at the moment the full refurbishment of the block which the grant applications are in for and the opening er and asking the recreation ground committee to r UNK the opening of the toilets
those three items
are we agreed on those
yeah
thank you
erm UNK repairs in southwell
yes steve
er this item was on the last agenda
i got a letter from richard who's the area manager of notts county council offering us er well let me read it to you it says thank you for your letter of twenty sixth of march and comments UNK
i shall be pleased to meet you and your councillors to discuss and inspect any problem areas
may i suggest one of the following
he's given me three dates when he'd be delighted to meet us erm friday the thirtieth of april four of may or fifth of may but other dates a as necessary
erm then he's very willing to go round with us
which one of those dates is
what days are they
friday the
tuesday wednesday
friday the thirtieth of april tuesday the fourth of may or wednesday the fifth of may
i can do any of those
yeah
is it to walk round
yes it's to walk round
peter you were you available at any of those times
i shall work in because i mean i'm the one who's been pushing to get them on this
i mean i would make sure i'm there cos i'm UNK with the pavements in southwell
so it's the pavements
it's the pavements
UNK
yes
pavement repairs
then
we can't get them done john cos of cable television
can we
it's a UNK excuse as far as i'm concerned and we can't wait long you know
steve will then er arrange one of the days the most convenient to himself and mr and since lynn and peter are able to accommodate UNK any of those three dates we'll circulate to other councillors er if anybody else is interested in commenting or providing information
is that agreed
mhm
thank you
perhaps we could do that
parking problems road southwell
we've had a reply from the county council erm we have we have had erm a reply they will be doing er a survey on road to see if it i wants inclusion
they say that the stop signs the UNK isn't erm again he's going to s to erm er he says that the stop signs the UNK isn't bad enough that the difficulties in UNK aren't bad enough but he's going to UNK that particular situation
he doesn't think that widening the carriageway on the corner of road and road will be very sensible but that wasn't what we were suggesting we were suggesting i think on er avenue rather than so we'll have to write back and tell him
i think one of the residents
residents did
yes
so he is actually taking some action and he will come back to us fairly soon he said erm about the result of his survey whether or not there'll be a residents' scheme down there
i've no further information on that
could we just er by following that up chairman suggest that they that they look at p the provision of double yellow lines around the UNK around those UNK that go from lower road into road because it's on that corner that you get the van parked which is causing the UNK problems
alright of course
it's not on the road
what
the van
double yellow lines around that UNK around the corner would actually stop that happening
right so we'll
been on that UNK
but i always thought it was illegal to park within fifteen yards of a corner anyway
and i can't understand why the police don't shift these vehicles
cos they're clearly dangerous and erm
the police have the powers to remove any vehicle if they think it's causing an obstruction no matter where it is
i know of similar things happening in that are equally bad if not worse and nobody seems to be able to get any action at all out of police district council or so
well
why i don't know
well i mean at least mr 's coming out and we'll ask steve to raise those very points with him and i'll also raise it with mr the inspector when i see the inspector about that particular issue
i mean i always thought if you were parked too close to it they take your number and next thing you know you get a UNK come through the post
i should think it's within sight of the police station anyway i should think
i will raise that with erm
shall i shall have to apologize to the council cos i mean i did do the survey of the erm residents and of course i had flu last month i do apologize i didn't actually manage to get that done
but if you still want me to do it i will do it
i think it would be probably worthwhile erm talking to the residents down there and actually explaining that th what's happening to them
it's all their cars isn't it
yeah
yes
worth it because full of cars
well they may well do
but at least we're taking some action and finding out what they want which is part of the problem
has the problem increased since the road through 's been UNK
well that may be something which we ma will actually find out when we
it should have done
can we move on then to erm purchase of the sports pitches
you'll be aware that the planning application is in there are some grant applications in with two er bodies erm the UNK and sherwood district council and the foundation for sports and arts
er we haven't heard from any of those
the committee meet the sub the committee has not met yet because there hasn't been any action and we won't be meeting until we get some movement from any of those three agencies who'll be UNK to us
may i ask chairman cos i missed the last meeting what the UNK is that the s an ad hoc UNK
yes it is
yes it is
we agreed to set it up at the last meeting
so what stage are we at
are we still UNK stage or have we taken a policy decision that we will purchase this ground unclear at the moment isn't it
well we have de delegated powers to the UNK which consists of myself roger lynn john and steve er steve
we're putting some money away for e expenses we've taken up the option to purchase we've put in a planning application for change of use we investigated possible grant applications we're investigating future expenditure and income generation and then we report back to this committee once
for the decision
for the
statement
we hadn't
we want to erm er found out or we make a UNK
that's right
a decision
we hadn't
finally whether or not to buy
we had not decided to purchase
that's right
right
we have taken an option to purchase at the at the cost as agreed which was the problem last time
whilst we get planning applications which is currently in
the grant applications are in and when we've got all that information er then UNK will erm bring all those reports together and present a report to the full council
john
yes we would do that
yes
an agreement yes
but what i haven't
you're going for that
we well that doesn't commit us to anything and doesn't cost any cost any money so that application is in i believe isn't it
well i haven't done it yet
cos gone to the sports foundation
right
yes
well we may not actually need to go to the p w l b for money because of the because of the grant we may actually get a hundred percent grant aid for this and if we get a hundred UNK hundred percent grant aid we won't need to
but that's i that's what the UNK will actually consider once we've actually er got some replies from these three agencies
are there any questions on the sports pitches
er right let's move on to 's recreation ground purchase of land
you will remember that the district council offered to sell the land for four thousand pounds and i think UNK got a report
well i phoned them up and i'd been UNK them and they told me to wait for a further communication
so when i didn't receive any further communication i've gone back to them and asked them whether they would be interested in reducing the price cos we consider it to be too high for that one acre of land
erm they say they would not be willing to change their valuation because that was the valuation er come to by the district values office from so they are not willing to come down in price
erm my recommendation at that price would be to say to you don't buy not at four thousand pounds when your rent is one hundred pounds a year
that's right
it would be erm i feel we should go back to them
there is a rent review due next year and i think they will be quite likely to ask you for additional rent erm amount of rent per annum to you
but even saying that if they doubled it to two hundred pounds it's a lot of years before we reach four thousand pounds
chairman if they ask for er additional rent all we have to say is no you maintain it as a as a recreation ground erm you know and then it passes back to them
er i i'm beginning to find the attitude of the district council on this not UNK
because we are actually spending a hundred pounds and UNK it when it's ac which it could therefore be their entire responsibility
now i'm minded at the moment to say look why should we pay a hundred pounds and pay all the all the all the refurbishment of that site because they won't be able to develop it there's no there's no access to that land
you know there's no access to that land so er why are they selling a at that price
so i d i am very much minded not to pursue the option of purchase
we've actually UNK that land for this year and wait and see what happens
roger
yes er i mean i agree with you chairman entirely i mean the arguments have been made before and i will just say them again that i think the district council are quite UNK er in asking for this sum of money particularly in view of the reason that the field is there which is for the recreation of the people who live in the estate and the back end of southwell and it always has been er and that is a responsibility that has been taken on by this parish council and if they feel that they wish to persist in asking an unreasonable price and let's face it the district council is in a position to look at this situation and say the parish council is doing an excellent job we will sell them this land for a figure that they can afford
if we are going to do the fencing er and everything else then may we then submit the bills for that work to the district council
and ask them to take that on board because i don't really see why we should be expected to take on both factors
so i would suggest that
i would have thought that we could request the UNK the fencing and tell them our plans for the fencing and not lose anything by asking for them to
yeah
make some
the position yeah it's as roger said and i think we've got to the stage now where we've shown good faith we've had that land put in good order and we can now i think quite UNK say we've done enough if you're not prepared to help any more it's over to you
cos at this point in time we would have left that piece of ground in excellent condition
it sticks in my throat that you know we've had to pay it but from the point of view of the residents we've done the right thing by letting it
but now we can quite UNK say that land was handed over to you in excellent condition
and if they fail to keep it up it's not our not our responsibility any longer
i'm
we just go o go on erm doing their job for them and paying out of our own pockets
i don't think this is the time to discuss what we're going to do in the future we've actually got on the table at the moment a proposal to purchase that land
what steve is saying r recommending to you is that we don't take up that purchase this year which is in our budget
peter
the boy scouts can on there for a number of years back to the fifties there've been excellent tenants of that piece of land
and when we bear in mind chairman that piece of land in the first instance was given to the southwell d c by a southwell resident
it's now been handed over to the district council i think they should be looking at it as a
that's what i think we should be asking for
yes
but it strikes
john cos john wa william gave him that
so they
nineteen forty nine
they want housing value for it don't they
and they say the district UNK valued it at that and they and they would be failing in their responsibility to maybe try
oh
to realize that money
well we're not going to give it to them
they've done very well out of that parcel of land that was given
all the land to build those homes on they was given the land for that re recreation ground and i believe they should hand that back to the parish and the people
yeah well we agree with you peter but they won't do it
yeah but it's what they
the only thing on the table at the moment is whether we pursue the option to purchase this year
no i propose we don't
i second that
we weren't aware of that were we
very clearly then we've got a proposal that we don't pursue that option which we've paid the UNK rent this year we've paid the lease this year so we can't UNK on that but maybe that'll come up for future discussion
so we have a proposal that we don't pursue that option to purchase
john
just want a final point
well just a final point would it be worthwhile er UNK the district council of the history of the site chairman because they may not be aware as the as the new owners of the site they took it over from the southwell district council on reorganization
so they may not be aware of its history
a UNK er of land was in fact given and this piece of UNK land was
well i think the chairman of the committee s is aware because he's been he's been told
but
has he
yes i think so
so we have an o we have a dis we have a proposal then not to proceed with the purchase of that land this year
anybody in favour
those against
could i make an amendment
well it's only in the interests of the council
er
new proposal
well i make a proposal that we also give them notice that at the end of this year we will not be prepared to continue the lease on the current licence
mhm
no i think that we should wait and see what we're being offered to us cos there's a lot of er you know
there's no there's no need to sort of rush at the i think we wait and see what they're going to offer us in er whenever it is that it comes up for renewal
and then we make all these
it's no good to them this land if sold in the on this particular piece of land they've sold all the viable access off to the residents of the haven't they so there there's no right of way really for them to get down there and it should be cheap
right well we that proposal is there a seconder for that proposal
no
so we'll come back to that issue later because we'll have to approve whether we rent the land i in future years anyway it does come up
can i move on to bridge repair of road
we've already referred t i've already referred to a bit of this in my er discussion with regard to the access to the er nature reserve
there is a problem on the on that bridge repair which is the which is the wooden plank er which a prevents access to the side of the of the UNK
can i suggest that those members of the general purposes committee who are going to look at that area anyway also have a look at the me the problems of this bank side which is actually UNK er due to the weight of people
i think that's the problem there
so could we defer that to general purposes as well
and while th they're down there can they put a co re bend that UNK we used to have a UNK it's got pushed into the UNK and it's gone down a few yards
this is what we're talking about as well it's
yeah
so there's a there's a job for general purposes possibly on that on the bridge
can we defer it to general purposes
thank you
erm maintenance of the road football pitch we've had some complaints er on the er road football pitch which relate to the er caravan access erm caravan use we've also had some er comments from the pub saying that they actually appreciate the UNK being in the area because of the increased trade
so er can i suggest that we actually ask the recreation ground committee to look at these problems over the er i don't think there are any significant problems actually after the after the easter weekend fortunately but just to have er in reply to the city football club because they are concerned and have been i have to say for many years so it's not unusual
the fact that we the parish council maintain that pitch
yes
and yet the revenue from the UNK goes to district council
it's er
are you
UNK

at ten and thruppence a week
and that was in the splitting job where you was handling skins sheep skins
and with the lime and the chemicals that makes your fingers sore what are called birds eyes
that red raw
you could you couldn't bear them a night time
and you used to wear er leather i've still got a skin
this or someone else's sister would be they used to give you this to make your
you cut a piece out and you'd UNK it up like that you see
that sort of thing er you used to wear them to protect to protect your fingers cos it used to get red raw if you didn't
anyway i started there i got the ten and three a week and er eventually not very good at that time quite a lot of short time
and they didn't have three days on and three days off you used to go in this particular shop at eight o'clock and maybe finish at half past ten or eleven o'clock because there was no more skins coming through
and what exactly were you doing
wh what exactly was your job
splitting
splitting shop
now that's a sheep skin
you see or it was
the splitting machine that's one half of a sheep skin that's the outside
now the splitting machine used to cut that skin down there like that
cut it in half then
split it in two
so you got two skins
now one half this would maybe go for clothes er coats or
and the other half used to go as a window leather which are called st
UNK
UNK leather that's it
mm
and so you got th two skins out of out of one sheep
er one would go one process and another would go the other
er that was the splitting shop
there was all sorts of processes before it got to that and after it got to that stage
er
and what exactly was your job in the splitting shop then
well i worked with a man on a machine
and a we used to get the skin i used to pick the skin up
give him one part now you hold that i used to hook it on to a roller tuck it over pull it through and then you've got it lined up UNK on to a roller
and then he used to bring the knife there was a knife going like that a big knife one about four foot
and th this knife was going like this and the roller was pulling the skin round
and it was pulling the one that you'd UNK on was pulling that one and the other one going out the back
so you that was splitting
now do you actually remember going to work the first day you were you were going to work
the first day yeah short trousers
er the first day i didn't stay dinner
home but it was only a few yards anyway from
so eventually we i used to get er couple UNK of bread and i used to get thruppence every day
now i i'd got all sorts of alternatives to buy
had a pork shop in street
we'd have a choice of three UNK of which were a which was a big chunk three UNK of UNK er what else is there
three UNK of UNK beef er and then you could go down on to the fish and chip shop in street
and get er three UNK of chips three UNK of fish bits
which was a good meal substantial meal you know for thruppence
now from being at school enjoying yourself and enjoying yourself and going to work did you feel differently
feel
did you feel differently with working
no i don't think so
did you enjoy work
yeah
funny thing i've enjoyed every job i've done
and i mean that
er the splitting shop wasn't particularly good i i'd say
but you were glad to get a job that were the thing
that made you pleased
but once i got out of the splitting shop out into the dry handling leather rather than skins er it were terrific absolutely terrific
i were in a UNK shop
and the UNK shop used to er get UNK that side make it smooth you know
well
then i went glazing
how much of a difference to your family did it make that you were working financially
well
when i went home a when i was started at ten and thruppence a week it was a UNK regulation in the family that the spending money erm basis what you got for spending was a penny in the shilling
now i earned ten and thruppence used to take the ten and thruppence home and i used to get UNK ha'penny spending money
weren't eleven pence weren't ten pence weren't a shilling UNK ha'penny
and that was it
then that went when you're fifteen i was fifteen i were getting twelve and six
same again one shilling and a ha'penny
not one and a penny not a shilling
till i was er i went i left and went to gun factory
er
and then when i was eighteen er eighteen yeah started paying my board then
pound a week
er while you were working did you still try and get sort of like odds and ends and little bits of money
yeah wh when you was on short time ooh yeah
we used to i've sold card of the match at cricket matches
i've sold cushions at the cricket matches
quite a few of us from used to go down to cricket match
and UNK when football UNK and reserve matches at we used to there were one or two weren't many cars about then you see
but there was a few
and we could look after cars at the er reserve matches
now wh while you were working w was your father working at this time
no not very often
very seldom
he did work on er county er stand the one that's still there
he did a f a few jobs and they were nearly all temporary
they didn't last long
most all UNK jobs
and none of them last long you know
you couldn't get a regular job or he couldn't anyway
and erm did your mother work or was she bringing up the family
my mother used to er whe when we were younger used to come down the for a days' UNK
er she did one or two jobs there
well er
was there a lot of erm drinking used to go on in the in the in the area at the time
well you take to hear to hear them talk you you'd think everybody were drunk every night but it wasn't so
er i've known er one bloke he he'd send for a pint of UNK beer when it was sixpence a pint and then he'd send for another pint and he'd be drunk or he'd be ready f to fight anybody that wanted to fight him
and there usually was somebody ready to fight him for twelve especially on a saturday night
now saturday night in street we used to call it the UNK street UNK every saturday night
you could guarantee that if you waited top of one of those yards that somebody would be fighting or wanted to fight or a window could get broken or either men or women
men and women they'd just fight each other but women used to have a go ar argue not f particularly fighting but you know falling out
and the men they of often used to have a go
and the lads
did you have any real characters in th in the
oh yes yeah
i'm not going to name them because of the family they're dead now
oh yes there was one er he had a UNK
er people who er who lived do th they'll know and then the family will know
cos he was sir you know
oh and there was er
why did they used to call him sir
well he used to go to er used to go to the british UNK every sunday morning
now he had about he about seven or eight kids i think he must have done yeah
two three four five yeah
and in the week i don't think he was working at the time but on a sunday morning he'd walk out of that terrace house and er he'd be UNK absolutely
he'd have a walking stick he'd have a UNK a top hat and a stiff collar and he'd swing this cane and walk up the street
there goes sir yes
what reputation did the have with other areas at the time
was it seen as being a rough place
did it what
what reputation did the have with other areas of at the time
was it thought to be rough by everyone else
oh yes we had a reputation
er i'd a lad a street that's what it they used to call us
er yeah well you know we were rough because but i mean if we got into a fight there we there were no gang UNK
there was a gang of us but i mean er if one of us got involved with a fight it was him and him
and we used to stand down and leave it at that
no UNK interfere
you know it was a fair fight there were no kicking
we'd just fight and that was it
and i suppose i well i used to go about with a gang but we never UNK anybody
you know you used to talk about raids and er a black hand gang and all this sort of thing but we no
if there was any trouble we we'd fight but one on one
wouldn't gang up four onto one five onto one and UNK and UNK nothing none of that nonsense
how long wer were you actually at then
well i started at fourteen and i had to leave er when i was fifteen and no nearly sixteen
and then i went back at er eighteen until i were twenty three i think it was
now why did you leave first time
got a short time
were only working half days
and where did you go
and what did you do there
i started painting and then i went to be rivet UNK
and then i was UNK mate
i really enjoyed that
really enjoyed it
was it what was the differences that you noticed between and
what
different what
what were the big differences between the two
well it were the variety you got at
you see er there was a riveter and a holder up his mate and a rivet UNK
that's yo that was the team
now we used to build the frame of a coach UNK er passenger coach
we used to build all the frame and the roof UNK no fitted
er bolt it together first and then rivet it after
so all the time th there were different job
different size rivets different lengths and i while i were UNK i knew where eventually knew where what size rivet to put in a certain place
and you used to get them hot ready for the rivet for the riveters
and then we'd get onto the roof with the little tiny rivets quarter inch rivets
and maybe an hour after we'd be on three quarter rivets
or five UNK or half inch so you got the variety as well and different jobs to do all day long
and wh why did you leave there
well it closed down
and how did you get back into then
well er my mother went down the yard i won't tell you about the other sister
my mother went down the yard and seen the boss and asked him if he could get and the fact that my mother went down the yard i suppose er he must have felt sorry for us
anyway i got back and er
was it the same wages
on no i was older then you see i was er i was they sent me straight back into the splitting shop
and within er a week i was told to go into the dry part handling in the UNK shop
er and then i was on my own time in the UNK shop and i was getting a man's wages
so what were you
coming out with then
mm
what were you getting then
er let's see er around about thirty shillings about thirty five bob a week
which were good money for a single fella
erm now you said you went away you lived away from home for a bit when you when you were eight
mm
did you say you lived away from home for a bit
yeah when i were eighteen
now erm you were saying bef was there a union at the at the time
oh yeah
what you what you
there wasn't
you lost your job trying to start one
no th there was a union we were trying to UNK more members
oh
oh the union was there the amalgamated society of leather workers
it was a national union but it was a crime more or less with some bosses to belong to a trade union
now it's a crime if you don't belong to a trade union
you see i think although i can't prove this you see what happened when i was in the in the glazing shop we were we were on short time
and instead of er having half day every day cos there were no prospects of much stuff coming through they'd say well we'll all have two weeks off each
two men will have two weeks off and it were twelve in the shop
so two would be off for a fortnight and then two more and then two more
now the fella that i worked with was the president of the union from the branch
and i was er doing my part i thought to change the world and get everybody into the union so we could get better conditions for everybody and all this more money anyhow
er and i used to go to night school to learn er national council of labour colleges to learn economics
er and eventually we changed the foreman the union changed the foreman
and the foreman er we used to play about UNK about throw orange peel at each other you know cos it were a boring job you just stand like this and you could more or less close your eyes you know
after a while so to relieve the UNK we used to throw orange peel at each other little bits you know screw it up and one hit this bloke who was made foreman before he was made foreman a and we had a fight
he come at me and he was six foot two and he come he were gonna knock hell out of me so i had to protect myself and we got fighting in the shop
anyway we forgot about it and then he was made foreman later
so i thought well that's
anyway when the time came to stop off for short time everybody had their turn except the union president and myself and he came to me this foreman and he said er now john i don't want you to think what happened between me and you will make any difference about being sent back for
i said well i hope not anyway i says er if you do i shall have a go at you
so er time went on i didn't get the sack i just wasn't sent back for
neither was the union man
now how did you become involved with the union
are you
well
always interested in politics
no
i went in this shop with this next to this fella
and when i hear that when you're working you're talking as well and he was a good UNK and he you know he was a good union a good clever speaker and he impressed me
er and then he got me he er he got me interested in politics and he got me going to this n c l c evening classes
and i got interested and you know it wer i was UNK very interested in economics
and did you become a union represent did you get involved in union politics
oh yes i was on the committee at
er i was on the committee on the buses but that was later
i was a UNK man for bridge depot
er yes i was very keen i'm very interested
er
what did your family and do your friends have views about politics
i means did they were they surprised you become involved
yes er i remember a chap at the depot doing the spanish civil war er wh th there was a movement going round collecting food for the or money for food for the children of spain
children
and i was in the depot and i and i was er trying to er get some money for this thing or doing something for it anyway and this bloke said john he said what the bloody hell are you got interested in the people of spain for
we're talking about nineteen thirty six now thirty seven
i said well i said if we don't those UNK in and spain we're gonna get them over here
i didn't realize what i was saying but it proved to be true
those UNK in bombing the people of spain bombed us eventually
anyway er that was the er no nobody else made any comment one or two was s surprised
you know that i should be interested well i was the secretary of labour party for a time
whe when you started off becoming interested in politics when you were working at we were your friends surprised
were they not interested in politics or your family
no you see it's the fact that you're working your conditions your environment if you're working in a certain place it's almost built up in the beginning
it wasn't till people got together into factories and er workshops and things like that
and working in close relation and discussing things that this is exactly what happened at
now i in one shop er you'll never hear mention of politics it would be all football man football this football the other
but if you get involved working with somebody else who may be interested in politics then you start talking and this is how it UNK
i mean er you see th i should say there was about six or seven who were keen on the trade union
they weren't UNK communists or anything like that they were just good trade union men
and they'd be talking now you could bet they could get somebody interested in that shop on politics or trade unionism they'd get one in that shop
now erm was it through this union activity you became interested in the labour party
it's same thing same man
i see and did you did you do a lot of canvassing for them and all this sort of thing
at election time oh yeah
have you got any stories about that
er well i were out of work and er UNK elections used to come in november
er and er there were great UNK between the con er the conservatives and the er labour party
and er apart from canvassing which we did
a UNK cos i was a block steward i used to collect the UNK and at election time we would do a UNK of our own block
er asking people whether they were favourable or mark them favourable or not favourable and so on
er and then w we used to do the bill UNK vote for so and so or vote for so and so
we used to stick ours up and if we see any fresh blue ones we should pull them down
er and they used to do the same to ours
er then election day we were out all day with a driver of a car getting people out and for them or going through the motions
i've looked after the kids for them while they've gone to vote anything to get them here that was the thing
cos they er walter used to say any positive voters we must get them out on the day
and apart from that time during er elections etcetera how much involvement would you have just a normal we week where there's no elections on or anything
did you have meetings very often
er well yes at er there were several er michael foot UNK and jimmy UNK and UNK and jimmy UNK
there was communists there was i m ps there were labour party men and at that time there was a unity campaign
er it were led by sir UNK and er michael foot
UNK well i i've gone to meetings in the albert hall and i've gone to meetings at sheffield
i joined the er demonstration in UNK park
er when the durham UNK came
er we was there for the er when they came in
er were several meetings public meetings
UNK he was in the albert hall when all that trouble was we were together then weren't we
at er UNK
you used to go the weekly meetings the labour party
the month
that's what that's what you're talking about isn't it the weekly meetings
monthly meetings
pardon
monthly meetings
monthly meetings
yeah
you used to go to
oh yeah it was a monthly meeting
could you tell us about UNK and s and wh what happened then
well er first of all you'd get the minutes of the last meeting and then you you'd get correspondence and then you'd get chairman's remarks
and then somebody would bring something up
it may be the pro prospective candidate or panel name to go forward on a prospective candidate or something like that er and then there'd be er a talk by the chairman about the finances or what we ought to do er to organize er events to improve the finances
it was all about money or you know there wasn't a great deal of political activity or great deal of political work done in the labour party
it was all done er the borough labour party
now you got you got you got your war ward which was nothing because the wards was er the chairman and the secretary absolutely
you know er and they'd tell people and there was no never much debating as such
what you laughing at
nothing
go on
he er he asked you about er wh who was it
UNK did you say that you went to see UNK in a meeting
we went to a public meeting at the albert hall me and her when sir UNK came to
er and a lot got chucked out
when was this
ooh nineteen thirty six or seven
and was he
go on
before we was married
thirty six or seven
thirty six
and we was up in the in the it was a protest as far as i was concerned
yeah
you know and we went and we UNK and er a lot got thrown out cos he had his UNK there you know
and er he were a bit rough with them and all
ah
was there a lot of trouble then
wasn't a great deal of trouble in but th there was in the east end of london if you if you we can read can read about that
er and in several places where he did go because he his supporters were UNK really
you know there were no doubt about that they were
and how much how much were your UNK for the labour party how much was your membership
ooh er wasn't er i can't remember now
i think it was er wasn't a great UNK sixpence i think it was
and when did you join the labour party
ooh i'd be UNK er UNK i'd be twenty so nineteen thirty three
and were there sort of like clubs and societies associated with the labour party that you got UNK
no
no the labour party as far as i was concerned was just a meeting a monthly meeting in above the co op in grove
where the co op used to be not the co op now
in that room up there once a month and at elections times and that was it no more
i see
now you were saying before your father er was unemployed quite a lot of the time during your childhood erm did he actually get any unemployment benefit while he was on the dole
yes er now what did get
there were u a b unemployment assistant board and there was a means test at the time as well
er when i was s i used to get eight shilling at one time unemployment benefit
and you'd got to go and look for work
and you you'd got to tell them that you'd been where you'd got where you'd been
you know
er
did you know how much your dad got
no
no not can't remember now not to be sure
would the what exactly was the means test UNK what did that involve
did they come and visit your house
no you were called to the labour exchange
er i think a court of UNK i think they called it
yeah
wasn't it
ah
yeah
that just come to me now
court of UNK
you didn't get money did you
you got food tickets
ah ye yeah it depends how
you didn't get money
how much er you'd got and how much you'd got coming in and how much you'd you know your what your erm commitments were and
right
you know
er
did you at the time or in the thirties did you have any involvement with the unemployment claims union or anything like that
i didn't
no
no
not myself no
were other people involved in with it
oh well there must have been
must have been
yeah but er didn't you go to an unemployment school
eh
an unemployment school
a club an unemployment club
what was that
well it was a place on street and it's still there that one
it's above the shop just above up the stairs
and there was a big room and you and you could go there and make things out of wood
i've got a table somewhere i've made
er or you could make anything and there was an UNK there showing you
you'd got the tools and different things and show you how to use them
you paid for it
yeah but didn't you have to go there to get your dole
oh no that was
that was a school
ah that's the one i'm thinking about
ah that's street
now when we was between sixteen and eighteen if you was unemployed you'd got to go to school
half day every day
one week you'd go in the mornings the next day you'd go in the afternoon
this was at street UNK club still there
now but we had teachers the headmaster of street school he was the head teacher at the out of work school
and then we had a two one teacher who later was at school
mr er and he'd give us sums arithmetic tell us stories er historical events or something like that
but what we were keen about was football
one teacher he used to say well what we gonna do today
oh come on let's go down lane and have a game of football
you see
he used to play with us as well
we used to go it's a nice day mr i go down football
come on then and we we'd walk down to lane and play our game of football
but you'd got to go and you'd got to mark your register and if you didn't go you'd lose a day's dole
at tha at this time in the twenties and early thirties was there a lot of people unemployed in street and around there
oh yeah
oh yes
er there were very few that had a regular job really
er c the density of the street itself er cos you was nine UNK with twenty four houses in two hundred yards you've got a lot of people together haven't you
er and the people that had a regular job now there was one next door to us
he was er more or less well off still in terrace but you know he was they seemed to be well off and probably were
cos he had good regular job at
but er now in our yard on our side there'd there would be er one two three four only four out of the twelve or thirteen houses the men had a regular job
and that was pretty it was it'd vary in some cases but in som it was worse than that and some were better than that but generally speaking there were a lot of unemployment
tell him about
what
he'd come and borrow
in one terrace and i'm not gonna mention names again because the family's still around you know and i don't want to UNK them
but we'd to go down th one yard and in the middle of the yard there was a gap between the UNK and the coal houses just about er four foot s square
well that's where we used to play cards on top of the dustbin
a dustbin lid and put a board over it you know
and this man he was a regular dustbin man and he'd been at it all his life and he used to play cards with us and his family his sons and as many else as got any money to play UNK or UNK
and because he wa he was really the only one that was in regular work in the yard i'm sorry well there was another one but still there wasn't many everybody was short of something some day
and it would always come at weekends
and it would always come when we were playing cards
first one mrs so and so me mam says it was always me mam says mam says can you lend her cup of sugar
er mam said can you tell her time please
mam said have you got a penny for the gas
mam says have you got a tub of UNK
or anything you know so this er man one day he says we were playing cards he said i'm bloody fed up with this
he said now what do they want
so me mam says so he went in the house and says his wife's name he said give me a pencil and paper
he got a sheet of paper about that long to all concerned we have no salt UNK mustard UNK our clock does not keep good time er
sugar
oh tea sugar
he put all down and he pinned it on the back on the back door
did a lot of this helping of each other go on
oh yes
people er i mean th they couldn't help a lot because they'd got nothing themselves a lot of them but there was a lot of help done without any fuss or bother i mean er a UNK say er have you got a UNK
er well i've only got silk cut
okay
now to get in a pub that was another thing
of many in summertime we always used to stand at the top of the yards you know men and women
men used to be down on UNK you know and the and the women stand there arms folded UNK away
er and then UNK come along and say are you jack
can't
why
i haven't got a lap UNK
couldn't get in the pub because he hadn't got a UNK
now a la UNK was thruppence his first half pint
now once he got in for his half pint in the in the passage he'd have he'd have a good UNK and it was about when he'd got to bottom of the glass put it down
i say what did you do that for
well it holding it in UNK waiting for somebody to ask him to have a drink and invariably somebody would but if they did ask him they'd always ask him back next time you know if they couldn't do it this time
that was the you know there was that sort of spirit there were very few UNK er well there were UNK of course but few people who er who didn't UNK if they had a drink they bought one back
they'd say are you coming in
no i can't buy you one back
that don't matter now
and they wouldn't go in if they couldn't buy one back
there were a lot of that sort of thing
oh yeah
right mr could you tell me when and where you were born
when and where
i was born on june the eighth nineteen thirteen in an place called in UNK south wales
and how big was the family at the time
well my mother had five children with her previous husband and my father met my mother while this fella was ill and he eventually died with t b and my father married my mother and took on these five children i in south wales
and were you the first born
i was the first of the
and how large eventually did the family get to
let's see there was er nelly UNK tommy edward and donald
five er ten eleven
nelly tommy nelly UNK donald edward UNK that's seven isn't it
mm
twelve
now could you tell us about how it came about that you moved to
mm
oh after the war the fi first world war my father was er sent home wounded in nineteen eighteen or nineteen
and he was a wounded pensioner er and he applied for a grant which you which er a wounded soldier in the first world war could get if you had a pension he could get a grant of that pension to learn a trade
and he could also apply to go to and take a course of instruction on or a trade to learn a trade
and it he went to college
and he did the course and after he'd finished the course he found a house up road and er sent for the family
so my mother brought us all to on the train and er i was at that time about let's see nineteen thirty twenty i think i was eight years of age then
i see and how long did you live there up road
er not very long because he er he started a business and er and he didn't do ever so well cos times were bad in the twenties you know as you know
and er the rent was twenty one shillings at that time which was rather a lot for a council house so we had an exchange down to street in the where the rent was about seven and six which was a big difference
now the has changed a lot recently mr
could you describe what it was like when you first moved there the area itself
yeah well take er there were some good patches in the you know there were some quite decent houses and some very nice people
but there were some like me i suppose on the other side
er now t take a take one street er we'll say street
it were known as park
now that street with from two hundred yards of it there'd be nine UNK each with twenty four houses in each terrace within this two hundred yards so there were a lot of people closely knit together and er there was quite a lot of UNK unemployment quite a lot of poverty
yet people were friendly you know
they'd do anything for you within reason you know
er they'd help each other if they were sick er well let's say quite a lot were unemployed down there and there were always someone that i've seen men stand at top of yard and say have you got a UNK jack
he say well i've o i've only got two and he'd break a UNK in half and they'd have half each
and instead of having a few UNK and saving and throwing two dog ends away you didn't see that they'd just break it in half and have half each
now you were saying just then that erm parts of the were different than the other parts
yeah
in what way
well there seemed to be like er grove er road it seemed a bit better off you know
they seemed to have more money
er well i suppose it's the same nowadays you know isn't it
and on the estates sort of people there were different UNK types of people but street would ha had a name
yeah there were a few characters down there
er well i'm not gonna mention their names now but er quite a few characters believe me
er i were telling you about the UNK in one particular terrace you could just imagine it in what nineteen er twenty si no twenty seven twenty eight and you know things were bad you talk about the thirties the twenties were worse than that
i've seen th this fella came down and he was selling UNK and er he went down this particular terrace and he must have sold seven eight or nine or ten on both sides
at one and six a week
and the price was thirty nine pounds and as far as i know at the time the UNK went down that terrace i don't think anybody could play it properly
they'd all have a little bash one or two fingers you know i did even on one particular one
er but nobody could really play the piano yet they all bought them
and eventually there was quite a few went back before they were paid for
er at th
m mr er could you tell us about your sch where did you go to school
road
and how old were you when you when you first went
road school no sorry road
road school i'd be ten i should think nine or ten
aye
i wasn't there very long cos i only went in one class in road school
then we moved to the and then i went to road school which i finished my time there fourteen
i left at fourteen
now can you remember what you were taught at school the curriculum
yes
UNK well it'd be first of all it was er an hour of religion where the headmaster used to have us all together all the classes together
and sing UNK and maybe have er a lesson or two on one particular part of the bible
and after that you'd go to your own classes and you had a set er what did they call it
set er programme where you had er maybe an hour's arithmetic
addition UNK multiplication and so on do so many sums a day each lesson
and after that you'd maybe have er well be UNK then
and about ten minutes UNK running round the yard come back and maybe have a history lesson
er maybe half and hour history and half an hour geography and er science er but it were all UNK very UNK stuff
er wasn't nothing technical you know
was the discipline very strong in the school
oh yes very strong
one man in particular er again i won't mention his name but anybody that went to road UNK know who i mean when i say that if you did anything wrong he'd call you out and ask you something and if you if you like pupils used to be a bit shy and not speak to him he'd slap you across the face
i mean slap not just sideways with his hand and then he'd give you the strap after that
er one case i know he he's so well known amongst the old lads er he used to give you so many sums to do each day and i think it was four or five long division
and when you're learning them you know it's alright now but when you're learning it's very difficult
it was to me
so you used to take these five sums out to be marked and he'd put right tick right wrong right you know
and he said to me he'd marked my sum and as it happened they was right all of them
so whether he didn't believe that i i'd got them right or not i don't know but the answers were there
and then he picked one particular line out he said where did you get this figure from
now as you know when we used to do the sums we used to have a little bit of paper and work it out on this separate bit of paper but he said to me out of the blue he said where did it how did you get that figure
well at that particular time i couldn't tell him
i says er i don't know sir
never went to me spare bit of paper probably eventually but he hadn't got time for that
so i said i don't know sir
he looked at me he said you've copied haven't you
i said no sir
because the bloke next to me used to give cakes to copy off me
anyway er he says you co i said no sir
so he UNK me across the face
he said you've copied haven't you
i said no sir
he said he got the strap out of the desk about three or four you must know what a strap is don't you
one come on hold it up two three on that hand three on this hand
six UNK and a slap across the face and i hadn't copied
and when he'd s finished he said you've copied haven't you
i said no sir
and he said go on
oh it was it if you did anything wrong especially with that fella you were you were a
oh yes there were no er there was no er no nonsense i mean you wouldn't dare answer the teacher back like they did now and call them by their christian names
we wouldn't dare do that we wouldn't think of doing that
did you have any favourite subjects at school
yeah geography
yeah i was always well er in that particular class from that i was always either the top of the second or the third at geography
now did you want the s did you ever have the chance to stay on at school
no i didn't even get a chance to sit the eleven plus
i wasn't allowed to s sit for the eleven plus
well why was that
my father said i'd got to leave school at fourteen
and would you have wanted to stay on
mm i don't think so i wasn't er i were all for looking for a going to work you know
i wanted to go to work i didn't want to stay at school
can you remember when you were at school what sort of games you used to play
oh yeah cricket football er sometimes UNK swimming UNK stick a bum tin UNK
could you explain what those last three were
UNK etcetera
five stones they call it you know
UNK you know what i mean don't you
they had the five UNK and you chuck them on back of your hand and eight UNK nine er nine flies ten and you know
er UNK stick a bum
what's that
well that was one would stand against the wall and about four would get down like that and you had a team say of five
and you'd say UNK stick a bum here i come and you'd run and hop onto and get on as far a onto these backs as you could
and you'd all got to get on and stay on for a little while without touching the floor then you could have another go
and then we'd tin UNK er you you'd get a tin you don't you know tin UNK
go on go on
you get a tin er and whoever's sort of looking after the tin er somebody kicks it UNK kick the tin and then you all go and hide and he has to find you before you can come back and kick the tin
so while he's looking for you somebody could run out and kick the tin there you go and fetch him and if he'd caught anybody and when you kicked that tin the other well you could all go and hide
you sort of released him to go and hide again
er UNK which is er similar to er i dunno american UNK in a fashion isn't it
well we used to play that in the street you see have the UNK the top of the yard and there and have to set a good target UNK
of course there was football and cricket and swimming in the UNK jumping off the suspension bridge was a regular thing
could you tell us about swimming in the UNK mr what you used to do
oh yeah well that was where i learnt to swim in the UNK on road er it's the bridge that goes over lane near
and there's a UNK on one side and i suppose the UNK it's still there the UNK is on only about what three or four yards wide
and what we used to do to begin with the UNK used to dip in the middle you know there was bike wheels and dead cats and everything in it and it used to dip and there was a UNK and the UNK used to go up and down with a horse pulling them and in the middle there was a so you couldn't bottom it in the middle so when i learnt to swim i used to UNK off this UNK and go under the water so far and i could reach the bottom when i got to the other side
and hang onto the UNK
and i gradually began to swim like that
well we used to go in the dinner hour from road school
and then at nighttime we used to come down to the if we if we didn't go in baths which was smashing it was absolutely great had two UNK and a UNK board er and a deep end and a and a shallow end for kids
it were lovely in the opposite the UNK pool now
and then the other favourite place was the suspension bridge
cos there was a lot of sand and UNK just under the UNK suspension bridge on the right hand side then and it would go UNK gradually UNK towards the middle without being too deep
you know only right in the middle and we used to jump off the suspension bridge regular some used to UNK but i never did UNK there
i used to jump off the middle of the suspension bridge
now going back to your actual home environment mr erm if there was always could you actually describe how the house was built
my
the make up of the house in street
well it we it was a terrace and one side of the UNK the front doors were facing each other and there was twelve or thirteen houses on each side
the front doors facing each other
one side of terrace had a little garden a little UNK stamp no ever so small
some used to keep them quite nice as well but they were that tiny
now the other side we didn't have one at all we did it were just the path down
now the round the UNK used to go down the yard and on the left hand side of the yard there was a toilet and a coal house
everybody had a coal house not many had coal in
much coal in anyway
some did some had them full and some didn't and er there was a toilet and a toilet and a coal house across the yard and then we used to go in the back door and there was a tiny little kitchen
i suppose about one and a half yards perhaps not that square and in the corner there was what they called what we had the copper for boiling the clothes make it with small coal and coal and wood and paper and boil the water and my mother used to do the washing there and we had a big old UNK with wooden rollers out in the back yard that was always out in the back yard
and on the top of that we used to keep a sink bath
er not the long one we didn't have a long one we had a UNK one
and we used to keep that on top of the UNK
and then at the side of the copper there was a gas stove and there was some shelves where we used to put silver UNK
and round to the left to the copper was a sink a stone sink just cold water
then the kitchen there were the living room was er about three by three by three i should think maybe three and a half by three
now we had a coal fire on one side there was the er hot water boiler and on the other side there was the oven
er the copper the hot water boiler we had a top on and you fill it up and then when the water was hot take it out
well this all had coal and the UNK want wanted sweeping and if you didn't sweep your UNK regular the UNK used to come down onto this water into this er boiler
we were very often washing with er UNK water
and how many bedrooms did it have
two
now er if there was twelve of you
ah well not there wasn't twelve to all together
er because me UNK me sister two of me sisters went in service er there was me at this time me brother two sisters no two brothers five six well i have we have at one time me mother and father slept downstairs in the front room
er me and me brother and two sisters slept in one bed two at the bottom two at the top
and then the other room was for the bigger the elder ones
er i think there was just UNK at home then
yeah she's dead now
UNK older than UNK
ah but UNK wasn't at home then
oh
she was in service
so you know we had back room for the elder and the youngsters into to well we were only kids you know then
talking about twelve and er eleven or twelve thirteen
now erm did you say your father got a pension from the army
a what
did you say your father got a pension from the army
yeah
w was it a decent well i mean was it a living wage
yeah i think i think it was about by the time he he'd had this allowance from you know going to college i think it left him with about twenty seven bob a week which wasn't bad you know
because a UNK w was only earning thirty shilling a week
a UNK on a railway was only on er i think it was twenty seven to thirty bob a week
a skilled man at that time was earning one and tuppence an hour
for forty eight hours and the UNK was on UNK ha'penny an hour
so you know it wasn't a bad little pension was it
er erm
UNK
could you tell us about the ways in which you as a child used to try and get some money for yourself and the family
what the boy the lads
yeah
oh yeah
well there was a it was such a job at that time you couldn't get work and we used to genuinely look for work every day but it was just a waste of time
so we had to go to pictures and we had to have a few or whatever
so one of the ways was at that time the co op used to have a horse and cart coming round the streets fruits and they used to sell rabbits
well the lads used to skin the rabbits for the customers and throw the skin ov over the top of this cart horse and cart
so we'd jump up an get one of these rabbit skins and then we'd take it back to wholesale UNK in street and get fourpence for it
well that would enable us to go to UNK one of us to go to pictures and get a penny bag of sweets or a UNK of fruits or a UNK of UNK
you see we were never hungry although you know er times were bad and all that you were never short of money either
because another one was er we come down the houses in here empty houses and in the summer they used to grow flowers UNK and we used to go in the UNK we weren't supposed to er and cut these flowers and make them into UNK and sell them for tuppence and thruppence a bunch
nice big UNK you know and wonderful value for the people
and was there any other ways you used to is there any other things you used
to do
er UNK outside the arms and the bridge hotel every night maybe only get sixpence or UNK cos there wasn't that many cars about at the time
and we used to say to them er can i mind your car sir
aye keep your eye in it my lad
and he'd come out maybe at ten o'clock just gone and give you tuppence or some would give you a penny
er and then another one was er bottles we used to go round the back of er and get a bottle or two bottles and get tuppence penny on the pint and tuppence on the UNK bottles
and take them back into the shop or send somebody else with them and er get our picture money that way
and then er we'd maybe get thruppence between us and let one go and pay to g to in the pictures and open the lift the bar up the emergency exit and get in on our hands and knees behind the curtain
was this quite a common thing for the lads in the to do things like this
oh yes yeah we all did it
we all did it
they still do it actually
do they
i don't know
i reckon our david's done it
there were different gangs you see there was there was er my say our gang we'd be er thirteen to fifteen
and then there was another gang fifteen to eighteen and then another gang eighteen to twenty three
there was three different gangs
and were they based on areas as well did you have like a different gang for different streets sort of thing
oh yes we used to meet at top of the yard
er you see er no we were we were all together
sometimes all the lot of us would play there marbles was another favourite game
i mean i i've had as many as a thousand marbles in a bag
all for taking lawyers
er if you if you had you had to dig a little hole in the in the by the wall on the on the pavement like that to hold about sixty four marbles say and you'd start off and say give or give or take give or take as a lawyer i used to have four marbles and whoever was taken that was a lawyer of four marbles i don't know why
and whoever took this four UNK eight marbles had chucked them in this hole and if a even number come out it was mine if a odd number came out then he'd take the eight
then you'd have UNK or UNK a thirty UNK until you'd got sixty four marbles you know and chuck them in this hole and if odd or even come out
of course it was UNK
martin they used to call it pitch and UNK er till the policeman used to come round and used to what you on with
ah just sitting here
did was there a lot of UNK did er in the area
well we did in this particular in terrace
every weekend
some men and some lads
we'd play UNK and UNK ha'penny UNK
we've even played for UNK
now could you tell us about erm like you the general health of the family how was that taken care of
fortunate i can't remember too much er ordinary er illnesses like er we'd have a cold and you know er and that but no i can't remember chicken UNK and er
UNK
UNK fever and that sort of thing
there was a lot had it er i don't know how they used to go on really er i know some somebody in a movement called UNK er what were the other one
i can't remember
eh
i can't remember
there were some sort some sort of er some like an insurance now maybe only pay tuppence a tuppence
tuppence a week
yeah
er and that and that cou would get you get you to a doctor then
er but if a doctor's visit i think they used to pay five shilling if you sent for the doctor
and you'd got to pay five shillings
wasn't it five bob
yeah it was a lot of money in those days
mm
i can could apart from that this operation i never had any illnesses not when i was a kid you know not until later on
now you've just been describing to us mr about er your leisure activities etcetera and it was sort of confined to the etcetera
did you have much trouble with the police involvement with them etcetera
no er not really because the only time i wa i was in trouble with the police was i was riding a bike without a light
and this policeman i were coming down lane off over the UNK back bridge
and he eh said where do you live
i said twenty four terrace
and he took me home er he gave me a good talking to and tell me dad cos me i nearly i got a good hiding was going to get a good hiding from me dad until this policeman says don't worry he says er you won't hear anything about it
and i got a UNK
i had to go to court to pay five bob cos i were riding a bike without a light
i went to the hall and the old man paid out
er now if you broke a window this was the sort o how we used to get into trouble we should play maybe football or UNK or cricket or something and we'd break somebody's window
and we'd got to pay for it which was usually another five bob
er
were the lads you used to knock around with were any of them in serious trouble with the
yeah
police
yeah
could you tell us about them
two of them
well i'm not gonna mention their names but they're still alive one's still in and he's doing he's done very well for himself
three of them went into a shop in a UNK shop why i wasn't with them that day i don't know cos we was always together our four
but this day i wasn't there anyway and er they went into this shop in the er and they came out or one of them took a fruit cake
they're about i think the UNK price was one and three
the three of them was involved
well one got let off one got a pro put on probation for three years and the other one got sent away to an approved school
and that one that got sent away he learnt a certain job which he's done in ever since and he's done very well at it
were they picked on by the police the people in the cos that seems a pretty severe sentence
well no the owner the baker reported them to the police
but we knew the police and the police knew us
you know they di they knew us by name
i mean we were to come over bridge here and there was a police station on bridge at the time police you know opposite the t b i and the sergeant used to stand there and he used to wait for us coming home
we had we'd go to park be sent out of there by the keeper because we co we weren't supposed to be in he said
and the girls used to say these UNK these lads are here again and er well he sent us out and when we'd come back we'd pass this sergeant and at he'd talk to u where you been what you been up to
i'd say nothing we've just been up there and he'd smack us across the chops with the er gloves and say go on and don't let me see you here again
you know
but wasn't it somewhat severe to get you know
wasn't it what
wasn't it a bit severe to be put into er a UNK centre for just UNK a cake
one and UNK fruit er fruit cake yeah
was that quite normal at the time
er well it er it was normal because it was the only time i i've heard it happen in street anyway but there were there was kids being sent away all the time to UNK and er for doing wrong things
and was the area itself er with the adults concerned were the police often involved with them
no it wasn't so bad really
er
it was a bit rough it wasn't
it was rough but you know it w it was petty things that we was in trouble for not nothing sin i mean we would never think of UNK anybody or UNK things for the sake of UNK
er we we'd tie two doors together which and then knock on them both and then run like hell
er firework night now i we would get UNK put them get a dustbin lid and put the UNK under the dustbin lid and the dustbin lid used to go up because they were big UNK then
but apart from that i mean we w i never knew any of our lot to put one through a letter box or anything like that you know
we was all into UNK but it was never anything wrong you know what i mean
er i like bonfire night we'd maybe start collecting bonfire rubbish round about the end of august
we'd go to all the shops along our and there was some shops with bags hoping to get something else besides rubbish
and then stored it in somebody's coal house
and at that time nearly everybody had a bed with a UNK made of straw and on top of this UNK straw UNK they used to have what they call a tick flock tick
well every bonfire night it was the time for most people to get rid of the UNK and the UNK and er and bonfire night we used to come just right
well i know in one terrace alone in street used to have three big bonfires in this two hundred yards and i've known one terrace to have as many as twenty UNK you know UNK on the street ready for and the big lad the bigger lads used to get the UNK get somebody's prop and stoke the fire up and put the UNK on
and then you'd got the UNK and if you hadn't got UNK at home you certainly would have them after bonfire night
mr could you tell us was there a UNK near you
yes
now there was er he had two shops on street
he had one er just on street there and the other one was near street
and there was also another one a little bit further on
there were three on street between bridge and station
about that time everybody had UNK suit you know what UNK blue is don't you
well this UNK suit whether it was brown blue or black it was still UNK
cos it was UNK on monday as out it go on saturday if you were lucky
er everybody or nearly everybody used to go to the UNK
but nobody wanted other people to know about it be embarrassed
we went i went regular
and so did a good many people who i thought would never go
cos i used to see them there
you see they can't deny it
but i my mother used to send me and er with my father's suit and er she used to say er now you're going t to UNK take your dad's suit
i says aye
and i used to get a penny or tuppence sometimes to take it in
and then on a saturday she'd say go fetch your dad's suit
i said well i said i'm someone had seen me last week
cos it instead of it wasn't wrapped up you see it was wrapped up in a cloth
well if you've got a cloth er parcel with wrapped in cloth you know everybody knew where you were going and i didn't like people to know i was going to been to the UNK
so we started another thing then the if you paid fourpence you could have your suit wrapped up and it were new paper with string
and it looked as though you'd bought something rather than been to the UNK
i used to say well let me have a UNK and then i and fourpence was a lot of money then
so anyway i used to get this UNK and er walk down street
and UNK still everybody knew it didn't matter
was everybody embarrassed about going to the UNK or didn't some people
quite a lot
it was very useful for people because it was the only way they could get the bit of money on a monday
i mean they used to take things er the wedding ring the jewellery if they'd got any UNK sheets er suits shoes er didn't want to sell them didn't want to get rid of them they just wanted to borrow money on those and he used to charge you interest and ticket money when you took it in and then you'd got to pay interest when you took it out as well so it was they were on a good thing
yeah
and then people used to er maybe wedding rings or sovereign used to UNK that and then they used to either they couldn't afford to get it out to redeem it so er the UNK would sell it then after a time
they was on making a good living and still do i think
they're coming back again UNK aren't they
and
and was it the suit that was the thing you always used to UNK
ooh my dad's suit was definitely the thing every week
i don't know why he brought it out on the weekend for it
there's another story about me dad that most of used to borrow we had UNK in the streets there was quite a few UNK in the
and they used to charge maybe lend you half a crown not a UNK but your ordinary women used to lend you half a crown and maybe charge you sixpence for it or something like that you see
and my father s he er he used to go in the UNK tree and one of the landlords there he'd say er tom lend us a quid
and he used to lend me dad a pound and he always used to give him it back on a wednesday on his pension day
and then borrow it again on a friday or a saturday and this went on for so long er he'd eventually tom said by the way jack he said whose pound note whose pound is this
so he said why
he said i don't know whether it's mine or whether it's your bugger
he said i tell you what he said you keep it we we'll call it straight
so i don't know whose pound it was
did these people who used to lend money get a bit heavy if they weren't UNK
what did they used to do
if they didn't get paid well er there wasn't official UNK so they couldn't er they couldn't sue you i'd think
they weren't supposed to do it anyway it was illegal
no i er i don't know people didn't go out of their depth i don't think they it was half a crown or five bob and they used to pay maybe pay it back in bits and UNK
and then the woman that would lend them UNK say well you're not having any more so you'd got to try and find somebody else who'd lend you money
but
but you've never heard of people getting beat up
oh no
cos they hadn't paid or anything
no
can i give you out there
er for five thirty
that one that's waiting
thank you very much
what happened was that it was the son and i couldn't get he was given and he's never had it in his life
the wee man must have asked for it
no
he probably told you that just to explain things
but it was a wee thing
he wouldn't
but the computer would do it
it would get our own computer UNK
i don't know but UNK this afternoon

thanks very much
right
cheerio now
i said there's no need to lock it mike it's alright you know
i just come back er ladies and gentlemen to apologize for this morning's cock up i mean it was totally UNK of me
er i'll explain why it happened an and then perhaps you'll hopefully find that you can forgive me and er then i'll go on and say one or two of the things that i was gonna say this morning but er didn't
i made the mistake this morning of trying to squeeze in er before i came here to just cl try and clear another task
er that was silly er i didn't allow myself sufficient time to prepare for this opening and ob obviously to UNK myself
the result of that was that by the time i'd rushed across the road UNK up the UNK well found the place UNK up the stairs i was out of breath and er hadn't composed myself and i just res UNK a UNK that er
that left you about er twenty past nine
i'd unnecessarily put myself in a stressful situation
it's rather interesting that the only two management er training courses i did last year were er stress management and time management and i seem to UNK them both up
er anyway as i say er i realized when i'd started talking er that i was digging a bigger and bigger hole for myself so i er i UNK out of it and made an exit
and passed me the shovel
er i it was UNK to you and i apologize for that
both for not being prepared not giving the opening of this course the importance that it did deserve and obviously for the embarrassment that er you must have felt having to sit there while i made a total fool of myself
interesting as well that on the subject here to discuss quality and i didn't bother to put a quality presentation together
a again i am very sorry
if i'm g go over things that dennis covered or that have already been covered this morning i will be brief a and i just wanted to say these are some of my personal views on the quality initiatives
er i know hugh er a and many of the management team erm share most of them erm a i if not all of them
our quality systems are about defining what we as a group are gonna do for our clients our customers
er without the customers there's no point in us being here at all
and we're gonna define when we're gonna come up with the goods as well
what are we gonna do
when are we gonna do it by
a are the two things that the client's interested in
th the cost obviously i is a third point
but once we've UNK defined who's gonna do what within the quality systems that then we've got something to make a start from
and the quality systems will help us to monitor and identify where things are going wrong and once we know what is going wrong we've got an opportunity to put it right
and that then gives us this UNK of improvement which is bound to impact on everything that we do
the management team are fully committed to the group's quality initiative
we consider that investment in quality is as important as improving the working environment which we've obviously been er doing slowly over the last three years
and investing in UNK
and UNK equipment which again we we've b successfully been doing over the last two or three years
so i it sits side by side with the erm items that we'd decided are important for us to achieve our UNK
the good housekeeping exercise which we've just circulated the documents on which we'll be consulting on in two weeks time tt er it mainly is about changing the organization to allow us to delegate authority down to an appropriate level
and to ensure that we act as a group and not just a collection of separate offices
er this of course will then improve the quality of the service which our customers receive
you'll have been briefed i'm sure about the two day management get together that we're gonna have at scarborough next week
all the function heads most of the section engineers all the team quantity surveyors and a good number of er senior project engineer m s three type levels are gonna be there
i don't know how we're gonna get UNK fishing rod on the train i'm a little bit worried about it but erm
get bob on the
getting him off the UNK perhaps will be a bigger problem
er the reason for the get together is for us to look closely at the aspirations of the group within the immediate future and taking us forward three to five years
three to five years seems quite a long way forward in the current uncertain climate
but we've called the er the seminar UNK the future
and i think you can rest assured that the quality systems will be the foundations onto which we will build any changes which are identified as being necessary as part of next week's get together
without quality systems in place we won't be able to tender in the future for design work which a lot of our clients will be offering
it was only because we had the quality systems in place okay we didn't have UNK er at the time but the quality systems were in place that we were invited to tender for the UNK project for UNK station
so again everything comes back to quality and the c e d g being er essential a and really er a building block for our future survival
okay
would it be alright if i stayed for the rest of the afternoon
i think actually UNK that was very UNK cos that really sort of UNK what we said this morning so thank you very much for coming back
er
you might have to find your own chair actually
oh right
i can stand at the back
right erm wh what we propose doing now i is just to i've written up er your inverted commas answers o on the board
erm we'll just er look at th those have a good bit of a laugh and a bit of a UNK
erm the idea then is to swap your project quality plans around the groups and then for each the leader of each group to UNK those plans just briefly a few minutes er and present that to the erm t to the group
and hopefully that will stimulate some discussion
right
so tho those are the estimates of cost
er they range from sorry can you see that
they range from eight thousand two hundred and fifty pounds through to eighteen thousand one hundred and fifty
erm i shall pass no comment on those but i do know whose was the lowest bid
and we said it would be
erm
UNK
it's only because your boss is here isn't it bill
erm issue of drawings to the er the client er the client wished to know wished to know this
er three of you told him when he was going to get it
erm it's perhaps en UNK in that which is the total completion er for the fourth group
and you also told the client
er two of you told him when he was going to get the estimates
erm
er
again
can you just alter the third one to the thirty first of august ninety three
sorry
which one
that one
that one you had your pen on
that's three is it
sorry
beg your pardon
i was doing it under the covers you see
erm so er i mean it could be argued that those figures go in there
i'm a and they're not too bothered about that
erm group number one offered to advise the client when he UNK when they'd finished the survey
not too sure you would actually do that without erm i i've got no real comment on that i quite so simply
okay dennis
yeah
what i'd like is
not yet
because we're going to wait
till you've s till er
you're present
we're going to wait till er we've heard your UNK on each other 's until we make our minds up
we'd like groups one and two to swap for comment please and gr and groups three and four to swap for comment
now could you get together and spend five or six minutes as a group having a look at the other group's presentation and could you please make a note
of the following
the good points the points you disagree with completely but most importantly of all would you have been able to have worked from that particular quality plan as presented to you
in other words was the quality plan sufficiently well completed for you to be able to utilize it
in UNK
so if you could just spend five or six minutes doing that and could we come back at twenty five
past
two please
okay
for me young lady
from there
from the end
you're as bad as
yeah
we're running
testing
early on
right
have w have we got one then
what's that
right
right
do you wanna
is it group UNK erm plan
no it's not group four cos they'll all escape
group four
yeah
er so yeah
let's can you see that roger
so they've got the project number UNK no problem there
er we i can't remember if we
be an r o r o w one
yeah
r o UNK a bit odd
that one's misleading
mhm
for a kick off
do you want to make a note of that
mm
and extension varies by designs
erm
not r o w
UNK erm he's made himself er he has made himself coordinator
and section engineer
and section engineer
i didn't sign it as coordinator
mm
project engineer is brian
right
no problem there really
that one
have they got all the sections filled in
didn't notice
survey
it would be sent back if it wasn't filled in wouldn't it
survey is all we said wasn't it
mm
yeah
we haven't got some of our headings
no
er project manager
yeah the same trouble as er
we just put today's date on which is fair
yeah
enough isn't it
yeah
UNK i didn't notice
did you
they've made that up i think
mhm
mm
o eight nine eight isn't it
UNK numbers one o two double o
mhm
survey of design
er th they should have done the estimate
thirty percent
got thirty estimates there
now then
good man
that's against what sorry
er
project remit
project remit
well they've written it in but they haven't ticked it
they haven't got any specification laid out
alright
so
mm
affect that
shouldn't they tick this box
n erm
oh i see what you mean
yeah
fill ours out
specification
well we did because we said we'd have to specify what to
they'll produce design drawings and thirty percent estimates er one and a half miles of train line
one down one mile on the up double junction below twenty mile an hour speed limit
agreed that
up
UNK and land purchase negotiations
yeah
w we did exactly er we just sort of noted it on there
mm
and there
er now then
they haven't got er meeting anything about wh er
a weekly report
no UNK no mention of a report
no
reporting
yeah
at a at any intervals
no
ah
right
let's have a little look here
all they've done here is done liaison with the s and t
i would have thought that was really irrelevant
since we know what the speed is
mm
mm
yeah
er that is valid
but erm no reference to UNK services
mm
which will want to know
n no er reference to access and land ownership which we need to know for the
survey
w we w we would need to know and be involved in UNK services
our works bridges responsibility statement not completed
yeah
that's
works bridges responsibility statement not completed
yeah
ownership we would want to er erm mm
no UNK dates quoted
no UNK
and er project meetings not allowed for
no allowance project meetings
mhm
and theirs was nearly twice the price of ours
they just added their
er i think they were a bit more my gut feeling on this what it would cost somewhere around about twenty five grand
mm
er to honest
that er it in actual fact and i'm gonna hold you lads to all this
erm
yeah
erm
no cross sections
no cross sections
right
erm
this is on the project quality plan now is it
only one UNK section drawing it would b it would be a big one
yeah
but we need
yeah
that'll be we sort of weighed up from the length of what we had to show
mm
and we UNK er alright
they've shown their certificate of er compliance
won't argue about that we didn't
okay
not much really
there's a lot of technical work supervision in there
my god
mm
maybe they're allowing
thousand six hundred hours
it seems that seems a lot
do you agree
yeah
hell of a lot
yeah
query
is that just for supervision
not the actual technical work itself
that's just supervision or does that mean the technical work and supervision
well i think we should query this
this is on appendix d two one
er technical supervision query two thousand six hundred hours
which is nearly a year
mm
two thousand six hundred two thousand six hundred hours
well it's over a year a on er working days
that's at ten hours a day
how many hours did we put down for working on
two thousand six hundred at twenty pound an hour
how long did we say for the survey
a week each
that's
yeah
oh no two weeks
wasn't it
yeah
it's cos it's er
the thing is should have been nearly seventy five hundred
we've got five hundred down for
that's right
one fifty and two sixty two seven five o
right surely
but if that's hours
seems a seems a lot
that must be dopacs units
well
ah
possibly
but a again erm
because
an hour far too much
if you were if you add two thousand seven hundred and fifty hours at twenty pound an hour you'd be well over eighteen thousand
yeah
so th are the
are these dopacs units then
yeah
i think they must be
mm
oh right
mm
yeah
that means the survey comes out roughly at what we estimated
yeah
right
yeah
yeah
er okay then
right
that's that explained
well they they've put the thirty estimates er thirty percent estimates in there
that we just showed them over here apart from that th their UNK the same
yeah
these are dopacs units
mm
mm
can you see where the UNK is c in cost is
ah
right
they've got UNK
UNK in
that's for a start
and photographs
and photographs
yeah
but they're not supposed to include it
er if they'd kept it separate
don't liaison between
yeah
it's
yeah
so if you take fifteen hundred off then that erm
it was eighteen thousand i think it was more or less
plus sixteen
plus photo plus photographs and they've seventeen fifty really
we have
so er
we've sort of er beaten it down at bit
points
well there is there is a particular section for the photographs
i think we've UNK that one out actually
oh have you
er which is that
yeah
they're on
they have lot of technical work supervision
two seven fifty divided by sixty three
what's that
it's about three weeks isn't it
that's a hell of a lot more than we put in didn't we
yeah
didn't we put er ten percent
yeah
of the job in didn't we
yeah
we put a couple of days in i think in total
yeah
that's where it's UNK up norman
it's er i erm tho those are dopacs units so if we e if we er divide by
well it's two hundred and something
and a
now what was it
it was three hundred and fif three and sixty five dopacs units
about a week isn't it
seventy five seventy threes
three six five isn't it
yeah
three six five a week so
erm
erm
wh what's that
six weeks roughly
eight weeks
eight weeks near enough isn't it
yeah
eight weeks
no
that's totally over the top isn't it really
mm
but that er technical supervision seems very high
which UNK that on
that's on er
project plan d five eight
d five eight
it's UNK er
technical work supervision
and he's got eight weeks
mm
they've got too many
i've put all the er the grades in the wrong way round
they haven't done any or work operation checks
i started with highest worked on to the lowest
ah
is that on
is that on another sheet
they haven't allowed for any
fees are
detailed design
that's the one
th they've got that
right
there
it's a pity we've not got a copy of our own
mm
so what have we got adam
right
these are the points that we disagree on
erm on the main header document not r o double o
form d one the project remit no thirty percent estimates
no mention of any reporting
works and bridges responsibility statement not completed
as well for the
also no project meeting
and the project quality plan there's no cross section drawings
are you nearly ready
yes
okay
don't what the good points were we haven't said any yet
and on extra works supervision
no
we haven't
single good point about it
erm well basically
yeah
yeah
it's realistic
the writing was good
yeah
oh did we have a look at that
good point
it was okay
tape stops and starts
okay
might i remind you please that
when you're speaking into the group could you
try and speak up a little bit because we've still got the tapes going
and er this young lady UNK terribly interested in the way in which we're using our language today so er i hope that doesn't UNK you
right
group three
could we please have your comments
er group three
we're commenting on er group UNK erm er quality plan
erm we don't see a great deal of difference that they've had the same problem as we've had in that we ran out of time before we could put the er finished act together properly
er so we've started off with a number of relatively UNK erm points
for instance the title we thought r o w was UNK station r o w was misleading cos b r o w stands for renewal of way
probably doesn't describe the project er correctly
erm on the second sheet form d one the er erm thirty percent estimate box hadn't been ticked
er there was a fairly comprehensive er specification
