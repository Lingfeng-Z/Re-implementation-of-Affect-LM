erm in some ways more erm comprehensive than one that we provided
i but missing out items that er that we'd shown
erm also there was no er reference to er the er frequency of reports at the bottom of the er bottom of the sheet
er which er i suspect was due to the th the insufficient time to carry out the exercise
on the second sheet er of d one the responsibility statement er there were just a couple of boxes er ticked
erm UNK with the operations manager route speed potential since we know the route speed is twenty miles an hour er i felt that probably wasn't really a vital item
on the other hand i would have ticked s erm location of services er and public and utility because th these are things that we need to know at the design stage
likewise obviously for land and access because we will need to know that for the survey work involved
erm most of the other items o on the works and bridges would have been the responsibility of the project manager to er them
but those two in particular we felt that er we would do that as part of our er a an essential part of what we were trying to design
er there's no UNK dates er quoted but these of course have been given
so they have been considered
erm number of projects meetings er wasn't er wasn't completed and the boxes at the bottom er but er planning permission was erm ticked as a constraint er i wondered what the basis was behind that for ticking it
right
so that was the
er the access t plan
right
okay
erm on the er process check list erm a difference from ourselves which does the affect the price of group three which we UNK left out they have quoted er a price for a UNK investigation
er we left that out because of UNK assurance that it was just our costs but these are this is certainly something that we would have to er add to our cost
and er also incidentally a cost for the p q s because the p q s would do estimates for the UNK th that are involved which is outside our normal line of duty
er so that's an item included that we didn't have on ours
i wouldn't er b just at a brief UNK glance i didn't er agree with the er drawing schedule
it's quite different from ours
we saw ourselves as having to do erm a considerable number of cross sections for calculating or enabling the p q s to calculate UNK quantities
we had no assurance of the ground between road and UNK as flat
so a w we saw cross sections as being the big item here whereas er UNK team er didn't er didn't see it as such
erm on the er project plan d five p erm without having our own to compare with a bit difficult to do again o the e the fifteen hundred for UNK investigations included which we haven't included
there's also a very valid item for photos which we hadn't included
two hundred and fifty pounds er which certainly would be er done
the o only thing that we felt w we could take issue on was on the project resource sheet erm technical work supervision
there was erm a total of two thousand six hundred units allocated to brian which we thought
was er a bit steep
three and a half hours of work
mm
three and half of his time
erm but if you translate that into er into days it's quite a substantial amount and er erm again in our plan we'd thought in terms of a complete UNK design er where the input would be probably more on the checking side than actual on the actually on the supervision
cos you can see from our price that anticipating very a rapid er a very rapid completion
so really there's only that item w we felt that particular one was a bit er a bit steep and er the rest was er a difference in emphasis i would suspect coupled with shortage of time
was it was it a UNK plan as it stood
er yes
good
yeah
a subject to er th the i think my main objection to it would be that the lack of reference to cross sections which on you without knowledge of the ground could or could not be viable
well you got quite a lot out of being able to evaluate
as a project engineer or team member or one of the troops doing the job if you were presented with that you could have done what you'd been asked to do
as far as we can judge in five minutes yes
yes
that's
UNK group two would you like to tell us about
there's a
shortage of actual evaluating
erm the quality project plan needs filling in erm certainly with i c couldn't with that
erm and again the second sheet form d one erm the fine details erm and the er the remit er gave a reasonably adequate to work to
er the c e g responsibility statement form d one erm er erm UNK that by writing er a rider on that they assumed concept will be agreed for surveying er feasibility
er and that the with er nothing more than to get on and do it
i think some of the erm er they've crossed all the p way ones out and er appear not to have crossed any of the works bridges b e s out
er they tried to write a rider to bypass it completely but i don't know whether that is sound
i think maybe they should have perhaps covered
certain
erm the process check list erm again they've identified the people on each erm and within that they've actually nominated people to look at the land ownership which is the on the ignored with their rider on the previous sheet
er but again nominate people erm to do the different works
erm they haven't UNK the number of drawings to be done
erm again it's a question of time i'm sure they would have been probably reasonably er adequate
er the project resources sheet erm again th the erm it's identify erm the quantities do seem about right
erm there's they haven't added up one of the boxes and i believe that in terms of erm its actual cost
er and that query made on how they are going to actually evaluate the plan
erm once they've gone off this sheet and it's been transferred UNK to the project plan and the price of the plan
er but the plan itself the dopacs units haven't been actually completed and therefore they could be running at a loss
erm the actual form d three five erm bar chart was filled in with er UNK dates and UNK people
and again some of them have different values of units
er within the erm procedural responsibility statement th there's no UNK mentioned er form d three five
so what you're saying
but
really
o overall er the plan looks reasonably sound except for the which er reflect in the price
i could work to it
but what we also said tha that's quite encouraging john is that there is an ability to UNK the costing that you've achieved with
the information previously entered onto these other forms
in which case er given a little bit more time to fill the thing in
yeah
erm there i it's not just a matter of UNK a figure out of thin air but you can see the justification for the full fee bid and you can er UNK the accuracy of the fee bid as well
yes
good
right
group er one please
what comments have you got
erm group one commenting on group two
sheet one was er as we wha what was expected
no problems with that
we were a little unsure ourselves whether were actually doing scheme work or design
er we always think we do a little scheme work within design
but whatever er it's difficult to on that
erm form d one the pink one er there was no reporting UNK weekly intervals er or whether they were going to report on completion
erm and that is or could be the only approach to the client once the job starts so we thought it was fairly important
erm works bridges b e s subjects as john rightly said we missed out erm one or two of these and tended to ignore the things that were under works bridges and b e s
er and as john said one or two of them were probably relevant and we didn't make er notes on those
erm and probably those points are erm of interest and some of them er will have to be taken into account
er there was no constraints erm within the project or within the responsibility statement on saying that somebody else should be responsible for certain things that we felt were outside our remit
erm obviously
the quality plan erm a lot of UNK but no names apart from the detailed design drawings and i we thought that the quality plan the idea was to pin somebody down to being responsible for each actual item erm
yes
what really we thought was the idea of this to pin them down into er in who was doing it and when
er and we thought that there should have been initials against every item that was ticked
erm t just to er well there was a l a certain lack of time on this thing i mean dennis had to come round and tell us to start our tick list else we weren't gonna
er and if he'd of walked up to john two minutes later he probably wouldn't have made it because we had a right erm but we did feel there had to be some initials
even if we made somebody's up
erm
getting down to the project re resource sheets er jack w we felt that even though our bid was fairly low even a adjusted for a full calculation
now we did feel that erm the difference between our bid an and erm the team two bid was mainly down to erm correspondence and project en administration
that in fact we were looking at almost two months' work erm for project engineering when in fact that scheme would have been UNK down into project engineering
erm then correspondence two hours for two people
erm client reports again technical work supervision there was a lot of time a and we just felt that erm
for a full year
that's right
the longer it
that's but actually if they look at the dopacs times for the people doing the work the surveyors and the UNK they can do their work in two months which is spread out over a year
now spreading it over a year means that the project administration jumps dramatically and there's about four five thousand UNK worth in there
er and we felt that was a bit excessive
erm
no fighting gentlemen
well
no but forty hours is about er fifteen
don't
don't worry too much about
okay
whatever we just
we just felt that
we were probably very mean on our project administration
that we didn't want to put too many people on the back of the people actually doing the work
and we felt that team two have gone the other way tha that the work spread out and actually when you looked at the at the project plan at the back erm that in fact a surveyor was out for six hundred and eighty three dopacs units which is about ten days and that had spread all through may june and july
erm there was no start date for him and no finish date for him really er
considered what the resource
yeah
that's right
this takes no account of priorities other works within the section whether in fact this doesn't need doing until UNK early ninety four
er and so what john's done he's suggested that in fact if it comes for march ninety four that he spread the work out till nineteen ninety four which may be the sensible attitude cos people can make those decisions of the schemes to involved
if you do the work early somebody changes their mind as soon as you've finished
but er it would have to be a client discussion about when he actually wanted the contract completing
but spreading the work out though actually extended the administration costs and not giving start and finish times that were fairly tight so the people doing the work allowed them to make their own judgments on when it was going to be done
and that things would tend to drag on to the last minute and then they would start and then it would it go forward
and the work would then be completed to approximately the same timescale that we that we UNK on the
er we thought we thought that the scheme was the sheet was filled in properly er a apart possibly from the er initials as we suggested putting people down on the quality plan which was obviously down to UNK
er we thought we could work to it and we thought we had a different rule for UNK er and we didn't check the calculations
well it seems to me that there was obviously enough information in that plan for you to be able to understand very clearly what was wanted and what was going to be done
and i think that's really quite important
and th that's quite encouraging
mm
that the group you were assessing managed to do that
we've got one last group
have you any comments on that david
erm dennis
before we go on to group four
erm no
right
group four have you got all your people still here
or have they
yeah
escaped
yeah
no actually i working out punch line for the joke
er cos that's why we're so expensive when you lose a few engineers in transit
erm
literally in transit
in transit
yeah
er commenting on group UNK
erm plan
really i think at the end of the day it's very similar to ours although the price difference is a bit different
erm the remit er the client details and the UNK pretty detailed i think it spells out what should be done
i think the only comment i would have on there is we spelt out specifically what we thought the project manager should be responsible for in the actual remit stages itself
although UNK actually ticked that the project manager was gonna be responsible for certain things i think it's one of these things that need to be brought out
fairly importantly that we're gonna do this but you've gotta do this
i think i see one problem with we've put site investigation and UNK the price i think whereas if we'd said that we require site investigation work to be undertaken by the project manager we've really got to decide the level of site investigations so that in the first instance we've gotta approach the soil mechanics and determine from them what we need from them
so the really the UNK gotta get that price
it's a matter of then where you put that price either in our fee or invoice directly to the to the client
but again obviously that doesn't apply but that's what has gotta be done
again we got into time constraints there was one or two things obviously that weren't filled in but i think that's only been UNK i think at the time
obviously has ticked off erm quite a lot of work that the project manager is gonna be responsible for on here really
here on the responsibility reference statement
er it might very well be that the project manager may think well my god am i gonna do more work than the engineers that are working with you
so that the split may well have been that er he was gonna to do a lot more work than perhaps the er civil engineering design group
so perhaps a lot of the times but i would have maybe suggested that we could have done and presented that as part of the package
so again perhaps tied in our prices it might be that we've assumed that we'd do more perhaps than the other groups
so overall
number of meetings although we hadn't ticked the box we had UNK up exact same number as ten sets of meetings erm six liaison and four technical
erm UNK yeah pretty similar i think really
they were all UNK
as a sort of bridge person i was quite interested to find out how different the works the permanent way office does the structural things and er obviously all the clients have UNK that this resources would be thrown perhaps
maybe three lads to the drawings and maybe two lads to do the calculations whereas it would be slightly in the bridge office or the works office because of the present resource availability it tends to be that you only have a smaller number of people doing those tasks
but again obviously if the resources are there why not use them
yeah i think obviously norman has put down that he's gonna produce quite a lot of cross section i think that's a valid point i think we had assumed perhaps UNK that the ground was gonna be relatively level
but er they might have been assumptions that we shouldn't have made
erm i think looking through the actual resource sheet itself i think we had more project administration time down and certainly that we had more technical work supervision and you put more of an emphasis on of actually looking after the lads
there is only well there are sixteen hours that er that UNK put down for the total technical work supervision on the job i would have thought that perhaps that might be quite tight er you know bearing in mind that it's maybe a job that requires a
to the remit
erm i i'd initially put a great big cross through all of that
i know absolutely nothing about p way but then as norman was speaking i realized that perhaps i could put a few UNK in
and it might be that what we've got to do is t is to change that to perhaps include p way
i think we need a bit more discussion on this
erm the key dates have to be here as well as on the d five cos this forms part of the appointment contract to the client
we're saying to him we will supply this service on a by a particular date
he wishes to know that and we will record our progress against it
erm clearly state any UNK erm er the moving UNK the footpath for example
clearly state that we're assuming that you are going to divide er divert the footpath we're not going to
i think what you have to remember is that these three sheets er are in fact well w what we have to remember is that the business manager is an internal client and that these three sheets are something to him or to her to type to form the appointment contract so therefore let's get it right
erm and you were saying earlier mike that this in effect is an internal contract and you have a nice little story about some initials behind someone's desk which you'd
mm
perhaps like to repeat
is it UNK in front of a microphone
well sorry
later
yeah
effectively what we've got here is the mechanism whereby the client requirements are sent to the people who are actually going to do the job on the drawing board
it's an internal type of contract
if there are any problems then we should be able to say to ourselves well let's go and have look at the project quality plan what's that tell us
and if we've got the project quality plan right there shouldn't be any problems or queries and it did remind me of this australian er project manager who i've mentioned to one or two other people over lunch who used to sit in a great a great office running UNK project and when people came in to complain to him he used to refer them to the plaque on the wall which said r t f c
read the fucking contract
effectively what we've got here is a similar internal message
and so it's very important to get this completed really well tt because then there shouldn't be too many queries later on
so that will do dennis
erm just a couple of points here th this form is one of positive identification that there is no need to do anything with the boxes that you're not going to touch
erm in other words someone is responsible for drawings therefore you would you'd put the initials in there
erm we're not gonna get involved with mine workings for example nothing appears there
positive identification
erm i think for some reasons UNK we so a UNK in there bridge assessment records i applies to p way
erm
erm
it may do
it may do
i mean steps and things like that
it might do
ah sorry
well i stand corrected
project
i told you i know nothing about er p way
erm category of checking one of those b the idea would be to ring either the double nought or the nought
erm self checking as we mentioned before self checking i is UNK
er if you've got a competent p person that you trust preparing the estimate they can check it themselves
it doesn't have to be checked by someone else it doesn't have to be an independent check unless the regulations demand it
which i don't think in UNK they do
er certainly the works office there's no reason why you shouldn't draw do a drawing and check the drawing yourselves
it's quite UNK provided you trust the person and that person the necessary skills
weekly reports and things we've mentioned before
erm the purpose of the two columns and i think we've missed this out is that we should be identifying how many w whether we're using er going to produce drawings by hand or by UNK
erm and i could thi think of no other er quality measures necessary to meet the er quality objectives apart from bringing your sandwiches
i suggest you might bring a sandwich along paul
the point i want to get across here is that this a p way form it is your form not my form not the q a form it's the p way form for you to use and to change to the way that you want it to change
erm i don't and similarly with that form forget the details that again is a p way form for you it's your form you change it
i'm not interested
this one again that is a p way form erm the only person who's interested in that is trevor and his organization so if you want that changing agree it with trevor
and that really is all i need to say unless you've got any questions
i think er granville can field er any questions when he does his spot after coffee then dennis
i thought he might go he might do it now and we go for coffee
oh
oh dear
okay let's have a break er if you can come back reasonably quickly er we can make up a few seconds
do it quietly
right
you've
in case anybody doesn't know me i think i've had dealings with most people here but my name's granville
and i'm a project engineer within the works design group
hopefully this morning you've now been introduced to the concept of quality planning as it's intended within the civil engineering design group
i trust the exercise you've just a carried out has at least given you an insight into the format and use of this document
but what are the advantages
as a project engineer i've been using a similar document for about the last six months
its format has changed over that time quite a bit because like any quality system it's subject to constant review
and as mike referred to this morning there are ways and means if there's items in here that need UNK and improving there are ways and means that you can do it
but throughout all that time the principles contained within the document have always cha remained the same
if we go back a few years i don't know how many people remember before we had dopacs i remember when projects used to come into the group from on high they used to filter through the organization until they landed on somebody's desk who was actually supposed to carry out the work
at best he maybe had a letter from the client that letter had gained UNK notes as it UNK its way through the hierarchy some helpful some UNK should i should i say and some UNK
you may have then had a verbal exchange with your next in line but bar that you were expected to get on with the work
and then we had that introduction of dopacs and all that changed
and i ask the question or did it
true projects can now come into the organization at any level
true we have written UNK
but by their very nature they are only a few lines on a piece of paper at the moment
the final UNK has still got to get on with the work based on this small amount of information only now with dopacs he has a time limit
and that time limit or dopacs units in the past has always been a wee bit UNK
it's been based on jobs we've done for clients in the past based on UNK past experience
we've never in the past looked in detail at the total work content to work out these time units after all in the past we've known what the client wants we've been giving him it for years
but now as you're probably all aware this has changed
the railway is now business and client orientated the work content that we go into is decided by their requirements and not what we would like to give them
you've now all seen a project quality plan but i'd just like to go through a few of the headings just to advise you where i think the benefits lie
we start off with the front cover sheet
this UNK the stage of the work feasibility scheme design
which immediately identifies the scope of the work required
it also sets down the project team UNK all the functions involved within that scheme thus ensuring that early contact is made between all individuals
the lead project engineer is named who is then responsible for the day to day running of the project
but the project coordinator UNK an overview at review meetings
inside the front cover are the project details which is a form d one we've all seen and used before
it sets out the agreed remit including any constraints
this remit is agreed with the client by the project coordinator who can be anyone within the organization but would normally be an experienced engineer
the project quality plan is then compiled between the project coordinator and the lead project engineer based on this agreed remit
also included under this heading are all the client details which enable an appointment contract to be prepared and UNK
now come some of the sections which you may not be so familiar with
we have the responsibility statement
this identifies exactly those areas of the project that the c e d g will be responsible for within the terms of the appointment contract
once agreed with the client it ensures that all relevant responsibilities are covered by either the c e d g the project manager or the client
a copy of this statement is UNK to the client and therefore no ambiguity exists
in the works one the main bulk of the project quality plan is the process check list
i note in the p way it's only a page but the principles are still the same
this has proved the most useful as far i've been concerned and the works i've done in the works office
cos it comprises a UNK the major requirements necessary to complete and the project and it helps to identify the processes involved and the stage to which are to be taken for the s for the successful completion of the project
thus ensuring all items of work are taken into account and none are UNK or forgotten
it indicates the persons who are to carry out those aspects of the work thereby defining person responsibilities
it also identifies the management procedures that should be followed to correctly complete the project in line with office requirements
the final item of the process UNK includes the necessary reports required to keep our clients informed of the progress both physical and financial of the scheme we're undertaking
so therefore right from the outset the project en the lead project engineer knows which ro reports are required how many and when they are to be provided
next we have the project resource sheet
this has been in use in the works office for some time it was it used to be called an UNK
this UNK the main processes and resources required to carry out that this particular item of work
having defined the processes in detail under the UNK it now becomes much easier to allocate the necessary resources time units dopacs units or whatever you like to call them to successfully complete the project
the project resource sheet enables these units to be identified for each individual's activity within the project thus ensuring a realistic fee bid
the final page is the project plan the d five of which i'm sure we're all familiar
the project resource sheet is so designed that once you've allocated the resources it is now relatively easy to transfer those res resources over to the project plan
all that is contained within the project quality plan enables the project plan to be completed correctly and accurately
we all know it's extremely important that project plan is as accurate as possible
because once UNK it represents the estimated fee for the group's involvement in a project either in the form of an appointment contract for the client to sign
or as a fee bid
it defines the project UNK and priority to enable individual UNK within the group to be planned through dopacs and it also important n needed by dates the UNK within the project which again through dopacs enables checks on the physical and financial progress to be carried out at any time
to summarize
i believe that project quality plans are essential within our group to ensure we provide our clients with a cost effective quality service
it also allows a consistency of standards and policy from all the functions within the group to our clients
by the use of project quality plans we're ensuring that the following important criteria are fully considered and answered
the first criteria is what
a clear and precise remit is obtained and UNK
when
needed by dates both within and on completion of projects are again clearly identified
how
the depth and scope of work content is defined allowing resource requirements to be accurately predicted
who
individual responsibilities at all levels are defined within this plan
and most important of all how much
ensures a realistic fee bid based on all of the above
and if we can get all of those five right it helps all of us within the group to hopefully get it right first time
and if we get it right first time we'll have a satisfied client who will hopefully return to us for more work
and that is the situation we're in that's the name of the game is to satisfy our clients and that is all project quality planning
er i know mike now goes off at slightly different subjects so i would suggest if there are any questions not only on what i've just said but really what you've done this morning the exercise either myself dennis or mike or trevor could answer any questions
UNK silence
silence
straight between the eyes
i think the problem with a clear remit i can't really come to terms with that precisely competitive
how do you know your competitors clear remit
or do we tend to build things in because we've already done that type of job and we know the job and things in UNK where
is to discuss wi with the client what it is that he
what he said what
he'll just say well yes
i would hope that in a competitive sense
recognize the implications
i would hope that in a competitive situation i it is happening now un under a non competitive situation er the clients are giving us written UNK erm and i think we'll be going further down the path
of the client to lead you on to perhaps you could introduce more elements into your actual
remit diverted an and
i accept
yes
th the remit though that we're actually putting down on the appointment contract is actually the result of the negotiations between the project coordinator and the client
i in the past th granville mentioned these letters that used to work their way down from on high which might have just been a bit of a UNK in somebody's eye with no money at all to spend on physical work but even so it was given the same status within the r c UNK organization of five or ten years ago a as an investment item was it was almost authorized
a and we tended to not bother going back to the client but giving what we thought he needed that was the culture of the regional civil engineer
mm
if brian didn't think we needed it then it didn't even get a UNK let alone er resources allocated to it
nowadays it's different when a client comes to us and says i need something here
if he doesn't know what he needs that's great because we can help him a and he's not gonna go somewhere else where he isn't going to get that help
but at the end of the discussions between the project coordinator and the client when you have actually helped him and led along you could have this or you could have that or perhaps we could just take it to this stage cost some options out and give you a recommendation
whichever you go write down your interpretation of what you think you have agreed with the client and sign it and send it to him
if he signs it that indicates that he has accepted what you've jointly agreed and then you've got something a UNK something to go back and measure yourselves against and to justify what you've done against erm the fees that you're UNK the client for if the client at s at some stage decides perhaps that's not really what he wanted after all
er in a competitive situation the UNK tender w was a an example of that we actually had a contract document which is about as thick and complicated as one of the contract documents that we would put out for civil engineering physical work to er a contractor
and we actually had to comply with certain clauses a and provide method statements and
it's got a hundred and fifty sheets in it
so it was written
as a document
so if we're going into to this
and what did the competitor have
if we go into
this fixed fee competitive scenario then we will insist that we are actually comparing apples with apples and not apples with UNK whe when the client looks at our fee and he looks at an external UNK or another railway internal UNK fee
yeah
i think that's the way we see it going and that's the way we hope it's going
yes
but just at the moment in p way we feel that it isn't possibly going that way
no
and yet a and with
and it
one or two competitive UNK that have
that's all we're worried about
a
are writing the remit and then the UNK aren't going out to the other competitors
well if that's the case bob it's really the fault lies with our client not with us
our client should be presenting us with a sheaf of paper with pink UNK round it saying we would like a tender on that fixed fee by two weeks on tuesday or whatever
a and by the way you are in competition with a number of other organizations both internal and external
they should be doing that work if they're asking us to design a remit price it and then they're using that remit to get prices from other people er i would suggest that we perhaps ought to have words with our clients on that basis a and say we're quite happy to tender in competition but erm i you ought to give it a little bit of thought before you actually put the thing
erm i think it might be helpful if i make a comment on this business of er UNK from the other side of the fence actually bob
when i worked er for in the mid eighties we had been through a period where we'd always taken the cheapest tender
er for north sea platform design and construction activities
we very quickly realized that the cheapest tender wasn't always the cheapest in the medium or long term t to but we weren't very quick to realize how to put that right
because we had a tender board operation which said you take the cheapest tender
eventually through reasonably correct bid evaluation we began to learn how to cost out inferior bids when we had a very low bid in we could see that certain things had been UNK certain things might even have been missed out completely and we then began to cost the effect of that on the organization
but it did take some time
now i suspect that your industry shall i put that in inverted commas bob
has got to go through this learning curve to some degree
but i do see the project quality plan being extremely valuable because you will be feeding back the front part of the quality plan to the client and explaining the extras that you're going to do or the constraints within which you're working
now you cannot force the client to take that into account and read and understand it but i do believe that it will be possible for you in writing to the client to explain the advantages and the extras which you are incorporating within your er proposed scheme which you feel are absolutely fundamental to the correct working of the project
in other words they're not they're not extras er in the absolute sense they are necessary for that particular scheme but they may be things which less erm experienced consultants might UNK
and so there's a tremendous onus upon your good UNK to highlight the experience if you like and expertise you have of spotting problems and explaining how you will get around then within the given fee bid
i think that's the most sort of optimistic
comment i can make bob but it is a potentially
UNK issue
i think i think yes
i think i think all we're worried about is the transition period between
yeah
the in house friendly at atmosphere we've had up to now er non competitive across to what we're gonna see in the future in the future which is competitive with a professional client giving a professional remit to a number of UNK which will be us
but in the meantime there is a very loose remit situation
and that's all we're worried about this transition period that we might lose clients within that
put it like this bob i don't think the project quality plan is going to UNK you
oh no
if anything i would believe very strongly that a more systematic approach to this a UNK for checking specific items off will in fact help you
yes
through this transition period but there isn't a UNK answer to your immediate problem
yes
th the more the better remit we write if you like in reply in our contract and the more erm
explanation
explanation and conditions we put on it to say what we are and aren't going to do the better
erm it's just this transition period
th there is one point on the same vein as that bob th the second sheet on the d one where there's a suggestion that we tick off additional bits that we're gonna put into our contract we are going to arrange possessions we we're gonna do this that and the other
we've gotta be careful that in er using that sheet we don't do it in such a way as to bully and turn off the customer by saying by the way you'd better make sure you've done this and this cos i'm not doing it
you know i it is a very fine line between er how we talk to our customers which is why i can't stress enough the need for the project UNK to talk face to face with the customer first of all and perhaps gently lead him down some of the items in this list that the project coordinator thinks the client might not have remembered
er a and then say well we can take that on board for you if you like but it might be more efficient for you to do the possessions because the civil engineer leeds actually is part of your organization a and it might be more appropriate for you to get those possessions in for you to decide whether or not you want one big bang o of a week's possession or you want to do it i in four hour no trains periods for the next three years
that type of putting back into a business context is something which er we need to help the business come to terms with while they are growing in this new scheme of UNK work in a more formal and structured way
i would actually like to emphasize that the qu quality plan is originally intended to help the people who are going to have to do the job at the coal face
however i believe that there are advantages in improved communications with the client
if you er use the front part of the plan correctly and complete it well
okay
any more questions
granville you got off very lightly there
okay
right
let's er let's move onto the downhill part of the er proceedings today
mm
you heard dennis say a number of times today that
a project quality plan format has been designed for the permanent way group and that it's your format and you change it
granville UNK just a few minutes ago anything to do with the quality system is not a moses job
it's not tablets of stone which have been brought down from mount UNK forever to remain UNK
it's a living system it's designed to help you if it's not supporting and helping you then it must be changed
i now want to talk about two or three of the mechanisms and techniques we hope to be able to use in implementing changes when things aren't necessarily to your liking
i will add a UNK comment however and say that you won't necessarily be able to change absolutely everything at any time of the day or night because there are some base requirements we have to address and we have to meet
those base requirements are UNK within i s o nine thousand and one and if that says thou UNK do x and y and z then we have to do x and y and z
so there may be occasions when you feel that it would be nice to make er a change to er a system or procedure and in actual fact it becomes really not possible because we would then be going against the UNK and requirements in i s o nine thousand and one
having said those very harsh words however there aren't very many hard and fast requirements in i s o nine thousand and one
it's called a quality system standard but in actual fact it's a code of practice
its language is that of a code of practice
it says for example you need UNK work instructions except where it's not necessary
so it's your choice as to how much or how little you write down
but what it's actually doing is UNK management to think
shall we have a UNK work instruction for this activity or not
but nevertheless it does contain one or two quite hard requirements which we have to meet if we're going to obtain and retain the certificate
so whilst you might think it's a nice idea to make a change to some procedure or work instruction or whatever you want to call it there may be the odd occasion on which it's not actually possible to bring in a change because we're faced with still er meeting the requirements in the base er i s o nine thousand document
now how can we go about er introducing any changes to the system
well we have some quality system procedures which were referred to earlier this morning and they are called UNK control UNK action and internal audit
now what are these erm strange words all about
i think that's perhaps something i ought to explain first and foremost
UNK control
the i s o nine thousand document uses the term UNK product but the word product er is a very broad word it's actually defined in i s o nine thousand as meaning product or service and it can be anybody's product or service
it can be a product or service you've bought in not necessarily a product or service that you are actually producing or generating yourselves
so what is this business
UNK product control
good evening
hello
mary
she said when i came in there's only two in front of you
and you know i've been sitting an hour
she says there are two in front you
now then what can we do for you this time
well remember you gave me tablets for this leg

that's the UNK again
oh no
not again
is that what it is
ah
but it's just on the surface it's not it's not the same as the other one
it's
aha
that's right
well you should have seen the size of it
yeah
tt they're an awful worry
and my UNK been right sore
and this about half past two the day i was that sick UNK and then i took the UNK
mhm

i think i'd rather have my UNK because of that
well th the UNK will only make this worse mary
will it
mhm
i feel done today
you know
mhm
i really feel
yeah
done
see your UNK that's one of the side effects it you get very occasionally with it
it gives you UNK
ah
UNK in your breast
oh gosh it's been murder
er i th i think er y i think you should give yourself a at least a week without it to get the a chance to get away
without what
UNK
without your UNK
aye
okay then
cos er it's only gonna gradually get worse and worse
aye
and worse if you keep in with it
i just feel done today i've never felt like this before you know

anyway thank you very much right
i'll still be here
right
right mary
cheerio
cheerio now
shut up henry
i'd like to welcome you to er this meeting of unison
it's an open meeting mainly to discuss er the campaign around er saving
i have a few erm apologies for absence to er make
one from joyce who until recently was a full time UNK at er
quite where the jobs are going and who does what at this stage i'm not sure now we're unison
erm one from paddy and i have an official letter er UNK for not being able to be here
he said he's been pressing and UNK the health authority about the their plans for
the future appears to be UNK in mystery and uncertainty
i find it difficult to UNK how an international hospital with a high with a highly regarded professional staff can be allowed to slip into terminal decline
it is an UNK on the present government's approach to the n h s
incidentally i can't be with you because i'm trying to ensure that in the next general election labour will win more seats
only with a labour government can we ensure the n h s will be safe and secure
that's erm that's his opinion
erm and also from er alan mp from he er UNK us for inviting er him here today but he says unfortunately i already have a previous engagement in london and so will be unable to join you on this occasion
please accept my apologies and best wishes and rest assured of my ongoing support
yours sincerely alan mp
er we are hoping that erm graham who's the mp er will be attending and speaking er
unless that's him on the phone at the moment
erm other than that i'd just like to introduce the other speakers
i'm my name's steve and i chair the save campaign
erm on my left here is john who's er from the district t u c
on my right is jeff who is a founding member of the save campaign and an ex patient of
and on the far end is ed who's a full time UNK unison officer
so could i without further UNK introduce john
erm the UNK trade union council in mansfield basically supports for two reasons
one that many trade unionists work at and there's a threat to their jobs and a threat to their future careers
too many trade unionists will at some stage or other become patients of
and it seems strange in an area where we just lost general hospital and everything has moved to that which is a nationally UNK hospital
let's get that bit right nationally UNK
is under threat
and i also noticed this week that nine specialist hospitals in london are now also under threat
this is from a government whose leader john major said fifteen months ago that the n h s is safe in his hands
mind you he also said that david UNK norman UNK and michael mates had nothing to worry about with their jobs
er we know where they went
er like everything else
that john major says it seems to be very UNK to put it UNK
lies is perhaps more accurate
the national health service was founded forty five years ago
for forty five years we're being told continually that it is the envy of the world
everybody would like to have a national health service wherever you go in the world
and we seem to be at the moment watching the UNK and the decline of the national health service
it concerns me in fact i was i've had a theory for a couple of years now that what the tories wish us all to do is to go on to the american system of medical insurance
private health care
that is why specialist units have to be shut down
why pay for good health care if you can get the best on the n h s
that is i think partly the thinking behind this government that they wish to see us all pay health insurance
take private use private hospitals
interestingly enough i also heard recently that takes patients from a private hospital the because they can give far better treatment than the private sector
it's kind of worrying
to tell what the tories are doing to the n h s i mean i don't think it's a case of us making them aware of what's happening
they know what they're doing to the n h s
i come on i mean if el UNK michael heseltine has to go all the way to UNK to have a heart attack
because he's very much aware of what the tories are doing to the health service same as the rest of the cabinet
and he has to go abroad before he dare have a heart attack
most probably wouldn't be able to find a hospital open
you never know these days
er so i mean this to us is a very important campaign
and i know there are speakers coming on that know far more about the n h s than i do so i'm not gonna go on too long
er because i mean we're just here to show support and to provide continuing support for this campaign
but it does concern me very much not just the loss of jobs but it's the loss of services in this area
and this is an area now which faces very high unemployment with the tory policy on pit closures
what that basically means wherever that happens anywhere else in the country you go to south wales you go to west lothian places like that i've been up to west lothian all services are reduced when your main UNK removed from an area
we do have an asset in and i think it is worth us fighting to preserve that hospital and not to watch it go into decline
but it's also about a bit more it's about defending the national health service
something which is very much under attack
we can see it daily monthly
i don't quite understand how the government think they'll keep getting away with this
erm i certainly know it's not a case of debates in parliament
or letters to john major
i've a UNK suspicion he bins any letter that UNK his government before he even reads it
it is all about people getting out
and about them fighting and making their voices heard
and i hope over the next few months that the people that's present today and other people get more involved in the campaign
show them some support
they keep UNK away the staff and the former patients at the hospital
and the unions more directly involved in it
and as i say i'm not really that is basically all i wanted to say
must be one of the shortest speech i've ever done
thanks
thank you
john without further delay i'll introduce jeff who is a founding member of the campaign and an ex patient
jeff
well it er to be here and thank you for coming to the meeting
er as i said on thursday night that it UNK me about that i'm also an ex patient of
and also i'm going in on the fourteenth of july er in to have my knee washed out on the fourteenth of july
and it's been on my heart for a long time to save
not just but the other hospitals around my country that are being threatened
and our health service is being threatened
and i reach out personally from the UNK and the UNK point of view to the people out there that sit in their UNK towers in the homes and say they cannot do this to our hospitals
and all i say in response is please get up write on petitions send them in to m ps send them in to the unions
fill them in to save your hospitals not just the unions or the m ps labour conservative liberal whoever they are it's your hospitals it's their hospitals they're trying to close
it's one of the marvellous hospitals in the world
and we just reach out to you please to try to speak out to your friends
er we will get on to the er the press and people to really get out to the people to save our it's no good saying in nine months' time why wasn't there something done for our hospitals
the time for the time for our health service the time for the rest of the hospitals in this country is now
it's today
don't put off tomorrow what can be done today for your hospital for
and i'd like you to just to reach out and the mps and people just to keep fighting
because what they're doing now as you know they can do closing they can do these now
we are having to fight hard to save our hospitals
so we need these people have UNK to fight for us
i will still carry on and i'd like to see on this t shirt here at the end of the day we have saved
thank you very much jeff
i'd just like to welcome graham who's come in
erm and very quickly move on to ed who's the unison full time
thanks very much steve
erm i think before i start it's very important as has been pointed out by the previous two speakers that we actually make a practical response to the closure of hospital
we all do our bit to ensure that the general public and also members of the health authority are fully aware of our feelings in connection with the closure of what is not just a regional UNK but what is a nationally and internationally UNK hospital
i also think it's quite er UNK that we're UNK both the birth of the new public service union unison for the first of july and also on monday the forty fifth anniversary of the n h s
according to my understanding of labour history it was er during the war years at one of the labour party conferences that a nupe resolution supported by UNK actually er brought about some of the many things that were written within the UNK report and committed the labour party to the foundation of the national health service that would be free at the points of need for every member of the community
so i think from the trade union UNK point of view we can feel especially proud of the fact that on monday we'll be celebrating the forty fifth anniversary of the health service and all the advantages that that's brought to members of our communities and members of our of our families
i think it's also very relevant that we look at the real threats that are facing the n h s
within this locality we look at the UNK or fairly UNK closure of
john earlier spoke about the gradual UNK of our national health service
the moves towards a form of credit card care where ambulance workers will be asking you the number of your credit card before erm treatment will be given in hospital
because that's literally the state of affairs in america
and one of my experiences since the n h s reforms has been working in hospitals and hopefully defending our members' interests
i mean i think maybe some of our shop stewards have a different opinion about er my involvement but that's what i aim to do
and one situation i came across as a consequence of the n h s reforms was nurses on a maternity ward UNK a work study
which literally timed every single activity they undertook
the purpose of that exercise was to bring about a specification for maternity services
to build times that nurses spent working with patients into a specification and to basically to form contracts based upon that time
now i think that approach to health care is fundamentally wrong because you measure the needs of a patient in one moment and then suggest that the needs of that the needs of that patient will continue to be the same in subsequent weeks or subsequent months
so you actually build a time value into the contribution of nursing
you actually do exactly the same thing as you would do to a joiner in a in a fitting shop to say this task c can take this length of erm time
so that's just one example of how UNK is UNK into the n h s
our nurses are un are being undermined in terms of the contributions that they that they that they can make
and it's also important that we look back over the last ten years to how the n h s has been fundamentally changed as a consequence of tory government policy towards it
in the early nineteen eighties the government undertook a review by an expert sir roy UNK
an expert in running supermarkets as chairman of sainsburys
and obviously an expert in business
but clearly someone with without a background in health services or indeed in the management of health services
what that review achieved was the UNK of the health service the breaking up of health authorities from health authority into units and the heading up of those particular units by general managers
now my opinion is that was the first stage of the government's master plan to create a health service that would be ripe for privatization
back in nineteen eighty eight the government faced a massive crash cash crisis in n h s funding and er many people within the trade union movement took part in a massive rally in london to call on the government to review its policy towards the health service
many of us at that time welcomed the fact that the government was taking stock of public opinion and was t making the effort to review the n h s
but unfortunately what that review meant was that what the review brought about was a near privatization of the health service through the government's n h s white paper and subsequently the n h s and community care act
the UNK of that act went to the very heart of the n h s
in general because it introduced the concept of competition between the providers of the providers of health care in the so called internal market
in simple terms health authorities have been turned into the buyers of health care and rather than the providers of health care
and that is very significant
and i'll go on to talk about how that is significant in the context of
in this process they're able to purchase services health authorities are able to purchase services from whoever they see fit and basically from wherever they th they want to
in we saw the health authority choosing not to purchase services directly from the n h s for their but purchasing from a voluntary stroke private privately motivated organization
and again there is no guarantee that any n h s trust will receive contracts from district health authorities in the future
therefore the UNK of contracts affects completely the services of otherwise model erm hospitals and services
and in a similar fashion i think it's also important that we look the move towards g p UNK
where g ps are at liberty to refer their patients wherever they want to refer those patients
yeah
so it won't necessarily be that patients from er a g p surgery or a g p practice will be referred directly to the local hospital
if g ps are UNK they have constraints upon their finance
and if you go and see a g p at the end of the financial year or at the wrong part of the financial year then you may be referred to somewhere strictly because that's all the g p can afford to send you
so i think the scenario within the health service is basically that units rather than working together working in with each other are actually competing to achieve contracts to secure work
in the context of we'll be UNK a change er we'll be UNK without a change on the part of the health authority an UNK of that hospital and a closure as a consequence of the internal market
er firstly a third of 's work is being transferred to medical centre a third of its UNK services
and i think it's very important that we look at what the impact of that transfer will have upon the hospital
the remaining hospital will lose a third of its activity will therefore lose a third of its income
but at the very same time it'll retain many of the overheads that it's currently got the overheads of management some staffing overheads the overheads for maintaining the estate of the of the hospital
what this will do is present at a disadvantage when it comes to competing with other units to secure the contracts that it ultimately UNK at the minute
the internal market makes no reference to the quality of care to the ability of a particular unit to deliver care
it's simply to do with pounds shillings and pence
and while many people can look towards the advantages of a UNK unit at medical centre people are failing to look at the disadvantages that will cause for the provision of UNK services in
because of the government reforms is unlikely to survive because it will carry into competition a third additional overheads
elsewhere will seem to be er will seem to be a little bit cheaper to the purchasing authorities
to deal with the future of the health authority com commissioned what's called the york report
a very UNK document er for many of the trade unionists who were involved in negotiations with the management at the current time
despite two written letters to er the district general manager that report hasn't been forthcoming
it contains vital information as to the ability of to survive
yet there's a UNK of UNK surrounding that report
it's likely that this report will set out how should close and all the reasons why it should close
erm as i've said strictly because it will be to it will be UNK within the with within the internal market
and i think if we look at the effects of the internal market in this situation what the internal market will achieve is er a situation where this community and all the neighbouring communities that use will be
excuse me
sorry to UNK in but if anybody's got a car parked at the back here the UNK taken all the
traffic warden is taking all the numbers
w well actually he's jus he's just getting bored with me
that's why he said that
right
i'll er i'll erm i i'll crack on crack on
i think in a similar fashion in a similar fashion we're seeing other areas of the country that are affected by the UNK of the internal market
over recent months the UNK report recommended the closure of many of the country's UNK teaching hospitals with wi with within london
erm basically to say that elsewhere can provide services on a cheaper basis than those hospitals erm wi with within london
i think the other point i would want to make is that it's quite significant that in the week that we celebrate the forty fifth anniversary of the n h s for the first time ever erm waiting lists within this country will have will exceed one million
so all the rhetoric that we've had from this government about better performance n h s more people being seen by the n h s that must be read against the fact that over a million people are or a million patients are er waiting on n h s waiting lists
the other thing that we need to say is that far from creating UNK within the n h s the bureaucracy attached to the changes when people are responsible for managing contracts dealing with contracts dealing with specifications for contracts
that within itself has cost one point two million pounds
and i think it's no wonder that for example within trent region over the last three years since the n h s act came into force that there has been a UNK of accountants or er administrators within the health service and a corresponding reduction within the numbers of nursing staff the numbers of directly employed UNK staff within with within the n h s
again the internal market hasn't worked and isn't working
one other example over the last week just UNK out of the air a hundred thousand pounds has been taken away from hospital er college hospital in UNK budget for the treatment of aids patients
they will over the next few months be UNK to sack twenty five unison members skilled nurses who work within that particular UNK
think of the logic attached to that
at a time when the incidence of aids has risen to er approximately to two thousand four hundred a year compared with one thousand six hundred a year in i in the previous twelve months
this government is seeking to reduce the budget of one the most necessary services within the country
i think another important thing for us to recognize is that many of the people within the n h s the people directly responsible for the care remain some of the lowest people in the country the least UNK people in the country
now while that says a great deal about what the government thinks about of them and their expertise it also says a great deal about how well regarded this national health service of ours is in the minds of this particular government
and again one of the great concerns that we have with the development of n h s trusts is those trust boards are able to determine their own policies in respect to staffing to set their own pay scales for staff also they are able to do their business to a large extent behind closed doors
legally they are only required to have one public or open meeting at which the community health council is invited to attend
again my concern about that is that trusts bring with them a UNK of UNK able to do business behind closed doors
and much of the concerns that we've been able to express about the health service has been as a direct consequence of us having information as to for example the numbers of bed closures as for example the numbers of people on waiting lists
trust status brings with it a cloud of UNK
we'll be limited in our ability to find out what these trusts are doing with public money what they're doing er in su what they're doing er i in support of support of patients
another area that is of concern to us is the development of what's called patient focused hospitals
trusts within this locality er are a little bit further UNK than are actually looking a towards patient focused hospitals where in actual fact everything every treatment a patient is dealt with on the ward rather than have a skilled nurse undertaking part of the treatment there will be multi UNK so er the member of staff will be multi skilled to perform almost every single aspect of erm care directly on a ward
again an attempt to undermine the skills and expertise that currently exist within the health service
again i think it's important th that i wind up before i start UNK
but maybe you think of course i started UNK when i started off but er
thank you very much john
erm
as i said from the start it's vitally important that we do everything we can to defend hospital
it's vitally important that we mark the forty fifth anniversary of the n h s
labour's greatest ever achievement without fear of any contradiction the greatest achievement of the labour movement was the introduction of the n h s which still remains to a large extent the envy of the world
we must fight to defend it
we must resolve on the forty fifth anniversary to continue in our support
we must all of us write to the health authority to our local m ps to the government to defend UNK hospital
thanks very much
thank you very much ed
erm i er move straight over to er graham and then open up for any questions or if anybody wants to say anything from the floor
graham
right
thank you very much and er thanks for inviting me along
i'm sorry i became er a wee bit late
sorry i nearly got a ticket as well
nice welcome to
i had to bring my UNK with me to er obviously get into coming from but er i've got a letter from alan as well so er me over the border
but the reason i'm here is just to express solidarity with the campaign that you're continuing
and it's a campaign that's gotta keep on
there's no question about that
er to let you know that your labour members of parliament in nottinghamshire as a whole er are backing the campaign
and that's because doesn't belong to you
no it don't
belongs to everybody and it particularly belongs to everybody in nottinghamshire
er whether you're from the south north the city or whatever
as far as we're concerned it's our and we want to keep it
and one of the er i think probably everybody in has some relative brother who's er used
certainly my father not least because of his er mining history
and also my brother as well have used
and you go anywhere you can go anywhere in the country people talk about it
they know immediately when you start talking about
they know its record they know what it does
and i think that's the most valuable thing
it's er what the er marketing people would call grand identification
and that means it's in people's minds there's something even above what it actually is
it's got an image it's got an emotional contact and i think we're gonna play that for all it's worth
it's one of the assets that we've got in the campaign
one of the other reasons i'm here is er again with the blessing of er jeff and alan and the other mps is to try and help the campaign along a little bit and hopefully er have friends from er central television who i've brought along today
er who'll get it on the news tonight with a wee bit of luck
and if i may we'll set something up for them and we'll try and get the shirt on the telly and whatever and try and get people to remember
anybody in the east midlands that sees that news remember their hospital is under threat
did a little bit for the radio this morning in radio and radio and it's all UNK to the mill
keep the campaign going
keep talking to people
keep letting people know the threat that is actually occurring
but it's not a new threat
we were talking earlier on about the n h s and the foundation of the n h s
when the national health service was founded don't ever forget on the second reading of the bill to establish the national health service every single member of the conservative party voted against the establishment of the national health service
and in my view what they couldn't achieve on that night in parliament in the nineteen forties is now being achieved by UNK bits and pieces away as they go along
they want a two tier health service and they're working towards a two tier health services
this for them is just one step along the way
and whether it's nasty shouting arrogant kenneth clarke or lovely UNK virginia they're all the same underneath in terms of the way they look at the health service
it's alright for some to be able to buy private health care and then the rest of us can have a UNK and reducing national health service both in nottinghamshire and throughout the rest of the country
of course they'll say well there's no demand
well try telling the one thousand seven hundred and sixty two people who are currently on the waiting list at that there's no demand for the services that provide
even the documents that er unison have provided to me which indicate the shortfall in operations last year will indicate that the job isn't even being done with a fully UNK let alone a reduced service
and UNK away one part of transferring the UNK unit just taking out bits and pieces is designed to UNK the idea that itself can stand on its own
once you've got rid of some of it why not take another bit and then at the end of the day let's close the whole damn thing and save everybody a lot of money
that's the theory that they're working on and it's not just here
it's not just in and it's not just in hospitals it's all the way around
over the last six weeks or so i'll tell you the places i've been and the people i've seen in the national health service
now UNK
i had a meeting of all the UNK in about five weeks ago
without exception every single one of them in that room and i invited every single one from the whole of my constituency said we want to stay in the national health service
but because they're reducing the fee income for UNK in the national health service these UNK dedicated people in some pretty tough estates in my patch were saying i am being forced to go private
whenever somebody comes into my surgery i offer them this so called UNK
sign up for private insurance
they don't want to do it and some are even having to leave the n h s as a whole
but they are being forced to do it by UNK virginia who's actually trying to reduce the ability of UNK to perform in the national health service as they want to do and as they always have done
four weeks ago i met every single g p in my constituency in a meeting
those g ps told me i thought i was listening to my own speeches to be honest from about a year or two ago
they were saying oh you know what's happening
i said no there's a development of a two tier health service
i said well welcome to the reality
it's what we were saying in the labour party before the nineteen ninety two election
and er i made one or two political points as you can imagine with doctors who are allegedly UNK and don't want to get involved in all this messy er things about conservative party and labour party and the rest of it
the truth is politics is coming home even to those so called professional groups
they're getting UNK too
yes there is a two tier g ps service developing in my city and in the UNK
and there's no question about that
there's they pointed out to me that the two thousand percent increase in prescription charges
since this lot came to power is forcing people to make a decision as to whether they should get a prescription or whether they should not
and there was one of many UNK stories about a doctor
she went round to this er house and said why aren't why aren't you improving and the person said i just can't afford the prescription
she went out and bought the prescription for this person because it was so essential
not every doctor can do that and you certainly do it every week
so all the way round there are attacks taking place
and attacks quite deliberate not just happening by accident
but quite deliberate on the different parts of the health service
the nurses two weeks ago i met nurses that i've met three years ago at my surgery about UNK
they still haven't been UNK five years later
five years from the original appeal in nineteen eighty eight those nurses still haven't gone all the way through the UNK process and any union officer will tell you that doesn't just occur in city hospital in this case but it occurs right across the as well
and now what they're saying is well we'll buy out those appeals if you had your appeal running for a few years we'll give you five hundred pound ex UNK payment
go away and forget it
well i can tell you if you get your right grade firstly you earn a lot more money
and it s should all be UNK
so it's not a very good deal
secondly there's some of the nurses who weren't present at the meeting three weeks ago who had been present three years ago
the reason they weren't present
they've retired
the thing had gone on so long they'd actually retired from nursing
and one person had died in the process relating the appeal
i'm very pleased to say that the union er involved had actually pursued the appeal even though the woman had died and won the appeal UNK so that the UNK pay could be given to the UNK in that case
erm what a situation we're in when you can't get your appeal through in a reasonable time and it actually results in that sort of nonsense taking place
and finally a group in the national health service who i never thought would be on our team the UNK
the classic UNK small business which made thatcher great
every last one of them i would imagine that were in that room when i met them er a week ago friday i would probably stake my shirt on it not that shirt but this one
that most of those people would have voted conservative in nineteen eighty nine or three whatever eighty seven ninety three eighty three
i would have said they would that they would have done
every single one of them turned round at that meeting and said will you go and beat the out of that government for what they're doing to us
because what they're now doing to them is saying unless you turnover two thousand UNK every month we're gonna do away with your professional allowance
now
fine okay
what does that actually what does that do
in a place like mine anybody who knows my patch you know old or you know certain parts of or you know certain parts of
they are not gonna produce those amounts of UNK per month therefore they're not gonna get the professional allowance therefore those UNK or those UNK are gonna close
and in one particular patch of i worked UNK hard over the last three years to get a doctor onto that estate
it's the only estate in my patch without a doctor
i've now got a half time doctor on there
if the UNK goes people are not gonna go to that doctor because there won't be a UNK nearby to get a prescription
so that whole effort to raise up that estate in my patch will UNK because of some arbitrary limit imposed by virginia UNK who obviously know very well from a commanding position in whitehall
absolute nonsense
doctors g ps nurses UNK they're all under attack and you're just part of the effort to try and UNK that attack all the way round
so the sort of things that are happening are happening everywhere and community care i think could be probably one of the areas that i could talk about at some length if you wanted to later on
erm these er very sad cases this week of individuals frankly no fault of their own er committing horrendous crimes that we have seen
erm UNK people being released into the community UNK not having the assistance that they needed committing crimes innocent victims there
innocent families having to suffer from that all for the want of proper supervision and proper care
it UNK over it goes into er the civil service unions that i addressed in parliament this week
exactly the same thing's happening with them in terms of privatization market testing
from examples as wide as er group four UNK taking over transportation of prisoners from prison er to court and back and losing a few on the way
erm to things such as er the er case of people not having adequate staff in prisons and therefore UNK people
it's almost like community care for the prisons you want to keep an eye in this one
i had a case this week of a person who was reduced from a category a the most serious form of offender in prison to a category c
he was a UNK a violent offender er racist attack merchant
on to a category c given home leave first thing he does on home leave is go out and kill an asian man
and in a way er and this is a story i think is gonna develop over the next six months or a year
we're gonna see a lot of this happening cos this talking comes cheap er crime and the rest of it
we're gonna see a lot of that developing but anyway that's a UNK
but that actually occurred this week and i think we're gonna see more of that
so anyway is the health service safe in the UNK hands
well for the sake of a few million pounds the conservatives will slash this area that area will say we need to close this unit that unit
well in and there's one or two people here that'll know what i'm talking about we've had one of our local mps on a consultancy basis for the health clinic fix up a contract for his own particular company
the district the er chairman of the district health authority david has been involved in this obviously in allocating this contract
and the then secretary of state for health kenneth clarke was involved in that his department granted the UNK
so a million couple of million pounds has gone in that direction
of course all three people no doubt innocent parties
all three people are local prominent tories
all three people went to the high school
and all three people in my opinion are like that
when they get together and they need money the old school tie the old party tie comes into play and money can be found for things that they think are profitable for them and their UNK and their companies and their interests
so if we can UNK the screw it's possible to actually get these people in my view to start seeing our interests as well
and i've said this er i've said this in week to the civil service unions i never did believe in lobbying parliament
i thought that was all about people feeling they'd had their day in parliament because there was a tory majority of a hundred or more
now if we can convince enough tories often a handful ten fifteen twenty there is a possibility however faint that you can change the government's mind
and i think that's where this UNK got to go next
i think we've got to be serious about it in terms of targeting given individuals tracking back their history go back through the bloody files if there's been anybody been treated
use everything without shame to get to those tory mps and say do you know what is happening
do you know that you your family your wife your grandfather whoever wouldn't be able to get this sort of treatment in the hospital they were treated in before
i think we can do that and i think it's important that we do that
we're fighting a battle against an enemy who has a totally UNK philosophy to our to ourselves
they don't even understand the health service they don't want the health service
they're UNK bits of land in again in the city of UNK a piece of land next to the city hospital for a supermarket
that's the sort of UNK you've got
where they ask what are your vital signs they don't mean have you got a pulse or high blood pressure they mean have you got access or UNK
they're the vital signs you've got to display before you go and get treated under the new health service
this campaign is just in my view really starting to make its mark on the public imagination
i hope that our friends from central television and the media and everybody else working through the east midlands region t u c through unison through the labour parties start to get that campaign really rolling
let them know you're around and i can say on behalf of the labour mps of nottinghamshire you'll have our full support
go to it
thanks very much
i wasn't actually gonna say anything but i'd better say a little bit
i've just suddenly realized actually that i'm the only health worker
yeah
could i ask a question please
certainly
well as er having listened to what graham said against the er the g ps and the UNK which er they totally agreed with what graham was saying what we don't see either in the press or on television a panel of g ps and UNK the national health service and the media don't see that
why isn't these doctors that are UNK it and the UNK and so forth together on a panel of something and expose it on t v or in the press that they condemn it
and we never see the doctors UNK it we don't see the UNK it either
and i mean the media from their point of view is not getting across
and they're the professionals
so i think we ought to see a little bit more of these doctors and a little more of these UNK also backing the national health service up er which they should
er is it a question do you want an answer
or
well it's jus i it was a comment
sorry a comment
can i just
i mean i think that's a good idea
i think you the people you know and i said you could apply it to tory m ps god knows if you're gonna get a tory mp for with their organization but i'm damn sure you can get g ps for and you can get UNK for or whatever
you can do all the UNK
i'd go i'd do stars for
you must've had people passing through there famous people who you can register get them there do this sort of thing
i mean th er
i've done that
oh i'm sorry
yeah
keep that keep that running in that case because you can't do too much with it
you've gotta keep using that sort of imagination to actually keep UNK people's imagination
i mean i didn't see that so
no but i keep us briefed so with so we're up to speed on it and keep those little units that little campaign feeling here there and everywhere going
cos that's the only way you're gonna UNK the public imagination
if you haven't got the public on your side and there is a lot of emotional support for if you haven't got the public on your side then the politicians can get away with murder
could i co c er comment a little further then on that
i'm talking about a UNK with a g p that set us
are these people afraid to expose themselves in a panel UNK the national health service or just to sit in the background and make any comments
it's that whole thing about they're never gonna come for me
has been for that has actually been the case has been the problems in terms of actually getting nurses to actually come out and doctors and UNK to actually come out publicly
erm and quite UNK to be honest because the fear of their jobs
i worked at as a nurse and there's actually there's a lot of pressure going on there as will back up
what i would say is there are instances that have been happening around the country in the last year where both doctors g ps and nurses have actually said you're not doing that
you're not closing this hospital you're not closing these wards
and what's actually happened was the college hospital
what they did was the nurses and the doctors took over the ward
they said you're not closing us down
we're running this ward
the patients themselves kept the management out and the rest of it
and that ward stayed open
there are those possibilities and that is something that we should be arguing for
but in a sense it's not just the people round this table and the committee should be arguing for this it's actually the people in this room
it's the people i mean the people in this room know a great deal more people than i do on my own for example
or a group of us do on our own
and that is where i think we should actually be pushing
we should actually be pushing saying for those health UNK service erm workers and also people in the public who are not doing that not a case of we don't want you to and this is a case against it although that's strong
it's actually saying we're not prepared to let you close down our hospital and our services any more
can i can i just erm add a question
is erm what are they doing
the only thing is what we can do is like everything else
as i said before on thursday that the idea is that the people outside there the public are the ones that are important
when it comes to an announce the fact that we're gonna have er council elections how many people come out and vote for your councillors and put them in
how many voted to put smack the conservatives and don't worry about politics i'm just using it as an example in the face
they came out and they voted
how many come out and vote for the mps when it comes to when it comes to the er elections
how many millions come out
now what we're saying is this is your hospitals
this is your health service
here is a petition
please sign the petition for your for your health service
get around
send your letters
how many people are gonna do this out there
will the b c they will do it
please tell them to get their petitions not just get down and get millions like you go out and vote to protect your health service as and your hospitals
i
got you george
yes
erm i just want to comment and then erm
i represent i think along with my colleagues here the you know the UNK movement
and there's nobody needs hospital or health treatment more than the pensioners
and yet for a long time now whether it comes to dental payment paying for UNK now they're talking about prescription charges and that sort of thing for not just myself not just us but for children as well
we're being attacked on all sides quite frankly
and as well as the closing of er certain hospitals
er i'm one of those people that took a two year er low pay rise to put me into the health service when my husband was ill
and we had two years with no pay rise
my father was also one of those er people that contributed a penny a week along with about thirty five thousand miners in this area to pay for
and so is not theirs to give away at all
it's ours even before the national health service was brought in
i think one of the problems we face is that the campaign for is UNK with the campaign to save the pits
i think it's suffered from this
you know because tremendous publicity quite rightly the thing given to the campaign to save the pits
and i'd like to think that you now start to think not in terms of in terms of other hospitals but to get a UNK campaign throughout the country on this particular issue
because i mean th there's more teaching hospitals in london going an and right throughout the country
why cannot we g get the same response on the question of hospital closures er as we did er against pit closures
i'm not saying that you know would successfully we drove back millions of people supporting us that would never support us if you go into one particular matter alone or one particular hospital closure alone
and i think it is so very important that we try to do that
now the mps can help in coordinating this
they could play an outstanding role in giving the information and coordinating this
also now that we've got unison the one union i think they can help but i do think that's what needs to be done because they're doing the same with the hospital as now doing with the pits even after the closure campaign
and closing them UNK thinking they can get away with one at a time
and i'd like to ask the panel what possibilities there are of getting a nationwide campaign listing all the hospitals that's under threat
and i think
listing all and developing this national campaign
yeah
i'm i'll go and bring alan in
to answer that question and that
health services
we've actually debated the issue before this week
and the t u c to launch a nationwide campaign probably september october time to tie with the chancellor's autumn statement for a mass rally in london for about the time of the autumn statement
we would hope that by doing this we'd actually mobilize the whole country to get down into london and to protest at the house of commons against the closures in the health service
so that's all being looked into
sorry about that
so we UNK in september october there will be a massive rally in london to save our health service
thank you
i think basically what i'd like to say today is that i personally agree with what UNK saying that it is an attack on the health service and it is the greatest achievement that the labour party has done in history in my opinion
and i believe that the labour party should be at the front to save er our health service including the holidays er not the holidays including the hospitals including er keeping hospitals within the health service
and i'm against any trust status which they tend to go because i believe that the beginning of our campaign that because was talking last year about trust status it did UNK a lot of people against and said why should we bother fighting for a hospital what would go trust anyway
this er committee is fighting for inside the national health service and i think we should make that clear
that we're not fighting to save a hospital to go trust
it is to stay within the health service
we need more help than we've got
this committee we started we formed a committee some months ago
erm and as part of that committee i believe we've not been very successful
erm we need to get more organized within ourselves we need more help before we actually and er we're talking about petitions on er UNK signatures on petitions
we need at least forty thousand signatures before we can even attempt to do anything with and get publicity round that
be because before you can actually present them to UNK street you need forty thousand signatures at least
we are nowhere near that amount
we need people on the streets collecting signatures we don't need people to just sign we need your help in and in areas
and we need a UNK coordinating campaign to get those signatures as quickly as possible so then we can talk about lobbying parliament because we can't do it without them
we need a focus point and that needs to be it
and for us to go forward that is the first major thing we need to do and i'm appealing today that if people can give us two hours on saturday morning or a friday afternoon we need people we don't need two people on a street corner cos we've done it and it is it we don't get the effect we want because most people walk past us
cos while you're getting one signature twenty people walks by you
we want ten and fifteen people stood there in the street you want their t shirts on because i have never yet had one person say to me i won't sign it because i think they should shut
people no one wants to see hospital closed
but it's we've got to get them motivated and i'm asking today you know we need more help and if you can spare a few hours a week it would be more than appreciated
and if you can see jeff after the meeting i'm sure he can take your names and coordinate that
thank you
i'm going to have to UNK apologize er to all the speakers on the platform who've actually got prior commitments er pretty soon after the speeches i'll just let mick speak and then i'm gonna have to close the meeting
but erm obviously what UNK said i think we all we all back up
if we don't get if we don't literally don't get the bodies on the street we don't get we're not gonna win we're gonna lose
well first of all i'd like to
on behalf of the national union of UNK and offer the full support from the n u m
i was invited to touch on the historical links between and the mining industry of this area
it's given miners a lot of service over the years and UNK a lot of the er distress of the at work
regardless of the pit closure programme ta erm we're in full flight erm at the end of the day we could be looking at a situation with four pits remaining in nottinghamshire er and to that extent there'll be up to four thousand miners still UNK on the services of should er remain open
and er th there will be an increase the ra accident rates that are UNK related er inside the remainder of the pits because we're now seeing the drift towards er longer working hours more time at the coal face
and even before the pit closure programme started with the increased competition that was taking place inside the mines the increased productivity erm we've seen a steady rise in the number of back accidents erm you know UNK erm related accidents
so miners in nottinghamshire still require the services that operated in the past
i'd just like to offer this erm message to graham back to the house of commons
it weren't so long back that er john major when talking about er benefit was quite surprised by the fact that er disabled erm UNK had rose by well it had UNK in inside the thatcher years
i mean it comes as no surprise to me er because of the lack of health and safety provision inside the work places and people that remain in work erm being subjected to longer working hours er inside the industry
and that's certainly the case inside the mining industry
erm but er going back to again erm because er they're analyzing now erm all benefits so they can reduce the
when you know what we should be saying to john major and employers is that it isn't any surprise that er UNK er has increased over the last thirteen fourteen years
and er one of the reasons for that is because of the lack of UNK provision being provided and erm th the closure of our oldest part of that
and the UNK will carry on rising while they k keep closing hospitals of this nature
so i think we can project the closure of and UNK hospitals of this nature into that debate about er new benefits and why we why the tories are suddenly surprised by the number of UNK
all i can say is thank you all for coming
erm please give a bit more of the just support we need we literally we do need bodies we do need people to actually come along
we we'll meet about once a fortnight er we can actually let people know if er if all you leave names and phone numbers or whatever
the campaign next friday is it
next friday in
in here at seven o'clock next friday is our next meeting
and it's not designed to be a public meeting for anybody that come along and gives support and help would be more than welcome
thank you again for all coming

you don't want it to have a lot of corn
you only want corn when you're working them
when you're hunting them and doing things like that
but hay suits any animal
but you that you can
mm
going back to the war time the second world war you said that racing wasn't considered to be an agricultural industry
breeding of horses was
yeah
but not racing
so what how did the racing industry get on during the war
how did they manage
well they had to they only UNK at newmarket
all through the war they UNK at newmarket see UNK it all to one meeting so that they didn't have to travel about
see the animal didn't have to travel about so and most of the trainers come here you see
oh it was very good in the war time cos there was only just i can't tell you now
i could tell you UNK if i'd known how where the race was or there's not many places
but all my races was run at newmarket
some was run somewhere else but i couldn't tell you where now not UNK
but all the races was run at newmarket or newmarket heath
all everything
that were all cos of the war see
mm
and all run here everything was run here and animals that won here well er well i think they put them down as better animals than animals that UNK before the war you know cos they had to do such a lot in a short time
you see because all the air force had all the heath they didn't have a lot of heath to train horses on you know then
you only had little bits they claimed UNK for farming
we had to had to plough that up and put and put er feed in it
where was this
oh what we call UNK
UNK
yeah where you come down that hill from the boy's grave
yes
well on your right that's all that's all UNK down there
that's all training round in there
mm
see
that's on the mm that's on the UNK road from bury coming in isn't it
yes yeah
then when you get down into well bottom
you see a house on your left don't you pass the house on your left well all on the right is a what they call the UNK
yes
see there the UNK are on well bottom to the top of the down
till you get traffic lights
yes
all laid out special you know for training
mm
galloping ground
during the war you had to grow food on it you said
what
during the war you had to grow food on it you said to me
food
you had to grow food
yes
during the war
yeah
you had to grow food on those areas
yeah
where you said
you weren't allowed to use them
oh no you weren't allowed er only the UNK we was allowed to use
oh yes they'd be erm tt agriculture
they'd UNK pinch 'em you see
they'd have to give so much away
same as the south fields they pinched all a lot of that
we had to grow potatoes and UNK everything you know
and these were usually on the training grounds
otherwise they'd have built on it or summat like that you see
that's why we have to do it
but it's all back again in its own place now
mm
see but th the south fields what was a good training ground for all of us
two mile round there was er the air force was on it you see the ninety ninth UNK was down here see all the war all them all that ground was under all undermined with big petrol tanks
oh yes all down there that's where they bombed when the war was on and when they killed the people in the town
oh yes
th this was a great place this was very dangerous
was there a lot of people killed with the bomb
one two four i four i think four i think was killed tt
whereabouts did it fall
outside the picture place
outside the er UNK what you'd call it you know where outside there it fell
killed the girl in the post office i know
post office is this side of the road in them days
what on the opposite of what it is now
two and three in the town were killed
market day it was you know oh yeah
it was during the day
yeah i was down the UNK i was i was
i was down the paddock
before i couldn't get down the high street for bricks and houses but they're not there now
i couldn't get out quick enough
i didn't know where it was
how did the war affect yo your training of the horses
oh it didn't interfere didn't interfere with th didn't interfere the only thing about it you had to do everything in daylight there were no lights allowed at nights you know
mm
you didn't have none of this
no electric lights
you had to do everything in daylight
you know very that was that was about the hardest part about it cos no sooner you were done you had to start again you understand
mm
cos you had to get do it with lights and every window was UNK over oh terrible
terrible to work in it
but er we got through it all didn't we
we got through it
but that's what happened
did the horses do as well
yeah oh yeah
they didn't worry about them they carried on just the same
you done everything exactly the same only you didn't have the time to do it in
you woke up about an hour you know the nights are shorter
well you see you finish in the morning about half past half past twelve we used to cos no sooner you get your dinner and had a drink you had to be back again two o'clock or half past two to start on 'em again you see
mm
which so that you got the stables shut up before it got dark at four o'clock ain't it
mm in the winter time mm
see for the lights so you weren't allowed to put the lights on you see for the UNK
show the germans coming over you know see 'em now you didn't have no street lights did you
you didn't have no street lights
no
all treated all the same you see
mm
ah
did racing continue the same during the war
racing
oh yeah we UNK just the same even though we had to do it early so that some of them leave and we started at sometimes half past eleven
finished at half past two you see you know UNK it up like that
oh yes they got they got through everything alright pretty good
they're very good very good indeed
marvellous how it was run to tell you the truth
oh yes those horses come in horse boxes them days bit of luck instead of trains
they got them here you see for the races
they used to come a day or two beforehand you see so they could be settled down and then race
oh yes everything was it was very well run it was UNK very UNK it was
very UNK
but of course you didn't you didn't have the time to do a lot in the UNK light beat you
but you see you had to do as good as the same amount now you know
you only got the same amount of money end of the week
you didn't get no more
no it wasn't easy
talking of UNK the racing itself
have the UNK always been as they are today
or were they different in your childhood
no always the same
just the same as they are today
you know there were no difference in them only er as they go along now they're putting plastic rails up instead of being wooden you see 'em there
see so many accidents happen you see they're putting plastic up now
then when we're bump against it would just bends over you see
mhm
oh yeah that's the only difference they be doing every UNK like that
and you'll find in time th the UNK be made of this here special stuff what they're galloping on
on the heath a special stuff they gallop on you know
oh the all weather
yeah the all weather
UNK
yeah wh what we call the all weather gallop
mm
well some of the UNK gonna be made like that and it cost a fortune mind ya
i suppose newmarket will be first one to make two th they've got two courses here as it is you see
they'll do one experience on it you see
see how it goes and make it all the one meeting that have july course like we was all through the winter
all through the war with july course you know you see
you didn't have no racing on the first course
which is the first course
the first one
mm
as you go er the bottom one
then there's one half way up the cambridge road ain't there
what one's that
july course they call i they call that
see there's two UNK in newmarket
there's none in newmarket really
there's a there's erm let me see one two three there used to be one two four meetings in UNK wood and two in UNK
see the july course comes under UNK
yes
see and n the first course comes under UNK wood you call it
see
that's how they're so rich
there's UNK footpaths all over the heath you know where people can walk and they keep sticking sticks in the heath now but they knock 'em down
they can't stop 'em
they stick
well bits of sticks in
sticks in
you know so they don't make UNK for horses who jump over
see you can't stop the people walking on cos th it's a law you see
there's a UNK all UNK you see
so who puts the sticks in the ground
the heath men
they do
you know trying stop you from walking on the
ah
walking in the path
but you pull them out chuck 'em aside you see people do
th they don't take no notice of it
see there was a case a little while ago weren't there about farmer UNK up a p footpath you used to get on a UNK to walk across the field
then you used to get some they're all byelaws weren't there
ah in the end they fined him a lot of money and they had him can't stop the public you can't do that you can't
no
so people walk over the UNK do they
ah yeah you can't stop people

that's what i said
houses in them days if you worked on a p work on a place you had to live on a place you see if you got the sack you had to get out of 'em
nowhere for you to go was there
is it
today they can't do it
mm
if you'd got the sack
what
if you got the sack
yeah
would you have found it difficult to have got work at another stables
oh no
you wouldn't find it difficult
you wouldn't find it difficult
very seldom you heard of 'em getting the sack
very seldom
same as stud UNK you never heard much stud UNK getting the sack
or head man
see you th you got so controlled you knew the runs of the horses you knew the ways of your horses you knew the ways of your UNK and you change you got to start a role all over again
you see what i mean it
that's why they don't sack people like that
you keep er and blacksmiths that's why they own their own blacksmiths
well you see if you keep changing the blacksmiths about and they're altering horses feet all the time putting plates on putting shoes on you see it's a game of its own
it's one consistent game of its own
so a blacksmith then will
ah they all had their own blacksmith
you got one
you got one
one blacksmith does that yard they l or two do the yards now cos there's a lot of
then two do them between them
and the blacksmith is he an independent person
oh yes
the UNK is
well he can't interfere with him
all you do is you put on the list all will want UNK
or come and send for him h he what has to be in the yard the blacksmith has to look thirty to forty horses their blacksmith has to look round every one of them
he has about sixty here
every one of those horses he has to look round for fo all four feet up
that's two up that's two up at er two or three up at or
are they employed by
yes
that was on the place
oh i see he had his actual own
oh yes
blacksmiths
oh yeah
because there are also some independent blacksmiths
oh er oh yeah got his place well his men go round he had got two or three men in every yard he has
mhm
he's just died he has er he was head man of the lot of 'em
the head blacksmith of the lot
he was jockey club man in charge of them all oh yes
you couldn't come and you come UNK in here and say you were a blacksmith
you couldn't get started
oh no
so strict
so you have to be
you had to be UNK and serve your apprenticeship
and accepted by the jockey club
with everything yeah fo for a blacksmith today
what about in days gone by
what
what about in days gone by
days gone by
well you had to send miles for them didn't you er blacksmith
blacksmiths were the thing on the side of the road didn't he do all the UNK mend your wheels and all horse all iron wheels and things like that won't years ago and you had to send for him to come and do 'em w well he had men that he'd that he'd taught like boys apprentices
he they used to go out and do all the outside work for him
all the horses
yeah
oh yeah
blacksmiths started on the side of the road that's how blacksmiths started
who's gonna do all th them years ago was all horse and carts
mm
who was gonna UNK and the bicycles and everything like that
but in newmarket with the racing stables
oh there was always blacksmiths here
always blacksmiths
did they have their own blacksmiths then or would there be like in the town that went round
no they didn't have
they used to have some had their own blacksmiths
the honourable george like lord derby he had their own always did
they've shops up there now all got blacksmiths shop you see
every stable
we had you see everything UNK for the plates everything you wanna make
your UNK used to come longer than this UNK where you measure horses feet and you know measure 'em up
you know they measure across from heel to toe
mm
then across from there to there
from side to side
always do on a bed of wheat straw so you nip it off from where the you see and you know your measurement
yeah
oh yeah asking a man on this television the other night th the heath man
i don't know if you seen it or not
his name is
now how can you tell the one horse from another
well he said it would be by the markings
yes but he wouldn't get the markings unless he be through me
or somebody in the yard he was paying
and you had to get a bit of paper and you drew a straight line straight line see like that and if he had two white legs you put a cross two white see if he had a long one he had put a big cross if he had a long two long white leg if he had me behind you put a cross
if he had a white face you put a mark down that way see
so it's like marking the points out on a horse with crosses
yeah
mm
i'll show you before you go give you a bit of paper
yeah
wh where we used to mark 'em
and when they say what we call 'em UNK they were called then you know
UNK
on the heath
some people chase them away wouldn't let you see horses work and all that you know
oh these were people trying to find out what horses might win a ra
yeah
yeah be fit enough to win a race
race yeah
mm
very strict years ago very strict
they used to get up trees with glasses and look with everything they
would they
like UNK
oh very strict years ago
they wouldn't let you th see anything
oh no er that's the secret of er that was
oh yeah oh h have a good look
UNK mornings you used to gallop them in the fog the best gallop horses in the fog
see say you don't gonna gallop five fur you didn't gallop five UNK well they might think you're gonna finish five you only UNK 'em four
see pulled up
you done 'em all like that
ah
get up early in the mornings UNK take 'em out and gallop 'em take 'em back in
shut the gates
some of the men didn't know they'd been out exercising
ah i'm telling you the truth
that's where i served my time they didn't UNK
these UNK
what were they looking for
why the books report in the papers
they all had a paper the evening news the standard the star the sporting life ah all the papers wanted to know about the horses
so the tr the owners who owned them days you could read about them but they don't do it today cos the trainers ring them up and tell them how they're going don't they
so when you put these markings on your piece of paper
yeah
they paid you for it they had to pay to pay
who paid you for doing that
wanted them on the heath
what the heath men or the UNK
UNK
ow
UNK
of course yo you don't go tell him it don't come on there does it
cos you can live down there you know you're doing this you see
but that's how they used to know
oh yeah
al any mark or a white spot on them all tricks of the trade
if the lads had any brains th the UNK used to say UNK they in the yard got any yes get the markings for us you see
they used take them and give them a drink
really
but then most of them relied on the head men we used to tell them you see to keep their mouth shut
so that when we UNK them they didn't know see mm years ago they were very particular an another man didn't li say i had horses and you had horses i wouldn't like my horses galloping with yours
see my meaning
mm
and th i wouldn't want yours galloping with mine
you understand
mm
so you had to be UNK so that your owners help one another
yes
get my meaning
so
oh yeah they don't stand for that today you know
galloping one UNK horse with another
oh no
UNK you'd be surprised
oh it ain't all ain't all UNK it's a bit secret on some things you know
owners don't know everything
if they see their horses done
you shoot me when you have a read of that
no
giving secrets away
oh yeah very UNK oh yeah they didn't like it
they used to ring one another up owners and they know one another in the yard
oh definitely they don't mind helping one another
see
mhm
that's why lord wouldn't have to give all that money
what was it ninety odd ninety five thousand pound
won last week at somewhere UNK wasn't last week to lead slip anchor
to lead him work instead of borrowing other people's in the yard
to lead him
to lead the horse
yes you have to have a lead horse in work
in front of your good ones
what so you can pace be UNK by it you mean
yeah
he's doing this horse now UNK boy he's leading him now
oh yeah
that's why we slip anchor won so far he wasn't from here to cross the road
mhm
see cos he had this lead horse you horses jumped off
made off couldn't catch him
that's what this UNK do
you see
see him far up ahead
they'll be coming down here saying thank you what's the date today
oh first of may tomorrow yeah no friday
friday
about the twenty ninth today
well you can always say i missed UNK till the end of april
they tell me he'll win the derby
yeah
going well he is i tell you
is he
i think th i think the UNK will win the one thousand tomorrow and er will ride the winner of the two thousand different to me or something it's called
i don't think UNK stay myself
different people different opinions that's my opinion
mm
that's all i know
so what would race days be like in
race days
years ago
oh they stayed just the same as they are today yo you carried on just the same only the difference in them now race days years ago the heath was shut at half past nine
you couldn't go on the heath and train horses up after half past nine
you understand not this side
mm
race people race days you see people come to their races and put their UNK and things up
and you all had to go over that side
over the bury side
over bury side where you come down that hill
yeah
they always worked over that and around there
the other places look across the heath as you come up the road anywhere but not on this side
half past nine they finish
same as the UNK they are today
there's a certain gallop on the UNK shut at half past nine
if it's not shut at half past nine it don't open till half past nine
you understand
mhm
it don't open till all the people have used the short UNK
see cos you have to cross over 'em
you have to start at the top of the town that way and go down over down and come round like that finish off start down norwich road and come up bury road
so that's how far round it was
i suppose a mile and three quarters i think
and one red house to the top of the lights traffic lights
from one side of the road up the other
that's how it used to be years ago
of course i co couldn't tell you now the different ways they do what they like now
that's all i can hear about
allowed to gallop his horses across the heath er and all this rot
terrible
did erm on race days how did they organize the races
when you were a young lad
organize well they organize theirselves
the jockeys
that's me it's all right it's my microphone
that's erm nothing to do with us the jockey club do all that
th they organized all the races
all we got to do is enter the horses in you get a paper called the calendar
when you have that calendar sent you it's a lot of money now
it used to be three and sixpence i think it is about five pounds now
well you look through it and every race meeting that's on there probably five or six weeks
and you look through every horse wherever you want to put your horse in them races are in that calendar and you pick your race out put your horse in pay your UNK
then you have to pay another UNK if you leave him in
understand
pay another UNK if you leave him
UNK
you pay a UNK to put him in that race
see if you want him to stop in it you gotta keep paying the UNK all the time th them weeks that go by
same as years ago
i don't know i don't think it's altered now years ago you had to enter your y derby horse
you had to enter them as UNK and then when you entered them it cost you fifty pounds to enter them and it cost you fifty pounds for every quarter of that lifetime of that foal
so you run in the derby
why did you have to enter them as UNK
oh i don't know that was their idea years ago
but i think it's changed
just
but i think it's changing now i don't know
i been out it a long while now
did the UNK used to be busy
what
busy you couldn't get through the streets for UNK and UNK in them days
UNK and all lined up outside the white UNK jockey club rooms
all lined up the street
UNK you used to jump in and drive them up the road cos there were no motor cars
oh no there weren't motor cars out for years called them UNK you know
you used to meet in the avenue meet in the high street
what UNK
meet at the station
used to be UNK from the station
at station UNK
ooh all sorts heath carts donkey carts everything
so there was quite a bit of business in newmarket for anyone who
oh the pictures it's a pity i haven't got some
i ain't got some of the old pictures for ya
but it was a very good very good in the old days
they sold horses outside the jockey club room years ago
sold them
sold them yeah
a man used to stand on no not them gates was there years ago there was a wall there
see be on a block standing on the block
you used to run your horses up and down outside there and they used to sell them
what UNK
yeah anything and anything
you sell everything
anything
they sell anything
up and down that's what they used to do
when was this
oh this is the old fashion years ago
there's photographs of some people i wish i could get them 'em
marvellous
the things that used to go on in newmarket
ah god yes
was that this century
ah
this century
oh yes
ah yes of course it was
yes
what before the
about when you worked at er
yes
well where i was born in needham market
mm
need i say where because i can't day
i don't
oh i see
the people to know
you was born here then
i was
ah right well let's say you were born in the house you live in
well you could say
without act without actually saying where it was
that's right yes
you don't often get that nowadays
no you don't because er i naturally i went away to work but er i was born here and er you see and wh what else did you want
where were you born because you must be one of the oldest residents in needham
yes i was born in this house but er i don't wish people to know er because er this is a funny world i don't know whether that's being recorded i expect
yes it will all be UNK that will go down on
because er well i er i as i and i've got young neighbours who i very seldom see because they are out at work er therefore i am quiet and that's how i like to be
yes
an
er erm well i mean we live in a strange world
mm
it's all very different to when i was young
yes
what did your father do
oh my father was a UNK
really
yes and he worked in the high street and er he what would you say suppose that's the proper word
he lived down UNK lane with his two sisters he was a single man you see and my father and mother lived here and my they not only UNK shoes but they made them and er course naturally you know well of course needham wasn't as big as it is now but they made them for the best people if that if that's the right not the right expression say but er but you know what i mean er and er and he you know all his life you see he did that and then one day he had a shock because his er what would you call him colleague he died suddenly in the night
so my father said what shall i do
i said well just carry on and so he used this er workshop at the back
the black and there was all UNK drawn and everything and we had a big table in there and he just carried on he didn't make shoes and he died when he was er well he had a bad stroke and he was in the other room for seven years
you see they didn't do things then that they would have done today you see seven years and you see i at that time well i used to used to have a day off and instead of having a half day a week we used to have full day a fortnight and so of course on my day off i came home to see what i can do to help you see and er my mother died
my father died in nineteen forty six and my mother died in nineteen fifty seven
well my husband and i were married in nineteen forty four you see and er as you see i go every year and it's nineteen eighty six so therefore erm i you see i don't really want people to know my age
mm
you see because living here like this and er i mean i mean only yesterday i heard of an people burst in the door and this old lady on the head and where's your money and that sort of thing you know so it it's really terrible
mm
it's a lovely world beautiful world but it's the people in it you see who are UNK things so much and i don't understand youngsters you see but because young people erm there was a time when youngsters just er do just as they like and they weren't UNK by the parents whereas my parents were very strict you see and it didn't do me any harm and i'm glad now that they were
we were brought up nicely to go with my father who used to sing in the church choir
they haven't one now
well i was sent to the erm united well it wasn't a united reform church then but it was called the chapel and i was sent to there to sunday school there mornings and afternoon and we went two by two across to the chapel you see so while my father we used to walk down the street together
he went to church and i went to the chapel you see
so he sang in the c of e church of england
oh yes and there were eight choir men you see well no choir at all there hadn't been for years you see so er and i had a photograph somewhere of my father with eight choir men you see and er well after that
did they have a did they have a band or anything in the church or did they sing without music
er well they've got a UNK organ there and er oh someone plays the organ yes
an old gentleman from UNK his name's mr i'm sure it was because er you see my father and i used to go up UNK road sometimes after church or chapel and er and go for a walk up there and used to meet this mr who played the organ UNK and very course but erm but i had a wonderful life really
mm
and then as i say when i was sixteen well erm when i left needham school you see i passed through
i missed several classes because they put me up in for instance i when i came up from the infants to the big school i missed the first standard and they put me into standard two and i went from two three four five six seven and seven and i was only eleven you see so i did pretty well and then the headmaster came to my parents and said why don't you let her go in for a scholarship to UNK secondary and so i went in for that and er there was one other girl went as well there were two of us and erm and of course we only heard during the summer break and er we passed
now this other girl came down one saturday morning and we had a letter to say that i'd passed and i said well so have i
we did so hope that we'd both pass you see because you know been terrible
how old were you when you passed that scholarship
well i was eleven but by the time but i had a birthday you see er in the summer and er well august actually and so when i started at UNK i was twelve you see and er and er i was at UNK school and scholarship for four years and er well i don't know whether i really liked school did you
bits of it not all of it
no that's right as i say but erm anyway then after that when i left at say sixteen you see er a friend of ours who was a railway clerk at needham station came and told us that they were taking on girls on the railway company and would i like to do it and so of course i had to pass exams and er actually can i read some notes that
yes
oh this er when i said er i was just looking through again because last night i sat up late writing these
and then i got in a UNK and i was so tired i was because it's my eyes you see
mm
i can't see very well
yes and of course i can't see anything at all without my UNK glass
without your
yes i know i'll read this first page
mm
and erm i put after leaving needham market school i won a scholarship to UNK secondary school for four years
then i was told that girls were being taken on the railways so i had to go to ipswich and take two more exams and started work as a booking clerk at needham station when i was sixteen
i learned how to use the single needle telegraph instrument
well now i don't know whether you know anything about that but it's a make words
UNK code is it
oh yes er yes code yes then i had to learn that
and er you see and i can still do it because i know n d n d n d and they keep answering that
i know it's i knew it was needham station and it was between station to station you see not er anything to do with the public but that's where i learnt so we used to er take er messages from station to station and i used to speak to the girl at UNK down the line
she was also the UNK daughter you see and we used to talk to each other telephone you see and erm well that's as far as i've got now
i hope you're finding it
this is just what i want to hear
oh well yes well of course er i kn i know about take two more exams and er i know the second one was mental arithmetic
mental arithmetic and reading and i also had er take an eye test because they said if there was a train accident and i couldn't see the signal whether it was red or green or whatever you see you never know
so i had to take an eye test i remember
erm and er oh yes er no wait a minute i had and take two and started work as a booking clerk i've said that before at needham station when i was sixteen
i learned how to use the single needle UNK instrument sending and taking messages from station to station
issuing tickets and taking in parcels
the parcel door was the other end of the office you see and er oh i loved it i loved the work i really did
i took early and late turns with the chief clerk you see and er well there were two lads who did a middle turn but i needn't mention that but they did a sort of nine to six you see
mm and you would do which turns would you do
you'd be early and late
early and late
how early
seven o'clock in the morning at seven o'clock till four i think it was and then er it would be two till ten you see but the UNK was always about just in case i was late er you know not there by seven
to book out the seven ten train
so he was always there and such a kind man he was and er yes chief clerk
the clerk whose job i took went on the district as a relief clerk and later relief UNK
i am talking about during the first world war you see
i was there until the end of the first war what some people called the great war anyway the first war that'd be ni and i was there until nineteen
well it was over in nineteen eighteen
however i stayed a bit longer and when all the girls all of us had three months' notice to leave it was dreadful you see because we were fully trained by that time you see
but er course i'm talking i'm forgetting all this is being recorded
it's alright don't worry about it
oh you'll sort it out later on
yes we'll sort it out don't worry
yes and the girls had three months' notice to leave and on the last day at three months i heard that a young lady had left the post office
i went to see the UNK and she said i've known you all my life so start work on monday morning because you see it was so quick and i hadn't got my references back from the railway company but that's what she said er i can start work on monday morning
i enjoyed the work issuing dog licences gun licences and old age pensions and of course stamps
when did the old age pension come in
well i can't remember but my parents got it but when it first came in i can't remember the year but
no
i was too young but it was about five shillings a week
is that all it was
was that for a couple or single
no i think i think they got ten shillings between them
if i remember rightly
yes
but i can't
i have no idea of the date when it started but erm and of course it er anyway it's better now thank goodness
erm whilst there i learn how to use another sort of telegraph instrument
when i was at the post office
er taking off and sending UNK you see erm then i was told that the railway company wer were taking girls on again so i applied and i had to go to ipswich to pass two more exams you see and er and started work and the in the catering manager's office at ipswich station as a clerk doing typing and general office work as the manager had to go on the district
every day to the ten UNK rooms
so he was starting at chelmsford UNK marks UNK colchester ipswich erm bury st UNK newmarket er down so far UNK and er there were ten altogether
so what do y you prepare helped prepare the food for all the trains
oh no i didn't do any cooking
you didn't
i was just in the office
aha
i was just in the office typing and er and general office work and while he went on the district you see
there was only the i was going to say but when they had w oh when i was in the i went to evening classes to learn UNK shorthand
erm i was at ipswich station for ten years
mm
you see
now when they were busy and had important people in our dining room at ipswich there was one there were two UNK
er one and another one who did who was a UNK but part time when they had somebody important in which i think i've put down here that one's finished with
but did that be for the staff catering
would that be the that you are talking about the canteen for staff
erm well
dining room
the dining room oh yes the dining room i was
that would be for the staff railway staff
mm
oh no every er ordinary customers
oh i see
oh i see actually it was actually at the station
oh yes
different now when it where it's just a cafe isn't it
i don't know i haven't been up for years
you don't i mean they don't have proper dining rooms at all
don't they
no
oh
no that's why i was wondering
oh goodness
there isn't at the station for the customers
yes
just like rolls now and a cup of tea
oh my word how it's gone down
well what sort of meals did you have to provide
well i can tell you
i've written it all down
oh really oh good
yes i you see in those days it was quite different
yes
you see er what it's like now it was a large adjoining the large room what they call the you see and over the over the other across the line to the railway line there was another place called the down bar and the tea room UNK
i don't know whether they're open
no
not there
no nothing like that there
i can't believe it you see i thought things were still as they were
no they're not
i think you'd find it hard to recognize the old railway station now
well every you know erm i can remember the time er when i first went and they used to have silver er UNK of course silver UNK water UNK on the counter and silver UNK sugar bowls with UNK and loaf sugar for people to use and of course well and when you see the war came along you see they were all taken away because you see we had UNK trains we were up day and night so the troops with tea
you'd get a message from the r t o the er railway transport office to say supply three hundred and sixty cups of tea at such and such a time and then of course the troops would the train would start the troops pour out and pour into our place and there we were UNK around
i used to help of course and we were up day and night
i've got a photograph somewhere where we had this UNK table er on the platform and if you were the tea and of course the men had to stay o overtime they didn't get paid for it and we it was a seven day week for us we were never paid for sunday
it was seven days a week
we had every other sunday off you see but otherwise we worked and didn't get any extra for it but of course the girls like myself well erm we couldn't lift these huge UNK of tea so they had two men keep them on you see and er and we were er perhaps i know one day we didn't finish until five o'clock in the morning
and we'd been up all night serving troops and er you see and then the manager said well look er now and have some breakfast before we get th another UNK and we were next door to the UNK office you see and when the erm war during the war you see the man would come out of the telegraph office and he would say er and er you see all the lights went out except a few lights along the back of the counter
then he'd come red and you'd know that a erm a bombing raid was UNK you see and er when i look back you know but as i say everything has changed so much
now that you're talking about all the troops coming through
was it ipswich station
yes
and yet when is it when were you working there because i thought you said you'd finished
you worked at needham during the war and then went to ipswich
ah yes well we after i left needham then i went to the post office for a year
yeah
which i told you
yeah
but you see erm well i wanted to get on
yes
and i thought i can be here until i'm ninety you know
yes and not get anywhere
that's it
mm
and so when i heard about taking on girls again on the railway
but they were still getting troops and bomb bombing raids
oh yeah well it was during the nineteen fourteen eighteen war
oh yes you see they i mean
but i think that you were working then at ipswich i thought you were just at needham
er ye well er it was when no let me think i went to ipswich i did a till the first war ended
i see what you mean
mm
well and i went to ipswich well it must have been just after the war then
mm
but you see er yes that's right and then of course i'm since then i was up at cambridge and that was during the second year
yeah
you see so yeah and er we used to have as i say er well for instance i've been up in the office
if they had important people like er such as mark and his wife the UNK erm you've heard of him of course
well he they were on their way to norwich but they stopped off at ipswich for a lunch you see and er i had i looked after them so that it shouldn't interrupt the other girls behind the counter or the UNK who was looking after his regular customers in the dining room you see er and so i used to erm and once i had i remember there was six black doctors came in and er and i was glad because it was nice to move about and instead of sticking in the office typing and then going out all alone you see while the manager was on the district you see i liked it and er anyway that was a long time ago
yes
so in the wa in the dining room they had UNK as well
oh yes
they had er his name was jimmy they had er well one used t one old gentleman used to be a yes and his name was jimmy the UNK that's right i get a i have to think because i sometimes get mixed up and i'm at cambridge and you see it was a long time ago you see so since i was young and i was then
well i can tell you i went to cambridge er on er the twenty eighth of december nineteen thirty one
well that's fifty how long well i daren't think
mm
fifty years ago
yeah
you see and
oh
that's a long time
yes
i'm sure you don't want to hear all this
i'm really interested about ipswich station just cos it's so different now
yes
that they used to have UNK and tables with silver UNK silver
oh yes
and UNK
er no they didn't have UNK no er in the dining room of course
yeah in the dining room
oh yes but not in the ordinary er there was a huge place where you could put tables all round the tables you see and er it was a and er i liked it i when they were busy you see i used to especially if they had an order for these hundreds of cups of tea er you see i used to go down and give a hand then i used to like it you see somebody would give a shout and i would come down from the office and left them anyway and then er i heard of this job
i thought well after ten years i thought well i want i still want to get on and erm so i heard of this job down at cambridge station as assistant UNK at the UNK rooms you see and er it wasn't quite the same because er at ipswich you see although the catering manager's office er my work was office work and typing you know general thing and er because he was away most of the day most days because of er the ten stations er from stretching as i say from chelmsford UNK marks UNK colchester and er i think it was UNK and er and UNK and er i think i don't know UNK and ipswich of course and er then er bury st UNK and that's it and i am not sure whether you went to newmarket or whether to ca whether to cambridge now newmarket but er you see so the days went on and we worked every other sunday and of course i know things were a lot cheaper then but you see the pay wasn't very good
no how much would you have earned
well because i was in the office i got a pound a week you see and the do you know the UNK there who she was the UNK then sorry i've got a photograph and she said that when she was UNK at colchester and she only got fifteen shillings a week
i and the girls that's all they got fifteen shillings because i was in the office i got a pound and mind you we slept in we had all our food you see and we had to all sleep in
where at the actual
on the station
on the station at ipswich station
on the station
they have rooms
oh yes upstairs they're still there i expect i don't know
goodness
we slept there you see
so what you had your own room and
well no i had to share a room with a with a i think there were five beds
four other girls that's right and of course there were UNK there to do the work and er yes UNK and er and er you know and in the in the kitchen you see there was the UNK and er a cook the kitchen maid and er a young man a boy well just left school to scrub the tables down and do the floors and that sort of thing and er and whi and er while i of course i had to go down every day to type to see what the UNK said what was on the menu and type it type out the menus you see that was one of my jobs and er and if let me think yes there was quite a number of staff that's just in the kitchen
mm
you see and ther i su i suppose there was about ten or a dozen girls behind the counter because it was early and late turn for them because you see we were open you see until ten o'clock at night you see and er then well anyway after that erm i heard about this job going as assistant UNK at cambridge and er so i applied and the manager said to me i thought well i'll be here ten years erm i can be here until i'm you know UNK years and er so he said well look you may not get a job because he said that another girl coming from norwich to go to cambridge to see the manager as well as you and so you might not get it she might get it and however i went and er i met the manager and the UNK in the front office the manager's office and we all had a chat but i didn't see the girl from norwich she must have gone some other day and anyway i got the job you see and er and so i went to cambridge as assistant UNK and i very well and i got to know all kinds of people all UNK being a university city
well it was a town then but since then it's been made a city you see and i got to know all kinds of people and one gentleman came in there used to come every evening and write a book and er i used to look after him if i happened to be that end and er you see and then he'd say oh just an exchange you know about the weather and just in general thing and then i'd leave him and he'd get on with his writing and one day he said to me
when i've finished this book and it's published i'll give you one he said you won't understand anything about it because it's all about electronics and UNK but he said never mind and he did and it's up on that shelf er i've still got it
yes and
never read it
well er it's all on well i couldn't understand it he said but he said i'll give you one because he said after all i wrote it here didn't i
you see he was exceptionally nice and he used to lecture at the colleges and er he was a real very nice gentleman and er and so he of course he took his drink across to the table with him and sometimes i took it for him it just depend and he wrote this book and er i forget now perhaps you would like to read and see what he says
the second book down it's with a UNK coloured book
that one yes
UNK technical electricity by samuel
yes
to miss UNK
that was my name i married
with UNK and kind regards robert samuel
yes
this was nineteen thirty eight
oh well there you are
amazing
see how i've saved it all those years
yes
you see yes
extraordinary
it is isn't it
yes
yes he gave me one
yes i thought you know when i retired and left cambridge i ought to bring that with me you see
oh yes
and of course as i say being at cambridge there was a little theatre there and er we used to see so many of the actors and UNK that used to come into our lives you see because there were five places on the station for instance there was the tea room adjoining the there was a large UNK large UNK one girl in there you see and er there was then there was this large which is the biggest and then the dining room that you see and er so and one year i wrote it down but erm one year i remember we took forty four thousand pounds which was a lot of money and er you see well er i got on very well with the girls
and you ran all this
you were in charge of all this
no not till the UNK i was just going to tell you about that
the UNK there erm i was there and she i after i'd been there eighteen months she had a heart attack and the girl took up her tea tray one of the girls took up her because she wasn't on duty till about just quarter to six to do the money
it was my job to go to all these various places and collect the money and take the numbers on the till and collect the money and put it in a bag put it in the safe
that was my work then when she came down on duty she would sit one side of the table with her books and i would sit the other and count all the money you see then i would take this money er in a bag through on to the black through the past the ticket collector and take it to the booking office and they took it from me and took it when they took their money to the bank you see
well do you know sometimes i'd taken it through and perhaps a train would come in a london train would come in and people were UNK through
we never thought anything about being mugged in those days you see and er and th that's what happened as i say so we took lots and lots of money
you see and er
so you were a sort of assistant UNK
yes but you see at this time the girl took up her tea tray and when she took she knocked on the door and when she opened the door the UNK was lying on the floor
UNK at the mouth she'd had a heart attack
well of course she came running to me you see and we immediately phoned for the doctor you see but however and i said look phone for the doctor i said and then i said go across to the railway police just across the yard and i asked one of them to come to me and i said i will go up with her and be with her until the doctor arrived er he was with her the police sergeant when she died
there was me as well you see and there was nothing we could do and er she'd had this erm it was awful they took her to the UNK because some of the girls you see erm you know they went UNK and er i'm not gonna pass her door that sort of thing
er you know well of course they were young girls and er you see and there's there was nothing we could do you see and er anyway the doctor as soon as the doctor did come it was because th the young staff er they had to they took her away to the UNK you see and erm then i had to carry on with her work and do the best i could and mine as well you see but of course er the manager he appointed another assistant manager to go and collect the money which i used to do got it in because i took her times of duty as well and er you see and then after that er after several weeks i suppose it was i don't know how many because i forget how many that they appointed me as UNK and i was in that position for twelve years you see and
until you retired
until i re and well until my husband retired at sixty and i thought well if he's going to retire at sixty i might as well retire you see
so when was that
so that
er that would be oh well he was a he was a railway clerk er on the station
at cambridge is that where you met him
yes that's where i met him
yes
he used to come into our place and erm and er i always knew when he was g every night UNK rain snow whatever he was there you see and he used to have his pint of bitter no more or no less and er you see and all his friends there were six of them
all UNK stood along the counter you see and er they were all good friends and though some of them had retired one had retired and we well there most of them had retired because er my husband was fifteen years older than me and er yes anyway erm he retired let me see we married er when i was forty four you see and erm he would then be well no yes he'd be just fifty nine you see but nevertheless we had thirty two years very happily married and so when he died he was ninety one
yes and he was buried up at UNK you see
he was UNK and buried up at UNK in my parents' grave and that's what's going to happen to me you see i will be UNK because erm you know they make a sort of well and take off the top stone and the UNK and things and er and then the UNK go in the and so in a UNK don't they and you see and so we shall
all be together
be together
you see
yes
in my parents' grave
so when you retired you came to live here was that it
well yes and er so after that you see when he retired at sixty
mind you he was this is my husband
oh i thought that might be him yes
there isn't he UNK
yes
now he was a oh he was seventy one when that was taken
he doesn't look it
no
i mean he could be in his fifties
oh yeah he doesn't look it
he's a very young
picture of me when i was younger
oh yes
but i forget how old i was
but he was really UNK
yes
and so
he was
so quiet and so well respected he was so kind you see and so i'm grateful and of course before i married you see i we used to have three passes
i had three a year and of course in between times you go we had quarter fare if we want to go anywhere you see and er of course it was the old money in those days and i would come from ipswich to see my parents here for sixpence UNK then and er you see i used to go on holiday alone
now really as far as you're concerned er i could tell you a lot about our holidays we had
that's amazing that you went on holiday alone because surely you would have done much
well you know i wouldn't do it now
no
i wouldn't do it now because i ever since that woman was on the train was UNK and thrown out i wouldn't go alone on holidays now but in those days well maybe i was a lot course i was younger then but you never heard of such things
but yo it sounds as if you were a very independent person
oh i was
yes
oh i was and i used to go and the first place i went to let me think it was UNK
i wanted to go to scotland and i remember i came to say goodbye to my parents and that was in the evening and i went by train to liverpool street and it was pouring with rain and i had to make my way i had a taxi across to UNK you see and er and i went up th the left side of the country see past carlisle and then across and across and then and to UNK er to UNK you see
how do you spell that i can't think of the name
UNK
yes
er it's er d u n double o n isn't it
oh yes of course it is a scottish place
oh yes it's in scotland you see and whilst there you see every day er because a lady laughed at me and she said she was staying in the same hotel and she said er i used to book up in advance of course but never took a chance
i used to book up in advance and i thought oh go to UNK you see and er i got a free pass so i went and erm she said talk about a holiday she said you soon you've had your breakfast you're off
i said well that's what i came for
so what did you do when you
up and down the UNK
yes
up and down different ones different loch and er you could see UNK castle in the distance we er after we married we went to UNK castle went over it
how old were you when you went first went to UNK then
oh goodness well
you must have been in about in your mid twenties
er well i started going for a holiday by myself when i was about er
what
when i was sixteen because it's then i started to get these free passes and i had a sister then who lived at UNK and i had never been across london so the next door neighbour came with me to see me across london er because i was so young you see and i said right as long as you show me across london i can come back alone you see and so i came back alone and i that's when i started so from sixteen and er and as i say i went to cambridge in the nineteen thirty one it was the last day of well say nineteen thirty two you see and also in the twenties i was going on holiday alone and i went to once er to the isle of man and when i was er i sat next well being by myself you see they put me in to a little table near the wall
i booked up in advance of course
they put me by a table er near the wall but it for a table for two and then another lady came by herself i remember her name was miss and erm and she said have you been here before
i said no and she said oh i have lots of times i only live at manchester you see and of course you had to go by boat you see and i caught the boat train from ipswich at eight o'clock in the morning and i got to manchester at lunchtime about one and then went on to liverpool and the train there took us almost down to the docks
well of course when i went to the isle of man see i went on the boat and er you see and er it only cost me UNK for a landing er for the landing stage
i had to save UNK because i had these free passes
three a year which was very nice and er oh well whilst i was there you see erm i landed up in peel because i was going on a and she said to me one day this miss er what are you doing today
and i said er well i'm going on a coach trip to UNK around the island and she said may i come with you
i said of course and i said it would be nice company and so she said er you sit near the window i've seen it lots of times before as i only live in manchester
so she ca the two of us went together
well we went off we got off at peel which was the other side as you know and there was peel castle right on the hill there and erm well after and she said we won't go to these sea front UNK well i know a nice restaurant she said up that road and she said just turn to the right and there we are see
she said may i come with you
i said of course
i said it will be nice company and so she said er you sit near the window i've seen it lots of times before as i only live in manchester so she t well the two of us went together
well we went off and got off at peel which was the other with the all UNK up and she said the chemist advised me to go to the police and er so she said that's why i've been a long time because i've been to the police and reported it
he said it's happened before and he advised her to go to the police and er so he said er when and the police st told her when you come back we'll have all this typed out i and she came back all with a UNK all UNK up and she said the chemist advised me to go to the police and er so she said that's why i've been a long time because i've been to the police and reported it
he said it's happened before and he advised her to go to the police and er so he said er when and the police told her when you come back we'll have all this typed out your statement but we'll need you to sign so tell the coach driver to stay at stop at the police station for you to sign it and i said to her how did you manage to stop that boy
oh well she said you see it's my work she said i work in a in an insurance office and she said i'm in and out the courts all the time you see so he knocked down the wrong person
yes
yes
well anyway er you see and well anyway er so when that night and we were by coach of course bus went there by bus and so that night she said to me what are you doing when in the bus she said what are you doing this evening
well i said i think i'll go to the theatre and off i went to the theatre
i was rather late back when i got back i heard a knock on my bedroom door and she said it's miss and er i said oh come in i UNK the door and she came in and er and so she said to me er i just had a telephone message from peel er to say that you have been UNK to go the police court next thursday and i said what a day out of my holiday and she said well i'm sorry but you'll have to go
yes
so the two of us went off to peel and er anyway they paid us they paid for our lunch and er and so that was alright and of course i had to go in the witness box you see and swear on the bible you know the whole truth nothing but the truth you see
i was a witness and so on you see and down below and the sergeant said to me the sergeant came up and said to me you'll have to be careful because he said that boy he was sitting there with his mother poor woman all in black and er the em the boy's employer had got a solicitor on his behalf you see and i said well i can only speak through and say what happened that's all i can do and er so of course when i went into the witness box this man came and er asked me all sorts of questions
where why didn't you walk on the pavement on the path
i said there wasn't one you see and er he said er so you were walking were you arm in arm
i said certainly not
so he said are you two friends
i said no we're not friends but we're friendly if you know what i mean
we're staying at the same hotel and sharing the same table you see
he said oh
so erm then er oh he asked me other questions
so he said you were on the right and this lady was on the left near the UNK side
i said that's right it's and there was a narrow road yes
so he said erm well in that case he said erm you were walking together but not arm in arm

congress it gives me great pleasure to declare congress open
this in fact is the first time that the g m b has held its conference in portsmouth
we're absolutely delighted to be here not least because we have membership throughout the spread of portsmouth in the various different industries which we as a union represent the naval UNK the utilities energy water gas electricity and many other industries including the
so we're delighted to bring our conference to support our members in portsmouth
equally colleagues we're delighted to be here not least because the labour party has made significant UNK into portsmouth
and with now fourteen labour councillors as opposed to seventeen tories and a few UNK the labour party in manchester in sorry in portsmouth
well in manchester as well
will soon join their colleagues on the south coast in southampton and gain power in portsmouth

colleagues for the benefit of first time delegates this is going to be the running order of business for the week the final agenda this includes the rule amendment motions the general motions the standing orders committee guideline for congress business and the standing orders committee first report which we will come to later this mor this morning
and then in addition there are the thirty one composite motions that regions have agreed since the pre congress UNK meetings and finally an index to the general motions so that's very much an explanation for the benefit of first time delegates to congress
can we now proceed to welcome the deputy mayor to ask him to give us a civic welcome
can i introduce and welcome the deputy lord mayor of the city of portsmouth councillor jim
jim was born in UNK and comes from a farming stroke dairy background

mr chairman er i'd like to thank you for those nice words of introduction but i am particularly delighted as i am a UNK member of the g m b of almost thirty five years' standing due to my employment with british gas and my long membership with the labour party
the g m b annual conference is the supreme policy making body within the union all members branches officers and sections national committees and conferences are subject to its authority
i know the congress considers and determines all questions of policy affecting the general industry political or social welfare of membership and attracts around two thousand five hundred delegates visitors and guests
this includes leading british and european politicians representatives of foreign UNK in the united kingdom international trade union leaders senior UNK and employers
the g m b is widely UNK to be the most progressive british trade union and is regarded as a key opinion former of all matters of industrial and economic and social policies
the g m b's influence in the british labour movement and congress also provides a sounding board for the views of the political nature which can have a significant impact on the direction of the labour party
mr president portsmouth is a thriving UNK city with much to be proud of we have many supreme attractions victory mary rose and UNK amongst others which i hope you will have a chance to visit some time during your stay here in portsmouth
our UNK port which opened in nineteen seventy six is now the second largest UNK port on the south coast and it is city owned UNK profit they are UNK back into our city
we are very proud to be the home of the royal navy even though we have suffered tremendously from the defence cuts
we are confident that we can overcome these difficulties by encouraging diversification within our local industries
we are delighted to have you here you are most welcome we do hope you will enjoy yourself so much you will return as UNK as soon as you can to perhaps take advantage of our UNK port links with UNK and now UNK in spain

colleagues can i now take er a moment of your time and it gives me very great pleasure to call upon the president to deliver his address to congress
your president dick
thank you very much er conference and indeed it gives me great pleasure to address you this morning
you may recall delegates who were at congress last year that i spoke about governments having the moral support of the people
not just having a majority in parliament to UNK you and that was being described at that particular time by the tory government that their majority would be adequate they had a majority of twenty one
but much has happened in that short fourteen months since the general election
and we said that people would realize the mistake in voting tory and haven't they
manufacture industry barely surviving thousands of job losses a public service borrowing requirement at a UNK fifty billion pounds black wednesday UNK government climb downs u turns UNK on maastricht the mines education railway privatization v a t on heating bills
the country effectively run by fourteen tory UNK a prime minister who was told by his party and has been told by his by the country consistently to get rid of a chancellor who is totally and utterly incompetent
and after losing all but one of the UNK counties and a major by election defeat sacks his chancellor and then effectively UNK to number two in the government the person who wants his job
and the right wing of the tory party in open UNK
a government clearly that is split both politically and is totally incompetent the government's majority is now down to eighteen and all the predictions are that within a few weeks it will be down to seventeen
it will be amazing if this government runs the full course and as we saw in nineteen nineties the tories just love leadership elections putting the knife in
what they don't like is turning up at the house of commons and having to do some work because they can't stand the pressure
the UNK that UNK of left wing thinking commissioned an UNK to estimate the likely number of vacancies during a parliament ten point seven three sorry to be precise about this colleagues tory mps can be expected to die over a full five year term i'm sorry for being UNK
UNK is now a habit that could become UNK
i suppose on both there is such a thing as divine UNK there is as much chance of major holding the tories together as manchester city winning the UNK league
in britain unlike many parliamentary UNK in the world we have an opposition that is actually paid to oppose the government of the day i think
last year this union held a ballot and a hundred and forty thousand members took part in that ballot for the leader of the labour party and they made it absolutely clear to the executive that as far as they were concerned they wanted a part and a say in who was the leader of the labour party and they di decided UNK
for the last six months the momentum has grown we've been UNK to by ex leaders of the party by ex parliamentary stars by give us a meal roy by UNK by the wagon load telling us how we should be UNK
and how they should be no longer UNK to ordinary working people they know best they will decide their political record is far from impressive lost four general elections the last one was on their agenda
you remember it the UNK no trade union involvement involved keep out of it boys we'll deal with it
on the UNK in UNK in newcastle in birmingham in nottingham there wasn't a mention by of the trade union movement
it was not a trade union agenda
and there was no public UNK
we do indeed have the right to ask who really are our friends
amongst the activists in branch at branch and constituency level there is much speculation about the parliamentary UNK desire to br bring in one member one vote
o m o v you can't buy it at the chemist it isn't a new type of bread for some religious festival it's not a new cleaning UNK o m o v what is o m o v
it UNK the franchise of those entitled to vote in the labour party because the fact of the matter is the labour party membership is declining
so all these people who lecture to us about democracy should really examine the situation it's got nothing to do with democracy whatsoever when less people are entitled to have a say
do they want to float free UNK to no one and free to trade with other political parties of political power in exchange for new voting systems which have absolutely no credibility with us and absolutely have no credibility with the british people cos they don't want it
we stand for a de democratic party but we will not allow a bunch of politicians to UNK this party
the fundamental issue is this that if the labour party is to remain a party of labour it must have as an integral part the trade union movement it's as simple as that colleagues
and for those who want to propose alternative UNK links for the good of their own UNK whether they be members of parliament or full time officers of other trade unions they do this movement no credit or good whatsoever
for those who cannot maintain who cannot support the maintenance of the links of the trade union movement party we say this start packing your bags there's the door we'll stick around
instead of shooting ourselves in the foot our people are asking where does the fi fight start
against the worst and most incompetent government in living memory
the UNK workers in dundee left without any legal protection whatsoever and is this a UNK for what other unscrupulous employers will use
the attack on the trade union movement check off our existence the existence of the trade union movement is under attack union membership and others the UNK workers at swan hunter the thousands of local authority workers who have lost their jobs those are the issues in which our parliamentary party should be addressing now on behalf of our people
last year congress carried a motion on racism and UNK expressing its alarm at the rise of UNK and racism in germany and france this has always been a trade union issue
we were the first union in nineteen seventy six to come out with our policy on the then race relations act it's always been a trade union issue whether it was the trade unions in germany in the twenties and thirties fighting UNK and UNK or whether it was the trade unions fighting UNK and his black shirts in britain it has always been part of our ideals and principles
we stand for solidarity between workers of all races and colours and we are opposed and must stop unscrupulous politicians and racist groups using the race issue to divide working people
we thought that last year we hoped that last year the murder of UNK workers in and the demonstrations of fascist UNK was clearly not isolated
we are UNK at the attack and murder of the UNK turkish workers and their families in germany
and in britain between nineteen eighty eight and nineteen ninety one there has been a doubling of racist attacks in large areas of london it is now UNK for such attacks to take place
the facts are there has been a UNK rise in attacks and UNK this union must take the lead we call for the british government to bring in legislation to ban the evil nationalist and fascist political parties and insist that government UNK legal protection for third country UNK
we want the e c to do the same we don't want UNK statements we don't want words we need action and deeds now colleagues
colleagues we have much work to do and many challenges to face
trade union congress will shortly have a new general secretary a new leader
the g m b has argued for change in how the t u c operates
we believe the t u c's role should be one of more services to its UNK to direct membership with greater emphasis on health and safety and recruitment
new unions have now emerged which we have not faced before we must not UNK these challenges because they may appear difficult or hard and we must be prepared to learn off anybody who has something to show us to close our minds would be a mistake
colleagues eight years ago our union along with other organizations in the trade union movement UNK for a political fund
five hundred thousand of our members took part in that particular ballot four hundred and fifty thousand of our members decided that they would support a political fund it was the first UNK in my opinion since nineteen forty five of the political views of ordinary trade union members
shortly congress this union will be required to ballot again on this politically motivated move
i believe again that our members will support the call and in so doing call for a general election to dismiss this totally incompetent government
thank you very much indeed
i would like to now to call on steve UNK regional secretary of midland region to move the vote of thanks
president colleagues steve on behalf of the central executive council midland and east coast region and can i assure delegates today that this is not an UNK of UNK
whilst it might be unusual for probably unique in fact for a to thank a can i reassure all delegates we are not related so UNK has it
president just spelt out very clearly why in fact we're in the g m b and three words came to my mind three very simple words compassion care and change
compassion for the victims of this sick tory society compassion for the millions of people who have no work compassion for the victims of UNK and UNK compassion for the victims of the public service cuts whether it be the miserable one and a half percent pay offers compulsory competitive tendering job cuts low pay the pensioners the elderly the sick the child the list is never ending
and who picks up many of these victims
well the g m b does
when this government talks about safety UNK for those in need i tend to look six inches below ground level to find it often the g m b is the only safety net above the ground which leads me to my second word we do this because we care we care about our country our economy and our people
we care about the old age pensioners the poor the single parents and all those people who in a UNK time are going to struggle and some are UNK going to fail to pay seventeen and a half percent v a t on fuel and heating bills
we care about low pay and low incomes and it's estimated that in this country this so called wealthy country that we have about eleven million people now on or just below e c poverty standards
twenty percent of our population one in five what a disgrace
which actually then brings me to my third and last point president care needs change
now we need change to benefit our people our members your families and your friends
and we need a political voice to do that president a political voice and influence through a labour party that's committed to UNK for our goals by working with us and through us and we're not ashamed of our links with the labour party
i just wondered colleagues if UNK of UNK currently i understand UNK in northern cyprus would be prepared to say how proud he is to be associated with the tories of course in saying that i do include michael mates and i just wondered whether or not this watch he sent was in fact a UNK watch
we have no hidden gifts and no hidden donations to the labour party we have an open and UNK relationship with them and we intend to carry that through
you referred to the ex parliamentary stars president the UNK well i should i would suggest that they ought to go away and look at their roots
we in the g m b know about our roots and we always will because of a very another important word we're accountable we're accountable in the real world to real people with real issues and real problems not the UNK world of some sections of the parliamentary labour party
we need to get on with the real tasks working closely together the g m b and the labour party because working together will achieve the objectives of change for the good
now cousin oh er ah i'm sorry erm president because you know you get all sorts of UNK on this don't you can i say president er cos call him brother at times colleagues on behalf of congress can i thank you president very much for the very positive and very strong challenges that you've put before us and the theme that i believe will carry us through the rest of the week
thank you very much
thanks very much indeed steve
can i now er ask congress to stand as a mark of respect for UNK colleagues
colleagues while we're standing can i remind you of a number of colleagues of ours who have died in the past year george national office dick from scotland of south western region lord from southern region julie from southern region william from national office from northern region from birmingham harry london regional secretary grace from london region from yorkshire region and many others not mentioned here that have given their energy and their commitment on behalf of the g m b members we remember them all
thank you very much colleagues can i ask the general secretary to report on the constitution of the standing orders committee
the standing orders committee is made up as follows birmingham region john lancashire region noel liverpool les london john midland paddy northern jerry g m b scotland john southern peter south western keith yorkshire kevin and i am delighted to tell you that the standing orders committee have elected as chairman this year john
thanks very much
will conference confirm the appointment of standing orders committee
thanks very much
and could i now call upon the chair of the standing orders committee john to move standing orders committee report number one
president congress on behalf of the standing orders committee i move standing orders committee report number one which you will find on pages one four six to one four eight of the final agenda
on behalf of the committee i wish to thank all of those delegates and their regional secretaries who UNK so well in agreeing thirty one composite motions
the UNK are printed on pages one four one to one seven six of the final agenda
since the report was printed the committee has given permission for a bucket collection to be taken at the end of this UNK session for our colleagues involved in the dispute
the committee has also ruled that an emergency motion from the southern region on the crawley UNK crawley dispute is in order and will be emergency motion number one
the committee has given permission for a bucket collection to be taken at the end of congress on monday to help these colleagues as well
would the officers from southern and birmingham regions who'll be who will be responsible for these UNK please come to the s o c immediately on completion of this report
the standing orders committee has been involved i'm sorry the standing orders committee has been informed that the central executive council has withdrawn motion two
the standing orders committee has also been informed that the central executive council will submit to congress a special motion on swan hunter a special motion on a proposed transfer of engagement from the furniture timber and allied trades union
the central executive council will also submit to congress a motion number one o six a UNK rule sixty seven
president congress i move s o c report number one
thank you very much john
conference accept er conference arrangement report thanks very much
yes
chair i'd like to challenge standing orders on motion three o one an example being in the part time workers' qualification into it was done by a recommendation of and we therefore request that it stays on the agenda
that was motion three o one colleague that three o one
three o one anybody else on the s o c reports
john
thank you
yes
well it seems that er motion
could you give your name please colleague
oh yes UNK london region
motion one o nine it states here this motion seeks to amend rule t twenty one
now i've gone right through all the bloody rules to this and i can't see where this has been UNK
if it has it should be printed
concerned this rule still stands and it has not UNK
so
okay
could we have clarification of that
okay john
thank you president
motion three o one motion three o one specifically calls for changes to the local government superannuation scheme through the steering committee
that committee is in effect a negotiating body
this motion should therefore be dealt with by the committee itself but before it is it should be considered by the relevant local authority industrial conference
it is a pure term of and conditions motion
the mover of the motion might want to take part in the debate on motion three seven one pensions
motion one o nine seeks to amend rule t twenty one paragraph six
that rule is part of the rule governing the transition from the b m s section to the technical UNK section
it opens with the words for the period ending the third of december nineteen ninety one
the technical UNK section national committee shall consist of congress will appreciate that the clause ceased to have any relevance on the fourth of december nineteen ninety one it would be quite UNK to seek to make a respect retrospective amendment to this rule
president and congress i move
thanks very much john

thanks very much john
thank you
colleagues we now to come to a an item on the agenda which is always very UNK at our annual conference and i refer of course to the presentation of the g m b gold badge
and this morning we're presenting two activists with the gold badge the women and the men's and during the course of the week we'll be presenting the youth award to one of our young members
if i could first of all deal with the presentation of the women's gold badge and the executive has decided that the award should go this year to peggy from the midland and east coast region
peggy has been a member of the union for twenty three years been a shop steward for eleven years the last nine at k p foods and also branch quality officer been a branch committee member and a member of the midland and east coast regional council member of the regional labour women's conference and she's been to g m b congress on a number of occasions
and UNK represented the g m b at the international women's er food conference in gene UNK
UNK held numerous positions in and trades councils
she's been a school governor a labour councillor t l p executive member of the social security and industrial UNK
and quite frankly colleagues the list is endless
but it's not a question of holding office for the sake of holding office
whenever peggy has been asked to serve she's UNK and UNK undertaken the duties
she was the first woman delegate to the humberside county association of trades councillors and the first woman on the executive and has had an enormous impact on the UNK efforts on women's issues
but i think that the greatest tribute of all that can be paid to peggy and i feel sure it would come from her members and it's this and it's basically what the trade union movement is all about and it's about representing ordinary people at the shop floor because whenever anybody asks peggy to do anything for them to represent them she's always the first one there
colleagues an excellent record and a worthy winner of the g m b's gold badge peggy
president colleagues i am so proud and honoured to receive this gold badge more so because this is the award given to me by you president i do want to thank a number of people i also want to thank the regional secretary steve who thank you steven for your support and guidance
next i would like to thank john for his support and encouragement i'd like to mention UNK who has always been there when i've needed at this point who again has always been very supportive i also want to thank members of the regional both past and present but particularly i'd like to thank all the regional officers and staff for their assistance and particularly george hugh and the officer i would also like to thank regional political officer for the midlands and east coast we now hold all the major positions of the labour party with i would also like to thank the national food and leisure committee for their help and support and particularly to david nick and to conclude president i'd like to express my UNK thanks and love to those important people around me my family
i pay a great tribute to my dad who as a trade unionist on the railway would have been so proud to see me receive this very great honour
to my mum who along with my dad helped me my daughter who i'm very proud of as now she's started taking greater interest in g m b to my mum who at the moment doesn't enjoy the best of health who over the years has had to UNK a daughter who er on some occasions has not been a very great help to her has guided me through very difficult times as mums always do
finally to the one person who throughout my life has been a great friend and now my husband
i don't know how to put into words the very great depth of UNK that i owe for his patience for his advice and for his friendship but most of all the love and respect that i as i have for him
conference i accept this award on behalf of all women activists within my union because sisters we know it's not always easy for women however i'm here to prove that we can achieve but we need the encouragement and support of our male colleagues
thanks very much peggy
colleagues i now come to the presentation of the g m b gold award for men
erm i can personally UNK that the award winner that this year is somebody that i've known for something like twenty six twenty seven years
again another colleague with a really outstanding record of service not only to the trade union movement and the party but more so to the g m b and i refer to eric from the lancashire region
erm eric in manchester from where he comes is extremely well known obviously within the g m b but his record he's one of the individuals in the trade union movement that i think are becoming somewhat of a UNK these days i know that many of us when we first started in the movement were very easily able and very relaxed about combining trade union and political activities together but of course as time goes on and you do tend to become more involved in the one and the other because of course it's all time consuming but i can honestly say that in UNK case he's never UNK one UNK from his commitment both to the trade union this union in particular and to the party never UNK at all
he spent a great deal of time in his efforts certainly for this trade union and in recruitment where he works he's made it not hundred percent hundred and ten percent and is constantly er recruiting constantly recruiting
politically well yes he's involved at every level as indeed many comrades are but if the sign of his political influence i think is as follows that if there are any anything major going down in his territory any major political problems coming up then the leader of the council one of the first people he contacts is eric
er what goes on behind those closed doors even i don't know
but that's a measure of his influence
the other thing i would say is this that the management whilst they very rarely agree with what eric has got to say i've never met a member of management at any level at any level that doesn't respect what he's got to say and that's a tremendous er psychological blow before they even get round the table because he's completely UNK and his record in terms as UNK er for of UNK for individual members and groups of UNK er members er is UNK and i think apart from his ability it's the respect in which he's held by everybody by everybody
so i could go on at great length colleagues to tell you that he's on this committee and that committee well er and that would take me a good half hour because he's on he's involved in everything in everything in the party in the union erm and his commitment is absolutely second to none
i was absolutely delighted colleagues when the er recommendation came through that eric should be awarded the gold badge because i could personally UNK that there can be no better winner or holder of the g m gold badge
eric colleagues
thank you
well i think i heard the UNK then you know
i really did
ah what i'm going to say today this is not me swan song don't anybody think it's me swan song
though i've retired i'm still active for the g m b in my city and six to eight weeks of retirement nearly did for me trolley so before anybody jumps for it think about it because it's boring
now down to business i would like to thank the executive for UNK me this gold badge
many times i have sat down there amongst you the delegates and seen the UNK activists receive this award
i never thought that i would join their ranks for me being the steward and the convenor was always enough
it was what i wanted to receive the gold badge is pure bonus thank you thank you executive committee
many people own a share of this gold badge with me my wife and family who have helped and supported me in whatever i have been involved in especially betty
over the years the g m b has been a major part of our family life the night meetings sometimes being away from home the disputes i have been involved in you have shared them with me and listened to me and because of my involvement you have always supported me
thank you betty for helping me to win this award
and UNK who i always represented and though i am now retired i cannot do without them
also the other men and women i represented when i became convenor they made me what i am and i thank them
my region i thank for UNK me the region i am so proud to belong to
to my regional secretary ernie remember when we occupied the manchester city council chamber on council day
you kept saying we'll all be locked up yet you stayed with us
i was hoping we would get locked up to have shared a cell with you it would have been UNK really
i have laughed at that thought many times these are the things to remember
ernie i thank you
nearly thirty years ago now as an honorary member i organized a thir first strike in my depot
our then new young branch secretary came in to sort out our UNK before he left the yard our UNK was sorted and i was the new collection steward
oh just been a collection steward the new young secretary said
i said just a collection steward that is the agreement
yes said so the agreement between us was made signed in blood i thought then i UNK hands with him the signature UNK before he left the yard
when i remind him of our agreement now he tells me to get lost
on the UNK it was only when i got notified that i'd been awarded the gold badge i realized i never got my hand back that day
it was a fair price to pay richard i made a good and trusted friend that day
life for me has never been dull around you what more could i ask
thank you richard
richard our UNK were always the tories and the bosses and we have fought them for everything we got
we still have our two traditional UNK but now a third UNK an enemy in the labour party an enemy supporting the now ancient cry of the tories and the tory national press for one man one vote replacing the vote in the trade unions a UNK of the labour party from the unions if we let them get away with this it would mean none of the established political parties represent the interests of ordinary working people the people who i've always represented that's what i think about just them
business and employers organizations are well represented in parliament their secret funding of the tory party buys them influence and tory party policies and nothing is said
we need to be in the labour party it is only there that we the unions can take part in making policy about the future of our industries and services and taking care of our members
better that we get rid of these people in the labour party if they do not want our involvement let them go and form their own party as a trade union UNK formed originally formed the labour party
and that must be the cry tell them go and join your own party
let us remind the labour party that they should be attacking this useless tory government not supporting them not voting with them not supporting them by UNK when necessary we'll never get power that way
we must organize against them in the wards and in the constituencies to drive this UNK out
well we've now got a member of the parliamentary panel to follow that colleagues
i can see him coming as well
settle down president
er colleagues it's now my great pleasure to ask giles mp for durham north to address congress on behalf of the g m b parliamentary panel
giles is a UNK me i must finish my speech
sorry
gi
i'm so UNK to get to my
yes i know i know
i'll be watching very carefully
erm giles is a UNK member of this union colleagues and er many colleagues may not realize it but was UNK the res the national research officer of the union for many years before he entered parliament and of course from time to time enters into the script of things and many colleagues will know that er one of the great UNK of the trade union movement is of course constructive UNK you know a must for all g m b new stewards and new UNK and branch secretaries a must to be read
giles is the author of that particular work
colleagues it's my pleasure to call upon giles to address congress this morning
giles
dick thank you for those kind words er specially about er my book and i think i am considering appointing you as my agent er you also said er that i'd dr drawn the short straw indeed you er UNK to me that i was the UNK lamb this morning well we'll see about that but i do know that i have the great honour to be invited to speak to congress this morning on behalf of the g m b parliamentary group
now the g m b parliamentary group is a powerful and influential organization it's well balanced between front UNK and back UNK between men and women and between the UNK and how shall i put it the more experienced and as you would expect its members are prominent in the attack on this weak incompetent and UNK conservative government
but i want to begin this morning by thanking you on behalf of the group because all of us owe the g m b an enormous debt of UNK none more than myself
it's no UNK to say that i owe my start in politics to the g m b because after having worked as dick said for the g m b for a number of years it was the support of the g m b which helped me win the nomination for UNK street and in the early eighties i can remember when er the labour party was going through a difficult period it was officials and members of the g m b who were a UNK influence in my constituency as they have been ever since
and when as shadow education spokesman i was a UNK in the nineteen eighty seven election it was the g m b which provided me with the necessary facilities to carry out that role and i thank them for it
