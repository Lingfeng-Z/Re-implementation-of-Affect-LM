no good has anybody heard about this magic word conservation lately
since we've UNK all the power generators and the british gas nobody even talks about conservation any more
it's burn as much as you can use as much as you can
now i'd like to just turn to british gas where i'm employed
british gas since privatization and i think rightly so and UNK has had a defence policy against this government and that defence policy is to turn itself into a multi national energy supplier
it's been quite successful at that but british gas within two years will be no different to shell b p or UNK
british gas is subject as donald said to the UNK and UNK commission report
that is due out in july
they have a defence mechanism for that and their preferred option at the moment is to divide british gas into seven companies and let one of those companies supply gas in the u k and i think they're ready to abandon it
if they can't get sufficient profit out of supplying gas in the u k i think british gas is on the verge of UNK from the gas market in the u k and that a lot of jobs in this country and i think we ought to be aware of that and i think we ought to be campaigning to make sure that doesn't happen
for british gas its defence policy is its share price and its shareholders not its workers not gas supply in the u k
who's gonna be responsible for safety once we allow the private market to dominate
we have a regulator that all he's interested in is in fact doing michael UNK work for him
the previous nationalized energy companies that was gas it was electricity it also covered the water companies as well were good employers not only good at employment they were good at their jobs
the they gave good employment stability of employment good personal pension schemes good career progression schemes they put a lot of money in research and development security of supply was the key issue for the customer they put a lot of money into conservation energy development and of course one other thing that they did that this government doesn't like they actually recognize trade unions and had trade unions represent the members who work there
well none of these unfortunately UNK with the free market
the free market is where it's all going
yet in energy terms the u k is the best po placed country in the whole of europe
it has oil it has gas it has coal
what it doesn't have is a proper energy policy
now i think it's up to the g m b to push this debate out and we should say energy is the UNK of the u k not the UNK of the UNK in the city of london or the tory party it's the UNK of the people in this hall and the people outside and i think we should support a proper balanced energy policy for the u k
thank you
president congress steve midlands and east coast seconding composite motion fifteen energy policy
energy policy colleagues in the u k is non UNK
the UNK philosophy doesn't exist within this tory government that would allow an UNK energy policy to be UNK
i'll tell you what does exist though UNK short UNK
quick political UNK in the name of free market philosophy
doesn't protect people's jobs doesn't protect the consumer short UNK that doesn't seek to safeguard our vital natural resources for future generations
quick political UNK that have a complete UNK for the environment
the efficient use and planning in a coherent UNK and balanced way of all our energy resources is essential in the long term to safeguard in the long term the energy needs of our nation for ourselves and our children
we have the resources but we import coal
UNK coal UNK by women and children we have the resources but we import electricity via an UNK cable from france
we have the resources but we import gas and i'm a gas lad as well and i find that situation UNK
colleagues let's end this situation let the g m b as the motion states be in the fore forefront of pursuing an UNK balanced energy policy to serve this nation now and in the future
congress i second
motion three o eight scotland to move
sammy scottish region
what the president and colleagues as well as presenting himself as a great european leader a demand which is not seen as be particularly although at the moment john major and his government have sought to present themselves as green
well if they're green all i can say about us that we must be UNK looking
one of the agreements which our government signed at UNK was for the setting up of a sustainability plan for a british economy yet ever since the end of that conference these proposals have been getting successfully UNK down and deleted
we need to demand that major keeps his promise britain is already our willingness to go lightly on UNK in the pollution field is becoming UNK
does it have to take another oil disaster like the UNK before britain acts
already we're miles behind with catching up with standards which are accepted elsewhere
the labour movement has a role to play here we need to start building bridges with the UNK movement friends of the earth and others for a strategy for jobs for the economy which will tackle unemployment
but not at the expense of the environment and the living conditions of this and future generations
i move
the seconder for three o eight seconder for three o eight
formally seconded thanks very much motion three o nine g m b scotland to move
chair congress peter g m b scotland water privatization
the issue of water and the ownership of water in scotland is a very UNK issue
it's an issue which has totally united every aspect of the scottish community
i don't have to UNK or tell our colleagues in england and wales the effects water UNK had on them since nineteen eighty nine they can see it for themselves every day
and workers made redundant since nineteen eighty nine huge rises in water charges and the UNK of water supplies to ordinary people and their families who cannot meet the new high charges for water
it's disgraceful colleagues in the later half of the twentieth century in john major's britain we have private companies UNK the water supply to people a basic necessity of life itself
ian UNK in his consultation paper investing for our future for water and trade services in scotland set out eight options for consideration
the people of scotland considered these eight options and duly replied with ninety percent of the rep replies including tory councillors and UNK and some tory run councils totally rejecting any form of water privatization in scotland
but just show mr UNK that he's not the only one that can strathclyde water engaged sir william in not exactly a name that friendly with labour councils or trade unionists to undertake a brief external overview of its UNK strategy procedure in capital expenditure programme at a meeting on the twenty third of march
the overview was focused within the documents securing the future UNK regional council's er response to the UNK date consultation document investing for the future
the findings indicated there was probably no major savings in efficiency to be made which would produce a commercial charge more than the present public authority cost
in addition which previously act previously acted on behalf of private water companies in england and wales said strathclyde was providing an appropriate service with an affordable price which was responsive to local needs
the fact that highly respected consultants UNK our conclusions further UNK an already UNK case against removing the water service from public control
therefore we should urge our union and the er sponsored mps in parliament to oppose any form of water privatization in scotland whatsoever and to campaign for a turn a return to the water services in england and wales under properly controlled public authority
i move
the seconder for three o nine
formally seconded
thanks very much
composite sixteen public utilities lancashire region to move southern region to second
UNK lancashire region
congress president public utilities the name says it all
essential public utilities for every single member of the public
things people need for a basic quality of life
privatization high prices UNK
people calling round from next door for a bucket of water the elderly and sick dying of UNK or unable to light the house after dark that's what UNK and all the others who bought shares in the various sell UNK have a share in
closing pits the dash for gas that's what privatization results in the quick UNK can you spare a pound for the water meter vat on fuel how many more will die
you lose your job you're at home all day you heat the house to stay warm get cut off because you fall behind with the bill
you want to get connected the meter is fixed so it's stay warm don't eat
that's britain today
radical change is needed
we have to end private UNK
UNK utilities involving con consumers trade unions and the government
privatization has failed britain
we need to place these utilities under the control of the public
UNK is the best way to ensure that nobody dies because they cannot afford to use the basic services
nationalization of all the utilities at the earliest opportunity that is the task of the next labour government a basic quality of life for all that is the meaning of clause four so tell UNK no vat on fuel
congress i move
president congress UNK southern region
i'm here to second this composite number sixteen as regards public ownership of utilities
i believe that nationalization has become a dirty word in this country over many a year
i think it's about time we actually put that word back into the dictionary and made it a good word to have
the government over the past year has mugged the people of this country by UNK all the public utilities we have
they are now increasing all the charges across those utilities
they are about to re UNK yet again by breaking up british gas and i'm sure they'll break up every other utility they can
they're after making money
they're not after looking after consumers or the workforce this trade union should start considering how to go about re UNK the public utility energy companies within this country
for number one they could start considering doing away with the regulator and having an elected body to do UNK over the utilities
yes it is gonna be a long term project yes the money isn't there to actually just go out and re UNK them but by regulation approved elected bodies also with trade union members on them elected bodies then i'm sure we can start looking after the public and not the UNK and the accountants
i second
composite seventeen lancashire region to move london region to second
president congress dave lancashire region
i tried to write a speech last year and i made a right mess of it so this year i'm gonna speak from the heart because i might get a UNK like the leader of the council here i install water meters
thank you
erm when i was a kid i asked me dad what politics were about and he said well tories are for the rich and labour's for the poor
the only thing the tories can't tax is fresh air
well water meters proved that wrong because what happens is billy is over there laughing at me if you put a water meter in to get that water back in the main what does it need
it needs to push all the air out of the water main
where does that air go
through the water meter
you weigh that all up how much it's gonna cost over the years you're paying for fresh air on water meters
tories have done it again
on t v last week there was a programme tuberculosis has come back into britain said it was the UNK bringing it back
it's not
people are frightened of using their UNK their baths their toilets because of using water and paying for it
i pay through my wages twenty p a week for something they call water aid
this sends money to the third world
this money pays for villages and towns in africa UNK to have clean portable water
they did an experiment there was a UNK in africa i'm not being racist they did this UNK lived six mile from the nearest river
every morning the full UNK got the pots pans and went down to the river washed got the clean water carried back and they lived well
water aid came in don't do that and installed a pipeline
they installed a six mile pipeline and put UNK in the centre of the village
what happened
people started washing using as a toilet clean water they all got UNK diphtheria
they wiped out a village
now that is what's gonna happen in this country
we have got good medical facilities but as you just heard UNK just saying they're destroying that as well the only people who wanted water meters is when houses were on UNK value and they were paying two hundred thousand pound for a house at large rates and the water rates was the same house
so what they did they said can we install a water meter the water company said yes
there you go
now they don't do that
who just said they turn all the leicester is it they turn the water supplies off severn trent sorry mr
they turn the water off and then when they say do you want the water back on you can have a meter but they don't tell you pay thirty five pound a quarter for the meter and that's without a bit of water going through it
so right you get the water meter in you then start paying for the water you get a bill between hundred and seventy to two hundred quid a year
and this is for a terraced houses that used pay thirty five to forty pound a year
now as i say i install water meters because it's me job
i went into the water industry at seventeen years and i've still not UNK out how to do these new ones and make them go backwards i can do the other ones
but on a serious note if we go along this line of the one thing to me then of getting what we need we have gas we have electric the one thing we do need nobody could survive without is water congress i ask you to support this m this motion
president er congress david london region i speak in support of composite seventeen
erm just a word about the previous speaker i'm also involved with water meters and if he wants to know how to how to make them go backwards if he can speak to me afterwards i don't have
domestic water UNK should not be imposed because the likely effects will be increased and excessive charges
this will result in self regulation of the use of water to the point where the health of the individual the family and the public at large will suffer
availability of water and freedom of its use should not be governed by the size of one's wallet
i should also erm it should also be remembered that those with special health needs may require to use more water
why should they be financially UNK because they happen to be sick or disabled
the effect of UNK will hit the poor and the disadvantaged
perhaps the water companies before UNK on a policy of compulsory UNK should put their own house in order first
i refer to the estimated twenty five percent of all water pumped that UNK away in broken mains
no amount of UNK resulting in self regulation by the sick and disabled
and the poor
and the poor will solve the problem of loss from worn out mains
i therefore urge you to support composite seventeen to protect the life and welfare of all of us
i second the composite
conference i now call the c e c speaker to put the c e c position on the various different motions
john by the way has recently been elected president of our energy and utilities section
john midlands and east coast region speaking on behalf of the c e c
president congress the c e c is asking you to support composite fifteen support composite sixteen with a qualification and also to support composite seventeen
in addition we are asking that motion three zero eight be referred and that you support motion three zero nine
the tories have failed UNK to develop a UNK coherent energy policy for the needs of britain
beyond short term market forces this has UNK b badly upon them
the decision to close thirty one of our pits was er erm i was gonna say a major error i should maybe UNK that to a heseltine error
the president of the d t i chose to ignore what i thought was an excellent report from the special committee which was headed by dick
a fiver a ton subsidy UNK recommended and we heard yesterday where he was getting the fiver a ton from the miners' pension fund
utterly disgraceful
the fiver a ton was never enough anyway
i can give you an example
at our first energy and utility sectional conference we had the chief ex executive of national power as a guest speaker
after the conference in conversation with the section secretary and myself he stated that the fiver subsidy was a joke
national power were buying coal from australia for half the price of the subsidized figure
british coal was charging forty one pound a ton to national power
with the fiver subsidy got it to thirty six pound a ton
they can ship it national power can ship it half way across the world and get it for eighteen pound a ton
totally UNK
the increased use of gas to produce elect electricity will result in faster UNK of our resources while the subsequent closure of the mines will deny us access to hundreds of years of our UNK and greatest energy reserves
britain needs a balanced energy policy which ensures that our varied and rich reserves are UNK in the most efficient way
the qualification with respect to comp sixteen is that congress needs to be aware that a future labour government will have to decide between many competing priorities
the tories are also attacking our health service our children's education and are failing to invest in the training and research necessary to produce substantial economic recovery
a labour government with the trade unions with them using a progressive agenda will clearly have to UNK the demands that will be made upon it
with regard to comp seventeen
compulsory water met UNK will impact most heavily on the poor the sick and the elderly
suggestions of water UNK are not acceptable
the u k is the UNK country in europe and water companies should be forced to cut UNK from UNK which allow up to twenty five percent loss from the water supply before it reaches the consumer
UNK water costs ten percent per year more than non UNK water
where a household seeks to cut back on the use of water it will be at the risk of hygiene fewer baths toilets left UNK and less washing of clothes and dishes
ask the people across the water on the isle of UNK what they think of UNK water a UNK down i can assure you of that
the c e c is asking that motion three o eight be referred
while well argued the motion if agreed would threatened thousands of g m b members' jobs in power generation
we believe that power stations should be fitted with clean coal technology and that energy taxes should be based upon UNK rather than the use of a particular fuel
to summarize colleagues the c e c ask you to support composite fifteen sixteen with a qualification outlined and seventeen
we ask for three o eight to be referred or opposed if it is not and that you support motion three o nine as it's in line with current policy
thank you very much
thanks john
colleagues i propose to take the vote composite fifteen is being accepted all those in favour
against
that's carried
reference is being sought on motion three o eight does scotland agree to reference
agreed
conference accept that
yeah
thanks very much indeed
three o nine has been accepted all those in favour
against
that's carried
composite motion sixteen has been accepted all those in favour
against
that's carried
composite seventeen has been accepted all those in favour
against
that's carried
thank you very much colleagues
erm could i probably UNK colleagues could i advise you that you can UNK your water UNK at the entrance on my right
colleagues it's now my pleasure to call upon the deputy general secretary tom to move his section of the report and to address conference
tom
tom moving the deputy general secretary's report
colleagues er since we meet in portsmouth let me begin by UNK my colours firmly to the mast and UNK that the one issue that will dominate my comments here this morning UNK to anything else in the time that's allocated to me in moving my report i think would simply not reflect my activities on your behalf over the last twelve months
five years ago you nominated me for the national executive of the labour party
i was elected
twelve months ago you nominated as treasurer of the labour party
i was elected
armed with your support i look forward to my first year in that position to sorting the party's problems
maybe introducing a touch of that pragmatic responsible approach to financial control which has been a feature of this union's development over the years
i look forward to tackling the party membership system i wanted to make some of the sound admin system and modern communication methods which allow this union to send each new member a new membership card were introduced to UNK road
above all i look forward as the new labour party treasurer to bringing the party membership fee down from the UNK heights of eighteen pounds to the level which we in the trades unions know ordinary people can afford
that's true
well we've made some progress in some areas but not as much as i would've liked although i intend to keep working at it
we could have been a lot more down the road to genuinely UNK the labour party making it a bit more in tune with our own members and those many thousands who should be members of the labour party
but of course the UNK have got their eye on a bit of the party operation in need of their attention
another cause waiting for a champion
so for the past year i've sat on the labour party trade union review group a working party set up in the heat of an election defeat to UNK a potentially damaging row about the strange phenomenon in the party of labour
the UNK of the link between the labour party and the trade union
well we didn't do too well did we
even twelve months ago the issue was the political flavour of the month of real concern and anxiety only to a half a handful of UNK and a bar full of lobby UNK
now it's the biggest issue in the movement
it's UNK the proceedings of this conference and other union conferences
it's keeping the labour leader awake at nights the column inches full of knocking copy and letting the tories off the hook
and we have to ask the question
why
we owe it to our members if nothing else to find the answer
why oh why in this most UNK season UNK for a growth UNK in labour UNK have the green shoots of a labour recovery been UNK back yet again by our UNK
let's have this clearly understood this is a self UNK home grown disaster
i've travelled up and down the country in the past few months i've spoken to union branches i've spoken to regional councils regional committees party meetings general committees regional conferences and they all said the same
indeed it was said loud and clear at our political rally last night here in portsmouth
union labour links
we don't want to know
it's not important
get on with the real issues
an own goal yes but even so the review group was set up to smooth away a little local difficulty
that indeed is what it should have done
a private internal affair needed UNK and i went on that review group i was prepared to do all that i could to resolve it
armed with a policy which you'd clearly stated and which incidentally UNK completely with the official and existing party itself about the involvement of UNK in the selection and UNK of members of parliament
i went on the review group to sort the matter out too many of us went onto it convinced that the matter was already sorted out
their minds made up their stance adopted UNK objects before discussion had even begun
o m o v is the answer now what's the question
i've seen political UNK in my time but never at such close quarters
colleagues there is an UNK abroad in certain quarters of our movement that is a dangerous thing because it's
it's UNK and UNK which has led us to where we are today and that's on the UNK of the crisis
colleagues every other item on our agenda this week is yet another good reason why we can't afford a crisis in the labour movement
let's start getting things in perspective
let's take the pan off the boil
the plain truth is that after one year an UNK of UNK a little mud UNK and some very bad publicity we're right back where we started
in some ways we're much further back from the starting line
nevertheless it's time to call a halt before it's too late
those who can't see a role for the trade unions and the labour party need to be given time to see the error of their ways
and of course they will
the closer you get to an election a general election campaign the clearer UNK become for them
the forward facing UNK without our campaign UNK expertise back up and money will not dissolve any deeply held if only recently announced objections to union association for we all know what's likely to happen at the party conference in october if the brakes are not applied now
there can only be one outcome the trade unions will retain their involvement in the labour party i've been saying this all along as have others during the course of the last year the trouble is nobody UNK
now perhaps people will be more inclined to do just that and if they are then what we may need is a trade union link review group mark two
a UNK group which perhaps with some different faces which can do what originally so UNK this group failed to do
that's reach a common understanding which reflects the UNK of a relationship we enjoy at the present day so that we can all get on with the task of serving our members and forming a labour government
i move my report
thanks very much indeed tom and now i'll deal with various different sections of UNK report pages eighty two eighty three eighty four eighty five eighty six eighty seven eighty eight
yes
president congress peter middle and east coast
tom eighty eight bottom g m b direct it reads g m b direct it is now established as the best trade union journal
published bi monthly becomes necessary reading in the labour movement
direct seven was sitting with UNK on the front
she's the one that's making us out of work
i wrote to this lot up here and questioned it and all of a sudden the ball starts UNK somebody starts supporting UNK
we're in the UNK league here this union
we're not in fourth division
we can do without anybody but this movement in that document and it's about time somebody starts listening
tom if you're in charge of that let's get these delegates on them front pages we can do without the tories
eighty nine ninety and we now move from one o sorry
good morning congress er back to page eighty eight president sorry er couldn't get your eye
er tom it's regarding erm direct
by the way representing south western region
it's regarding direct
my colleague who was just up here was talking about UNK who's on the cover of direct
being a representative of a national race committee i'm often UNK at the ne the lack of black people demonstrated or portrayed in direct
recently on the cover of direct was a young black person who was er a UNK of somebody unemployed in britain today
unfortunately the photograph could have been er UNK as a UNK photograph of somebody from UNK or any other part of the world where there is problems in inner city area
please tom when er placing photographs in direct please try to make them a little more appropriate
thank you
now turn to page one o four one o five one o six and one o seven and one o eight
tom could you respond to those points please
first to er peter's point about er UNK on the er on the er direct i must say to you i got a bit of a surprise when i saw UNK in such UNK er fashion on er on direct but you know you've quickly got answers in this organization and somebody said ah well it was meant to be an UNK to her and they were a bit UNK in that er respect
but that's not the reason of course
the reason was that we were touching three million unemployed at that particular point in time and it was felt that the best way of making an impact was to highlight this in the way in which it was done
and whether it did anything else i can tell you peter you're not the only one that's made reference to UNK being on the cover of our journal
i've been UNK with calls
i'm still not sure whether it was right or wrong but it certainly got the reaction that was necessary that people appreciated that she was there she was the minister for employment and indeed she was causing a hell of a lot of problems for g m b members
on the other point that was raised in respect of er direct
i think our delegate will appreciate that er it is a difficult issue we do try as much as we possibly can to project all aspects of our membership in a fair fashion and we go out of our way er to be fair in respect of er certain er areas
i would simply conclude that while we're always open to any sort of criticism we're always open to any kind of recommendation that might be made erm to us in respect of er direct
direct itself you know it did win the t u c award
it wasn't anybody else's UNK it was a t u c award and you can imagine the very issue that has been raised here today are the very aspects that are critically analyzed by the t u c in determined award but i will take on board the points that have been mentioned
thank you president
thanks very much tom
right colleagues could i now advise congress as to how we're gonna proceed from here
er first of all we're gonna have a debate which i would term as politics which will take in motion three nine seven the labour party motion three nine eight sponsored members of parliament and then i go gonna ask the deputy general secretary tom to respond to that particular debate then party and union links there'll be the c e c statement
labour party and trade union links to be moved by the general secretary and to be seconded by UNK from the central executive council
i then take composite motion twenty nine labour party trade union links and then motion three nine six g m b parliamentary panel
we'll then i'll then invite a speaker from each region on the c e c statement and following on from that we'll then take the vote on the statement and comp twenty nine and motion three nine six
we'll then move on to motion three nine four representation at labour and t u c conferences and motion three nine labour local authorities
motion four o two labour party subscription contributions and then motion four o three labour party member awards
i will ask robert UNK member of the c e c to respond and put the c e c's position and we'll take the vote on those particular motions
is that clear colleagues
thanks very much i now call motion three nine seven the labour party to be moved by the lancashire region
and again colleagues it would assist er if UNK and UNK and supporting speakers and speakers who're speaking on behalf of the regions if they could come down to the front
david
thank you
david one four sorry one four eight UNK lancashire region
coming down here this week i came a week early actually i used a week's holiday as well and er my lady friend says i think we'll buy a house in UNK
i said no she said you won't leave the union will you i said no she said alright we'll buy one at UNK still in the lancashire region and the reason why the union is my second love obviously my first love is me family is what it's done for me but i also think what i've done for those people who represent me and yourselves in parliament
now when those people in parliament are absent by their silence they may be there you don't always see 'em you then get a bit annoyed but i tell you get bloody annoyed when they walk past you which happened to me and to the regional delegates at lancashire north west labour party i won't name who they are but they didn't even acknowledge us
this president behind me led a delegation of er fourteen of us one of 'em got a gold badge yesterday eric half of 'em sat down there and we went canvassing in UNK last election just before ninth of april that disaster we had
we didn't UNK in a nice little area we UNK on the side of the bloody UNK
it was blowing a gale am i right dick
and he's there shouting right what do they vote right okay and we heard this row and i look round it's eric got the gold badge yesterday and he's dragging somebody out their house you voted tory you voted tory
so we all sort of gathered round was it eric or ernie i think it was eric so we all gathered round that was the UNK that we had to make sure that we got a parliamentary candidate sponsored by the g m b in UNK
that was down to us they voted liz liberal
but the energy was still there we know full well that there's other mps there i think it's thirty seven we've got and we the only one that i know well is gerald UNK
you can get hold of gerald UNK just like that
great he's not even in my constituency
mine's a teacher i think jim
talking to john UNK this morning i went to his speech last night and john UNK never altered
three years ago in blackpool north west labour party he said i stand up he said and people say i lose me temper
now i'll never believe that of john UNK
but i saw him on the television last week breakfast t v not last week before just before i got into work and this woman on the television asking this stupid question she said why don't you put any opposition up in parliament and he hit the roof but what the television did they didn't switch off when he played bloody hell with 'em excuse my french er president but this is how it went he couldn't give a damn about you bloody lot he kept the television on it just showed his frustration
now to me and john UNK not even in our union shame that man should be is doing what every other g m b member of parliament should be doing
now we see you go into work or as one delegate said before you don't go to work because the places are UNK up we've got management in north west water arrogant it's unbelievable
directors they've signed one off sick from british er UNK and give him sixty thousand pound a year UNK
how can you be retired sick and get one of them
but the UNK of the people and yet when we're going to work we've got to try and combat these people and what help have you got
you've got your shop stewards your activists you in my region we've got some great officers the one that i have pat is great to work with but in the last two years i've had to get hold of pat more and more myself
but do we get hold of m ps
not a bloody sign of them
and i'll tell you summat i'm getting sick and tired of it
i have one pair of shoes at a time and i wear them out pretty quick because i'm doing all the canvassing for our lot
they don't do it
how many members have they recruited to the g m b
go on name me one
not one
how many members have they recruited to the labour party there won't be so bloody many
but i'll tell you something we haven't got to get sick we've got to get people who support us
people who put our message across i'm gonna finish before red light here people who're gonna do the job for us in parliament showing the g m b is the number one union and we've got to make sure it's right
support this motion thank you congress
john lancashire region supporting motion three nine seven
congress time and time again the majority of our sponsored mps appear unable to sustain any sort of attack on this government's policies
in fact when they raise an issue it's either for a personal ego trip or they're just paying lip service
i'm of the opinion that the reason they remain in opposition is that many of them have very little in common with the very people that they're supposed to represent
how do we ensure issues that directly affect the g m b members and there's millions about now i say nowadays are highlighted in their proper manner
we support these mps time and time again which we should be doing but in return we certainly want their support
support the motion
thank you
thank you john motion three nine eight sponsored members of parliament
midland region to move
yes
well thanks very much i hadn't realized it had gone i don't know to be honest i bet it's hiding behind there
we'll check it out
colleagues president congress alan midlands and east coast region
this co motion calls for a simple thing
it calls for this union's sponsored mps not to pair with tory m ps
yesterday we had the debate on the abolition of wage councils
indeed this union had a campaign of sending postcards out to mps asking them not to vote for the abolition of wage councils
yet when the vote was taken it showed a considerable number of labour mps had not voted
that vote condemned over a million workers to poverty pay
yesterday in your address to congress president you said that labour mps were paid to oppose this government and they and that they should be accountable
and john mentioned the UNK way that this tory government goes about things
every time a labour mp pairs with a tory leaving that tory mp free to go about his other business commitments most of them highly paid that mp UNK from taking part in opposing this government's policies
the c e c in opposing this motion are also guilty of UNK of UNK their responsibility to its low to its lowest paid members it has UNK to fight for
i move
president congress les midlands and east coast region seconding motion three nine eight
peer in when i saw this motion i took immediate interest
i didn't realize it happened
we've all seen debates on t v er only an handful of mps are present
where are all the rest
UNK off
such issues as maastricht vat on fuel to name but two when first debated only a hand handful of mps are present
can this do the movement any good
no
i attended a public sector lobby at westminster
this organized by the t u c mary was also there
we listened to jack straw among others
what an experience talk about tory UNK
i must give credit to one speaker though an mp from UNK
he really UNK up the debate
peter he's incidentally a g m b member
UNK can be proud of him
after the lobby i managed to speak to jack straw
asked his opinion on UNK
his answer i believe UNK is necessary
short and not so sweet
i then spoke to geoff mp for ashfield c l p and until recently also an m e p strongly in favour of UNK
his answer was he could not manage his commitments without UNK
alan my own mp was next
he explained the party line in favour
he then explained his own position which was quite different
strongly against but he could see the need for some front bench mps to pair
new mps tend not to pair and will attend most UNK he said
usually it is when it is the old guard when UNK sets in
we in the trade union movement know about UNK
ex UNK n e c dennis UNK was next
i asked dennis his view and i was taken UNK
he agreed UNK was a good idea
could i have caught him at a bad moment could he have UNK i couldn't believe it
dennis UNK saying UNK was a good idea
he then explained
in seventy one when i first came to westminster i was introduced to UNK
at my first important debate i UNK up with five of the tory buggers and then i turned up
UNK allows tory mps to sit on their boards of directors UNK your pension funds to rally support for their party and enhance their salaries
we should not be supporting this practice
congress i second
colleagues the c e c are recommending accepting with a qualification three nine seven and are seeking withdrawal of three nine eight
i call tom to respond
tom
thanks er president the c e c are accepting erm motion three nine seven with a qualification and erm oppose three nine eight
now the UNK of the motion from lancashire quite rightly identified that the major issues that should be concerning labour mps and particularly sponsored mps are issues like unemployment the national health service and local services
all of these are key political issues
er we call on labour UNK members of parliament to give their support in each of these areas mentioned and we do constantly have a dialogue and provide what is the union line in terms of erm these particular er issues
but i wouldn't wish anybody er to get the idea that we as a union wish to take away what really is the parliamentary privilege that members of parliament have got to have to look after their own constituencies in addition to being sponsored members of parliament
now i'd hate to think that anybody got the impression that we actually gave them instructions
we're simply not able to do that
there might be occasions when we feel that we'd like mps to take a particular line in fact there are occasions when i'd like to see mps take a particular line but we can only ask them we cannot in fact insist that they do take a particular line
it's a little bit unfair i think as well to UNK on sponsored members of parliament because you know as well as i do on some of the issues that have been very important to us not the sort erm er the UNK issues that head hit the headlines but issues that mean a lot to our members our sponsored members generally do work very hard
but i can think areas er like on europe i don't there's been anybody who's been in terms of UNK the issue erm er better than george UNK has UNK done in terms of the european er issue
on the er three nine eight erm the c e c are erm asking for withdrawal of these this motion they asked initially for withdrawal
that wasn't the case for very much the same reasons of course
we expect sponsored mps to be present at important votes and particularly on these occasions when our members are likely to be UNK affected
the motion goes on to say that sponsored mps should not pair with erm conservatives
now i've heard what the move UNK have had to say and you did i don't need to tell conference that most of the business of running the country is actually done outside of the chamber itself it's done in the various committees i mean dennis UNK was mentioned there
now dennis will not sit on any of the committees well we simply could not get our view and the representation that we want if we did not have erm membership of er particular er committees
so the UNK system does allow that sort of work to go on
in addition to that john UNK was mentioned and john could not attend the meetings that he does around the country if he did not have the facility to be able to be away from parliament during times when erm there are votes that need to be taken
so i would simply suggest that erm on the two motions er president as i said at the outset that we would support three nine seven and in view of the fact that three nine eight is not withdrawn the c e c would ask you to oppose three nine eight
thanks
thanks very much tom
propose to take the vote colleagues er as tom has said the c e c are
dave lancashire region on three nine seven chair when i got elected to the labour council in UNK i took a whip that i had did what the policy was of the UNK d l p
surely if a member of parliament takes a g m b sponsorship they should take the whip that we give and follow our rules and not go against us by going by constituent
either go for the constituent or be sponsored by g m b
david it's not a point of order that
i mean you're exercising your right of reply but for what particular purpose i don't know because the c e c are accepting the motion
ah but with referral with a qualification mr president
but nevertheless it's being accepted
colleagues i propose to take the vote on three nine seven
the c e c are accepting it all those in favour
against that's carried
is the midland region prepared to withdraw three nine eight
no
okay propose to take the vote
the c e c are therefore opposing three nine eight
all those in favour of the motion
against
that's lost
colleagues party trade union links the c e c statement labour party trade union links to be moved by the general secretary john
colleagues john general secretary speaking on behalf of the c e c and beginning with a rather unusual announcement
er our press office tell me that we have just had a call from ten UNK street who want a copy of this speech
this is not a joke
this is not a joke absolutely true
and i hope that john major and central office of the conservative party study it carefully since it is about party democracy and the conservative party have a few lessons to learn in that direction
but colleagues i turn to the UNK series of events that tom has er already described because a UNK form of spring fever seems to have UNK the labour party
three million unemployed homelessness and poverty on a scale not known for a generation
health service falling apart at the UNK and this the moment when instead of attacking this awful government a number of labour politicians have decided to attack us the trade unions who founded the party and UNK supported the party through thick and thin
and recently there's been quite a lot of thin
i don't know what the three million unemployed think of that sense of priorities but i think it's appalling
apparently some labour politicians think we're an electoral liability
we heard that claim i would call it a UNK at the last election
so whatever our reservations at the UNK of the party trade unionists kept in the background
we organized we supported we gave a great deal of work behind the candidates of the party as dave has already mentioned but we kept off the television we kept off the radio we kept out of the newspapers
the UNK would have been proud of us
there was of course a massive mistake in that general election campaign but it wasn't of the trade union making
quite the reverse
in spite of trade union UNK not just by representatives of this union but by representatives of a number of unions all within my hearing the public heard little about our vote winning policies for full employment or a minimum wage or decent rights at work the party said next to nothing in high profile terms about child care or maternity rights or the exploitation of part time workers
that was our agenda it wasn't the party publicity agenda
instead the party UNK professionals decided that the campaign should be fought on the basis of what they called themes
what this meant in practice was that we UNK the health service we UNK almost everything else and then got into an awful UNK over proportional representation
so were the trade unions to blame
not on your life
i visited thirty eight constituencies during that campaign and i'm convinced of one thing
if we'd fought that election on the trade union agenda we would have won a lot more votes than the campaign issues chosen by the professionals
hear that's true yeah
some critics of the trades unions have UNK that we oppose the UNK of the party constitution
that charge is nonsense
remember this booklet some of the longer attending members of the g m b will do we debated it in the conference of the old g m b five years ago
a radical programme for the labour party reform of the future
far more radical than anything that's been discussed in the last few months
in that same year on behalf of the union i went to the rostrum at the labour party conference to move a resolution calling for the end of the block vote
i actually used the phrase this motion is the death UNK of the block vote and the beginning of individual voting of trade union members within the part party
i have to say that if some of those born again UNK had supported us then we could have settled these issues long ago and got on with the business of winning elections which i thought was what party politics was about
but the core of this disagreement is about what we really mean by democracy
there are two groups of members in the labour party something over two hundred thousand individual members who pay an individual subscription and the four million trade unionists who pay through the political levy
two groups not one
and one group is an awful lot bigger than the other group
some labour politicians want the important decisions in the party selecting labour candidates or UNK the leader to be made only by the two hundred thousand individual members without any voice for the four million trade union levy payers at all
they call that one member one vote
i repeat it to you with a sense of UNK
our executive has a different view of democracy
we believe that everyone who UNK should have the right to participate in labour party democracy
and that means colleagues that means not just the two hundred thousand individual members but also the four million trade union levy payers who back the party through those payments strengthen labour's organization and give invaluable support at election time
we UNK our levy paying members last year in the election for the party leader you remember it well over a hundred and forty thousand g m b members took part in that secret ballot
with constituency support and the votes of other trade unionists john smith was elected party leader by a larger number of contributing members than ever had the chance to vote for john major or paddy UNK
that's the contrast and that should be a matter of pride
i wish labour politicians would spend less time searching for points of disagreement in the labour party constitution and more time pointing to the total absence of democracy in the tory party where there is no participation no UNK and they don't even have the confidence to tell party members where the money comes from
just remember the g m b's reform programme
UNK of trade union levy payers
a new system of policy making with wide ranging consultation
a total reform of the party conference
that's our reform programme
if you want to label people UNK we got there in this union first
but we are not in favour of any policy that UNK trade unionists out of the party or of any policy that denies trade unionists a voice in labour party democracy
perhaps both party leaders will be interested in that bit
i end i end colleagues with a UNK warning
financially and UNK the labour party is in something of a mess
with a small individual membership the party badly needs the trade unions to provide that broad and representative support across classes and across UNK
unless they're very careful the supporters of one member one vote so called will create a narrow and exclusive party limited to those lucky people who can stump up an eighteen pounds membership fee without thinking too hard and in the britain of nineteen ninety three there aren't quite as many of those as perhaps we would like to see
our reports on the options that we support offer a different model for the party
wider larger
okay thanks
right colleagues could we turn to a period of rule amendments and er general motions now
rule thirty seven on branches er motion seventy seven rule amendment to be moved by the midland and east coast region
and colleagues could i start and remind delegates that if there are UNK or additional speakers on this side if they would use this rostrum to my right if they would use this rostrum
now there are chairs available for additional speakers so if they would come down it would certainly UNK the business of congress
thanks president
president conference ken midlands and east coast region moving motion seventy seven otherwise known as go lightly
conference this particular motion calls for an increase of members required to form a branch or be allowed to continue as a branch should it lose members
an increase from fifty to a hundred members would allow greater flexibility for our regional committees in the regions to decide whether they allow the branch to continue or to UNK with another branch
therefore the increase in numbers to a hundred for this particular rule seems to be a logical move as a branch with less than fifty would be UNK of the g m b both from a democracy point of view and an administration point of view where cost plays an UNK important role
with the document being debated this week we should beware of making branches accountable to its members and increasing the numbers to one hundred gives us a greater base to work from than fifty
therefore conference please support i move
thanks very much colleagues
is that formally seconded
formally seconded
are recommending you to accept motion seventy seven colleagues all those in favour against that's carried
thanks very much
pensions and social security benefits i call composite motion twenty six women and state pensions
g m b scotland to move and london region to second priority in debates northern region
okay if the seconder and additional speakers would come down to the front please
conference chair mary UNK g m b scotland
we have argued for many years that the present discrimination on the grounds of sex and state pensions and retirement age is UNK
a much wider consultation process must be initiated before far reaching changes can be agreed
the whole question of an adequate income in retirement can be achieved and changes necessary to enable them must be worked at
few if any of the media UNK nowadays for the status quo
the need for UNK of state pension ages seems to be all but agreed
the main focus has centred round the age at which the basic state pension and UNK are available and whether some flexibility is desirable
for this reason we will argue for current level basic state pensions and UNK from the age of sixty to both sexes
the present sixty five regime is UNK against men but when in reality it is the women who are in the much inferior position
the fact that families when one woman in six UNK with an entitlement to a full basic pension based on her own level of payments speaks volumes
even when members of occupational schemes women's length of membership generally means that the level of benefit payable will be inferior to men
many people are unaware of that fact
the fact that the basic state pension is not a universal benefit but is based on the level of payment
you have to earn enough for long enough ninety percent of your working life to qualify
consequently we will argue that for the very least we need current levels of basic state pension and UNK and see that they are available to both men and women from the age of sixty
the conclusions are discrimination must end at the earliest opportunity for both men and women changes should include a full and p proper consultation exercise
for those in occupational schemes there should be a provision that if a person so wishes they should be allowed to work to sixty five without any loss of pension rights
i move
congress president ed westminster trade union political UNK branch of the london region seconding the composite
congress this composite is about a UNK a UNK by the tory government of men and women over their working lives women in particular who have been contributing their stamp all their working lives and are now being told that there is a danger that they will not get their state pensions at sixty
conference it is absolutely vital that those people are protected
we must ensure that we campaign as hard as possible that sixty becomes the state pension age for all our members men and women
congress if as a trade union and if as a labour movement you stop going forward in campaigning there's only one thing that happens you start to go backwards because this government will always try and take from working class people all the time
we must campaign strongly to ensure that men and women still have a state pension that isn't just a UNK at sixty
i second
president congress john supporting composite twenty six
we trust the c e c to campaign vigorously against the tory party proposal of increasing women's pension age to sixty five
this tory proposal must be seen by one of the most unacceptable and UNK acts of this government
look at what they've done given nine billion to their wealthy friends to move them into private pensions supported pension holiday because company funds are so big increased national insurance so we're all paying more even though we get less and compare this with the disadvantage women first
very few enjoy a personal pension very few enjoy an occupational scheme the greater majority gain nothing from UNK only one in six receive a full state pension
so you have on the one hand handouts to the rich on the other hand money taken from the poor
a typical UNK tory policy wouldn't you say
a policy supported by their backing group the c b i both in the game of using frightening tactics in attempt to prove their case saying whilst they would like to UNK pensions to sixty it simply can't be afforded claiming it would cost upwards of forty billion and adding the usual this cost will damage the economy
whilst we all agree they know how to damage the economy we also know that the cost of UNK at sixty would be no more than ten billion
now it's funny but same amount as they have spent on persuading their wealthy friends to take out private pensions
congress we are bound to come to only one conclusion that UNK pensions to sixty will be of benefit to all people and the tories are definitely not supporting that approach
and those in UNK positions the rest of us just don't count
support our motion don't let this UNK lot get away with this policy
let's tell the people and do this with an effective national campaign
thank you
colleagues could i just advise congress at this stage what we're we've gotta do erm and i think this will form the basis of what we're trying to do to UNK business during the course of the week
we're gonna take groups of motions together and in this particular section the next one will be motion three six nine which will have movement seconded motion three seventy three seven one three seven two and then composite twenty seven
now there are several of those that will require a statement being accepted by the executive but there'll be a statement on behalf of the c e c and there's at least one where there'll be a qualification
so at the end of the debate i'm gonna ask the c e c speaker in this case it will be the general secretary john to UNK reply to the whole of the er the debate
so not saying that will be the situation in every case but certainly there will be a number of occasions during the week er when that kind of arrangement will apply and hopefully it will help us to get through the business a little bit er quicker
i now call the mover of motion three six nine standing charges to be moved by the lancashire region and if there is a seconder if he or she could come down
president conference with the introduction of v a t on gas and electric bills this motion becomes even more important
it was bad enough when pensioners had to pay the standing charges on their gas water and telephone bills
it is even worse now that they have got to pay v a t on those bills as well
these pensioners have to pay standing charges whether or not they use the service just to ensure that they can use the service when needed
the telephone is very often the only link these loyal citizens have with the outside world they can no longer walk in safety to the local telephone box to make their calls and even if they could when they get there it is out of order
it is pensioners in particular who paid for british telecom when it was owned by the state their taxes UNK that the telephone system in the u k it became amongst the best in the world
we owe it to these people and british telecom UNK it to these people just let them pay for what they use get rid of the standing charge
i move
seconder
formally seconded thanks very much
motion three seventy television licences
lancashire region to move again
i know
well up twice in the first day er sorry UNK lancashire region moving motion three seventy
president conference as i say up twice in the first day it's a UNK conference that starts with motion three seventy and works backwards to number one it's better than UNK really
seriously though motions like this one have been debated over and over again
anybody who UNK with giving the pensioners the right to watch t v without having to pay a licence charge is either the english football manager hoping to god nobody sees the team playing or is a UNK player wanting to protect our old older members of the community from an early grave
let's not be tight let's not UNK those who have paid into the system all their lives a bit back
let them watch television if they want when they want free of charge
i move
president congress i've gotta up and say to you i had i've had to borrow the wife's glasses this morning cos i left mine in the car
could we have your name
oh you certainly can richard it's bill lancashire region er seconding motion three seventy television licences
my television licence is a colour television and it costs me eighty three pound for this year
in nineteen eighty seven it cost fifty seven pound this has increased by almost twenty nine per cent in the last five years
when the government broke in broke the link between the r p i and the old age pension they must have known that this kind of rise would not be paid by our pensioners
many of the millions of unemployed will also have trouble in finding the cash for this particular commitment
many would also object to this kind of contribution to john 's wage packet
the television for many old people who are afraid to go out at night an important link with the outside world and the sources of UNK entertainment
many of the youngsters unemployed cannot afford to go out seeking entertainment and a television is an important part to them
this motion has been before this congress before and i am still pleased to be here to second this motion
john major's classless society is a pipe dream for without money there are no grounds for freedom of choice or opportunity
it is er it is closer to a nasty video let's make things a little more UNK for those who are out of work or are elderly
pensioners who have given a UNK service to the nation should not be asked to pay for a t v licence and those out of work through no fault of their own except for a government policy
congress i second
motion three seven one pensions southern region to move
thank you dick
charlie southern region and a pension fund trustee
we have heard quite a lot colleagues about pensions and pension schemes over the last eighteen months perhaps we have to actually thank mr maxwell for raising the issue even if those pensioners he UNK won't thank him
there are even now other issues on the pensions debate we have employers like telecom using pension funds to fund redundancies we now even have the government looking to see if they can get hold of pension fund money in british rail and in the coal board to see if they can also fund job losses
these issues have been well raised and UNK over the last few months i would like to now raise another issue that i don't think has been UNK enough that is the issue of under provision in old age
this was very common in the past and i'm sure many shop stewards here who've dealt with redundancies in the past know about the poor members who get quite a nice lump sum redundancy but in fact they've only been in pension schemes a short while so they can't provide for themselves in old age once they've spent the redundancy money
now that has been addressed particularly by the g m b and we've UNK to have pension funds in employ with employers to be open to all so everybody can join pension funds
we've got a number of good pension funds that ordinary working people can join but the issue that has come about since compulsory competitive tendering privatization is those members UNK been in pension funds for maybe twenty five years now they're out on the open job market with the wonderful UNK world that we live in with a free market and they can't afford to make adequate pension provision for themselves
this time bomb is ticking away colleagues and in about twenty years' time we'll be back to where we were we'll have a lot of people who've got small pensions based on their previous employment with a health authority or a local authority british gas or the electricity companies then they've had to go out on the open market and they will be under funded and have inadequate pension when they retire
but what they will have is a small pension that will be preventing them getting state benefits and they will be in the poverty trap
now i don't believe that this issue has been UNK wide enough it's understood by a lot of people what the problems are going to be these problems aren't gonna occur in the next ten years they will happen in twenty years' time
now i believe it's the duty of the g m b and the trade union movement to first UNK the problem then we need a campaign and a strategy to avoid it and that is going back to decent pension funds
now the state has already got a problem because in the next century it will have insufficient people at work to pay for old age pensions we already know mr UNK is doing a pension review and is looking about only targeting it to the UNK at the bottom well that means a lot of people like you and me will miss out on state pensions
if we'd been forced like myself i believe in a couple of years' time i will not be able to enjoy the pension fund that i'm in at the moment we will have a problem and we need to deal with that problem and we need to raise the issue now and have a strategy and i think it's the g m b's to take a leading role in looking at this
thank you
thank you giles
is three seven one seconded
er it's formally seconded brother
congress president dennis southern region
er as charlie just pointed out it is of great concern and it's a time bomb that is definitely ticking away
having been employed now for british gas for the last twenty five years er i've got seventeen years of UNK service which has only just been negotiated through the g m b since nineteen eighty to nineteen ninety three and now it is probably one of the better pensions company pension schemes in the country
now i'm fortunate i've actually got seventeen years come july when the m c reports back on british gas might split it up into seven thirteen fifteen different companies
where is my pension fund going then
i'm gonna need a pension when i reach the age of sixty five i recommend that we support this motion and vigorously campaign for pensions for everybody on an equal status
i second
motion three seven two pension funds to be moved by lancashire region
UNK lancashire region moving motion three seven two
congress the motion is calling for changes in the law to protect workers' pension rights
it is clearly unacceptable that workers' pensions are open to such abuse by the employers
it is not satisfactory that workers' pension funds remain vulnerable to the UNK
the law must be UNK and operate on an open basis rather than under a UNK of UNK
employers are using pension fund contribution holidays to boost profits rather than improve benefits
brothers and sisters the maxwell scandal was only the tip of the UNK of the UNK in UNK the UNK of the current pension laws excuse me
john remember the importance of winning the seven demands in the pension charter the key one was pensions equal pay and therefore members need majority control of the trustees that run the scheme
let's stop the rip off
i move
mr president delegates graham lancashire region seconding motion three seven two
i endorse the need for and the urgency of our union to UNK the campaign prevent the contributions of our members being used as a corporate UNK fund
the UNK of this government to introduce legislation only UNK my belief that the scale of the UNK type fraud is far greater than any of us ever imagined
for the prospect of a retirement pension for all those presently under fifty years of age is looking UNK we must protect the pension rights of all contributing members we must insist that trustees are elected from the shop floor and not appointed by some UNK director who may not even UNK in this country
we must never again allow now that we're all too UNK aware of the consequences any company to UNK and UNK any working man or woman after a UNK from the right to a happy and UNK and financially secure retirement
i second the motion
thank you very much colleague
composite motion twenty seven pensions fund law lancashire region to move and second
duncan lancashire region moving composite er twenty seven
er it's a bit difficult coming on the end of a debate cos everyone's nicked your speech by the time you get here
i mean i want to start with pensions pay and er basically what's happening is that everyone's suffering pay cuts er and er th what the government is doing is first of all is attacking the state pension scheme er and it's allowing er employers to continue to rip off occupational pension schemes and er since it's pay and it's our pay we wanna make sure we control it and i don't see why the employers should be allowed to continue to exploit er us both at one both in terms of the pay we get now and the pay we get when we retire whether it be at sixty whether it be er whenever we wish to er retire and er i think it's very important if the government is er committed to crime prevention that it actually starts doing something about those for those employers and maxwell has been er referred to already he's just the tip of this very big UNK er and er up and down the country people are suffering substantial thefts of pay er employers are UNK organizing wages UNK that's what this er pension fraud is all about and it's about time that our government actually got round er and tackled this very important corporate crime issue that's actually going on at the moment and er i think that it's very important that we ensure that we're involved in er managing our own pension sch p pension funds and therefore we should be pushing through demands of the er th the charter for pension fund democracy and ensuring er that the government actually UNK to what we're saying and actually er comes up with answers why we cannot have the right to control our pay cos i can i can't see an any reason that they come back and say why democracy why they can't why they won't allow us to have a greater say and control our own pension funds and that's i think is a legitimate demand that we should be campaigning for up and down the country
so er in terms of composite twenty seven it's a very simple resolution and it's basically saying we should be supporting the er demands of the er campaign for pension fund democracy and the charter and that we should abandon the committee takes those on those demands and er we should be campaigning for that very important issue which is affecting increasingly millions of people up and down this country not just the p the er the maxwell pensioners
now we'll see what the government does in response to er all their friends who are going bankrupt in the lloyds er cos er that in that scandal on the one hand you've got the government trying to save its neck with its forty four mps who've had their had their hand in the till at the same that they're doing that they won't actually meet the just demands of people who've worked all their lives to actually have some sort of security in the future and that's the UNK er sort of double standards they're gonna try and er and use to get off the hook on that one because they owe people in this country a decent we should have the right to a decent pension and security employment and er with this campaign we should be we should be concentrating on as a major issue for this union in the forthcoming year
thank you i move
UNK lancashire region seconding composite twenty seven
president congress we know that the tory government UNK er agenda is to abolish state pension thus more and more people will UNK have to rely on private and company pension
we need to have strict laws protecting our members' pension funds
the media has highlighted UNK abuse of pension funds to prop up his UNK businesses there's potentially hundreds of employers like maxwell
within our UNK branch there have been two recent cases of such abuse one being UNK where an employer took sixty thousand pounds out of the pension fund and put it into UNK which at the time was in financial difficulties
subsequently the company went into UNK and left our pension holders with less than UNK pensions
so it's UNK that we can achieve to get trustees onto pension fund bo pension fund bodies to stop er employers UNK the pension fund and finally we commend the g m b's submission to the good re good committee and hope that the g m b's submission becomes law in the not distant future
i
i second
well as i indicated earlier colleagues i now call the general secretary to respond to the debate
john general secretary UNK on behalf of the c e c well we used to think whatever else was gonna change at least the pensions were secure but as this UNK debate shows not any more
duncan said it i think there is now a two UNK attack on our pensions
unscrupulous employers mean minded government
every week brings a new pension scandal
UNK has just given you one example i'll give you one of the others
UNK food
the pension scheme has a massive surplus so what does the management do
they take five million pounds out of the scheme as a refund they give themselves a five year contribution holiday and not one penny of that improvement goes to the members
so the inland revenue gets a bonus the company gets a UNK back and the members get nothing at all
and the g m b demands that when the good committee report it makes such behaviour illegal
as motion twenty seven has said so clearly it's the members' money
we support motion three seven two on the basis that the majority of trustees should be representatives of the pension fund members and any surplus should be spent not by the employer at the employer's own UNK but by agreement
after all we don't allow employers to take money out of our bank accounts and they have no right to take money out of our pension funds
security of pensions is fundamental to a UNK society
we don't believe that pension rights should be undermined by privatization or by c t we agree with motion three seven one but add one qualification the best way to provide protection for members threatened in this way is to force the government to honour its obligations under european law and push for pensions to be included in the regulations
and then there's the second UNK of the attack the government offensive
make no mistake about it by all the processes of the government propaganda machine by UNK flying and carefully placed links the government is trying to UNK us up to the idea of increasing the state pension age for women to sixty five
they UNK on about equality when really what they mean is a down grading of women's rights
we've had a lot about politics this morning and if the labour party wants to mobilize working women many of them who didn't vote labour at the last election here is a ready made campaign to take into the next election
mary ed john they all said it
composite twenty six is right
we should reject this government UNK and campaign for a pension age of sixty for everyone men and women with proper protected rights for women
lastly a word about our members in the coal industry which charlie mentioned
they have the worst of both UNK a government who wants to attack their pension rights and an employer willing to do the government's bidding
very strange story this
heseltine had to find a subsidy to stop the coal revolt by tory UNK a short term subsidy to the coal industry
that subsidy cost remember this figure five hundred million
the government then told the coal board to hold back nearly five hundred million that it was due to pay into the coal industry pension scheme
so it looks as if our coal members are being forced to fund the government subsidy there can't be much UNK behaviour than to pay your own money to get the government off the hook of making your own members and your colleagues redundant
of course the government denies it all
in a letter to me government minister tim says better quote this exactly because er government ministers always tell the whole and complete truth we know that experience the issue of the pension fund money he says is quite separate from the subsidy that the coal industry which will be financed by the exchequer
of course it is
it just happens to be the same amount at exactly the same time but how nice of him to explain and how silly of us to be taken in by this string of UNK
but just to be on the safe side we're taking the coal board to court
we don't yet know whether the coal board's action is illegal but sure as hell it ought to be
so the advice from the c e c e c is support UNK twenty six and twenty seven support motions three six nine and three seventy support three seven one and three seven two with the qualifications given support the campaign for pension fund democracy and let's work hard to clean up the pension scandal in britain
thank you very much
as the general secretary indicated colleagues all the motions are being accepted so i now put them to the vote
all those in favour of composite motion twenty six against that's carried
motion three six nine all those in favour against that's carried
motion three seventy all those in favour against that's carried
motion three seven one all those in favour against that's carried
motion three seven two all those in favour against that's carried
composite motion twenty seven all those in favour against and that's carried
thanks very much indeed colleagues
we now turn to the benefit systems and in this particular group colleagues we're gonna call the following motions motion three eighty motion three eight one motion three eight two motion three eight three and motion three eight four
it will be the same procedure and then i'll ask for john er to a statement on behalf of the central executive council
i now call motion three eighty privatization of s p and s m p lancashire region to move
willy lancashire region
president congress i ask this congress to do all in their power to campaign on behalf of all sick members and pregnant women regarding the breakdown in the control over sickness and maternity benefits employers are UNK their employees of millions of pounds since the UNK privatization of the benefits
accounts are no longer controlled so the system has broken down so says the auditor general sir john
sir john who investigated whether payments were correct found errors in one in three cases and two areas
there were also large UNK th these UNK to UNK four hundred and fifteen thousand pound in sickness benefits
the privatization which handed over administration of benefit payments to employers was the UNK of sir norman do i need to say more
in nineteen ninety one sir john stated that the average UNK for maternity benefit was two hundred and forty pound per person
i ask you do you know anyone that has been UNK
more like UNK
so i ask this congress to watch closely this benefits agency and let's make sure that the sick and maternity grants get paid correctly to what they are entitled to
i move
thanks very much
will the seconder for three eighty
formally seconded thanks very much
motion three eight one unemployment benefit lancashire region to move is it formally moved
formally moved
formally seconded
formally seconded
thanks very much
motion three eight two benefits northern region to move
president congress alan northern region moving motion three eight two benefits
congress fourteen years of tory rule have taught our people many bitter lessons
they have witnessed jobs destroyed services UNK opportunities wasted
in no area colleagues is the despair caused by tory UNK more UNK clear than in the area of welfare benefits
as our economy has declined as our recession has turned to a UNK increasingly it is the low paid the sick the disabled and the unemployed who have been forced to pick up the tab for the tory policy failure
congress as we all know the latest tory plans have once again hit the least well off
to cut entitlement to unemployment benefit to tax invalidity benefit and to mean test benefits congress such a tax most vulnerable in our society must be opposed by the trade union movement
motion three eight two calls upon the c e c to adopt a clear policy to resist the attacks on the poor and to launch a campaign to defend our people
i urge congress to support motion three eight two and to demonstrate clearly our belief the least well off in our society should not be forced to pay the price of tory failure re to UNK the UNK industry
congress i move
president congress gerry northern region seconding motion three eight two
congress as we all know the failed economic policies of the government has pushed our nation to the very edge of UNK
our UNK annual deficit budget now stands at fifty million pounds
against such a background colleagues our nation has only one choice get rid of major's UNK first
we need to invest we need to encourage research and development we need to provide quality training
in short congress we need to build out of recession because only by building and by investment can we reduce unemployment and cut the UNK budget deficit
faced with such a UNK choice however the tories as we all know have found another way they plan colleagues to cut benefits to reduce entitlement to unemployment benefits and to d tax invalidity
that congress is an insult it's like making a victim of crime pay compensation to the UNK
colleagues the g m b should resist the tax on the poor on the victims of tory policy
i urge you support motion three eight two
mr president i second
motion three eight three reduced t v licences er lancashire region to move
UNK lancashire region moving motion three eight three
president congress well third time lucky eh
all my motions on the first day
wherever you go nowadays be it swimming the pictures fitness centres or pop concerts they all appreciate that the unemployed cannot afford to pay the full charge
they have all introduced a discount scheme to enable those unfortunate enough not to have a job not to have a proper job the same access to all these facilities as those in work
for the vast majority of these people unemployment is a direct consequence of a government who only cares about those who have and could not care less about those who have not
when you are unemployed there is not much left after the job centre and the twenty third job application form to occupy your time
television is at least one escape and just like all the other trivial UNK should allow the unemployed to participate at a reduced rate
i move
mr president congress bill lancashire region
this is gonna be done from the heart there's no nothing being put there in front because when you see what i've got and what my branch has achieved working with unemployed people your branch UNK and that lady up there twenty seven years in this union we started this football team it was this dream that i had and i come from UNK which is not far from which is UNK with drugs burnt out cars people UNK each other and of course
just across the river we've got manchester city
this gentleman behind me and myself i beg you pardon did i say manchester city
i thought meant manchester united
this lad behind me dick and myself we're both city fans
don't tell everybody for god's sake
they're proud of it never mind what you said before unite UNK city wouldn't do what
give over
i've got a piece of UNK on the floor that i never thought i'd see
it's called the UNK shield and it's a local amateur thing UNK and district and to win it it's like winning the f a cup and this g m b team that we started we lost about three or four matches and we started losing the players so when you don't lock the doors and you'd end up with about seven players and you'd think is it worth UNK
course it's worth UNK because a lot of young men that was unemployed come down to the school where i'm the UNK and they said we know that you're running short is there any chance of getting in on the scene
so they got in on the scene and i seen young men that was walking the streets that had nowt to do put a football kit on with g m b written across the front turn out and become super human beings you never seen nowt like it they were so pleased to associate with like something like that
i just want to end up by saying i know it's all about reduction for unemployed and the telephone this union has worked very hard with the community in UNK throughout the country if you just give me a moment mr president i'll get this unclear
is this is this what's known as UNK licence bill
did you say telephone or television then
television
oh television right if that's real silver then i'll have that
it is real silver
colleagues this is the g m b at work in the lancashire region working with the unemployed
thanks
thanks very much indeed bill
motion three eight four telephone assistance for the elderly g m b scotland to move
and if there is a seconder if he or she could come down please
morning team congress jackie scotland
it is to the shame of this tory government that er our senior citizens have to struggle to feed and UNK themselves and to try to keep warm and as inadequate pensions that they receive from this government if you compare the way in the other european countries what they get and what the british government gives to our old age pensioners our senior citizens they're more they're worse off than actually second class citizens
but over and above this is a terrible fact that despite what they are already putting up with they've got more they've got the seventeen percent coming on their
if they're a pound over they've still got to pay the money
why are they doing this
if they heard a knock at the door or if they heard shouting and UNK in the street but there's nothing they can do what we're asking for here is and i'm asking for support is a phone to the people who cannot afford one whereas if they hear something they can phone the police or they can phone the support unit because are two people staying together in this day and age where they cannot walk in the streets they're attacked even in broad daylight going to get their pensions never mind at night time
what i'm asking for is that we keep this approach up to fight this government to give er our senior citizens a better chance in this life cos a lot of us here would not be here today if it wasn't for the senior citizens who brought us up
what we're asking for is a phone to the people who can't afford it to the police stations
it would only cost the b t very small and a telephone unit
now up in glasgow we've got a strathclyde labour authority who's actually putting schemes like this in
if it's alarm systems if the alarm goes off they phone the person in the house
if the woman answers citizen in britain not just in certain areas and i move for support
is there a seconder for three eight four
formally seconded
thank you very much
i now call john to put the
yep
president conference UNK lancashire region
er i come up to draw the president's attention erm to a problem we have within the delegation and that is that when er dick called the mover of resolution three eight one in the name of the lancashire region john who was going to move the resolution was in fact sat in his seat within the delegation
unfortunately john does suffer from a hearing UNK which er causes him loss of hearing and apparently when he puts his hearing aid in the speakers are causing some interference and a whistle within his ear
he's got the hearing aid out and unfortunately he didn't hear the president call motion three eight one and in view of that i jumped in and formally moved it to erm save the motion falling and i would ask you with your UNK if john could come along and move motion three eight one
thank you
well i mean the motion actually has been moved i do take the point i mean it's a fair point but erm not sure where john's sat at the back yes
where you going john
did yeah
did somebody tell him i was speaking
okay well look we are we are a little ahead of time and it we're certainly gonna complete the business but so on this particular occasion
providing he doesn't UNK the bloody rostrum of course
right john
mr president congress is the UNK system working or not
i knew he was gonna ask me that
i knew he was gonna say that
well
three eight one you're on john
mr john told me last year he paid a lot of money for all this and it's still not bloody working
but i'll get on to my resolution which is unemployment benefit and i'll say this it's a bloody disgrace and i mean it
and for unions to stand by and it's bloody unbelievable
you work forty years of your life you're made redundant all that time you paid insurance tax and after twelve months they've got the UNK to take money you paid all your life off your unemployment and throw you on income
that's all i'm saying
thanks john
the motion was formally seconded colleagues so i now call john to put the c e c position john
i was hoping dick i'd get one with no light on
john UNK to these resolutions on behalf of the c e c before i kick off i to reply to them i put at the top of my UNK notes three words poverty hardship and loneliness and i think those three words UNK and sum up what the majority of these resolutions are all about in this UNK society that we've lived in er under in the last fourteen years
if i can pick up with motion three eight zero which refers to the UNK of sat statutory sick pay and statutory maternity pay the c e c would like reference back on this for the very basis that the point is they do still remain state benefits and those who qualify them for them are legally entitled to do so
we ask for reference back so that a closer look can be taken at these problems in the administration of the benefits
when i move on to three eight one three eight two there's a lot of things been said about these benefits this morning which doesn't leave much left for me but looking at the situation of the way this tory government has in the last thirteen years certainly since nineteen eighty two crucified the benefits paid genuinely to people is in itself a crime upon society and it reminds me of the words of the song it's the rich that get the UNK and it's the poor that get the blame and nothing but nothing has changed since those words were written many years ago
since nineteen eighty two when they took away the related earnings from the unemployment benefit they have introduced a further nine UNK steps to the plight of the unemployed and now the proposals as has already been pointed out they now have a look because there's a fifty billion pound shortfall at how they can best tackle the sick and make them pay as well as people who are struggling to keep a roof over their head
we ask you to accept these two resolutions
on the reduced t v licence fees well i think we all recognize that everybody who's unemployed isn't living in the lap of luxury drinking ten double UNK a day hitting the UNK with a top hat and tail on the only pleasure especially people who've got young children to bring up is the television and such is the price of the licence nowadays that in order to sustain that other things in the family are going short
this again is an UNK on our society when people are being forced into that position again the c e c asks you to accept this
on the standing charges regarding motion three eight four for the rent free telephones for our senior citizens it is really an extension of three seventy but the c e c asks to while you while you accept this resolution ask for a qualification on the motion
we say it is unclear why free phones should only be issued for incoming and outgoing calls and for nine calls
what we are saying there are other UNK and i get down to the word loneliness now is there any reason why senior citizens shouldn't have the facility whereby they can make telephone calls if those they so desire to members of the family who in many instances they haven't seen for long periods of time
there are many people who live in houses on their own can't get out and again it's an UNK on our society when you hear and read about the telephone profits that er that b t are making
i don't consider it is wrong in this day and age that it is wrong to try to UNK and give to our retired people every decent condition that is going in order to enable them to live their the way they are entitled to do
on that basis chair and having got this off my chest i'm gonna get me bucket and spade and i'm gonna go to the beach this afternoon
thank you
john we've got business this afternoon
right colleagues er motion three eighty the c e c as john has indicated are seeking reference
does the mover accept reference
congress agree
thanks very much
motion three eight one c e c are recommending your acceptance all those in favour against that's carried
motion three eight two c e c are recommending you to accept it all those in favour against that's carried
and motion three eight four c e c are recommending you to accept it all those in favour against and that's carried
colleagues that in fact concludes the morning's business we're about twelve minutes ahead of time
just before we break can i remind all women delegates officers and guests there will be the reception to be held at twelve thirty to two UNK clock in the lord UNK hall in the UNK
the bad news is it's a cash bar attendance by ticket only please do your best to be there
now colleagues refreshments and the exhibition halls are stationed in the north and south reception areas on the first floor of the UNK
can i please urge you to visit the exhibition hall during the course of congress
congress stands adjourned till two p m this afternoon
thank you very much
right next piece of advice
er if you've got formulae when you set them up you should set them up so that you can copy them
erm here i've got some formulae calculating production figures er we've got different quarters formulae found are somewhat similar er there's a so that i can copy one to any of the other adjacent cells outside will work i don't have to edit the formula or do anything to it soon as i copy it it's alright for that cell
so it helps first of all when you're setting up the spreadsheet i suppose you can create one formula then copy it instead of having to edit each one individually erm but later on you might accidentally or maybe deliberately in some cases UNK a cell and er if you have to put it back again and what you probably do is copy it from the adjacent cell and then you have to study the formula to try and understand it and then edit it if it wasn't the UNK formula and er it may take a little time to edit it but it could take you a lot longer to understand it
at the time of creating the formula you're probably fairly clear about how it works but several weeks or months later you've forgotten an awful lot
so er it only takes you a second to er copy from an adjacent cell but it could take you a minute or two to get that formula working again if it's not UNK erm it would probably only takes you an extra few seconds er when you're actually building the formula to make it UNK in the first place so it's well worth investing a few extra seconds up front to save you maybe a minute or so later on
erm something else that i may well do with this spreadsheet as well i can UNK is insert an extra
product we've just got one row for one product at the moment but in the future you might want to insert another row and er the product b and then all i would need to do is just copy the formula down and i know it would work cos i made it UNK down as well
i don't need to copy it down when initially build it but er i might just put a little bit of extra work in i can make so and can copy it down
so make all your formulae UNK left and right and up and down
how do you do that
er in most cases the vast majority of cases you erm need to use the UNK
are you familiar with using the dollars in the formulae
are you familiar with er what this c dollar four means
and what does dollar g three mean
what does the dollar g three mean
i thought it was just an absolute on one of those not all
so you put dollar in front of the column or the row or both
yes
three options i suppose or neither i suppose there's four options er so what does the dollar g three mean
if it sticks with g then it might go down to g four or g five
yes that's right so if you copy the formula then they erm the g will always stay as a g no matter where you copy it to but if you copy the formula to another row you copy it from the cell below then the three becomes a four and er this one
means the four never change if you copied the formula
the c can change if you copy it to another column and the c put it to the right the c changes to a d if you put a dollar in front of them both then neither can change
so for the majority of formulae that's all you need to do to make the formulae UNK so when i got this extra product to insert just insert the rows copy the formula down and that change is made very quickly indeed i don't have to spend a lot of time understanding and editing the formulae
our little trap there is important that you do all the UNK first
the natural tendency is probably to insert a row copy it down insert another row and copy it down insert a row and copy it down er you need to do all your UNK first and then copy your formulae cos otherwise you end up with wrong formulae
erm take this example here er i've got sales being calculated say units times the price c four times c six now i want to add a product b so i might i might be here and think oh i'll insert a row here and copy the formula and go up to there and insert a row and so on
but if i do that well i copy the c four c six down have c five c seven and then when i go in and insert the extra rows then er well that UNK not going to refer to those new rows that i insert it's still cell the right of price and the right of sales the wrong sales certainly
you must do all the UNK first and then copy down so that you end up with the right formula at the end of the day which is the c five c eight
next topic is on memory
a lot of people are confused about memory as to what it is
they're not quite clear about a bit vague about what it is
i get people calling me up saying erm they've got a memory call problem and er i've deleted a number of files off the disk and the problem didn't go away
well the disk is quite a separate thing from the memory so let me er try and explain what the what the two are
i've got er a file named a b c dot u k one on a disk so it could be a hard disk or a floppy disk it doesn't matter and er when i retrieve the file lotus takes a copy of that file and places it places it into what's known as the memory of the computer
do you know what memory looks like
have you seen memory if you saw it would you recognize it
yes
inside the computer if you open up the computer you see these little chips UNK chips they're about a centimetre perhaps in length and you'll see a row of nine or ten of them that's physically what the memory is
you might see several rows depends how much memory your UNK got in it
erm that's where your file is yo you're UNK copies of them removing copies that puts the copy into the memory
so when you're looking at a file on the screen what you're looking at is the file as it is in the in the memory of the computer and if you change your spreadsheet then all you're doing is changing what's in the memory
you're not changing anything that's on the computer at all
sorry not you changing anything that's on the disk
the only time you change what's on the disk is when you save the file
lotus then takes a copy of the file that's in the memory and UNK the one that's on the disk the only time you change what's on the disk
if you get a memory full error it means you've run out of space here
if you get a disk full error message it means that you've run out of space on your disk
so if you get a memory full error UNK files off your disk of course is not going to make any space
memory is a bit of a UNK erm because if you switch the computer off and switch it back on again the file won't be there any more because it hasn't remembered it
the disk however does remember keeping the file there if you switch the computer off your hard disks will keep the file there floppy disks of course keep the files on the disk
so that's why you need to save frequently
there's all sorts of accidents not only having the computer switched off you might accidentally mess the file up or erase it or whatever er you've still got the original copy on the disk so if you keep saving it every ten minutes or so then you always lose more than ten UNK work
how do you know how much memory you've got on your p c
i know i've got enough memory
yes so when you're getting low on memory the bottom of the screen the little red m e m appears telling you you're very low about to run out er so how can you check how much memory you have got when you're in one two three
well if you do UNK status actually the screen is a little bit different from two point four but it's looking similar like this
er you get two rows saying conventional memory and expanded memory and two numbers
that's how much memory you had to start with three hundred and twenty thousand bytes and that's how much you've got left two hundred and eight thousand bytes i if you've got a spreadsheet in memory so it's using up some of the memory
erm what's a UNK
or what can you put in a UNK
how much can it hold
sorry
how many bits
so many
what's a bit then
you've heard it somewhere or other
oh that's right yes well we'll come to that yes er well a UNK is a bit not that means a lot er what's a bit
it's a zero or a one everything in computers is stored as zeros or ones
a bit is an UNK of binary UNK something about what it means erm and eight of them together makes a UNK
a UNK is enough space to store a single character a letter
now everything in computers is stored away as er numbers and a certain set of numbers represent all the different characters
an a is a sixty five and other numbers are sixty five
er if i remember erm so erm that gives you a indication of how much space you can provide erm we've also got some called expanded memory expanded memory an i'll be explaining the difference between the two
erm oh you mentioned er UNK and things
what's er k you know the word k
what's k
k UNK
UNK
what is it
how many bytes does it
it's approximately a thousand
it's not exactly is it
does anyone know the precise number
a thousand and twenty four
a thousand and twenty four yes and you want one k equals a thousand and twenty four bytes
there's a strange number one o two four
not a strange number to a computer though
do you know what's special about one o two four
it's er
the power of two
yes it's the power of two
it's te it's two to the power of ten
two times two time two times two
but to a computer it's a very round number
what's the next up from a k
a UNK which is an UNK of
UNK and i the size of it
what is it
approximately that is
precisely it's
one o two four
one o two four times one o two four
it's a bit
you know what the next level up is after UNK
it's usually referred to as UNK
computer bytes
yes
computer bytes
that's right
which is what
one o two four
i don't suppose anyone knows the level up
yes that's right
how do you know that
twenty five years ago
used them
oh right
right that's error bytes yes
er disks on your p cs are known normally measured in UNK or your memory on your p c might be measured in UNK
you're using up a lot more disk space than you are memory space
on a typical p c you might have a hundred UNK disk
do you know how big your disks are
do you know how to find out a memory
i don't know what machines you got
four UNK is typical these days for memories
they tend to have a lot more disk space than memory
erm to find out how much disk space you've got
how big your disk is
how much you've got left
you can type ch disk c h k d s k er press enter
the disk will UNK around for a few seconds and then you get the rows of statistics
disk is fifty six million bytes in size and er you used most of them down to three million left available
erm you might can you do us
you might get a message like this telling you you've lost some of your UNK
have you ever lost any of your UNK
er if you've got dos five or six then er it doesn't say UNK it says allocation units erm it's bits of your disk that er been er reserved as UNK by dos
it's not being of any of any er anything in there that's of any use
so what you really need to do is to free it up
make some free disk space available er yet if you haven't done this check the disk for er six months or more you probably have quite a lot of disk space i would imagine that could be freed up
so what you do is to type check disk space slash and then it asks you wh if it comes up with a question which i expect it may well if you've never done this before
tells you about your chain and your UNK and things and it says do you want to convert them into files
you say no
this fact sheet actually says yes here but eh if you say no then er it will free up disk space
could be a free UNK of disk space quite possibly
right so
let's now explain how a memory is used within the spreadsheet
i've got this spreadsheet with the column matters across the top and the row numbers down the side
we've got this red grid over the top of the spreadsheet erm within a single column covering er four rows you've got these little er blocks let's call them erm memory is used in used in columns so er if you put an entry in any one of those four cells there then er within a within a box it will use sixteen bytes of memory
there's nothing else in this whole column so that total column is using sixteen bytes
erm in this column b you put an entry in this block so that uses up sixteen bytes you've also got an entry in this block and that uses sixteen bytes
how many entries in that block but because it's between these other blocks that uses sixteen bytes as well
you've got nothing else in this column so that whole column uses forty eight bytes
that's quite significant
now let me go spreadsheet
let's start off with all of them for your UNK status to see the memory
so at the top there it says conventional memory two seven four o four eight of two seven four o four eight
we'll just ignore the expanded memory at the moment
just look at the conventional memory er if i put an entry in a cell in the first block of this column
then that should use sixteen bytes of your UNK status
and that number on the left has gone by sixteen o three two sixteen there
put an entry in the third block and er with the UNK status again and the number has now gone down forty eight
so sixteen in the first block sixteen for the third block and sixteen for the intervening block
now if i go all the way to the very bottom of the spreadsheet and put some er an entry somewhere near the margin there
now its using sixteen bytes for that block but also sixteen bytes for all the intervening blocks and there's an awful lot of intervening blocks between that and that in your UNK status again
er you see the number on the left is two hundred and forty one thousand and two hundred and seventy four thousand so it's gone down by approximately thirty three thousand bytes
i have only got three cells with any entries
i've used up an awful lot of memory
and er if i was to put entries all the way across the top of this spreadsheet like this and then all the way across the bottom of the spreadsheet do you know how i got to the bottom so quickly by the way
end and a down
end and a down
that's right
erm and now very quickly again because it's filling up all gaps between this bottom row and the top row of the spreadsheet
go into UNK status and just eleven thousand bytes
i'm trying to put an entry in this cell in i eight one nine two but we can't because we were require thirty three thousand bytes and we only have eleven thousand bytes left
it only starts counting from the first row of an entry and stops at the last
so if i've nothing in these first four cells and something in that one and something in that one and nothing below
so for that whole column it's still only using forty eight bytes
if i go back to the UNK layer quite often i get a question
does the UNK layer use up more memory
but as you can see now it doesn't because you're only using memory where you've got the entries
it stops counting there and it stops there
er if you was to put everything on top of each other for example then erm there's probably little gaps between one section and another and those little gaps are using extra memory
so that now i am UNK the amount of memory you could actually use
you can't use less than that i suppose you could things going across that reduces the amount of memory not UNK the layout
instead of UNK rows you mess up all the others
er several entries will use up additional memory as the minimum amount of memory they will get used erm but certain entries don't use any extra memory and in fact in this column here i've put an entry a whole number six seven eight nine ten etcetera into each of these cells and er that column there still only uses forty eight bytes of memory
in certain entries th tha which i'll come to shortly do use extra memory er just say a few things about er the one three of these three of the windows products which er one of you is using erm it uses memory slightly differently er if i put an entry in row one and a ro and an entry on row five one two then yes it er uses memory for that whole range there
but er if i also put something of row fifteen thirty seven then it doesn't use memory for all those rows between there and there
the way it works in three is it only uses memory within these five hundred and twelve row boundaries so any between one and five one two five one three and one o two four one o two five and one five three six and so on it'll fill in the gaps within those ranges but not outside of those ranges
so that spreadsheet is just sorting them all way across the bottom and all the way across the top
er we've not used very much memory at all
that's three of the windows product
erm so other entries will use additional memory if it's er a whole number less than three two seven six eight then no additional memory will be used
but if you put a number that's bigger than that or it's got any decimals to it then er you'll use eight bytes for each number additional eight bytes for each number
so if in a one to a four you got the numbers one hundred thousand that'll use sixteen bytes for the block plus four times eight forty eight a total for this cells
erm labels will use additional memory
er six bytes across the number of characters over the four characters
er the entry that uses the most memory is er a formula
even a very simple formula a plus and a will use an additional thirty two bytes and the longer the formula more entries in the formula
the more the more the more you put in the formula that more memory it takes but even a very simple formula uses up quite a lot of memory
so you'll tend to find on most of your spreadsheets it's the formulae that use up most of the memory
now you're limited to about three hundred and three hundred three hundred and forty k of conventional memory and you can't increase that you can't yo you can buy more memory and UNK it into the p c but er you can't increase your conventional memory available to your spreadsheet much more than let's say about three hundred and forty k approximately
er but what you can do is UNK something called expanded memory
expanded memory and you can have up to twelve UNK so that's er twelve thousand k this is not to scale this is going to be much bigger than that
so sounds fantastic you could make spreadsheet enormous
but unfortunately you can't use more than about probably five hundred k nearly a thousand k but probably about five hundred k on its standard memory
probably about the maximum you can use
even if you've got twelve UNK you can't use them let me explain why erm it uses the sixteen bytes per block solely from conventional memory
it puts only certain things into expanded memory
it puts formulae in that's very useful as i say it's formulae uses up most memory but it doesn't put everything
and the more you put in a spreadsheet the more and more of the conventional memory you are using up and eventually when you fill up your conventional memory you get a memory fault
even if you've got lots of expanded memory left UNK you can't use it once your conventional memory fills up that's it
you get a memory fault
you don't have this problem with problem
erm if you erm maybe erase part of entries of the spreadsheet you think oh that's going to free up a lot of memory er probably it won't
once lotus uses sixteen bytes for the block it doesn't let go of it
if you put an entry in a cell put a number one in the cell then immediately erase it doesn't free up that sixteen bytes for that block
and if you're working on a spreadsheet you may be working on a spreadsheet during the day start in the morning you're working several hours you may find yourself running low of memory then the memory light comes on or you get a memory full up message at some stage and you think oh that's not fair because i haven't made the spreadsheet any bigger
well er all sorts of things cause memory to be used up
er one thing that tends to use up a lot of memory is when you insert columns on the left of the spreadsheets
there's nothing in that new column that you insert but nevertheless it uses enormous amount of memory
it uses up as much memory as any maximum column on the right that uses memory
erm so what can you do
well the answer is pretty simple you save the file and you re retrieve it and when you re retrieve the file erm it UNK the memory to start with and then erm fills up the memory from scratch and if there's nothing there any more then it won't use any memory for it
so you're simply saving
find yourself running low on memory save the file and retrieve it back again
then you may well find a lot any extra memory
er when you use range erase to erase a cell to erase the contents from the cell so that's er put the numbers in the cells here
i'll format out ones to the next two decimals range UNK i'll make that UNK cell the range protects
ah suppose i erase that cell there with range erase then i get rid of the number of course but the cell the cell remains UNK you can still see the f two at the top grid references
that means it er UNK to fixed two decimals and er that counts as an entry as far as memory is concerned
that will cause sixteen bytes to be used in that block
even if you save and retrieve the file it won't free up the memory
and similarly if you've got an UNK cell this one is an UNK cell if i erase it range erase then the number goes but still the cell UNK
how do i know it's still UNK
there's a u
there's a u in the top left hand corner yes
er and that counts as an entry as far as memory is concerned
erm so you would leave what i call this deadwood lying on your spreadsheet cells that are using up memory they're not needed any more erm on many people's spreadsheets i've discovered quite a lot of deadwood using up large amounts of memory like in some people's cases two thirds of the memory used by the deadwood
certainly you need to get rid of it erm you know how to erm get rid of the f two don't you
you gonna tell me
yes that's arrange format UNK could get rid of the f two and you know how to get rid of the
i thought there was more people on that side of the room
ask questions
sorry er what would you do
somebody say something
er changing the global protection doesn't affect the u
range protection
you need to re protect the range protect
erm so if you really want to erm make sure there's no deadwood what you would do is do a range format UNK of the range you want to erase first of all
do a range protect on that same range and then a range erase of that same range
you know it's a lot of UNK having to do all three steps
that's what you would need to do
however there is a tip to erm you can do it in one operation
what you would do is copy a blank cell
so you got a cell that's not got any entry in it is not UNK so you're looking at the panel you can see that there's no nothing in the UNK and there's no u so if you copy a blank cell over what you want to erase
that's the best way to ensure that you've UNK everything
when you've copied the blank erm it's not UNK it's not UNK as well any more so
how can menu
you would still have to save and retrieve the file to create the memory but yes that UNK would be the idea of it
you don't leave deadwood on your spreadsheets cells that are UNK or UNK cos not only do they use memory where you've got the cells but between that and something else
so quite large areas of your spreadsheet could be using up memory unnecessarily
if the UNK full erm is it to stop you putting up your as files is that right
you could save and file yeah
erm that's all very well er saying it now but you might have a lot of deadwood on your spreadsheets er ho how can you get rid of it
well the problem is you don't know where it is
but it's not invisible unless you move the cell UNK around all over the place looking in the top left hand corner
you can't find these deadwood cells
there's not really a practical to move the cell point to around every single blank cell on your spreadsheet
erm one thing you can do is er if you know that there's a certain range in the spreadsheet that's of any use
that's the only part of the spreadsheet that's of any use then you can do file extract formulas
highlight that range and save it to a file
and er into that file you save everything that's within that range so you save the of course the numbers the labels er the column UNK range names
so anything of any use within that range you save into the file you extract to
but anything outside of that range is not
so cells that are UNK with nothing in them cells that are UNK with nothing in them
unless you know the type of deadwood that occurs in many people's spreadsheets is the space character itself
no doubt there's several of you here who are guilty of this
when er when you delete er instead of using range erase you use something else don't you
sorry
is it the space bar
the space bar yes
that's right s so there you go
i knew it would be the case
so as long as you get rid of that one two three four you can press the space bar and then enter
it looks like we've deleted it doesn't it
erm what i've done is i've put a label in the cell
see the label UNK in the top left and following it there's a space that's a space character which is invisible
but it looks like we've deleted it
i it is a character as much as a another letter a is a character
which is an invisible character i thought
you wouldn't go typing UNK all over the place would you but er spaces no problem
and er it's understandable why people do use the spaces it's a nice big key
and if you're just UNK the one cell it's just the two keys
big space bar the key at the front and the big enter key
it's an easy it's a lot less UNK than slash and then trying to find the r and the e and then enter
that's why people do it
erm you can other problems as well with the space characters got no memory
and so i don't recommend you do it
erm in two point four you just do it with one key if you want to delete a cell out that's UNK
just press the UNK key and it's gone
you know about that one
it's a bit dangerous if there's two ways you can accidentally press them and not realizing you've just deleted the contents of the cell
so that's right
so watch out for the UNK key
UNK straight away with no warning
gone
i've pressed it a few times by accident and then needed it
nor normally i just type it in
right any questions on any of this so far
er UNK spreadsheets is also good for getting rid of any deadwood
erm cos what you would do is you would er UNK that whole range that whole range that whole range that one and that one that one that one that one
i know i would never put anything over there or over there or over there over there
knowing quite happily to just rid of all of that
copy a blank erm and that would get rid of any deadwood that there is on the spreadsheet once you've done that and you've got rid of any deadwood
if you hadn't been consistent in laying them out like this then you can't so quite UNK go round go round UNK large UNK of the spreadsheet
and you tend to have less deadwood on a UNK spreadsheet
instead of UNK you can more often will delete whole rows or columns
you don't need that row any more so you delete it
and you do and then you not only remove the contents but the cell UNK and the UNK i'll ignore that we any more
two point four
right so now you understand how the memory works and you obviously realize not to leave big gaps between one thing and something below
erm when you start one two three if you get er the menu at the top saying one two three think about and translate or you just go straight into the spreadsheet you do get the one two three
you're starting er from what's called the access menu
er in dos if you type lotus you get that access menu with one two three translate if yo in dos type one two three the numbers one two three you go straight into the spreadsheet and you have eight k more conventional memory if you do
you don't go through the access menu an eight k conventional memory means could put more into expanded memory more conventional memory you've got the more you can put into expanded memory
right any questions on that
that much expanded memory if you they can only use five hundred k
erm
well they probably don't have that much
do you know anybody that's got that much
erm a lot of people have got maybe five thou three thousand
depends how much ma if you maybe new p c these days it would normally have it already on it four thousand k of memory and three thousand left could be converted to expanded memory but it's not worth it only use five hundred k of it probably
and you might could try a thousand k erm with oth other programs if you start using windows y you need to use the so software called microsoft windows if you're going to use one to four
and yet that would use all of that memory
but er one two is that you can't use all the memory you've got
erm the short section here on useful formulae in fact basically just one formula
it's useful in design
erm i've put a label a b c in one cell d e f in another cell and in this cell b five i've got the formula plus the three UNK b four and th the result of it is this longer label if you join the two labels together to make this label a b c d e f anybody using UNK at all
you have used it
erm what have you used it for
for that sort
that sort of thing right and why did you want to use it
erm let me just demonstrate how it works
a b c d e f you put UNK that
and it's a formula so if you change those cells the formula will be UNK no let's type my first and second names in and er it's the two names together
it doesn't look very good having erm first and the second name without a space between the two but i can actually put a space there if we entered a formula by putting a double quote space another double quote and then another UNK filling the spaces of d six
there we go
so why would you use it er that's have a look at
so i've got a parameters s section that we were talking about before putting all the things that you might change into one part of the spreadsheet
so a department name the admin department a department code one hundred and as i was saying er you wanna to get in the top left hand corner any information that keeps you informed so i wanna get both the department code and the department name into that one cell
you've only got the one cell left available
i need to get both pieces of information into that one cell
and i can do that with this formula
i can do that UNK that or those two cells have got range names the range names
erm if i put a space in it might look a bit better
you don't have to have a space you can have anything you like
that perhaps and i change the name of the department the er s marketing department erm one o two
let's change that
the one o two you might notice here has been entered as a label
if i was to enter it a number one o two
it's a number now on a label then this formula doesn't like it
it says error
cos you can't join a number to a label
by the way you can convert a number to a label with a certain add function
i don't suppose anyone would know
a chart
er it's something like that er is the word that two parts two arguments to the string there's the number b four comma and then a number for the number of decimal places you want in your label so zero so i get a label with three characters here one o two
if i put a two there i'll have an extra three characters and gives me a full stop and two zeros
sorry that change of one number to label
that's a label now yes
see it's left UNK whereas that's right UNK
that's a label
now multiply that by two then er zero on rather than the two
erm so what i can do is to put the b four here inside of that string comma zero
there we go
so that's the use of that
there are many other uses for these formulae
the formulae that work on labels they're never string formulae
the UNK joins one label to another i use the word join erm it's not the official technical word for what it does anybody know what the erm official word for what this does is known as
UNK
yes UNK
it UNK
UNK is the alteration that er the UNK does
UNK a lot
they UNK their variables
if you ever hear UNK talking you might hear them say something like that
have you UNK your variables today
but er these the word joining spreadsheets terms
bit shorter not as funny
so that's the er i want cover in the next section
we'll now have er another test
i'll give you a few minutes to revise then er we can see if the er lesson does anyone know what time the coffee break is er
the UNK just opposite there
right do you know where we er slot the last one
it was just after er page thirty nine so on page forty three onwards right are you ready
er the left started last time so the right can go this time
erm what was my convention for lines
table erm double UNK for the total and full stops for your sub total
yeah
oh yes quite right across almost right not quite
ah UNK
that is
double line at the bottom of the
which side are you on
total yeah he's on our side
that's what i said
single data sub total
double for the total and a row of dots for your sub total
your two lots of double lines
have you got any an answers on that on the right
one of you left sorry on the left you're not on that side are you
no
erm well erm what you said was correct
th the double line doesn't mean necessarily th that the total of it is the end of the sub section the dots sub section
so er i won't give anybody any points
oh
er over to the er left this time
what was my UNK for UNK
how did i do the UNK with the sub titles and totals
well you UNK them
oh no
you have them in the style of how you physically did it
the style yes
no you had yours
i'm not sure
then all your erm your data under underneath your heading you UNK
how much how much was various things UNK
two or three points
so it looks good but it looks alright
alright erm well i remember how do i get a sub title and then a total at the bottom
you know you had the sub title and things UNK below that then a total
so how did i UNK the sub title the detail and th the total line
your first title was UNK the same amount as your first title
right
yes
then your grand total was right over to the left hand side
yes
er oh in the example that i gave yes because it was totalling what the grand total
well a b various sections
er what was it lined up with
what
the grand total or
yes
the grand total
what was
it was lined up with the erm the title of that column
which was the
erm
the actual heading yes
so in the example you're referring to i had like a title and then i had a sub title and further details and another sub title and further details and then i had a total line
yeah
sort of grand total here
so what was that gr the total was totalling everything
the whole of that
so what was that
how here
what was that line here
that one
with the top line
top line
that's the one yes
right that was my
give me about two points for that actually
shall we give them two
erm in the titles of the spreadsheets in the top you know the top rows of the spreadsheet
what did i put where
there was various types of information
are varied UNK
no variable en
there's things
yes that vary and things that don't vary
where did i put them
yeah the thing that varied the less was the top and the most at the bottom and the middle was the middle
yeah
and things that don't vary
bottom
either in the top
er the along the line at the top you know
not the top left
like the date and the time you know along the top right
the right
not yes that's good
that's it
right good
over to this side now erm give me three things that you can do to make it easy t for the eye to see what er particular number is refer w which rows is referring answer to
the UNK one
yes that's one and what every row
you know
wouldn't it
yes
testing
right
inset row
that's one UNK every so many rows
blank rows every so many rows
inset what sorry
a blank row
a blank row yes that's two yes
and put your titles on both sides
put your titles on both sides right
okey doke
put the side
you've
how should you format your spreadsheets
could you UNK that please
erm
on the large side
erm i could guess
i don't think i will
UNK
if you were putting form you wouldn't have to
no i'm talking about the cell UNK you know i can fix two decimal the comma format
how do you set the comma format
load
load
how do you do that
erm range format comma two enter
erm we've got several different answers to the same thing
what's the er how do you do a global format
global formula in
right okay
alright i'll give you that then
on the other side on a new spreadsheet what is the new global format called
brand new spreadsheet
what is it set to
two points
graphs
general
general
right yes
which is what
which is what
UNK
it's called the general formula
yes but isn't the general formula got a
er it's it fits the number you can to be typed one two three point one you'll see one two three point one
oh right
er if you type a very big number you might get the scientific that is what the e thing
erm right
okey UNK right again
erm what's the advantages two advantages of using these global UNK
two erm
that's right
and global
it it's easier to have the global change things come out of the global and change things
yes
it's easy to change things if you say i want three decimals instead of two whenever
change them over and everything
all the global UNK change yes
that's one reason
two reasons
it would be easier than a UNK if you need to check out changing the
yeah
you don't have to format something and put them in
that's right
that's it
right
good to the other side
erm
give me er four pieces of advice in a bag
don't go out after nine o'clock
don't do after nine o'clock
erm
a wise advice about the UNK style you might call it er
don't use more than
don't use more than two yes
okay that's one
oh this thing about landscape and style UNK
give 'em one there yes
two
don't use auto UNK
don't use auto UNK yes
you need one more
don't know i can't think
you know the we got you don't need it on
or is that related to auto UNK
sorry what did you say
don't attach with you
because if you got auto
don't erm right now say erm realize that when you are using it
oh right
not too many lines
yeah okay too many horizontal vertical lines i also mentioned er not UNK the row heights get more on a page
that
okay
erm now over to the right
erm what should you do with the at sum
below that row
below yes
okay
erm on the other side
why
so that if you don't
if you insert a line
at the bottom
total
if you insert a line underneath
right
okay
certainly not right
erm what did i recommend you do with UNK wig
in the case out sum
er well draw a line you do have to have an extra row put on it
so what you could do with it
with the bottom line
what did i say
to the top
at the top
that's right you completely
you can reduce that row
and you could put a line in
at least there are
you can about one and put a line on the top of the total line er afraid that's wrong
what was the question
erm with when you when you drawing a line with UNK wig and you got the at sum below it how should you do it
oh
that's what she said
that's what she said yes but er she got it wrong
yes it they did
oh i don't know
yes that's right
that's one point
but what's the other point
there's also got wrong on this side
about the line
where do you put the line
bottom of the line
on the bottom of the blank line
yes
put on the bottom of the blank line rather than putting it top of the total line
yes because if you do that you know where you've put the insert
right
it's the UNK turn again i think isn't it
right
erm what's a danger with long formulae
UNK the
how can how does the end get chopped off
if you insert more rows than the numbers
cell addresses
cell address get longer
get longer
and they get chopped off where
about to two hundred and forty characters
erm but what do you have to do to chop it off
nothing
if you didn't say anything if you didn't give a me editing for a formula or copy it to somewhere else where the cell UNK are longer then it makes the formula longer and then you get
so the formula get longer okay but it er works alright until you do something
what's that thing something you do that causes it to get chopped off
call f two call it up again
what did you say then
if you press f two
f two that's what i was after yes
if you press f two and then do what
it loses the chopped the end of it
yes
oh so if you don't if you don't call it up to edit it you can keep changing it and it will still stay the same
that's right
oh right confusing
er yes right erm
what did i say about how not to input certain numbers
slightly vague question
what shouldn't you do when you're UNK several different numbers
vague question
it's an easy answer to a vague question
so it does look
you've got several numbers to input
what should you do
too vaguely
several UNK or several numbers
different numbers
you got sales figure and the unit sales
sorry
yeah erm down the individual figures
yes
of one
yeah give you half
oh that's unreasonable
graphs
what was the what was the answer
yeah but they didn't put it down individually on spreadsheet
yeah then put all the all the separate inputs in one cell
you remember when you did that formula hundred divided by an eight brackets something
oh i see oh right
right
erm how cross checks
i want precise details on this
put f formula
f formula right
underneath the two
where do you put your f formula
up in the right hand side of the work in the bottom of your column
okay
yes
and how do you
the erm er the question checking the answer
you put a test in don't you
test
whether it's greater or less
what's the test
if it if it like this then put this answer if not
this is an oral history project tape my name is and i am interviewing of ipswich
this is tape one of recording number two of the ipswich transport project
the date is the eighth of june nineteen eighty seven
right oh thank you mr
mm i wonder if you would start of by telling me where you were born
yes well er i'm ipswich bred and born
i was actually erm born in although most of is gone now for the development of the grounds
the house that i was actually born in is still there number twenty five er after a while i moved across the road to a bigger house when cos my mother had an another son and a daughter and then we moved over to the so when we were quite a bit in the stoke area
stoke area was chosen i suppose because my father worked on the railway and you either worked on the railway or if you lived over stoke it was well known for that
erm twenty second of july nineteen sixteen so i'm a first war baby
i then er we then broke away and went up to the er i suppose it's the i don't know what part of the but it's the UNK that's where i moved to then and then to because my dad couldn't getting on in years he couldn't take the hills up and then from i got married and we moved into this address here and then that was the day after war was declared that i got married
thirty nine
yes yeah fourth of september nineteen thirty nine and course erm the erm and six months after the UNK to the day really i erm went into the forces and served in the army for just over six years
right well did you went to school obviously locally
yes
when did you leave school
well actually i left school i think it was the either tenth or eleventh of november nineteen thirty one and i went straight into the transport department and i think my record will show that i actually started there on the twelfth of november nineteen thirty one
w why is it that you went straight from school into the
well er i
did you apply to go
no i didn't apply i erm although i was interviewed for the job
how it turned out was that we er i was attending the what was called the secondary modern school and we'd moved premises from up to
well i was a bleeding age but i hadn't got a job and erm i decided to keep on and we actually used a lot of our august summer holidays to help move the stuff from to school
i hung on there until well my fifteenth birthday was in the july and it was november before i actually left
what happened was i happened to be in the corridors there and the gentleman came in that's on the friday afternoon gentleman came in and asked to see the headmaster so i took him along to see who was the headmaster then and erm shortly after that i was called up to see and erm asked me if i'd like to apply for this job because had seen me erm bringing me up to bringing him up to see and he said erm well what about that young fella who brought me up there and would he like to apply
so i went down there and er well i suppose fell in love with the job right away
it was good everybody had told me that erm you know you didn't get very much money when you left school about ten shillings and to offer me fifteen shillings i thought was out of this world so erm
wh what did you actually start as
well i suppose a very junior clerk the first job i was given was well it's UNK of in this day and age but what they had was what they call a UNK clock and there every driver and conductor had got a key that was inserted in this clock and on it was his personal number well when he reported for duty he inserted this key into the clock turned the handle and UNK on to a piece of paper a roll of paper his number and the time he reported and the next day it was my job to go through and record from this piece of paper how many minutes they were late f reporting for duty and if they erm were more than i think about three or four minutes we had to send them a memo telling them that's how things were in those days that people were they UNK the line or else
so it was a case there and course at the end of the day you rolled the little roll up put UNK round and stood them up in a file and they stood there like little soldiers and you could always go back to the actual time sometimes you found a man hadn't re erm signed on he'd just gone and joined his bus up in town centre well you that was er subject of another letter
so you know they were very strict in those days
erm that carried on for a while i thought i was doing very well being able to do a job like that
it's the first job i'd ever had you see and then erm i suppose my next job was erm recording the bus mileage
in those days they didn't use UNK what they did was they took any particular route number and the number of journeys they did because in those days a bus kept on a route which applied say between witton and UNK heath all day didn't run around like they do nowadays and erm when the schedules were prepared each bus had got a route number or was placed on a route number say one witton two witton three witton and a copy of its schedule was recorded on another sheet and the mileage having known what the mileage was and we'd used to obtain that from the borough UNK department er i think it was about nine point one four miles a return trip witton and UNK heath er you'd work out how many journeys they did there and say well that bus was due to run a hundred and twenty six miles during the day
well sometimes they didn't do that f for reason perhaps a driver missed his duty or there was a UNK on the bus and you used to get a record each day of what we call lost mileage or an extra mileage perhaps on the odd occasion when an extra journey was run but erm the lost mileage was recorded and say you had this bus was due to run a hundred and twenty six miles it didn't for some reason complete its erm hundred percent journey you'd take that off and then record against that bus that run say hundred and twenty miles
now that was the reason that all this mileage was done because that mileage is the basis for which all statistical information is recorded
speeds per mile pence per mile cost per mile and everything is erm referred back to the mileage run by an undertaking during its year week or what have you
it also in those days was mileage for the tyres was paid on the number of miles run per tyre so at the end of the month you could record you knew what tyres were on a certain bus you knew of how many miles that bus had done so you recorded that particular tyre on that bus had run so many miles and it was that we paid for our tyres that way
i think it was round about a ha'penny a mile in those days
we had to pay er there was two lots of erm tyres there was one set of buses were fitted with and another one with or i forget which it was there but i know those three were involved at some time or other and we used to record the mileage send it off to them showing what each bus ran during the month
how many days it was out of service and this that and the other and erm they used to send us an invoice on the mileage run because at the same time we knew what tyres were on the bus we had to inform them of any tyre changes and they kept records the same as us
so you didn't actually buy the tyres then you were sort of an UNK
no we didn't buy tyres no they were tyre mileage rates and erm mileage was the tyres were paid for on the mileage run
how long did that go on for
oh it did went on for up to the time i retired
it maybe still the same now erm because right up to the time i erm retired we had on occasions to pay for the residual value of a tyre perhaps a bus had been in accident and the tyre had suffered damage which it wasn't possible to repair it or UNK it perhaps a hole had been UNK through the wall they UNK that tyre and we had to pay for the residual value mind you being in accident we could then claim it off the insurance company but so right up to the time i retired that's how tyres were paid for
i mean we could never have paid for all those tyres and when i retired the erm they actually had a tyre fitter supplied and paid for by they were the they took over the whole of the tyre maintenance they had a tyre fitter down there and he used to go up to depot change any tyres over there that were necessary he UNK them each day and changed them over but of course he was UNK erm at the same time
over the years we didn't have quite so much work to do with recording which tyre was on which bus because he took it over but it was right up until i retired in well five years ago that we were paying tyres that way
where actually were you working
in this early part where were you
at i never moved from there
we erm we hadn't got a lot of room for expansion down there we were in when i joined the department it was known as the ipswich t electric supply and transport department and er we were in some buildings which were rented from the electric supply department which housed the generators for the electricity so we hadn't got a lot of room for expansion there i think we were all confined into about three offices
what were they like well the facilities there like
well they were two storey buildings we had one office which was UNK off for us clerks and the other half was for the traffic superintendent who was responsible directly responsible to the general manager of the ipswich electric supply and transport departments so erm and then we had another office adjoining that which was a store room because in those days we used to have to erm record and keep in UNK all lost property no end of things we used to have but we you know we used to have pigeon holes and lost property that was brought in was placed into these pigeon holes it'd be monday tuesday wednesday
we'd keep them for a fortnight in those pigeon holes because most people claim stuff if they realize where they'd left it within a day or two and then as the weeks went round we used to take stuff out of there and just lump it altogether having duly labelled it up and erm record it and used to have tuppence an item if anybody lost anything
odd gloves we never used to charge for had to get rid of them and er so apart from those two offices er there was immediately above us was a UNK office spreading over these two blocks of offices called the ticket office and there at that time about eleven girls working in it on tickets
er nearer the actual bus garage was what was called the depot office and the paying in room
now the depot office the they in those days controlled what a man's duties were for the next day and a man didn't know what he was on until about twelve o'clock one day what he was on the next day
in those days a man was allocated duties it is true they tried to arrange that he was on early spread medium or late duties but it didn't always work out because of holidays sickness or that but erm there were no restriction on hours
in those days a man would run in about half past eleven at night and he could very well be on an early shift the next day
there was no sort of law against erm employing people without a certain amount of rest and erm that was employed er that was occupied that office from first thing in the morning when the bus went out from five o'clock and erm he would the depot clerk would go off round about dinner time there'd be his relief who came on at nine o'clock and worked with him until dinner time and he'd carry on till five and then we had what was called the UNK come on duty then there was a UNK and erm a hand
it was a shed hand actually he didn't wasn't responsible for cash although he helped the UNK and er i well remember this erm in those days the conductor used to either run into depot with the bus or he'd get relief on the UNK he walked down to the depot carrying his cash in his cash bag and then he'd sit in the paying in room and he'd UNK carried out his cash UNK the pennies into stacks the UNK the tokens the UNK every UNK
then he would place them on one of the old time boards which was er board about nine inches by nine inches and then hand that through the pigeon hole to the UNK and in front of him that UNK would UNK count that money and agree the total there and then
you can well imagine when all the buses ran in between eleven and half past eleven that there was a mad UNK to get their cash in and someone very often somebody's cash would get knocked off the board so there was a UNK on the floor
but that's how cash was counted in those days and erm the UNK was marked to agree with a man's statement of what his cash added up to and then the cash next day was counted up bolt because there was UNK heath to take care of although that wasn't a media when i first went down there that opened later on but there was the two got to be married together and then UNK to the bank the next day or on the monday if it was a saturday or sunday
but that sort of thing went on in those days money was physically handled all the time
it was in the later days that you gradually got the buses were then fitted with these UNK they've got the UNK on the ticket machines on the buses whereby every man's cash working on that bus that day went into a UNK on the bus
the UNK were then changed at night or when the bus had finished service and then were counted by a different means they were counted by machine coin counters and er so instead of say erm what sixty or seventy conductors paying in their money this was all erm on the bus so there may have been five or six drivers had worked that bus that day and all the UNK he'd taken during the time was all in this night safe in this UNK
so er you know things did progress a great deal
with so much cash about was there any problems with security
no because er i always put it down to the fact that most of our UNK were in coin it was very seldom that you had a pound note you possibly had a ten pound note in those days but most of it was UNK and the cash when it was married up was put into steel bound wooden boxes
they was made that two men had to lift 'em so there was hardly likely that any thief was gonna get in there and run off with one of these boxes cos you'd never lift it
so you know it never at any time was paper money to the fore you didn't get very much
the most time was on UNK when the drivers and conductors or fitters everybody used to get their pay packet which was mostly in notes they would immediately go to the depot and say can i change it
so that's the only time that we really had lots and lots of notes
did you have to wear a uniform to go to work
not me no the drivers and conductors and inspectors they had a uniform and it was seen that they did wear it
just before my time down there if a man reported for work with a dirty collar or something like that you were sent home
he wasn't allowed to work that day so people turned up in a white shirt and tie and looking smart they had to wear UNK even a cap but unfortunately nowadays although a lot of the i have seen quite a few people their uniform has changed since i left but erm they do come to work in very casual work now
casual wear jeans and open UNK shirts no UNK no
mm
but erm
there was no uniform for the office so you had to provide your own
no just went in ordinary civilian wear girls sometimes had some UNK because they were handling the ticket boxes they were metal they got wet they UNK up and that was a UNK job for there was really in those days it was a two box system a man drew his box which contained a certain amount of tickets of different variable classes and erm it was listed on a UNK he was given a half an hour to check his box and join his bus at town centre
so he sat in the mess room there and checked his box against the tickets which were shown on the UNK
if he agreed it he signed it and put the to which that was called a total UNK
he placed it in the box and that eventually returned itself to the ticket office
he also had another er what we call a journey UNK and that he used to record on there at each UNK he used to record the time and the ticket numbers that he'd got in his UNK at that particular time so it could be seen between certain times that a ticket perhaps was sold between witton and UNK heath
we didn't ask them to do electric house because that would have meant that you'd gotta have enough lines there to take a bus timing every half an hour because witton well every quarter of an hour really
witton to electric house quarter of an hour electric house to UNK heath quarter of an hour and it did the reverse direction
so it meant every quarter of an hour you were asking a man to record his numbers so we boiled it down to UNK
witton UNK road london road and those sort of places
so that was the journey UNK and that was handed in at the end of the day and from that and a visual check of the tickets that were returned by him to the ticket office they could tell which tickets were missing and therefore they were sold to him and er there be there was the odd UNK but in those days if anybody was short in his UNK by i think it was about sixpence in those days he was the subject of a another warning by letter and if he UNK well then he was brought in to see the traffic superintendent who erm could UNK him for two or three days so he lost pay for two or three days
discipline was very strict in those days but of course with the war coming on and lots of those men going to the forces things changed UNK during that time and discipline was somewhat more UNK after the war
every one of those men who went in the forces who lived to tell the tale was given their jobs back when they came back because their jobs were replaced by women during the war drivers and conductors they were replaced by women and as the men came back so the women were paid off so everybody who came back from the war was given their job back
so before the war y you did the UNK and you did the UNK on and UNK off
yes
what other jobs did you do
well lost property i already touched on that was one of my jobs and then erm we called it the ticket book that was for want of some other name i suppose
it was the record per week of the different classes of tickets that were sold
penny tuppence three ha'penny returns and every UNK of tickets was recorded so that you so showed the erm number of tickets erm it was possible for a at the end of the week to record what the UNK were per route and the mileage and so as i told you before the mileage played a great importance in that you were able to say how much that route was producing per mile run and the erm in those days it the erm the receipts worked out daily receipts weekly receipts and the progressive total in that year were always published by the ipswich evening star round about tuesday or wednesday and if you missed them there'd be UNK member of the public ringing up to why answer why you hadn't put it in it was you know looked upon then you were public transport and the public team that you belonged to them
they thought they had the right to boss you around
i pay for your salaries cos we were in those days on the rates
any erm UNK at the end of the financial year was made up by a rate demand erm so i the it wasn't the same in all UNK undertakings some of them were allowed to carry forward their balances but ipswich whether it was erm er by law or er a oh i don't know what it be perhaps needed that they got to be the erm balance of the year had to be balanced at the end of the year so you had a rate demand and of course that rate demand went on to the next year's rates
so i more often than not we were on the rates and of course the public say oh i'm paying your salaries
so you can imagine that erm er during the war of course th they buses made because they made to the trolley buses made plenty of money because erm labour was cheap and erm you had the soldiers they were lot of them no other form of transport petrol rationing and that so the buses really did come into their own during the war
du during this during before the war it was trolley buses
yes
when did the motor buses come in
i think the first ones we had were about nineteen thirty six i believe
my memory doesn't er is not all that clear on it
but there were certainly trolley buses when i went there in nineteen thirty one and trolley buses first came in nineteen twenty three and it was all trolley buses by nineteen twenty six
erm motor buses came in i can't recall i think now on reflection that it was after the war motor buses came in
erm nineteen forty eight forty nine something like that
i couldn't be UNK about the date of those but er c the reason that motor buses came in is because it was too costly to extend trolley bus routes
with putting up new UNK
yes you you've got to extend the route well of course you've got to put up trolley UNK every for about forty yards and then of course there was two lengths of trolley wire that had to go because as you know trolley buses used to have two arms positive and negative supply and er of course the bus had to come back er alongside the UNK the outward route it come on so you had four wires up there and the cost of copper wire was terrific so the motor buses were developed and we UNK with the buses on UNK mainly but when the UNK were finished we then UNK because trolley wires were then beginning to wear out rather than replace them they would convert a trolley route into a bus route and erm because the erm there was a lot of people hated to see the UNK of the trolley buses because they were so clean and silent and the buses came you got the deal UNK and UNK of the old engines that a lot of people hated to see the trolley buses go but cos that was the reason that they went
they were very reliable because erm the motive power was in a motor electric motor not a lot of parts to go wrong but er once you started the motor buses they had to send people away to be taught the mechanics of motor buses so you had the old die UNK of the UNK trolley buses who never did take to motor buses and course the younger ones came into their own then who were able to adapt to the modern motor bus
do you remember what you were paid at the UNK of the war
well yes i did merely remark about it i think i got fifteen shillings per week
that was when you started in nineteen thirty one
yeah when i started in nineteen thirty one and in those days you got a rise every six months and i got a one and three rise after they'd been there six months and at the year i was earning seventeen and six
now i got married in nineteen thirty nine and my wage then was forty eight and sixpence and that's how my wages were and erm
how did that wage compare to the to drivers and conductors
well it was a wee bit under because i was only an office clerk i wasn't the junior but by then had come there and there were other clerks some girls who'd come into the office and i'd got a little bit of step up you see and took over a little bit more important work erm i did just before i went in the army have a UNK at erm running times that was preparing the schedules for buses
for some unknown reason before the war we used to have a route change every year
if the buses ran from UNK road to UNK barn one year they'd decide they'd send them from UNK road to UNK bridge the next
they were always changing them to try and balance up the take i suppose on each leg of the route and there was always was the chief clerk then and him and i got on very well together and he really initiated me into running times
i didn't do very important part of it because erm it was sometimes you'd get the same sort of schedule
a bus would repeat itself every hour and he'd say run that one down or that was running it down hour after hour until about seven o'clock when certain buses were run in
the other buses were either spread out in their running time or cut down to form the evening frequency which was less than what it was during the peak time and so i you know i'd left it at then when i went in the forces then he carried on
i came out of the forces he was only waiting for the time that i came out for him to retire
he hung on until i came out and i was given UNK leave or UNK leave rather and i didn't even have a chance to have that they wanted me down there so quickly i think i came out of the forces one week and i was working down there the following week because was way past his retiring age
though er i really got into that i was forced into it i never had a time to think about it i was wanted there i who was the traffic superintendent then
he was very UNK with me and he brought me back into it without a lot of undue pressure and erm because transport wasn't my life but i'd sort of dedicated myself to it
i got stuck in i used to bring stuff home at night to work on and er there were no exams to sit then you just sort or did it by you either could or you couldn't do it
that's on disk
w what did you actually do during the war went away
well
is that transport related or
no it wasn't transport related i knew that my group because everybody was placed in a certain group by age and er i knew that i was due to go and i thought oh well this is hanging around you sort of wanted to get on with it
i volunteered for the UNK guards well i had to go to UNK and after a week there they decided that i wasn't UNK fit for them although the doctor or the m o at the ipswich recruiting officer said oh yes you're a one you'll be fine for the guard but cos i was fairly well built UNK wise
oh yes you're just the sort of bloke we're looking for the guards
so i fell for it and i volunteered for the guards but after a week they decided i i'd got flat feet which wasn't very good for UNK your foot down as the guards demanded in those days
i came back on the friday night and erm well i've packed my job in at the transport department i better go down to the recruiting office and see what else
well having been UNK to a two from a one erm i said well what else can i volunteer for cos i didn't fancy going back to work and then being called up again
so i erm i erm was put into the royal army pay UNK and posted up to UNK north london and i was there for quite a while we all transferred down to UNK
well we went into the rifle brigade UNK at UNK and used to work out at a big house outside of UNK so we had to march out there and then at the time of UNK they were looking for places to put all the soldiers that they'd brought and er we were cleared out of UNK er out of UNK and posted up to nottingham and we worked in the factory which was taken over by the army then and erm and then whilst there i suppose that was about nineteen what about nineteen fo coming up to nineteen forty two they decided to have a UNK or UNK on UNK so we were all subject to another medical and they put me back to a one and says right we're getting rid of all a one personnel out of the pay UNK you have a choice royal army UNK or the royal artillery
well my brother was in the artillery and i thought well it be nice if i can get with him but that didn't work out that way
i was posted to the er UNK brigade and i was posted to norwich just at norwich UNK really
at the brigade h q
having served as sort of er apprentice there as an artillery clerk i was put posted up to UNK to go through a erm UNK course
i was up there for six weeks i passed the course and was posted back to brigade h q to a wider UNK to a regiment
my UNK came through and i was posted to UNK this side of norwich so i was still UNK in i could get home once a week twenty four hour pass and then erm after a while erm having served at regiment i was posted up to as the sergeant artillery clerk with the brigade an UNK brigade up at coventry just outside coventry and then of course the a t s were coming in were coming in quite large numbers then and they were replacing male personnel and then i was posted abroad and i went to egypt where i was there again fortunate enough i suppose to go into the UNK the second UNK which was the records office of all the forces or the UNK personnel in the middle east and i worked there until i was actually UNK from there but i was out in egypt there for two just over two years came back to UNK where i was finally UNK and allowed to come home and as i said i came home one week and i was back at work the next
so i was actually messing around with the tax officer for quite a while because i was on UNK leave and i was also working so he wasn't gonna let me have two lots of sa wages
how had th the transport changed then in that period you were away sort of five years
what were the changes that you noticed
well
ha had things been allowed to run down over the war
no but th erm the only real difference was that lots and lots of the trolley buses were of the utility type
they were made to wartime restrictions wooden seats and erm mass produced really erm there was none of the erm UNK seats at all that were a part of the feature during th before the war
we had lots and lots of trolley buses and er who was the general manager had sought powers to run all over ipswich
oh the by pass road you know the north northern part of ipswich along the by pass and of course had ordered trolley buses because you had to order 'em about two years ahead of time erm to take care of that but it didn't UNK and we had a surplus of buses and some of them were sold off i think some went to walsall some to wolverhampton and er i think it was one of those that was sold to UNK in the national newspapers that had UNK over
it er gone on its side but erm i da i wouldn't say that things had deteriorated that much
it was erm they had expanded they brought in the UNK lane route during the war
as they say things were different during the war
if it was er public transport certain facilities were afforded to public transport which went to private under enterprise erm because of the nature of taking factory workers to the UNK factories and such like
but i wouldn't say that er that it had deteriorated
mind you the erm the wages had risen quite a bit during the time
i was fortunate in that i was married before the war and the ipswich council had decided that married men's wages would be made up
erm so i was constantly getting rises less my service pay and erm it got to a state there where sometimes my service pay was more than what the erm salary i would have got at home was and my wife had to pay to keep my superannuation live
she had to
you turn it up
fears i er i'm coming back from the forces i went into the main job taking over from the previous scheduled clerk by breaking the schedules and the duties
the duties being erm what a man had to do to cover that er period of that UNK
as i said before a bus was on a certain route number say you had one witton what was had now and then well that ran from six o'clock in the morning perhaps till eleven o'clock at night
now that had to be UNK by a driver and a conductor for that day
well obviously he couldn't work six in the morning till eleven at night
so you had to have in that day erm about five men to cover one bus right the way through can you just a moment
five men during the whole day
erm why i say five men you might think that peculiar because there was a man and a conductor each time but we used to reckon that two buses full time buses would be scheduled by te or run by ten men because there one man would come off at nine o'clock have a relief of hour and fifteen minutes and then another one would take over from him
so it's er how we used to marry them up was erm two long buses as we called would take ten men to do five duties
erm then the erm the UNK of the UNK conductors was they didn't like the long periods of duty they erm they wanted the new set up so i introduced what we call straight duties UNK the relief portion so they didn't go home for a meal they had about a half an hour off so they were able to get their eight hour duty done in a shorter period and they'd probably finish about two instead of half past three four o'clock
at this time then after the war how many vehicles were there running
oh dear i suppose seventy odd a day
and how many men would that would you employ
i think at erm at the peak time there was about two hundred and twenty six drivers and conductors
erm when i came back out the forces a man's guaranteed week was a forty hour forty eight hour week
it went down to forty six they negotiated things that er reduced it to forty six
it went down to forty four forty two and now i believe they are on a forty hour week
whether they've got down to thirty eight i don't know but it was a forty hour week when i finally left
so and then erm of course they start bringing in one man buses and the conductors were no longer required
now er i could make a point here that when they introduced one man operated buses they thought they were on to a new thing but one man operated buses were in this town before the war
trolley buses had one man to do it
now they thought they were in a new thing in nineteen fifties when they brought in one man operated buses but they weren't
there's only one person on a trolley bus
yes
there's no conductor then
the they used to put a conductor on for peak time and then about nine o'clock the rear door was closed and the driver took over issuing tickets taking money and then perhaps the conductor would come on from about twelve or two and then again perhaps from half past four till half past six
so a UNK duty weren't very nice then probably three piece duties which were spread duties but you know people thought they were bringing in a wonderful thing to be one man operated but it was before the war that we had one man operated buses
cos i remember the duties there used to be a driver you would get more pay for bringing the bus one man so underneath each duty was just how many how many hours he was one man and how many two men
so it's it wasn't a new thing when they brought but nevertheless erm that went on and on and on then and er cos the staff really went down the requirements for staff went down and erm i think erm they got it down when i left there to round about a hundred and forty six staff was all that was required
mm how many were in the office at this time
was the clerical work still there
b no erm the clerical erm staff on the erm shall we say the traffic side increased a bit because er there was mo more and more demanding work but the ticket office they went down erm i have mentioned perhaps before that they had the two box system and there was about eleven twelve thirteen girls in there and their duty was to check a box that had been used one day stock it up with tickets get it ready for the day after
so there was constantly two books two boxes going
at the same time they had on UNK and tuesday we used to sell weekly tickets so they had to go out in another box on UNK and UNK
then there was plenty of work for them but then when the erm the one man buses really got going and they introduced the night safe on the buses the ticket office was cut UNK they didn't need to have all this information
we had UNK that we could extract this information from but it wasn't so accurate because man wasn't required to record the erm numbers of each class of ticket
all we were concerned was the total ticket registers
we could get certain information recorded from the ticket machines of just how many of different types of tickets were issued because what we'd they had double readings
a man when he issued say two UNK tickets there were two UNK tickets but he pushed a little lever and issued two UNK tickets which came out almost together that was a UNK fare and that would record once
mm
on little UNK
so we were able to tell how many tickets of certain classes were sold each day but not route by route we'd lost that facility because the UNK just weren't big enough and of course the wa everything got mechanical but now i mean i don't UNK to know anything about what happens now but i was introduced to it when i went down there for a retirement and believe me it's all electronics now they can tell how a ticket machine is issuing tickets at any particular one day by this electronic business this computers
so they really brought it down to a very fine art now
was the wh were there trade unions in the transport department at this time were they quite active
oh yes the erm the main one was the transport and general workers' union which erm did all the drivers conductors and cleaners and semi skilled staff but erm you had the erm n u v b which is the national union and vehicle builders and of course you had the electrical trades people so they were all working in there but the main one covering most of the men was the transport and general workers' union
now the office staff there was no closed shop there but our union was UNK
the national association of local government officers
i don't know whether you in
well that was the erm union for us erm i think erm one of the great assets of being in public transport was that we were in a local erm pension scheme erm when we in the office started we had to wait until we were eighteen and then we had to wait for a vacancy because there was a limited number of people that the council were prepared to back by paying a similar amount
drivers and conductors had to wait three years they had to be employed three years before they were accepted into the pension scheme but you know believe me i'm glad that i paid in for it
it was a bit of a pill at the time and y used to pay a shilling in the pound well a shilling was a lot more valuable than it is now and erm i used to UNK paying in it forty eight and sixpence but it does provide the well the UNK of life now whereby the pens the ordinary old age pension wouldn't
erm i told you that erm during the war if my army wage went above what the recorded salary was my wife had to pay to keep the superannuation going
and when i see the buses now running around they seem to run everywhere i don't on earth what kind of running board they've got because in my day it was so well regulated that erm you just recorded certain intermediate stages and i quote witton and UNK you get used to get witton UNK norwich road bridge UNK road UNK corner electric house and you gave an indication of the time that those buses should be passing those times
er and then we'd used to repeat right the way through the day we had a bus say for sixteen hours and it erm repeated itself every hour and that was boring job just writing it down and repeating it
so wh what was a running board then
a running board was the information given to the driver of what where he was expected to run what time he was expected to leave the various UNK
they w it's erm lo
they were prepared by the office and given to each driver daily
well there were running boards they were they were written out well eventually we were typed out but they were written out and first of all it was really funny we used to size them on to these wooden boards let that dry then UNK them and that board was used day in day out
a man used to hand it back in when the bus ran in and it was given out the next day
it eventually got that they were typed and put into UNK covers which made it a lot easier
it was funny in my day when i first started there you used to get mix up some size and er in a pot in a proper pot and take it down into the mess room and put it on the stove coal stove heat it up and you let it boil over there was a terrific smell about the place you can imagine the size but that's what we used to do in those days
things were much easier then but th all these running boards were interpreted if that's the right word on the master UNK
now you used to say perhaps there's an UNK service er an UNK run from witton to UNK and back again and you wanted a ten minute service
well that would take six buses to do that
six tens being sixty and they were all prepared in a master schedule you'd write down twelve o'clock twelve ten twelve twenty erm that sort of thing you see
mm
and then each that would take six buses one two three four five six UNK we used to call them and then the running board was a copy from that of all what number one witton was gotta do
so from a mass master timetable each bus route number was interpreted on to a what we called a running board and er it was that the driver ran to
you got UNK some time in that erm when the six a twos the fours and the six b routes were running erm it was found sometimes that if you married them together did a six a trip one time a six b a two and four you could save what we call a bus you could save a whole bus by UNK them together because routes were only of thirty minute UNK from electric house out to six a r UNK and back again was half an hour
now you could have two buses doing that and forming fifteen minute service because one bus went out in thirty minutes another one fifteen minutes behind it that came back so that the first bus was able to do the third one
now if you want to decrease the frequency say at evenings and you wanted a twenty minute service you can see that you're in all kinds of UNK
it was fifty it's thirty minutes to do the run you only wanted a bus to repeat itself every forty minutes so you got ten minutes to waste
you couldn't afford to have drivers sitting around for ten minutes not doing anything so you married these routes up together and were able to by UNK get them to a more economical run
er but even so the running boards did look very complicated because on one half an hour he'd probably go and do a six a run another one a six b run a two and a four
you can imagine that some drivers er went the wrong way and it was just that they just didn't concentrate on the run but nowadays they seem to run all over the town
so how on earth they keep them to a schedule i do not know but i don't want to know now
what was the social life like was there a social club
there was a very strong social club
was the general manager then he was very keen on sport and erm in nineteen thirty eight er saw the opening of the erm sports ground at UNK close UNK road
i remember because in nineteen thirty eight er we were scheduled to have an opening in about the september and we got a team coming down to play us at football and we were going to have a social evening UNK and that at in the evening and of course at that particular time the war was a definite threat
you remember UNK
yes
and his white piece of paper so everything was cancelled
er as regards to the team that was gonna come down from london and i was secretary of the football club at that time
said erm oh we must have something
so i rang the power station people at norwich and they sent up a team to open it
so it was in nineteen thirty eight that the erm sports ground at UNK heath was opened
now erm was the UNK of the ipswich UNK cup and erm in those days if there was any erm going begging at UNK road would give them a job on the gangs
the electricity cable laying to give 'em a job so you could play for the ipswich electric supply team and we had a jolly good team we won the cup for the first three years that it was in being but the UNK used to be on UNK road and course that was in those days a thing to be looked forward to
erm there was the cricket there was bowls tennis swimming section gardening section
the swimming section was more or less brought back to mind to me the other day when they showed the old stoke bathing place
though we u that was over stoke UNK road way when we used to have the open air swimming pool there
it was only water that was let into a confined space but we had a sports association which had a section for the swimming and er i way remember bought a couple of old single UNK buses from somewhere i don't know where and he had them fitted out and UNK up at stoke bathing place especially for us to go there and change and w we did have quite a good strong section we used to hold our an annual what you call a UNK or no not a UNK but er in the st UNK swimming baths a festival a swimming festival a gala yes
mm
and you know we could in those days because of the number of people employed being electric supply and transport we could erm manage to keep it a viable proposition for an UNK entertainment then and erm you probably can turn this up in the star they're showing erm as he was then one of the drivers swimming from erm stoke bathing place to felixstowe
er i was i think i've got pictures about it somewhere or tha that was in the evening star not so very many years ago
they've got pictures of it of him preparing all UNK up
it was our answer to cross channel swimming
he did it once or twice had to give up when he got to the mouth of the river UNK because he UNK the currents but he did he did eventually do it from stoke bathing place to felixstowe
it was a long swim in those days
at what stage did they split the power and the transport
oh a at nineteen forty eight they split up the electric supply and the three was nationalized and erm it just went out of the control of the local councils it was government controlled then and there was a distinct possibility that the transport section would be sold off to private enterprise and the only private enterprise that was capable of taking over then was the eastern counties but erm i think the erm local council having had the transport under their wing for so many years fought off that erm feeling and erm they kept with it and er of course all the accountancy went to the borough treasurer and the certain members of clerks from the borough UNK which was at in those days er seconded on to transport accounts
so we were really UNK to the ipswich borough council rather than to private enterprise which some people really wanted to sell us off as being a you know a weight round their UNK because if we didn't make a lot of money after the war the accounts would show that we were making a UNK every year and erm well there was no way that you could UNK it because our routes weren't really long enough to charge lots of fares erm maybe tuppence was the town centre to the extreme UNK
mm
and you know you couldn't get a lot of money although of course nationally the rates of pay were governed nationally they were going up and up and up and there was no way that we could keep pace we couldn't keep on increasing the UNK fare
they are increased now obviously but erm you know to put anything on a UNK fare then was well a ha'penny which was twenty five percent on terrible every year we were going for a fare increase and in those days you really had to go through the traffic commissioners
you had to go to cambridge
loads and loads of information had to be supplied
you had to satisfy the traffic commissioners that what you are proposing would answer the cause wouldn't give rise to erm great UNK to the travelling public and erm oh you're preparing a fare increase about a year before it actually came up to in front of the commissioners and then he would erm perhaps make some alterations or give you a date when you could apply
you had to then notify the public at least twenty f twenty four i no fourteen days before it was due to come in
everybody then had the right to make erm UNK against this and could be heard at cambridge UNK about fare increases
so i it wasn't a very easy thing then to get them and as i say you'd be preparing a fare increase which perhaps a ha'penny on certain fares and a penny on fares above a certain range and you had to allow for UNK or resistance in the public travelling but er as long as you could always bring in a little extra from a fare increase it was worthwhile going forward
as i say it was very difficult in those days you had to satisfy the traffic commissions
so i in the fifties across to be one man operated buses
yes
what were the changes that followed that then
how did it develop in the sixties
was it the town was growing then
well the town was growing then
as i said the er the trolley buses were being UNK out and the buses the motor buses were being used more than ever and i don't know the date of the last trolley bus running but i well remember it being reported time it was the erm bus was packed on its last journey from electric house and people were UNK it
it was its last run and it finished up at UNK heath erm was on the UNK route
the last ones to be UNK and erm
why those routes
well i suppose it because as i told you those four routes were always treated as a separate entity because they were on there were possible chances of UNK those routes together to get them to run the most economical way
there was four routes there now and we had as many as ten buses operating those four so it meant they were left you couldn't sort of UNK them
you couldn't say well we will have motor buses on the fourth and not the other three because they were so closely UNK
so that they got to all go off at once
so all the other routes were UNK and then those when we got a big batch of motor buses come in
it then erm they would they went out in one complete entity you see and the trolley wires were just taken down
erm motor buses very expensive
another thing you might not realize is that erm when you ordered motor buses you had to get authority from the ministry of transport and you used to UNK apply for a bus grant
now in its UNK we used to get a fifty percent grant that was the price of the bus was UNK at ministry would pay
it got UNK out so that the ministry didn't pay anything at all but to get this grant you had to keep tremendous records copies of UNK and you had to get er and the bus grant and the permission from them
it was very difficult to get these things but of course erm it did when you were talking about seventy two thousand pound for each bus
you were glad to get half of it
yes
cos trolley buses in this town were really the erm well i suppose they really came about rather than motor buses right at the start because built trolley buses and so did of UNK
you had er in fact used to use our overhead to erm test their UNK before they went to the body makers
if they were going to a different body maker anyway
so they
mm
we used to charge them for using our overhead and erm so i suppose trolley buses were used here because it was so convenient
right on the doorstep making them
yes supply them
i it's in or this may be a little bit UNK to want an UNK tell you everything that's happened but there are some of the highlights in my life
the sports section that you talk you UNK on a little while ago
it was a thriving thing and but when electric supply in nineteen forty eight went nationalized we lost a lot of members and er we did try to carry it on just ipswich borough transport
i think the UNK section the table section they're still UNK actually but as regards to football you just hadn't got enough members
you can't have a transport football team because you can't get enough of us together at one time cos they're working you see when people want to go to and from work but er
so you came up for retirement what in nineteen
well it's er i've
been retired five years now that was eighty two yes
i worked up to the end of may and because of accrued leave i er i left then
my actual retirement date was the twenty second of july
i had worked there and that was when i was sixty five so i'd worked there all my working life apart from the war years and had served under quite a number of people really
when i first went there we had who was a tall heavy built man and you walk well i did i walked in fear of my life
if i could get away from him not talk to him i was happy but if he spoke to me i was ju literally shake in me shoes he gave you that he was that erm type of man although he was kind enough really but he was really UNK
bowler hat little UNK and UNK and when you came through the shed my god nobody UNK cos he had eyes everywhere and the traffic superintendent was he was directly responsible to him erm then erm retired and erm then retired during the war and they had another fella come in from he came from away
he wasn't there all that time
i think he had a little bit of ill health and my immediate superior took over as traffic superintendent and he was there throughout the war and when i came out he was my boss and er you see and er and then in nineteen forty eight was made transport manager because as you say we had to split from electric supply and he carried on until erm nineteen seventy two and erm we had government reorganization and erm they did away with people like the town clerk and transport manager and erm was retired early retirement the same as the town clerk and erm they brought in a general manager from away and brought in more staff with him and that was came in and er so i then applied for the position which was going there was there was traffic superintendent was going er chief administration officer chief engineer and erm er UNK maintenance superintendent
all those positions were going for want of an application so i applied and because brought in people who he knew certain of them were automatically filled but they want the chief administration officer so i applied and really i don't kid myself that i got it because of my qualification because i hadn't got any letters after my name
mm
i think i got it because of my local knowledge and the that gave him the facility of being able to carry on without UNK
if you'd had all people come in and try to bring in new ideas on to an old system i don't think it would have worked
so they had me as continuity and i got the job and it was a bit of a struggle because i'd always been traffic at work but this was a little bit different in that if you had to do more accountancy and i had to pick it up
i had a lot of help from people and erm well i'm fairly UNK and i sort of took over this job of chief UNK assistant
sorry chief UNK officer and i had to provide quite a lot of statistical information which i'd never done before but nevertheless i made a fairly reasonable job of it i had an assistant and erm i think i got fairly well known amongst the councillors and people who UNK and then went
he had some ill health erm he was they brought in a bloke who was retired from some place up north sheffield i think it was
they brought him back as a UNK to general manager and really i didn't see eye to eye with him
he came in with the ideas give the drivers and conductors everything they asked for whereby my training had always been to only give them what they were really entitled to not give them anything extra but he gave them the earth and that erm didn't sort of go very well for the new manager who came in he had a lot of UNK to do there that this fella had given away in his six or seven weeks there
in fact you know he gave the drivers and conductors a lot more than what they were really entitled to but conduct
what sort of things
well he did there in the various agreements there were UNK which erm if they i can't recall the exact wording now but if they er their average wage working week was between forty two and forty four hours they had to get make up pay and all that sort of thing
well we argued that erm they weren't entitled to it
we read the read the agreements differently to what they did but he'd lean towards the drivers conductors and he gave away a lot of what had tried to erm stop them from having because they weren't really entitled to it but he saw differently and gave it away and course once you've given it away you no way of UNK it but then came in and well i mean he was a real transport man his vision and his ideas were really good and he made it what it is today
he was really and lovely man to work with
he was genuine he appreciated everything you did and i don't think you get a better manager and of course he's now under this new transport act when transport this was erm was nationalized isn't it
he that he's now a director of this ipswich buses and i don't think you can get a better man to do it because he is heart and soul in transport he the things that he brought in the different UNK that he brought in were good i mean he brought in he brought in all this erm operated UNK and all that sort of thing and all this electronic gear that they are working now
mm
so you think you had er you know go back well looking back on it
quite happy with the way it's all gone
oh yes i had a good life
i think er erm when i first started down there it was a job i thought well this is a good job fifteen bob a week that's a lot more than some of the other boys who'd left school got they were twelve and six you see and erm i think erm i came back out of the forces and took over more responsible jobs i don't think i could have gone to anything else but transport
you were with the public direct contact with the public and er i would hate to have been sat in an office and just looked at four walls
i used to UNK around the building
go and talk to the fitters interest myself in what made buses work and how they worked when down in the pits
i couldn't bear to have sit in four walls and not move
yes
from the desk
it i think i had a good life there and i've got no UNK i think to be public transport is a good thing
anything to do with the public
oh yes right
you get you know the UNK and arrows but they don't hurt you get a lot more people who appreciate what you do than UNK and UNK
oh well
thank you very much
well i don't whether that's of much interest to anybody
probably listening to it probably sound like a drill
thank you very much indeed
yes
i'd like to welcome you all and thank you very much for coming on time
this is our fifth session and it's the gifts of the spirit
if we could just pray together
god you are mother and father to us all
be with us as we pray
pour out your spirit upon your people and grant us a new vision of your glory a new experience of your power a new UNK to your word a new UNK to your service that your love may grow among us and your kingdom come
through christ our lord amen
if you remember at the last two sessions we've talked about signs and symbols
and particularly over the last session we talked about the UNK actions that make up the actual point of confirmation the UNK of the sacrament of the sacrament of confirmation
and you had some work to do at home on that
it was the can you remember section and there were some missing words to fill in
so if we could just check that we've all got this right
god speaks to us in many ways
in the beauty of a UNK or a flower in the power of the sea in the UNK of people we know
god also speaks to us in the seven UNK the special symbols of god's love and care
and on the day of confirmation i will be confirmed by the bishop
the special symbol of confirmation has four parts
and they are the laying on of hands the UNK with the oil of UNK the signing with the cross the words be sealed with the gift of the holy spirit
and when the bishop says the words you reply amen
and it's very important to finish off with amen and to actually do it in a very convincing way
if the bishop can't hear you or if you forget to say it he will ask you are saying yes to all that the spirit will give you
what we want to do now is to actually erm do a er a guided scripture UNK with you
i don't know whether any of you have ever UNK in this way before but it is a silent way of praying
and i will actually draw or paint a word picture for you to put you in the scene
what i want to make sure first of all is that erm you understand what has gone on before the scene that we actually want to find ourselves in
and we're actually going to think about the evening of good friday
so we've actually had UNK thursday and the last supper
jesus has been through the UNK in the garden he's been arrested he's been abandoned by his apostles he's been through a trial and he has actually been through the UNK and he's been buried in the UNK
so i'll close the curtains and the room now will be quite dark
i just want to you to get yourselves comfortable during this time
we have to be silent we have to be still
at the end of the UNK towards the end of the UNK i'll ask you three questions and i'll leave some time of silence between each question
and i want you to think about the question that i ask you but i don't want you to speak out the answers
if you can just close your eyes and picture the upper room
this is the same room where jesus a few hours earlier had celebrated the last supper
the room is quite dark
there are one or two little oil lamps which are UNK
but even in the UNK you can make out the UNK faces
have a look at them
they look tired and worn out
they talk quietly amongst themselves sometimes finding it hard to speak
some of them are near to tears
there's a sudden noise outside in the street
immediately they stop talking and look UNK at the door
very quietly one gets up and goes UNK to check the UNK on the door
everyone is very tense
can you imagine what they are feeling
what are they remembering
what are they saying
if you'd like to open your eyes and if you would like to list your response on a piece of paper for me
the questions i asked were are what are they feeling
what are they remembering
and what are they saying
for the feelings you've used words like frightened nervous worried sad anxious curious shocked UNK guilty confused
what are they remembering
you've used words like death last supper good times sad times the past couple of days all that jesus had said and done their UNK their UNK
and what are they saying
they're asking what the noise could be who it could be were the guards coming for them
they're asking each other did they know what was going to happen
how long were they going to be there
would jesus actually be raised from the dead
all of these things are pretty negative
they were feeling lost and all alone
i'd really like to erm tell you the brief story of the events which lead on from good friday to pentecost day
on the night of good friday the apostles must have felt a painful sense of loss
it was not just that they had lost a friend through death but the death that jesus had suffered was long and cruel and above all it was UNK
the apostles had hoped that jesus would have been the one to set the people free
only a week earlier on palm sunday it seemed possible that jesus could have led a UNK against the hated romans
much as they UNK him and loved him he seemed to have let them down
but they too had let him down
one of their friends UNK had UNK him
but then hadn't they all
only john had the courage to stay close to jesus throughout the terrible events of thursday night and friday
perhaps none felt it more than peter who UNK that he would never leave jesus
friday night saturday and sunday were a nightmare
they were terrified that the jewish authorities would come for them and that they would suffer the same fate as jesus
on sunday morning their confusion and UNK increased
some of the women who were followers of jesus had returned from the UNK where jesus had been buried saying that it was empty that they had been told in a vision that jesus had risen from the dead
on sunday evening nearly all the apostles were together in the upper room where jesus appeared to them
now they knew that the women had been right jesus had indeed risen from the dead
during the next forty days jesus often appeared to his friends
he reminded them of all the things that he'd said and done and he prepared them for their mission in the world
forty days after the resurrection jesus took his friends to a hill top outside jerusalem
this was the last time they saw him
he gave them his last instructions and then he was taken from their sight
i have an exercise for you now
it's called a word match
and there are twenty four words at the bottom of the page and we have good friday we have easter day and we have UNK day
and there are eight words that need to be fitted in to each day
eight words that you think would be most suitably des that would most suitably describe the feelings of the apostles on good friday on easter day and on UNK day
if you can just work spend the next couple of minutes working through that
you can work on your own or you can work in pairs
right let's see what we have for good friday
we have end sorrow death shame guilt despair confusion UNK
for easter day we have joy UNK life beginning waiting resurrection hope and wonder
and for the UNK day we have leaving promise command glory peace question waiting expectation
we see there with good friday all the words are they're negative words aren't they
whereas easter day and UNK day the words seem full of hope for the future
new life
okay if we want to finish there and erm have a short break
you can have a drink and erm a UNK
and during the second half jim will lead the second half
and in that we're actually going to look at erm the actual what jesus promised with erm with the coming of the holy spirit and what the holy spirit can actually do for us
it's erm now we're doing this you know so that the holy spirit as you er remember is the third person in the UNK that we call god
erm and we're looking at his role in and i use the word UNK his erm in our lives
and er again just to you know recall some of that to you know the some of the ways that we think about that will be developed in this section
you know some of the ways we think about the holy spirit and some of the ways in which the holy spirit helps us
it's more than help actually it's an UNK
er what we can do with the holy spirit is more than we can do on our own
what we can do with the holy spirit is something that we cannot do on our own
and er you know just briefly that's what this er section is about
er we've got this thing called command and promise haven't we
mhm
right
do you want to give them out then peter while i'm
in order to fill this in this little er section you have to look at the er the chapter that they recommend you er saint UNK gospel chapter twenty eight
would you two share
okay
right
twenty eight right to the very end of UNK gospel
you have to read that in order to er
okay peter if you there and on to the next page right to the end
same for y for you if you if you want to take that for yourself twenty eight on to the next page
twenty eight
erm
have you read it
okay
you'll have noticed that er in reading that it's the part er on er UNK erm jesus of UNK that erm that is actually what we saw on the film is actually what's written here
er and these little exercises er are meant to give you erm they're memory aids really they're not meant to be homework they're simply so as er you know like if you want to remember er a difficult name you can sometimes do a funny thing with it you know to remember it you know
well the these exercises are erm designed so as that you will remember
so you've seen the film you look at the er the scripture and now you should er fill that command and promise in
erm it says er before jesus UNK in to heaven he gave a final command which was
look at UNK gospel
and the command is in four parts erm and you're expected to write in what those four parts are
er so can you remember from what you've just read what the what the command is
anybody er wants to shout that will help all of us
right good
can you read it out the bit that you feel that's er think you're you've got the most difficult one there
i think you've er you know
that's right that's the first part of the command
er now these you know you can actually write that in go on if you want
that that's the top one
erm you know perhaps in years to come you're looking over this work just to check on it you the UNK be a help to you
any offers on the er the last er
three parts of that
last three parts of the erm the command
well we have go to UNK and now we're looking at er erm at er at the other parts of that command
yes go on
right UNK helped us there by they're the last three parts of the command
go therefore make disciples of all nations
you'll find them at the very end of chapter twenty eight
you should find it it's actually written in the last sort of four five lines there
yeah that's it that's the part there
go therefore make disciples of all nations UNK them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit
that's the first part
teach them to observe all the commands i give you
UNK also read the promise that comes in the last of that section
jesus also made a great promise what was it
what was it UNK
and i will be with you always
that's right
and in my translation here it's got and know that i am with you always yes to the end of time
you could always fill this in at a later date there's
aha
no need to hurry it if you're rushing it too much
it's important just to know where it is that's all
erm to save you er searching through your bible i think i'll read this next bit out
much earlier at the last supper jesus had promised that when he returned to god he would ask for a gift to be sent to his friends
in john chapter fourteen it tells us what that gift is
don't worry about finding it
no it's it might be in here
later on you know
i shall ask the father and he will give you another advocate to be with you forever
that spirit of truth whom the world can never receive since it neither sees know or nor knows him
but you know him because he is with you he is in you
i will not leave you UNK
he says
okay so that's that particular part
so just to UNK again we have to try and link UNK day to pentecost
because all of these ha all of these events are happening fairly rapidly
and the whole thing is UNK within fifty days
after the first meeting with jesus in the garden easter sunday there comes a period of forty days
and in that time jesus appears to er people who will be what he calls his witnesses
